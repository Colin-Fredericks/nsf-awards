 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Western Kentucky has been granted an NSF award to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site (REU). The unifying environmental theme of this REU site is focused on land use and land cover and its impacts on water in the Upper Green River Watershed, a karst hydrologic system. The research components are all directly related to water quality, contaminant transport, and near surface atmospheric water cycling. REU students will spend 10 weeks during summer at Western Kentucky University working with a faculty mentor from the Department of Biology, Chemistry, or Geography and Geology.  Students will learn in standard field techniques, collect samples and analyze data in the laboratory.  In addition, they will also analyze existing environmental data sets.  Eight undergraduates and four students from the Kentucky Math and Science Academy will participate in this REU site.  The Academy provides advanced academic opportunities for gifted high school juniors and seniors.  Each student will develop a research project linked to the impacts of land use and land cover in the Upper Green River Basin. The Upper Green River supports a great biodiversity of fish, macroinvertebrates and freshwater mussels, many of which exist only in this part of the watershed.  In addition, there are rare and endangered cave-dwelling invertebrate species that have never been fully identified. The change in Land Use/Land Cover in this sensitive ecosystem further complicates these issues, including hydrologic and atmospheric responses.  \r\n\r\nThe student participants will also be provided opportunities to discuss ethical issues related to collection and use of data, experimental design, professional standards, and the broader impacts that environmental research may have on society.   The broader impacts of this proposal are first addressed by the creative scientific research investigations undertaken by undergraduates with the corresponding promotion of training and learning.  Secondly, the recruitment focus of disadvantaged students from Appalachia clearly broadens the participation of underrepresented groups.",

One Gatton Academy student is at the  University of Louisville and is a Congressional Junior Fellow.  Of the  21 other undergraduate student interns in the program, 14 are currently in graduate school or  have already graduated with a M.S. degree.  Of these 14 students, 7 are  women.   Several students are still undergraduates.  One is currently  in Medical School and one is in Pharmacy School.   One student intern graduated from Elizabethtown Community College,  transferred to Western Kentucky University and subsequently graduated in 2012 with a  degree in Middle School Science Education.  She currently teaches  science in a rural middle school in Kentucky.  One student graduated with a M.S. in Meteorology from Iowa  State University, and is currently at NOAA.  Another student graduated from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology  and is now a professional geologist at the South Dakota Geological  Survey. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cathleen J Webb"
