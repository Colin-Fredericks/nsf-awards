Global minimization models are\r\nnow well understood, but very little is understood in the more\r\nphysically realistic settings of local minimization-based and\r\ndynamic problems.  Specifically, existence is open for both\r\ncohesive and sharp-interface (Griffith) dynamic fracture, and\r\neffective macro-scale models for local minimization-based\r\ndislocation plasticity are unknown.  The investigator seeks to\r\nmake significant progress on these and related problems. \r\n\r\n     The propagation of defects in materials is of obvious\r\nfundamental importance, yet in the most physically realistic\r\nsettings mathematical foundations and analysis are lacking,\r\nleaving engineering models largely ad hoc.  The investigator\r\nworks on developing mathematical support in these areas, leading\r\nto improved models, better understanding of solutions, and\r\nimproved (and justified) algorithms for computing simulations.",
