 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research team will investigate the evolution of energy spectra, time-intensity profiles, and charged particle flows along and across the interplanetary magnetic field in co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs) observed during solar cycles 22 and 23. They will use measurements of energetic particles, magnetic fields, and solar wind plasma obtained by the ACE, Wind, and STEREO spacecraft to study these CIR events. This team will also develop a new theoretical model, based on their existing 'Particle Acceleration and Transport in the Heliosphere' (PATH) numerical code, in order to study the time-dependent acceleration and transport of particles associated with CIRs, as well as to probe the 3D structure of CIRs and the evolution of magnetic connections between an observer at Earth and remote CIR locations beyond Earth orbit. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the properties of solar energetic particle (SEP) events associated with CIRs remains an outstanding problem for the scientific community. This study will yield new information about the 3D structure of CIRs and the configuration of the interplanetary magnetic field, both of which are crucial for the development of future global heliospheric models, which are in turn important for space weather forecasting. \r\n\r\nResearch results will be presented to the broader community at scientific meetings and at smaller workshops where student participation is encouraged. The team will also publish findings via peer-reviewed journals and web-based monthly electronic newsletters. In this project, several graduate and undergraduate students will be supported at the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH) and at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). This project will integrate and synergize existing research programs at UAH, the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in San Antonio, and the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis outcomes report is for the period May 2010 through the no-cost extension ending April 2014. \n\n \n\nThe main goals of our study were to probe the following three fundamental questions:\n\nWhere are the CIR particles seen at 1 AU      accelerated?\nHow do these CIR ions propagate throughout      the inner heliosphere?\nHow does magnetic connectivity to remote      acceleration sites affect CIR-associated particle observations at      Earth?  \n\n\n \n\nThe primary outcomes of the study regarding the three main goals were:\n\nCIR particles at 1 AU are accelerated locally (near 1 AU) for low energies (&lt; 1 MeV/nuc) and at several AU for higher energy particles.  The particles accelerated come from the suprathermal ion pool, that is the energy range above the solar wind, and NOT from the solar wind itself.  Other accelerating events such as Solar Energetic Particle events contribute importantly to this pool.  Surprisingly, the suprathermal ion pool is always present in the interplanetary medium even when there are no obvious accelerating agents responsible.\nLow energy particles seen at 1 AU come from close by, while the higher energy particles come from several AU, and propagate inward.  Large scale magnetic disconnection in the high solar corona due to magnetic reconnection can be detected uniquely in CIRs, proving for the first time the existence of this reconnection process in the corona.  \nCIRs propagate through the inner heliosphere following magnetic field lines tied to the Sun.  These field lines are influenced by the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet, and the intensity of the CIR at 1 AU depends critically on the details of the connection between the CIR and the solar source.  This often leads to markedly different CIR signatures seen on different spacecraft which connect to slightly different latitudes on the Sun.  \n\n\n \n\nMore details on the outcomes of this study were described many talks at scientific meetings, and in 7 journal publications: \n\n \n\n1) We carried out the first systematic evaluation of the changes in Corotating Interaction Region (CIR) energetic particle intensities viewed from multiple spacecraft.
