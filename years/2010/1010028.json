 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ideum, Inc., in collaboration with the Institute for Learning Innovation, will develop, test, and disseminate a free suite of original, multitouch-enabled, open source exhibit software that will transform the ability of science museum professionals to assemble interactive computer-based exhibits for use in museums and on the Web.  The project will develop a library of extensible software modules for all major platforms that exhibit developers can configure in specific ways. These modules (developed using the popular Adobe Flash and Flex authoring tools) will be configured as three flexible templates that have broad application across the ISE field: 1) a current science news aggregator, 2) a timeline-based exhibit, and 3) a collections viewer. The templates will also be available in the form of universal modules that more advanced users can mix and match to build customized exhibits, allowing for modification that will yield further advancements to the software. \r\n\r\nOpen Exhibits will increase the capacity of hundreds of science museum exhibit practitioners to easily create interactive computer-based exhibits, both on site and on the Web.  This project has particular significance for smaller museums with fewer resources for exhibit development. The secondary audience is the large number of museum visitors whose experiences and STEM literacy will be enhanced by the project's exhibits. Rockman et al. will conduct summative evaluation with particular attention to the impact of the deliverables on practitioners and user institutions.",
