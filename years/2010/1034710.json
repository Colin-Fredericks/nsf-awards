 "awd_abstract_narration": "I/UCRC for Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology (MSET) Center \r\n\r\n1034710 New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT); Sirkar \r\n1034720 University of Colorado at Boulder (UC-B); Greenberg \r\n\r\nThe Center for Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology Composites will focus on membrane research, innovation, and educational capabilities that far exceed those of either university working alone. This synergistic combination of skills and expertise provides a a compelling rationale for a new partnership between NJIT (lead institution) and UC-B as the research partner\r\n\r\nThe proposed research plan addresses novel membrane materials (for wider applications, desalination of water), control of pore size distributions to improve selectivity and performance, protein fouling on membranes, particle classification (ie, fractionation), enhancement of shear forces to reduce membrane fouling, and others. Membranes are to separations as catalysts are to chemical reactions. The membranes make separations easier and more economical (in some cases, possible). The collaborators, UC-Boulder and NJIT, have historically produced quality research in separations and membrane technology. The two universities have sufficient resources, infrastructure, and well-qualified investigators. The proposed research projects are innovative, but more important, the projects have potential to evolve and develop significant technologies. The leadership team has substantial experience in running centers. \r\n\r\nThe most significant impact of this center on society may be the stimulation that will result between research, education, and industry. The research proposed by the center has potential to impact major societal issues including energy and fresh water supplies. While it is obvious that university-based teaching/training in research environments is the first priority of the proposed Center activities and goals, the key ingredient to their strong program is that the training is gained through advancement research in the rapidly-evolving cross-disciplinary regime of membrane science, separation processes and engineering design. The PIs plan for a very broad and yet still appropriately targeted dissemination through a variety of mechanisms including the usual publications as well as webinars, review meetings, direct connections to companies and industry communities.",
