 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and the Chemistry Division, Kari B. Green-Church and colleagues David L. Denlinger, Joseph A. Krzycki, and Michael Ibba from Ohio State University and John Tansey from Otterbein College will acquire an ultra-high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer.  The award will enhance research, research training and education at all levels.  The mass spectrometer will support a variety of research projects including: (a) translational analysis of insect proteins during environmental stress and diapause; (b) mapping of the biosynthetic pathway of pyrrolysine and development of amino acid analogs; (c) the impact of MprF activity on lipid remodeling; (d) lipid profiling of apolipoprotein-like particles for studies of intracellular lipid trafficking.\r\n\r\nMass spectrometers (MS) are used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. The time of flight (TOF) mass analyzer has high sensitivity and mass accuracy to assist the analyses and interpretation of the resultant data.  The instrument will be configured and available as a cyberinstrument, meaning that access to and operation of the instrument is open to any academic institution in the Ohio Mass Spectrometry Consortium. The acquisition will provide graduate and undergraduate students training in this important technique at Ohio State University and other institutions in the state.",
