 "awd_abstract_narration": "While it has been shown theoretically that stochastic network\r\noptimization techniques utilizing queue backpressure can result in\r\nhigh performance cross-layer protocols, there has been limited prior\r\nwork on translating them into practice. In this exploratory research\r\nproject, we develop and demonstrate a novel cross-layer backpressure\r\nprotocol stack for wireless sensor networks, building on our\r\nimplementation of the backpressure collection protocol (BCP).  The\r\npossible gains of this highly agile approach to cross-layer wireless\r\nnetworking are substantial and include increased throughput even in\r\nthe presence of mobility, handling of bursty external interference\r\nevents with reduced losses, and reduced protocol implementation\r\ncomplexity. We incorporate techniques for MAC-layer backoff\r\nprioritization, transport layer utility optimization, mechanisms to\r\nhandle various kinds of network dynamics, and interoperability with\r\nasynchronous low power sleep schedules. Protocol implementation code\r\ndeveloped in the project will be released publicly as open-source. It\r\nis expected that the successful completion of this project will\r\nprovide an important proof-of-concept that stochastic optimization\r\ntheory-driven protocols can be successful in practice.",
