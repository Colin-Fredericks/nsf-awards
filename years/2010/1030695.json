The collaboration will enrich education, research and development in pervasive social networking. The Workshop will be collocated with the IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications in Mannheim, Germany on March 29, 2010. The requested funding is intended to support US researcher to attend this workshop. It is expected that the workshop will lead to both short and long term collaborations between US and EU researchers in this important emerging area.",
