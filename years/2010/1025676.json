 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project concerns the escalation of conflict. Small insults can lead to larger insults, escalating back and forth from minor events into major tragedies.  In the nineties, for instance, rivalry between the East-Coast and West-Coast hip hop scenes started with a \"diss track,\" a song that disparaged rappers from the other \"scene,\" and escalated by the end of the decade to several unsolved murders. Child-custody disagreements between divorcing parents often escalate to major legal battles that traumatize the children, deplete the financial resources of the parties, and damage their mental and physical health. Escalation in social exchange is common and central to many interpersonal, intergroup, and international conflicts.  It also presents a significant physical and mental health risk to members of society, not only by the direct acts of aggression and violence between individuals and groups, but also by the physiological distress it creates. This research project has two broad goals: First, the project is dedicated to understanding the psychological causes behind negative escalation, the factors that exacerbate it and the situations that nurture such escalation. Second, the project will use the deeper understanding of the causes of escalation to identify novel ways to prevent and defuse conflict escalation. The project develops a theory of social action that explains why negative exchange escalates. It assumes that actors and reactors perceive the same action systematically differently, and that this difference leads directly to escalation. The theory also suggests novel ways that the vicious cycle of negative escalation could be broken. The researchers will test the theory in eight experiments, each of which should provide different insights about way to defuse escalation.  \r\n\r\nThis research project promises substantial benefits to society.  The quality of social relationships is central to physical and mental health, with escalating conflict serving as a major social stressor. Escalation occurs at all levels of social organization, from individuals to international acts of aggression in reaction to a perceived offense.  The research project is therefore likely to have substantial scientific impact, as well as significant implications for the welfare of individuals and society.",

Negative social actions tend to escalate.&nbsp; Harm done by one person may be reciprocated with greater harm in return, producing an escalation in conflict that can turn initially small insults into major catastrophes. This project investigated systematic reasons for dysfunctional escalation of conflict as well as ways to defuse escalation. A series of experiments used a modified &ldquo;dictator&rdquo; task to study negative escalation. One person received a sum of money and another was allowed to take away as much as he or she wanted. Then the roles were reversed multiple times. Because taking is perceived as a negative social act, one could study whether such taking escalates over time. If people take the same amount that was taken from them, they are not escalating. If they take more than was taken from them, they are escalating the negative exchange.

It evaluated two reasons for this phenomenon: 1. People might react to a negative act strategically, escalating in order to deter future harm. 2. People might react emotionally, and simply attempt to take revenge with no strategic goal. The strategic account assumes that escalation results from reflection and planning, the revenge account assumes that escalation is an automatic reaction. Several studies evaluate these accounts and found no support for the idea that negative escalation results from strategic behavior. When participants were encouraged to reflect, escalation was reduced, suggesting that escalation is a reflexive response that could be reduced with further thinking. In a related experiment, when participants were cognitively busy which did not allow them to be reflective, escalation was exacerbated. Taken together the results support the idea that often people take two eyes for an eye not necessarily because they strategically attempt to deter the other. Instead, they react to the slight of the negative action even stronger, but they could be taught to avoid costly negative escalation by further reflection.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Another series of studies evaluated the positive social acts of giving or sharing.

In one case, the amount of the surplus increased throughout the year with each quarter, in another case it decreased with each quarter. The research team discovered that as the amount of the surplus increases, people give others a bit more in absolute numbers but they give less proportionately.
