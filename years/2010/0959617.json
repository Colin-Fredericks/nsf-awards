Francesconi and colleagues Matthew Devany, Charles M. Drain and Nancy L. Greenbaum from the Department of Chemistry at CUNY Hunter College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) speciation of 99Tc metal oxides and phosphates; 2) porphyrin-based materials; 3) RNA structure-function; 4) polyoxometalates, nanoparticles, materials, sensors and imaging agents; 5) experiments using 13C labeled RNA samples and 31P-99Tc correlation; and 6) studies of speciation of 99Tc and lanthanide metal oxides.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.\r\n",
