 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research and development project leverages curricular module development to design, develop, and test new cyberlearning modules that integrate multiple (circulation, respiration, and digestion) systems of the human body.  The project aims to deepen science content knowledge, science inquiry skills, and model-based reasoning skills for high school biology students. The project will use simulations showing how individual systems function, how they work together, and how the integration of all three creates a dynamic and reactive biological system. It is expected that the presentation of this dynamic system will result in a deeper understanding of the materials and enhanced performance on student achievement measures. \r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to:\r\n1. Develop an integrated simulation of the human digestive, circulatory and respiratory systems that allows students to develop productive inquiry strategies.\r\n2. Embed the simulation in online instructional modules that provide immediate, individualized coaching as students are challenged with a series of investigative tasks.\r\n3. Provide reports of students' performances during the activities to students and teachers.\r\n4. Develop follow-up online collaborative investigations that provide differentiated instruction to strengthen students' understanding and support transfer and opportunities to engage in scientific discourse.\r\n5. Develop one benchmark assessment that measures outcomes across all three body systems and reports to students and teachers.\r\n6. Develop and deploy professional development to support teachers as they use these materials.\r\n7. Provide evidence of the technical quality, feasibility, and usability of the new materials.\r\n8. Study the influence of these materials on complex science and inquiry learning of the integration of the three human body systems modeled.\r\n\r\nA small scale randomized, controlled trial will be performed at the end of the project. The project is grounded in model-based learning, cognitive learning research, and an evidence-centered design. Universal Design for Learning is factored into all simulation designs. Questions asked during the evaluation include: Is the project progressing as planned? Are the modules useable? Are the users satisfied? Are the modules used as intended in a typical high school setting? Does this improve teaching and learning of key content? The primary investigator is WestEd; the American Association for the Advancement of Science is a partner and three teachers from nearby schools serve as co-developers. The project has an external evaluator as well as a strong advisory board. \r\n\r\nThe project will create multi-leveled instructional cyber-modules. These modules will contain embedded assessments that provide students and teachers immediate and individualized coaching. Professional development will also provide teachers tools and guidance to increase their learning of human body systems. Dissemination strategies include featuring the modules on WestEd's award-winning website as well as submission of academic papers to journals and national conferences targeted at science educators and education researchers. Because these modules supplement classroom curricula and use online technology, they could potentially be used to teach millions of high school biology students.",

The HBS suite builds on prior work establishing the benefits of using simulation-based science assessments that support the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). These modules provide students an opportunity to access information about these systems using multiple forms of representation that have been shown to allow students to better demonstrate their understanding about scientific phenomena.

These modules are intended as formative assessments and provide feedback and coaching tailored to students&rsquo; errors. HBS instructional modules provide progress reports for students and teachers. The benchmark assessment provides a summative report consistent with the NGSS targets.

The study involved predominately high school biology students from across the country. Although the modules were intended to help students integrate the curriculum from units taught throughout the year, the content of the suite did not align easily with traditional high school biology curricula. Different curricula cover the content at different times of the year and at diverse time intervals, making the traditional curriculum fragmented. It is therefore not surprising that many of the teachers in the study found it difficult to integrate the content of the modules into their instruction. Teachers also reported that the HBS suite presented science content at a level that students in traditional biology classes found somewhat difficult. Consequently it took them longer than teachers expected to complete the modules. Coupled with the extended time was the competition for computer resources, especially as state testing often hits in the spring. While HBS modules were tested in introductory high school biology classrooms, they could perhaps be used more effectively for advanced courses as an introduction to or review of human body systems&nbsp; and the nature of complex systems.</p>\n<p>Based on interviews, teachers found the HBS platform easy to set up and navigate, and students found it easy to use. The professional development prepared teachers to use the technology in their classrooms. Most students related well to the technology. Teachers reported using HBS in ways that they believed strengthened their instruction. They indicated that the instructional reports helped them assess student understanding and allowed them to organize the introduction and review of content strategically.</p>\n<p>One teacher wrote, &ldquo;I think that the modules are an excellent way of bringing contextual cohesion to some of the concepts that I teach in my biology class.
