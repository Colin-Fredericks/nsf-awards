 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nThe focus of this NSF-CAREER project is the regulation of gene expression in maize, an agriculturally important crop plant in the United States.  Gene expression is a regulated process that determines which biochemical components are present and active at any particular time in a living cell.  Recently, biological science has been dramatically advanced by the sequencing of the genomes of a wide range of organisms, including maize.  Although the gene sequences are essential to understanding the traits, growth, and development of an organism, they represent only one type of heritable information that influences the regulation of gene expression.  The goal of this project is to determine how gene expression is regulated by epigenetic factors; that is, factors other than the actual sequence of genes.  Examples are the addition of methyl groups to the DNA in or near particular genes and the association of regulatory regions of DNA with specific proteins, either of which can be heritable information and can influence which genes are expressed.  This research will use genetic and genomic techniques to identify specific factors required for epigenetic gene regulation of introduced and naturally occurring genes in maize and will explore interspecies variation in epigenetic gene regulation.  Currently, relatively little is known about the importance of epigenetic regulation to phenotypes and adaptation or about how such information is passed from one generation to the next, so the project will also address these important questions.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe principal investigator strives to improve scientific literacy beginning at the precollege level and to inspire and advance young scientists by providing them with positive research experiences through their direct involvement with intellectually stimulating research projects. Maize provides an excellent system through which to teach and learn genetics, presenting many opportunities to observe examples of important genetic concepts.  Every experiment in this project will be conducted by postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate trainees.  Emphasis will be placed on excellence in preparation for scientific careers and in mentoring young scientists for success. Additionally, the project will provide information about the genetic regulation of transgenes in genetically modified organisms and will improve the understanding of how gene expression is regulated in an agronomically important crop plant.  In the future, this basic knowledge can be applied to trait and yield improvements in maize.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCorn is one of the most economically and nutritionally important crops in the United States, and is a product of Zea mays, or maize.  The goal of this project was to elucidate mechanisms that regulate the expression of genes in this important plant, and to identify proteins that contribute to these mechanisms.  As a CAREER project, this funding was also intended to develop undergraduate educational opportunities that were integrated with the research goals of the project.  The project specifically focused on a type of gene regulation called epigenetic regulation, which is dependent on special types of reversible modifications to chromosomes, including DNA methylation and addition of chemical groups to DNA-associated proteins.\n\nUsing a genetic approach, mutants were identified and characterized that were defective in this type of gene regulation.  Specific characteristics of these mutants were compared with other maize mutants.  Comparisons were also made with other plants where these mechanisms have been studied.  The results of this work indicated that crop plants like maize have complex and overlapping regulatory pathways, and multiple types of regulation seem to be occurring at individual genes.  It was also observed that the genes that are regulated by these mechanisms are very likely to support growth, development, adaptation and stress responses.  This means that these findings are highly relevant to agriculture and crop productivity in the United States. This award also supported educational opportunities and scientific training for many undegraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, including traditionally underrepresented minorities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen M Mcginnis"
