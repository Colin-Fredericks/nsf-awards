 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Nanotechnology in Society at Arizona State University (CNS-ASU) is a Nano-scale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC) funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF).  It implements an agenda of \"real-time technology assessment\" (RTTA) and clusters of thematic research in pursuit of a strategic vision of the \"anticipatory governance\" of nanotechnologies. The RTTA agenda comprises research programs in: 1) research and innovation systems assessment, which aims to map nano-scale science and engineering research activities using bibliometrics and patent analysis; 2) public opinion and values, which aims to understand the dynamics of public and expert opinion regarding emerging nanotechnologies; 3) anticipation and deliberation, which aims at deploying novel demonstrations of scenario development and public engagement activities to anticipate societal dimensions of emerging nanotechnologies; and 4) reflexivity and integration, which aims to bolster the ability of nano-scale science and engineering researchers to understand their own roles in responsible innovation through integrating social science and humanities with natural science and engineering.  CNS-ASU's two clusters of thematic research are: equity, equality and responsibility; and (beginning in Oct 2010) urban design, materials, and the built environment (\"nano and the city\").  To achieve its strategic vision, CNS-ASU unifies these research programs not only across several universities but also across three critical, component activities: foresight (of plausible future scenarios), integration (of social science and humanities research with nano-scale science and engineering), and engagement (of publics in deliberations). CNS-ASU also performs educational and training activities as well as public outreach and informal science education.",
