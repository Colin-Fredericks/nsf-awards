 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThis multidisciplinary symposium aims to bring together researchers working on quantifying nanoscale carrier transport processes in excitonic solar cells. Excitonic solar cells, including all-organic and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), offer strong potential for inexpensive and large-area solar energy conversion.  Unlike traditional inorganic semiconductor solar cells, where all the charge generation and collection processes are well understood, these excitonic solar cells contain extremely disordered structures with complex interfaces which results in large variations in nanoscale electronic properties and has a strong influence on carrier generation, transport, dissociation and collection. Rapid progress in this multidisciplinary area requires strong synergetic efforts among researchers from diverse backgrounds. Such effort can lead to novel methods for development of new materials with improved photon harvesting and interfacial treatments for improved carrier transport, process optimization to yield ordered nanoscale morphologies with well-defined electronic structures. The symposium plans to support the participation of underrepresented groups, including Hispanics, Native Americans, and women, through appropriate travel and registration support. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nEfficient and low-cost conversion of solar energy is important for environment protection and energy security of the nation. Excitonic solar cells offer strong potential for inexpensive and large-area solar energy conversion. These excitonic solar cells possess complex internal structure, which results in poor energy conversion efficiency. Rapid progress in this multidisciplinary area requires strong synergetic efforts among researchers from diverse backgrounds. This symposium aims to bring together scientists working on materials science, nanoscience, chemistry and theory to develop synergistic efforts to improve the efficiency of excitonic solar cells.",

Narayan, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre\nGarry Rumbles, National Renewable Energy Laboratory\n\n\nOrganic solar cells (OSC) have attracted worldwide attention from researchers due to their potential to replace traditional Si-based solar cells.  Their low-cost and ability to be integrated with practically any surface (rooftops of bus stations to backpacks and umbrellas) makes OSCs an important technological path.  Current SOC technologies produce cells with about 6-8% efficiency while commercialization of these technologies requires 10-13% efficiency.  This symposium has brought together researchers developing novel materials, device technologies and approaches to study nanoscale charge transport processes that address current challenges to reach 10-13% efficiency.  Two joint sessions with Symposium HH and II, namely, Molecular Engineering of OPV Materials and Advancing OPV, highlighted key recent developments in OPV.\n\nThe symposium started with a tutorial session on Quantifying Nanoscale Charge Transport in Excitonic Solar Cells.  Prof. Venkat Bommisetty, South Dakota State University, explained the importance of developing quantitative correlation between charge transport across nanoscale donor-acceptor morphologies and macroscale efficiency of the solar cell.  He introduced scanning probe microscopy and the use of scanning probe based advanced characterization methods to probe these nanoscale processes.  Prof. K.S. Narayan, JNCAR India, introduced concepts of OSCs; Prof. Andrey Kadashchuk, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, explained the effect of defects and disorder on charge transport and performance of OSCs.  Prof. M.F. Baroughi, South Dakota State University, explained device concepts of OSCs and generalized charge transport  models.\n\nProf. Alan J.
