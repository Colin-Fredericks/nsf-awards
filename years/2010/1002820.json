 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the creative practices of artists and computer scientists/engineers as they work independently to develop novel computing technologies. The goals are to use knowledge gained through this study to both inform computing research as well as to create and evaluate an educational framework for fostering innovation within computing, information science, and engineering (CISE) and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. At Georgia Institute of Technology, artists are contributing to the future of computing through the doctoral program in Digital Media. Some of these artists are developing novel computing technologies that parallel work being done in computer science and engineering labs at Georgia Tech. For example, a computer scientist who has developed a wearable sensor network for Navy soldiers is adapting his technology into a SIDS monitoring garment for infants. Separately, an artist is adapting technology she has used in an interactive sculpture to an infant swaddler for SIDS prevention. These common technologies and goals place their work in dialog, allowing direct comparison of creative work practices and outcomes. This project will study pairs of artists and computer scientists/engineers working independently on parallel computing projects to find similarities and differences in their creative work.\r\n\r\nThis study will pose questions such as ?What common ground may be found between an artist?s and a computer scientist?s prototyping methods?? and ?How do artists and computer scientists incorporate or defy disciplinary training in their approach to innovation?? The study will establish a methodology and framework for understanding the mindsets and work approaches of creative practice in computing, engineering, and art and design. The knowledge resulting from this study will help researchers and educators in computer science, digital media, engineering, and the arts orchestrate creative projects in their own disciplines while incorporating knowledge and practices from other disciplines. In the second year, the study researchers will implement a course at Georgia Institute of Technology?s undergraduate Computational Media program that embodies knowledge gained about creativity across the disciplinary boundaries of art and computer science. This work in curriculum design will contribute in tangible ways to the NSF STEM initiative through publication of both the curriculum and classroom results.",
