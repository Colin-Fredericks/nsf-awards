 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the development of an interdisciplinary graduate training program in engineering for cultural heritage diagnostics. Forensic engineering, the investigation of failures and failure mechanisms, is uniquely suited yet rarely used to assess the damage to artifacts of cultural heritage, including ancient monuments, historic buildings and paintings, from the ravages of time, pollution, natural disasters and decay.\r\n\r\nThis IGERT, based at the University of California at San Diego, trains graduate students to develop diagnostic methodologies and analytical models that will be deployed and tested on a) Renaissance art works and historic structures in Florence, Italy, and b) archaeological sites and artifacts in Jordan and Israel. Trainees learn and develop new state-of-the-art methods for the long-term \"health monitoring\" of cultural artifacts, including non-destructive testing, cyberinfrastructure and engineering analysis. Using a team-based approach, trainees will create an integrated platform for diagnostic and predictive modeling, including multispectral imaging, simulation, data synthesis and visual analytics. Students are advised by three co-mentors, one from the student's primary discipline and two from other disciplines. Substantial field research abroad will prepare them for careers in international science and engineering, and the tools and methodologies developed for cultural heritage can be applied more broadly to the analysis of degraded or obsolete infrastructure, such as public buildings, roads and bridges, as well as almost any other engineered component or system. \r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",

Cultural heritage challenges and problems often require different kinds of solutions from different fields of study. In the process of collaboratively addressing specific problems, students advance the state of the art as well as their own personal development. IGERT-TEECH serves to engage, enable, and empower students through experience-based learning, thereby creating resilient, resourceful, and responsive science and engineering professionals. Experienced-based learning, in which the research, education and training become a means by which life skills are acquired, has a lasting and indelible impact on students, who will reflect on their experience with a community of individuals who guided their growth from consumers to producers of knowledge. This ecosystem is primed for innovation and the development of tomorrow's talent pool and workforce. It trains engineers from across the academic career spectrum, from high-school students, undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, as well as research scientists and junior faculty at the beginning of their careers. It also provides an incubator for those seeking to transition to and succeed in the private sector. IGERT-TEECH seeks to break through barriers created by traditional research silos, linking collaborative and disruptive research across domains. Its silo buster mentality is aimed at creating a new methodology for collaborative research and training, joining human imagination, intuition and creativity (great minds) with big data to forge a new breed of engineers capable of tackling tomorrow's grand challenges in collaborative, interdisciplinary teams. The goal is to challenge traditional research models, theories and techniques by pushing trainees out of traditional silos through work at the interface of multiple domains, advised by mentors from multiple disciplines, to create a fresh and transformative new approach. All trainees will have triple-advisors representing multiple engineering and science domains. We have shown that this ambitious advising approach is both viable and highly transformative to overall trainee and team development, advancing and empowering the collaborative research and training approach. Each trainee will be assigned an international academic liaison, further increasing the impact of the planned international field research and education experience, grooming the student trainees' ability to communicate effectively and efficiently across domain boundaries and cultures alike.
