This coupling is not fully understood, in\r\npart because the basic mechanical response of interacting\r\ngraphene sheets is not yet adequately described.  Important for\r\npredicting this response are the nonlocal van der Waals forces\r\nbetween layers of graphene and between graphene and a supporting\r\nsubstrate.  The aim of the project is to develop and investigate\r\ncontinuum models of graphene structures that incorporate van der\r\nWaals forces in a rigorous way, accounting for long-range\r\nordering of atoms.  Derived via a multiscale analysis, the\r\ncontinuum models are formulated within nonlinear rod and shell\r\ntheories.  Equilibrium configurations of various graphene\r\nstructures -- involving multiple layers and different substrates\r\n-- under external loads are analyzed using the tools of\r\nbifurcation theory.  Also, the thermal properties of nanotube\r\ncomposites are investigated within the framework of a network\r\nmodel taking into account the influence of van der Waals forces. \r\n\r\n     Interest in macromolecules composed of carbon atoms has\r\nstimulated a great deal of recent research in materials science\r\nand physics.  Much of this work has focused on carbon nanotubes\r\nand, more recently, on the basic structural element of a nanotube\r\n-- graphene.  Graphene is a single-atom-thick sheet of bonded\r\ncarbon atoms.  Despite many decades of effort, only within the\r\nlast six years have scientists discovered methods for producing\r\nisolated individual graphene sheets.  This discovery has\r\nstimulated a flurry of experimental and theoretical work on the\r\nexceptional mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties of\r\ngraphene.  Exploiting these properties could lead to significant\r\nadvances in many technologies and yield, for example, more\r\nefficient solar cells, faster microprocessors, or lighter,\r\nstronger composite materials.  The principal goal of this project\r\nis to employ mathematical modeling to gain a better fundamental\r\nunderstanding of how atomic-scale forces between layers of a\r\ncarbon nanostructure influence its mechanical and thermal\r\ncharacteristics.  The project investigators are developing and\r\nanalyzing comprehensive multiscale models of interacting graphene\r\nlayers by utilizing ideas at the forefront of existing theories\r\nas well as by introducing new mathematical tools.",
