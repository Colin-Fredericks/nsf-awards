 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and the Chemistry Division, Bruce Bowler and colleagues Charles Thompson, Michele McGuirl, Klara Briknarova and Stephen Sprang from University of Montana will acquire a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.  The acquisition is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study that will impact proteomics research on: synaptic vesicles, cellular targets of organophosphate insecticides, the replication/transcription complex of arenaviruses, and lipidated virulence factors.  It will be used for protein biochemistry research investigating: fundamental aspects of protein dynamics related to G-protein activation, protein aggregation specific to the pathology of amyloids/prion proteins, the physiologically-important aggregation of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin, the catalytic mechanisms of enzymes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis, and engineered thermophilic enzymes for use in biofuel production.  It will also be used to characterize new chemically-modified nanoparticles for metal-sensing applications, and polyketide antibiotics.\r\n\r\nMass spectrometers (MS) are used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer.  Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) is a technique for preparing the sample to be ionized by a laser before injection into the mass spectrometer.  The time of flight (TOF) mass analyzer has high sensitivity and mass accuracy to assist the analyses and interpretation of the resultant data.  This open access instrument will be available for training students in several departments in the use of this analytical tool. It will be used by undergraduate students in research and in laboratory instruction courses and in outreach to Native American students in tribal colleges and in high schools on or near reservations in Montana.",
