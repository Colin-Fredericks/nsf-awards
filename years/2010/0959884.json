The capabilities of certain kinds of computer processors, called Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) have been expanding rapidly due to a large commercial market.  They are now faster, and cheaper, than conventional Central Processing Units (CPUs) at the heart of most computers.  Dr. Stephen McMillan and his colleagues at Drexel University are proposing to use these fast, efficient, and affordable CPUs to speed up the very complicated and lengthy computations needed in to model the behavior of large collections of stars or molecules.  NSF's Major Research Instrumentation program is funding Dr. McMillan's work through its Division of Astronomical Sciences. \r\n",
