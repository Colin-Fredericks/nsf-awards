The proposed workshop will be a novel opportunity to expose researchers and clinicians, including junior colleagues, to diverse, but compatible expertise, along the lines of the Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group (IMAG) aim and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap, to design a common plan of action to develop state-of-the-art 3D multi-scale models of bone. The proposed three-day workshop format will allow experts from different fields to teach each other the latest developments concerning bone modeling and to design collaborative plans to solve challenging problems. Each day will begin with presentation of clinical problems and relevant technologies by systems biologists, mathematicians, and engineers. During the first two afternoons of the workshop, round-tables will address day-specific clinical problems, aiming to design a plan to obtain necessary additional experimental data and to adapt existing mathematical and engineering tools for preparation of the appropriate multi-scale model. The last afternoon of the workshop will be dedicated to reviewing the research planning and collaborations to make sure that each person knows his/her particular ongoing role and contribution. As the workshop closes, each participant will appreciate his/her role in advancing the 3D multi-scale modeling of the bone tissue for each of the clinical problems examined. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  The proposed workshop will (1) establish the bases for critical new networks and partnerships across disciplines, institutions, and seniority, (2) create opportunities for further advancement of women and minorities through encouragement to participate in the workshop, (3) provide training for junior and senior researchers in complementary disciplines, (4) improve treatment and public health management of bone related conditions; and (5) potentially provide insights for the formulation of new materials based on deeper understanding of bone as a natural composite-hybrid material. \r\n",
