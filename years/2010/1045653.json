 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the recent Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the behavior  of oil plumes in the natural environment has come become a central question.   Experiments performed in the University of North Carolina (UNC) Fluids Laboratory have  shown that buoyant plumes can be trapped underwater at regions of strong density  stratification. This project will explore the mechanisms leading to underwater trapping  of multi-phase plumes like those forming in the ongoing Gulf spill.  Specifically, the  project will focus on fluid dynamics experiments in the density-stratified flow  facility in the UNC Fluids Lab to better quantify the combined roles of turbulent mixing,  strong ambient stratifications, plume buoyancy, and use of surfactants (dispersants) in  creating under water trapped plumes.  Theoretical closure models will be developed to interpret  the experiments and guide field studies. Further research will include direct numerical simulations  to explore plume behavior under the effects of high temperature, high pressure, internal waves,  and shear associated with this current spill.  The intellectual merit of this theoretical and  experimental research includes developing a benchmarked model for actual oil plume distribution,  residence time, and surface versus sub-surface oil fractions.  Broader impacts of the research  will involve disseminating results with other groups directly working on the Gulf Oil Spill, including  those collecting data on the subsurface plume distribution.  Additionally, the PIs will make results  available to the petroleum industry and regulatory agencies such as EPA to assist in the  understanding of current and future spills.  The research project will also involve the education of  two undergraduate researchers and create new outreach opportunities for high school students to  participate in the UNC Fluids Lab.",
