The research mission of the Center is to perform leading-edge research that is industry driven to produce technologically small satellites and components, which will be on-orbit validated and demonstrated.\r\n\r\nUCF plans to join the existing Advanced Small Satellite Technologies Research and Education Center (ASTREC). The capabilities of UCF will provide essential help to the ASTREC in terms of system engineering, ground station support, guidance, navigation, control algorithms, simulation and visualization. The collaboration between UCF and ASTREC will help advance the state-of-the-art techniques in small satellites as well as enhance the space related academic curriculum using realistic satellite projects.  The research interests and experience of the UCF team both augment and complement very well the research activities and competencies already represented at the center.\r\n\r\nSuccessful participation of the UCF team in ASTREC will greatly increase the competition of the Florida space research capability, help in training a highly capable workforce, and attract more high value research and development. The proposed research at UCF will offer a wide spectrum of research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, in particular from women and minority students. The PIs also plan to work closely with the Office of Diversity Initiatives (ODI) and the Society of Women Engineering (SWE) to encourage minority and women students.  The research and education activities that are promoted in this proposal would greatly help bring this about.",
