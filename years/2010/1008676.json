 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Materials World Network (MWN) award supports US-Russian collaborative research to study  the formation of nanostructures at surfaces of materials irradiated by a femtosecond laser pulse. The major goal is to provide an atomic-scale understanding of fundamental mechanisms of materials response that can be used to further advance technological applications. The US team at the University of South Florida will develop theory, and perform modeling of the initial stage of absorption of a femtosecond laser pulse, followed by the isochorical compression of the material, propagation of the compression and rarefaction waves, fast non-equilibrium melting of overheated crystal, and slow resolidification of the melt. The theory/modeling will also focus on the fundamental mechanisms and kinetics of bubble nucleation in stretched hot melt, as well as cavitation, ablation, and spallation of the target material. The team at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow and Chernogolovka will perform experimental investigations of response to a femtosecond laser pulse, and formation of nanostructures at the surfaces of several representative classes of materials, and will calculate the optical characteristics of resultant surface nanostructures. A broader impact will be achieved by developing predictive and experimentally validated multi-physics model of laser-induced modification of surface morphology. Reciprocal exchange visits will provide students with a unique opportunity to gain professional experience beyond one nation's borders.",
