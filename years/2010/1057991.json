The goals of workshop are to: (1) educate PIs about the NSF proposal submission, review, award and oversight processes; (2) provide an environment for researchers within the field of ceramics to collaborate and share information about their research projects; (3) improve communication about research accomplishments; and (3) engage PIs in discussions about the roles and responsibilities of PIs, professional societies and funding agencies. As well, a website will be developed that will better showcase the accomplishments of the NSF-funded researchers and educators in ceramics. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This two-day workshop will take place in early September 2010 at NSF Headquarters.  Topics that will be covered include: the NSF review process; the solicitation Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI); NSF project accomplishments and reporting requirements; Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) highlights and press releases; and the roles and responsibilities of PIs, professional societies and NSF.  At the end of the workshop, a discussion and survey will be conducted with the participants to inform future PI meetings.  The resulting website will link together researchers, abstracts of their NSF-funded projects, publications, press releases and other highlights.",
