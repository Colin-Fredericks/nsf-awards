 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large relatively high-elevation surfaces with low relief are common on\r\nthe continents. Such uplifts have a significant impact on the geological \r\nrecord by influencing drainage networks and sediment supply, on climate by modifying\r\natmospheric circulation, and on biogeography and the biota. Work in geodynamics has\r\nshown that such uplifts amount to a telling signature of mantle dynamics. Thus, they\r\nprovide a means to discriminate among hypotheses about how the continental lithosphere\r\nand the deeper mantle interact through processes that result in uplift and mass transfer in\r\ncontinental interiors. The Hangay Dome in central Mongolia provides an excellent and\r\naccessible laboratory to investigate these processes and determine the degree to which\r\nmantle upwelling, mafic underplating, lithospheric foundering or plume activity have\r\nbeen important agents in its uplift. This five-year project proposes to use the Hangay\r\nDome as such a laboratory to coordinate studies of both the structure and state of the\r\nlithosphere and the sublithospheric mantle as well as the history of surface uplift and\r\nlandscape evolution. The project will involve observations and measurements made using\r\nbroadband seismology, basalt and xenolith petrology and geochemistry, 40Ar/39Ar\r\ngeochronology, stable-isotope and vesicular-basalt paleoaltimetry, geomorphology and\r\n10Be geochronology, molecular genetics of divergent fish populations, and U-Th/He and\r\n4He/3He thermochronology.  The Hangay Dome?s widespread exposures of basaltic lavas,\r\nwhich were erupted over the past 30 Ma across a broad range of elevations, will be key to\r\nthe integration of all these data.  Dating of the basalts will enable linkage of petrologic data\r\nbearing on basalt genesis and the nature of the Hangay-Dome mantle with studies that\r\nuse the lavas as time markers for documenting landscape evolution and the history of\r\nsurface uplift.",
