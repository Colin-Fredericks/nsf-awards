  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSince the discovery of penicillin, antibiotic drugs have saved countless lives.  Emergence of bacteria which are resistant to traditional antibiotics poses a threat to society, especially because the pace of new antibiotics drug approvals has been declining. In nature, part of our innate immune system involves the production of chain-like molecules, called peptides, which aid in warding off bacterial infection.  While these \"host defense peptides\" (HDPs) are highly promising as new antibiotic drugs, the major disadvantages are very high manufacturing cost and the tendency of peptides to degrade in the body (they are easily broken down by enzymes).  Hence, it would be desirable to make materials which effectively mimic the bacterial killing exerted by HDPs, but at a lower cost and with greater stability. \n\nPolymers are relatively large molecules made by linking small molecules together in a chain reaction.  Because polymers are not degraded by enzymes, and are much less costly to prepare, there is significant interest in making HDP-mimetic polymers. Researchers have made polymers with key functional groups which reflect the properties of HDPs, and the polymers indeed showed the ability to kill bacteria.  Polymers differ from peptides, however, in many ways.  For example, the polymers typically have heterogeneous size (broad distribution of molecule chain lengths) whereas as peptides are uniformly sized chain molecules.  Recently, more sophisticated techniques to prepare polymers in a controlled fashion, thereby obtaining relatively uniform chain lengths in a given sample population, have been developed.\n\nI am pursuing a PhD at the University of Michigan under the direction of Professor Kenichi Kuroda, a leader in the field of antimicrobial materials.  For this summer\u00c6s EAPSI fellowship, we teamed up with Professors Masami Kamigaito and Kotaro Satoh of Nagoya  University, who are world renowned scientists in the field of controlled polymerization.  Together, we made polymers by the specialized techniques established by Kamigaito and co-workers for application as antimicrobials.  By combining our expertise on antibacterial agents with our Japanese colleagues\u00c6 highly refined skills in polymer synthesis, we were able to obtain well-defined polymer mimics of HDPs this summer.  Although the EAPSI fellowship has been concluded, we continue to work closely on this ongoing project with the goal of developing the most effective and safest polymers for this urgently needed application.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2010\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edmund F Palermo"
