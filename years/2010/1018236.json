 "awd_abstract_narration": "While the continued scaling of transistor dimensions enables the integration of an increasing number of processing cores on a single chip, the performance of future multicore processors will be limited by power dissipation and peak temperature constraints.  High-performance computing systems will be achievable only through energy-efficient design and energy-aware programming methods. Each core will require dedicated active power and frequency management to make sure that at any given instant it does not waste any energy by operating at a speed higher than what is required by the given task that is executing.  Such management requires the introduction of novel on-chip voltage regulation modules, real-time monitoring of the current usage for each voltage domain, as well as detailed awareness of the extent of parallelism achievable for each running application.   \r\n\r\nThe PIs will investigate the design and fabrication of a scalable on-chip infrastructure for message-passing multicore processors that integrates support for efficient inter-core communication with programmable fine-grain control mechanisms to regulate independently the processing speed and power dissipation of each core.  The proposed infrastructure will consist of a heterogeneous network-on-chip (NoC), a set of voltage and frequency control modules that are distributed on the chip, each next to the controlled core, and a new application programming interface (API).  The NoC will be dynamically configured to sustain multiple traffic classes with different quality-of-service requirements.  The fine-grained power management will rely on high-Q on-chip magnetic energy storage through the use of magnetic materials in a CMOS post-process fabrication step combined with high-efficiency Buck converters based on pulse-width modulation with hysteric control for fast response times. The API will expose both the inter-core message-passing communication and the voltage/frequency control of each core to the application software programmers.  \r\n\r\nThis proposal will allow the PIs to train graduate and undergraduate students in integrated circuit design employing a leading edge CMOS technology and exploiting new magnetic materials as well as in hardware/software co-design of on-chip infrastructures for dynamic power management.  Ongoing industrial interactions with leading information-technology and semiconductor companies promise continual relevance of the project and avenues for dissemination.",
