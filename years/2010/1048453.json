 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Dr. Robert D. Drennan, Mr. C. Adam Berrey will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct a regional-scale survey of prehistoric human settlement in the R\u00edo Tonos\u00ed Valley of Central Pacific Panama. The central objective of this research is to understand the forces that led to the growth of large scale social formations within this region, and the activities and relationships around which they were organized. At the time of Spanish contact such  'supra-local'  social formations in Central Panama were organized around highly unequal social relationships. However, archaeological research suggests there was considerable variability in how these social formations were organized across space and time. Social hierarchies were founded in different spheres of activity, and some social formations were organized along much less hierarchical lines. This variation can be seen clearly the world over, but for it to manifest at a smaller scale -- among the societies of a single small area -- provides a particularly intriguing opportunity to study the forces that produced it. To examine this question Mr. Berrey will conduct a survey of the Rio Tonosi Valley and record the presence and distribution of both structures, ceramics and other surface material.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the very hierarchical forms of organization that developed in most of Central Panama, supra-local social formations in the R\u00edo Tonos\u00ed valley seem to have been much less hierarchical. The research will determine whether in fact this was the case. If it was, the research will attempt to establish whether R\u00edo Tonos\u00ed social formations were in other ways \"less developed\" than those of nearby regions.  If R\u00edo Tonos\u00ed social organization turns out to be more hierarchical than it now appears, then the proposed research will provide information about ways in which the nature of that hierarchy may have differed from those of other regions.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide opportunities for field training for students from several universities, and foster international scholarly collaboration. Public understanding of science and appreciation of the archaeological record will be emphasized through outreach at local schools, and preliminary results will be presented to the local public in Tonos\u00ed, as well as other venues in Panama.",

Strongly developed social hierarchies were often the backbone of this organization, but in some instances social hierarchy was far less important. In strongly hierarchical polities the roles of economic control, craft specialization, ritual, and warfare were highly variable. Under the supervision of Dr. Robert D. Drennan, doctoral candidate Charles Adam Berrey conducted a regional-scale, archaeological survey of the Rio Tonosi valley in Central Panama. Archaeological research in nearby regions of Central Panama (such as the Rio Grande and Rio Parita valleys) reveals strong social hierarchy, considerable specialization, and much prehistoric warfare. Burial evidence collected by previous research in the Rio Tonosi valley, however, suggested much more egalitarian social organization during the Late Ceramic period (AD 700-1522). This research sought to understand what might have led Rio Tonosi societies along such a different developmental trajectory.</p>\n<p>Mr. Berrey focused on the archaeological site of Guaniquito Abajo, known from previous research as an important Late Ceramic period settlement. He carried out a systematic archaeological survey of the landscape surrounding Guaniquito Abajo, covering an area of 50 sq km. As of the date of this report, the NSF-funded fieldwork and laboratory analysis of materials are complete, and data analysis is in progress. From AD 250 to 550 social organization in the Rio Tonosi valley was very similar to that of other regions, such as the Rio Parita valley. In both regions settlement is characterized by widely scattered small hamlets and farmsteads, with very little evidence of social hierarchy or specialized production. Between AD 550 and 900, though, the trajectories of these two regions began to diverge, resulting in strong social hierarchy in the Rio Parita valley contrasting with much more egalitarian social relationships in the Rio Tonosi valley in the Late Ceramic Period. The emergence of these different social structures may have its roots in patterns of demographic growth and community organization. Population growth at this time was slow in the Rio Parita valley, but much more rapid in the Rio Tonosi valley. Higher population densities in the Rio Tonosi valley created pressure for agricultural intensification which, in turn, encouraged farming families to live in dispersed hamlets and farmsteads near the land that they cultivated. This precluded the formation of the nucleated villages that emerged in the Rio Parita valley--villages where intensive interaction is easier and specialized production and exchange are facilitated.
