 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research is collaborating with the GLOBE program, the University of Colorado, New York University, the Texas Regional Collaboratives and several other partners to design, implement, and evaluate an Earth System Science learning experience for teachers and students. The goals of the From Learning to Research project are to prepare 80 teachers to engage middle and high school students in Earth System Science research on local, regional, and national scales, expose teachers and students to Earth Science careers, and allow students to interact with scientists from around the world. \r\n\r\nThe project is providing onsite and virtual professional development activities for teachers and the GLOBE Student Research Collaboratory (GSRC) is supporting teacher and student learning about climate science and research. Teachers and students are learning about climate science and develop systems thinking, problem-solving, data analysis, communication, and collaboration skills. The project is (1) producing research findings on teacher and student use of GIS visualization tools, modeling programs, and social collaboration technologies; (2) implementing and evaluating GSRC's impact on motivating and preparing middle and high school students for careers in STEM; and (3) providing teachers with resources and strategies for ensuring that their students know about and prepared for STEM careers in earth science-related careers.\r\n",
