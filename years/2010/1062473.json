 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) was established within the Census of Marine Life program (CoML), supported by a host of organizations including NSF, to house and make available data on all marine species with open-access through the World Wide Web. The OBIS server is located at Rutgers University. OBIS has become an invaluable resource for marine research with contributing members and data users world-wide. It is a world-wide database reflecting the diversity of ocean life, its distribution and abundance and it is an ocean database that will be instrumental in addressing global change issues. \r\n\r\nOBIS is intended to transition to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) and its activity on International Ocean Data Exchange (IODE). This was formalized with the IOC-UNESCO as of 2010 but will take some time to implement. Requests have been made for IOC member states to contribute to support of OBIS starting in 2011; however, immediate support is needed for the transition to secure the future of OBIS. This RAPID award is the appropriate mechanism to quickly provide support for an uninterrupted transition to keep the system viable and available during the process, and to continue the coordinating efforts needs for the incorporation of OBIS into the IOC. \r\n\r\nOBIS invaluable to the marine research community, educators, resource managers, and the public. The accumulation of biodiversity data and enhanced accessed through OBIS can lead to better environmental management decisions and educational opportunities world-wide.",
