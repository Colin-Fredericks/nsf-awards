The key to understanding solar variability and its direct impact on the Earth rests with understanding all aspects of these magnetic fields. This is the ?dark energy? problem of solar physics since the magnetic fields lie beyond the resolution limits of current solar telescopes, are obscured by Earth's atmosphere, or hidden by the glare of the solar disk in the outer solar atmosphere. The Sun provides the laboratory where crucial properties of non-linear dynamics in highly ionized magnetic plasma can be observed and understood, and models can be tested and refined. The technology now exists to resolve and measure the Sun?s magnetic fields and how they control the solar atmosphere. All aspects of the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) design are optimized to study these fields in our astrophysical backyard. With it, we will understand the life cycle of magnetic fields, how they are born by dynamo mechanisms, evolve by convective and explosive phenomena, and dissipated by resistive and reconnective magnetic events.\r\n\r\nThe ATST will be a 4-m aperture, off-axis solar telescope with integrated adaptive optics, low-scattered light, infrared, coronagraphic, and polarimetric capabilities. It will resolve the essential, fine-scale magnetic features and their dynamics that dictate the varying release of energy from the Sun?s atmosphere. The ATST design is optimized (throughput, scattered light and instrumental polarization properties) to make vector magnetograms down to its diffraction limit (0.03 arcseconds at 500 nm). Its collecting area, which is a factor of 16 greater than today?s solar telescopes, will provide the sensitivity to measure both weak fields and rapidly evolving stronger fields. It has a factor of 64 greater collecting area than the largest existing coronagraph, and will provide the sensitivity and coronagraphic capability needed to measure the weak, fine-scale coronal magnetic fields. The new technologies, and our increased awareness of what we know we must learn, make ATST the necessary and logical successor to the solar telescopes built in the 1960s and 1970s, and is a natural complement to space missions such the Solar Dynamics Observatory, STEREO, and Solar Orbiter.\r\n\r\nThe ATST offers tremendous opportunity for the training of students and recruitment of post-docs and faculty in solar physics who will become users of the ATST and the instrument builders and theoreticians of the future. ATST plans to establish a strong synergy with the education and outreach programs at the collaborating institutions, including programs for the K-12 classroom, internships, public outreach through tours, hands-on exhibits, and displays. The ATST program has and will continue to actively involve large segments of the US and international solar physics community, helping to strengthen solar astronomy programs at universities and national centers.",

Inouye Solar Telescope is the world&rsquo;s largest and most powerful ground-based solar telescope. The Inouye Solar Telescope was constructed on the summit of Haleakal&#257;, on the island of Maui, Hawai&#699;i, USA. This site was chosen for the very clear, dust-free skies above and surrounding the summit, which allows for world-class never-before-seen detailed images of the surface of the Sun. The telescope captures very precise measurements of the solar magnetic field, which provide detailed information about the inner workings of our nearest star, the Sun.</p>\n<p>The telescope itself consists of a 4-meter class, off-axis, all-reflecting telescope that incorporates a series of mirrors, an integrated adaptive optics system that corrects for any disturbances in the atmosphere, and a collection of high-precision beam-splitting optics. These optics distribute collected sunlight to a suite of four state-of-the-art science detectors, including an imaging instrument and three other specialized &ldquo;spectropolarimetric&rdquo; detectors that cover wavelengths from the visible to the near-infrared. The construction project also included the development of facility buildings, enclosure (dome), software systems, and automated safety systems.</p>\n<h2>Why the Inouye Solar Telescope was Constructed:</h2>\n<p>The Inouye Solar Telescope was constructed to study the Sun&rsquo;s magnetic fields that control solar wind, flares, coronal mass ejections, and variability in the Sun&rsquo;s output. A primary scientific objective of the Inouye Solar Telescope is to precisely measure the three-dimensional structure of these magnetic fields that drive activity of the solar atmosphere. The measurements are needed on a very small spatial scale; understanding the underlying physics that control the Sun requires resolving its magnetic features down to their fundamental scales of just a few tens of kilometers in the solar atmosphere. &nbsp;The large 4-m aperture of the Inouye Solar Telescope allows scientists to resolve these structures down to approximately 20km in size at visible wavelengths, which is far higher in resolution than possible with previous telescopes.</p>\n<p>Observations of the solar atmosphere are also possible with the large-diameter Inouye Solar Telescope, including measurements of the faint corona. The solar atmosphere is highly dynamic, changing and evolving quickly. Measurements of the weak coronal magnetic fields, that have never before been obtained with any regularity, are essential to understand the Sun&rsquo;s explosive behavior and to aid space weather prediction efforts.</p>\n<p>DKIST will be used to answer many long-standing questions in solar physics including:</p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does the Sun have a magnetic field?</p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the Sun&rsquo;s activity vary over time?</p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What causes sunspots?</p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What heats the solar corona to more than 1 million degrees?</p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the solar wind accelerated?</p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What triggers coronal mass ejections and solar flares, converting pent-up magnetic energy into magnetized clouds of plasma traversing the interplanetary space?</p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is energy stored and released in solar flares?</p>\n<p>The Inouye Solar Telescope will significantly advance our knowledge of our nearest star and provide answers to these and other elusive fundamental physics questions about our local star. The Sun literally allows and controls all life on planet Earth. Understanding its behavior in a world ever more based on sensitive electronic technology, is becoming more vital to science and humanity every day.</p>\n<h2>How the Inouye Solar Telescope was Constructed:</h2>\n<p>The observatory was designed, constructed, assembled, integrated, and verified over the course of eleven years. The project was funded by a combination of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) &ldquo;stimulus&rdquo; money and National Science Foundation (NSF) Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) funding. All construction activities were specified and overseen by the National Solar Observatory (NSO), which in turn is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). More than one hundred large industrial and research institution contracts were placed, a dozen trade unions were engaged, and hundreds of scientists, engineers, technicians, and other specialists worked on the project throughout the years. The result of all this hard work and focused effort is the successful completion of the world&rsquo;s most advanced solar observatory, built to meet all of its performance requirements, on schedule, and coming in under budget.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/15/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charles Mattias&nbsp;Mountain</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1011851/1011851_10013433_1644954077389_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1011851/1011851_10013433_1644954077389_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Inouye Solar Telescope\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1011851/1011851_10013433_1644954077389_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Inouye Solar Telescope\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Inouye Solar Telescope at sunset on the summit of Haleakal&#257;, Maui, Hawai'i.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NSO/AURA/NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles Mattias&nbsp;Mountain</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Inouye Solar Telescope</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1011851/1011851_10013433_1644954218589_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1011851/1011851_10013433_1644954218589_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Internal Observatory Explanations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1011851/1011851_10013433_1644954218589_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Internal Observatory Explanations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The different buildings, and internal levels and assemblies of the observatory.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NSO/AURA/NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles Mattias&nbsp;Mountain</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Internal Observatory Explanations</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1011851/1011851_10013433_1644954269697_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1011851/1011851_10013433_1644954269697_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Telescope Mount Assembly\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1011851/1011851_10013433_1644954269697_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Telescope Mount Assembly\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The telescope mount assembly in operation.

The large 4-m aperture of the Inouye Solar Telescope allows scientists to resolve these structures down to approximately 20km in size at visible wavelengths, which is far higher in resolution than possible with previous telescopes.\n\nObservations of the solar atmosphere are also possible with the large-diameter Inouye Solar Telescope, including measurements of the faint corona. The solar atmosphere is highly dynamic, changing and evolving quickly. Measurements of the weak coronal magnetic fields, that have never before been obtained with any regularity, are essential to understand the Sun\u2019s explosive behavior and to aid space weather prediction efforts.\n\nDKIST will be used to answer many long-standing questions in solar physics including:\n\n&#9679;     Why does the Sun have a magnetic field?\n\n&#9679;     How does the Sun\u2019s activity vary over time?\n\n&#9679;     What causes sunspots?\n\n&#9679;     What heats the solar corona to more than 1 million degrees?\n\n&#9679;     How is the solar wind accelerated?\n\n&#9679;     What triggers coronal mass ejections and solar flares, converting pent-up magnetic energy into magnetized clouds of plasma traversing the interplanetary space?\n\n&#9679;     How is energy stored and released in solar flares?\n\nThe Inouye Solar Telescope will significantly advance our knowledge of our nearest star and provide answers to these and other elusive fundamental physics questions about our local star. The Sun literally allows and controls all life on planet Earth. Understanding its behavior in a world ever more based on sensitive electronic technology, is becoming more vital to science and humanity every day.\nHow the Inouye Solar Telescope was Constructed:\n\nThe observatory was designed, constructed, assembled, integrated, and verified over the course of eleven years. The project was funded by a combination of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) \"stimulus\" money and National Science Foundation (NSF) Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) funding. All construction activities were specified and overseen by the National Solar Observatory (NSO), which in turn is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). More than one hundred large industrial and research institution contracts were placed, a dozen trade unions were engaged, and hundreds of scientists, engineers, technicians, and other specialists worked on the project throughout the years. The result of all this hard work and focused effort is the successful completion of the world\u2019s most advanced solar observatory, built to meet all of its performance requirements, on schedule, and coming in under budget.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/15/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles Mattias Mountain"
