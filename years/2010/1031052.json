 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to investigate a new concept in coatings for cutting tools that will enable dry, high-speed machining of steels and other hard-to-cut metal alloys.  The approach is to design coatings that are resistant to both high-temperature oxidation and diffusion-based wear mechanisms.  Current state-of-the art coatings have been promoted based primarily on their oxidation resistance.  Resistance to diffusion-based wear mechanisms will be achieved using large-metal nitride compounds that have a limited solubility within the work piece to be machined.  Since high-speed machining operations are subject to both oxidative and diffusion wear, multilayer coatings that are structured as alternating layers of large-metal nitrides with oxidation-resistant nitrides will be investigated.  Depositing these coatings as nano-scale multilayers will also enhance the hardness and fracture resistance of the coatings.  Sputter  deposition and full chemical and mechanical characterization of the deposited coatings also will be carried out.  Research will be conducted to evaluate the performance of these coatings during high-speed turning of steel. \r\n\r\n\tThe societal benefits of the research will be realized through the promotion of dry machining in place of lubricated machining.  Both environmental and health concerns have been raised for machining operations that use cutting fluids.  The disposal of cutting fluids has become more regulated and therefore more costly for the metal cutting industry.  The success of the coatings to be examined in this study will enable a substantial reduction in the quantity of lubricant used, and in some cases complete elimination of cutting fluids during cutting.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe process of machining is central to the manufacture of metal components used by the automotive, aerospace, and many other industries.  Machining is widely used since it can provide high precision and excellent surface quality.  Current issues of interest include the ability to machine at higher speeds, machining with minimal or no lubricants, and machining of traditionally difficult to cut materials such as titanium and nickel-based alloys.  Improvements to machining process are continually being sought.  In each of these cases, cutting tool wear is accelerated, and therefore much of the effort directed towards improving machining processes centers on improving the cutting tools themselves.  Cutting tools are typically coated with nitride-based compounds that are hard, wear-resistant and provide low friction when run against the machined workpiece. \n\nThe focus of this research project was to improve the process and materials used for coatings applied to cutting tools, which has the potential to benefit a broad range of industries.  For coating materials, titanium and titanium-aluminum nitrides are commonly used.  In the present work, we examined zirconium- and hafnium-based nitrides as alternatives.  One mechanism of tool wear is due to the heat generated during the machining process, which results in significant heating at the tool-workpiece interface, resulting in elements from the coating dissolving into the workpiece metal.  To avoid this, larger-element nitrides such as zirconium and hafnium nitride can be used since they have lower solubility within metal alloys such as steel.  We examined these nitride compounds by depositing them onto cutting tool inserts and then testing them under actual machining conditions.  We found that the zirconium nitride demonstrated improved tool wear compared to titanium nitride when cutting a plain-carbon steel.  However, hafnium nitride did not perform as well.  Further research showed that there is a competition between the hardness of the nitride and the ability to resist dissolution.  The larger element nitrides generally have lower hardness than the titanium nitride, which is detrimental to tool performance.  Therefore the use of these nitrides will require improved deposition processes to generate coatings with higher room-temperature hardness.   \n\nFurther improvements were sought by modifying the process by which the coatings were deposited onto the cutting tools. Typically, a process known as sputter deposition is used, in which a plasma removes atoms from a metal source, and combined with nitrogen within the plasma, results in nitride formation on the cutting tool surface.  We modified this process by incorporating a source of energetic argon ions within the deposition system.  Using such an ion source is not commonly done in combination with sputter deposition, so we directed considerable efforts towards understanding how the ion source could best be used to deposit hard, wear-resistant coatings of both titanium-based and large-element nitrides.  The results showed that the ion energy and flux strongly influence the structure, hardness and crystallographic orientation of the deposited coatings.  We also found that the ion beam parameters are so influential that they overcome traditional epitaxial growth mechanisms.  In a series of key experiments, we were able to tune the crystallographic orientation and coating structure by changing the ion beam energy and flux during deposition.  This opens the possibility of novel coating structures for many types of nitride films.  Further research is needed to determine the ultimate influence of these new structures on the performance of the coatings in machining applications. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/27/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James E Krzanowski"
