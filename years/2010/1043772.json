 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds approximately 20 graduate students at U.S. institutions to attend (1) the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom 2010) and (2) the 11th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing (MobiHoc 2010). These two conferences, referred to as MobiCom/Hoc, will be co-located this year. MobiCom/Hoc (September 20-24, 2010 in Chicago, Illinois) are  premiere conferences in their respective mobile computing fields. The intellectual merit of this project resides in the contributions that the student participants will make to (1) the MobiCom/Hoc 2010 event and (2) the future scientific progress of the student's research. In addition to the technical paper presentations, MobiCom/Hoc 2010 offers a wide variety of technical activities (e.g., keynote presentations, poster session, demos, and eight workshops). The exposure to the technical content of MobiCom/Hoc 2010 will inspire students to address the tough problems in their respective field, with a long-term benefit of scientific progress for these types of networks. The broader impact of this proposal concerns the development of the graduate students that are able to attend MobiCom/Hoc 2010 due to the provided travel support. The travel funds allows graduate students conducting research in the field to attend high-caliber technical presentations, be exposed to state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate students.",
