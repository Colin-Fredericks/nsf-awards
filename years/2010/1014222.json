An array of individually computer controllable micro-devices on a chip is the centerpiece of the system, will allow numerous laboratory experiments and demonstrations to be carried out under a microscope.\r\n\r\nThis Class on a Chip project gives professors, teachers and students access to the micro and nano world at a relatively low cost. By providing teachers with hardware, software and supporting curriculum, this framework will impact hundreds and thousands of students by allowing them to become immersed in essential scientific and engineering  concepts, thus propelling a larger fraction of students towards scientific careers in the STEM fields. Universities with and without substantial micro-device initiatives and resources will also benefit for this accessible technology.",
