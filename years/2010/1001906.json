 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Atlanta Lecture Series on Combinatorics and Graph Theory is a series of three mini-conferences hosted jointly by Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia State University. As the various areas of combinatorics and graph theory have matured, many new techniques and ground-breaking results have been established. Often these break-throughs are relevant to other areas of mathematics or other disciplines. Techniques and results in combinatorics and graph theory have greatly impacted such fields as computer science, bioinformatics, transportation and communication network theory, topology, algebra and computational matrix theory to name just a few.\r\n\r\nThe areas to be covered by these conferences include, but are not limited to extremal, algebraic and probabilistic combinatorics and graph theory, as well as structural and topological graph theory. These interdisciplinary meetings will focus on the interplay of results across areas including extremal graph and hypergraph theory, random graphs, structural graph theory, topological graph theory, poset theory, probabilistic combinatorics, domination theory and graph algorithms. It is expected that the conference will also promote deeper collaborations among researchers from the surrounding region, as well as build both the knowledge base and set of potential collaborators for participating young researchers and graduate students.",
