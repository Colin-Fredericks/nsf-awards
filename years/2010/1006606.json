A quantum phase transition takes place when quantum matter becomes unstable to a new, ordered ground state.  Therefore, quantum criticality is a concept that describes a phase transition between competing ground states driven by an external parameter other than temperature such as chemical composition, pressure, or magnetic field.  In principle the phase transition takes place at absolute zero.  Nevertheless, a growing body of experimental work indicates that fundamentally new physics can develop over a wide region at finite temperatures.  The goal of this research project is to enhance our fundamental understanding of the extent to which quantum criticality controls the finite temperature properties of unconventional superconductors and provide insight into the mutual interplay between unconventional superconductivity and magnetism.  The results from these basic investigations are expected to provide further understanding of the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity and to facilitate applications to electronic sensors and devices such as magnetic field sensors or even computer logic devices.  This highly interdisciplinary project will allow graduate students and postdocs to benefit from exposure to a diversity of important experimental techniques and a variety of different physical systems and phenomena.  The diversity of the expertise gained by the participants in this research program is a substantial advantage in today's knowledge based, technology driven economy, being beneficial to a future career in industry, government, or academia.\r\n\r\n****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nThis individual investigator award supports a research project addressing major themes in condensed matter physics: quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity in Fe pnictides, and the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in pnictides and hybrid ferromagnet/superconductor (F-S) structures.  These studies are expected to significantly enhance our fundamental understanding of the extent to which quantum criticality controls the finite temperature properties of unconventional superconductors and promise a deeper insight into the mutual interplay between unconventional superconductivity and magnetism.  In addition by comparing and contrasting the Fe-pnictides and cuprates superconductors, the project may contribute to uncovering the vital clues that theorists need to solve the mystery of high-temperature superconductivity.  The strong mutual interaction between the ferromagnetic and superconducting subsystems of heterogeneous F-S structures does not suppress either property, but rather can dramatically change the structure and properties of both of them.  Therefore these structures offer unlimited possibilities for qualitatively new science and technologies.  For example, such structures offer important technological promise for devices whose transport properties can be easily tuned by comparatively weak magnetic fields.  This highly interdisciplinary project will allow graduate students and postdocs to benefit from exposure to a diversity of important experimental techniques and a variety of different physical systems and phenomena.  The diversity of the expertise gained by the participants in this research program is a substantial advantage in today's knowledge based, technology driven economy, being beneficial to a future career in industry, government, or academia.",

We focused our experimental studies on the heavy-fermion CeCoIn5 and its alloys since this unconventional superconductor is a prototypical system for which its pronounced non-Fermi liquid behavior in the normal state and unconventional superconductivity are thought to arise from the proximity of this system to a quantum phase transition.  We developed a new experimental technique that has allowed us to reveal the quasiparticle dissipation under the superconducting dome as a function of high-applied magnetic fields and pressure, and low temperatures, thus revealing the antiferromagnetism and quantum criticality of the underlying normal state under the superconducting dome. ?Furthermore, these results show that the full suppression of the quantum phase transition in CeCoIn5 by doping with Yb has surprisingly little impact on both superconductivity and the non-Fermi liquid behavior.

This project created training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates through a variety of integrated research and educational activities, as well as mentoring. In addition, students from middle schools and high schools in the surrounding Springfield and Ravenna school districts visited the our laboratory and learned about physics in general, and superconductivity and magnetism in particular, through demonstrations and short lectures given by members of the research group. In this way, the middle school and high school students were exposed to a research environment and were given a flavor of the science done in the lab and the technology involved in doing it.
