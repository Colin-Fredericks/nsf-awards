 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurements and Imaging Program, Prof. James Reilly and his group at Indiana University are seeking ways to improve the structural analysis of peptides using mass spectrometry.  In the Reilly approach, peptide ions are photofragmented by high energy ultraviolet light instead of the conventional collisional fragmentation.  Resulting data have been found to be somewhat instrument-dependent.  Dr. Reilly seeks improved understanding of the photofragmentation process and its variability in order to provide a more effective protein identification approach.  He is also assembling a database that catalogs and summarizes photofragmentation data, and working to develop an improved de novo sequencing algorithm.  The work entails collaboration with a group interested in the theory of peptide photofragmentation.  \r\nBecause of the importance of peptides and proteins in bioprocesses, the fields of biochemistry, proteomics, and cell biology will all benefit from improvements in peptide identification and sequencing technology, particularly with respect to the ability to identify mutations, post-translational and sample handling modifications, and genome sequencing errors.  Advances in proteomic technologies can impact understanding of the molecular basis of disease, which in turn should translate to improved clinical intervention.  In the course of these studies, students and postdoctoral researchers are receiving invaluable training in multidisciplinary research that involves physical, analytical and biochemistry along with instrumentation and data interpretation algorithm development.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe field of proteomics involves the detection and identification of proteins that are synthesized in the ribosomes of living cells.  Proteins are involved in most of the tasks that a cell performs.  It is important to comprehend their multifarious functions if we want to understand how cells operate.  Proteins can be routinely extracted from cells but they are not typically analyzed as intact molecules.  Instead, they are digested using proteolytic enzymes.  The peptides formed in this way are separated by liquid chromatography, ionized by electrospray and introduced into a mass spectrometer.  Once inside the mass spectrometer, peptide ions are typically fragmented by collisional activation.  However, an alternative activation method that we employ involves the use of short-wavelength ultraviolet light.  This type of photodissociation generates more extensive distributions of peptide ion fragments than are obtained with collisional activation.  Having many fragments can lead to more definitive peptide identifications and even the capability of de novo sequencing of peptides.  De novo sequencing corresponds to extracting a peptide's amino acid sequence directly from a mass spectrum rather than from a process of matching mass spectral peaks to predictions that are derived from databases.  During this project we investigated the fragmentation of very small dipeptide ions that consist of only two amino acid residues.   By studying the photodissociation of these very simple systems we learned about propensities for breaking different kinds of peptide bonds.  We also investigated the photodissociation of charge-tagged peptides.  These are peptides that have their own charge built in by covalent modification.  So instead of adding a proton during electrospray ionization we simply detach a negative counter ion from the peptide in order to charge it for mass spectral analysis.  Charge-tagged peptides have been around for a number of years but they have not found extensive application.  Our investigation clarified some of the problems associated with charge-tagged peptides.  Most critically, charge-tagged peptides exhibit relatively disappointing ion yields, the charge does not remain fixed on the tag and pieces of the tag can move around the peptide which confuses all fragmentation spectra.  As a final application of photofragmentation we studied peptide libraries in an attempt to learn more about selection rules associated with this ion dissociation process.\n\nThe second major activity that we pursued during this project involved cross linking proteins with a reagent that we developed called DEST.  This small organic molecule is similar to several that are commercially available except for the fact that it creates positively-charged amidino linkage sites when it reacts with a pair of lysines.  In contrast, other cross-linkers neutralize the normally positively charged lysine side chains.  Amidino linkages guarantee that the cross-linked lysine residues remain charged.  This obviates the problem of distorting the structure of a folded protein.  Analysis of cross-linked species usually relies on proteolytic digestion of linked proteins.  By creating positively charged cross-link sites, DEST yields particularly highly charged pairs of cross-linked peptides and this facilititates the extraction of cross-linked species from a mixture of unlinked species by ion exchange chromatography.  We exploited this in studies of bacterial ribosomes.  In a cross linking study of E. coli bacterial ribosomes we detected cross links to ribosomal protein S1 whose location had not been previously established.  This protein does not appear in x-ray crystal structures of ribosomes because its presence inhibits the formation of intact crystals.\n\nIn addition to the novel cross linker we also developed a pair of amidinating reagents one of which penetrates cell membranes and the other does not.  This reagent will enable future labeling experiments that can dist..."
