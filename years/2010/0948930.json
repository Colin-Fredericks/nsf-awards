 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological invasions create enormous environmental and social problems, impose a huge economic cost, and threaten biodiversity. Studying invasions aids environmental management and increases understanding of natural system dynamics. Fungi are one of the least understood groups of invasive species, despite being an essential component of biodiversity and having tremendous ecological significance. Fungal control of plant invasion will be studied on an island in Argentina where a century ago more than 130 exotic trees species were planted, including many that are highly invasive elsewhere.  Surprisingly few of these species have become widespread on this island.  Previous research shows that lack of mycorrhizal fungi (root symbionts that are key to plant survival) limits spread of invasive plant species in the area. These fungi form mutualisms with only a few plant species, and the plants and the fungi are dispersed independently, so the plants may not 'find' mutualistic fungi. This project will elucidate how fungal dispersal aids spread of invasive trees. Introduced species that eat fungi, such as European boar and deer, may disperse fungi in their feces, generating a feedback between the exotics and increasing the impacts of the invading trees. Fungi can also spread belowground and thus promote establishment of the introduced trees. This project will show how mammals, wind, and belowground growth influence fungal spread and subsequent invasion by exotic conifers, one of the most aggressive groups of invasive plants. \r\n\r\nThe 21st century may bring a great loss of biodiversity.  Invasive species are a leading factor, also producing huge economic losses.  To manage biological invasions effectively to minimize these environmental and economic costs, we must understand the factors regulating invasions: this is the goal of this study.  In addition, this will contribute to our understanding of fungal biology and its influence on plant ecology, which will advance the ecological sciences.",

Biological invasions are one of the major global changes affecting species diversity and services ecosystems provide to humankind. Why some species develop full-scale invasions and others either fail to establish populations once introduced, or fail to spread even after a population is established, is not well understood.&nbsp; Similarly, why some areas or habitats are more invaded than othersis a longstanding question that it is important to answer.&nbsp; This project aimed to help answer these questions bystudying how mutualistic soil biota, an understudied factor, affect the invasion of land-transforming northern hemisphere pine tree species in the southern hemisphere. Most terrestrial plants need to be associated with mutualistic fungi (mycorrhizae) in their roots to survive; these fungi aid the plants to gather soil nutrients. Some of these associations are not very specific, so plants can form mycorrhizal associations with a number of fungal species. But some plants &ndash; and this is the case for pines and several other highly invasive species&ndash; have very specific requirements and can form mycorrhizal associations only with fungi from their home range, or with at most a very few other fungi. So for such plants to become invasive, theyrequire the arrival of their associated fungi. In this project we found that, even when these non-native fungi arrive,the dispersal of these non-native fungi depends on non-native animals (wild boar and European deer introduced for hunting), who eat them and disperse the spores very effectively with their feces (see figure), because native animals do not seem to consume the fungi and wind may not a major agent for dispersing spores in this region.
