 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to analyze and then utilize the dynamic behavior that results from incorporating components with negative stiffness into electro-mechanical and structural systems.  The research focuses on such phenomena as band-gaps, twinkling, bi-stability, signal magnification and frequency induced softening, towards applications such as energy dissipation and absorption, energy transfer, energy harvesting, waveguides and vibration absorbers.  Research issues include understanding of the nonlinear transient dynamics between expanded and contracted snap-through states, analysis and design of high-frequency dynamics that result from low frequency inputs, derivation of effective dynamical properties for assemblies of small scale units of negative stiffness, development of topology optimization methods to handle systems with negative stiffness, innovative usage of objective functions for design of desired behavior, construction of experiments using magneto-elastic base structures, and the measurement and characterization of dynamic responses in experiments. The research will be conducted using a combination of physical experimentation and rigorous analytical techniques, such as Bloch-Floquet theory and topology optimization.\r\n\r\nThis research supports and leads to the creation of new tools that facilitate the development of novel and more effective engineered materials. The work explores the concept of elements of negative stiffness and their incorporation in assemblies that have dynamic properties that do not occur in standard materials.  The advanced devices that become possible through the use of these materials are likely to generate growth in a number of high-technology industries: medical diagnostic equipment, sensing devices for non-destructive testing, automotive, environmental (sound abatement), and energy harvesting.  The research seeks an enhanced understanding of a variety of phenomena of relevance in emerging technologies:  wave propagation in periodic media, acoustic and vibration energy management, metamaterial design in the acoustic and ultrasonic range.  The work also provides a framework for the understanding of the effect of negative stiffness in different physical domains and develops new insights into the design of systems that take advantage of this fresh understanding.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStiffness in mechanical systems is associated with the restoring forces that occur under elastic deformations about an equilibrium.  Negative stiffness is the case in which negative restoring forces are generated under deviations from an equilibrium, thereby driving the system further from equilibrium, until globally positive stiffness contain the deflection.  Negative stiffness allows systems to exhibit \"bistability\", i.e. two stable equilibria on either side of an unstable equilibrium, enabling \"snap-through\" from one equilibrium to another.  Snap-through can be used to induce high-frequency oscillations under low-frequency excitations.  These oscillations become more complicated when snap-through systems are linked together.  This work studies systems with negative stiffness, with applications to energy harvesting and wave behavior.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nA snap-through energy harvester will oscillate about stable equilibria when excited.  We looked at the equilibrium configurations of small chains of preloaded snap-through oscillators, and considered the energy levels of the equilibria in the context of harvestable energy.  Unusual transitions, or bifurcations, of equilibria, were uncovered for symmetric oscillators, and the perturbations of these bifurcations with broken symmetry were observed.  \n\nWe also examined the behavior of traveling waves about equilibria for large chains of oscillators, and how the wave speed is related to the wavelength in the presence of nonlinearity.  A study of interacting, internally resonant waves suggests that emergent waves are likely in the presence of nonlinearity.  The time scale of the emergence and interaction between internally resonant waves is affected by the strength of the nonlinearity.  These interacting waves can be phase locked or phase drifting, depending on initial conditions and parameters.\n\nIn collaboration with researchers at Duke University, we built and tested an energy harvesting device based on two connected snap-through masses.  The device showed the feasibility of snap-through frequency up-conversion for harvesting energy in low-frequency environments.  The electro-magneto mechanics of the oscillator and harvester were successfully modeled. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe project supported the education of students.  One primary doctoral student completed his PhD.  The project developed his expertise in nonlinear dynamics, vibrations, and wave behavior, and he is now working with Ford Motor Company.  The project also provided research experiences for four undergraduate students, who participated in design, manufacture, and assembly of experimental components, as well as in general discussions of the research topic.  The primary PhD student was involved with mentoring one of the undergraduates.  A second PhD student, an underrepresented minority, was involved in the analysis of wave simulation data, which helped broaden his research experience.\n\nThe PIs and the primary graduate student were involved with K-12 outreach through existing programs with the College and University.  Through the High-School Engineering Institute, the team exposed high-school students to mechanical engineering, with particular emphasis on energy challenges, and gave the students a small hands-on project on wind energy. \n\nThe research results were disseminated through conference presentations and papers, and journal papers.  A PhD thesis was also completed.  The work is ongoing, as additional papers are in preparation.  The energy harvesting work helped establish collaboration between researchers at Michigan State University and Duke University.  The research is applicable towards harvesting energy from ambient vibrations and understanding energy transfer in chains, and is expected to lead to applications in energy dissipation for passive shock, vibration, and sound control.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian F Feeny"
