 "awd_abstract_narration": "While transformations to an aquatic lifestyle have been intensely studied in organisms ranging from insects to whales, basic questions remain unanswered for birds: e.g., how many times has 'aquatic flight' been gained and aerial flight lost? A large collaborative team will focus on resolving the controversial evolutionary relationships of wing-propelled diving birds (including new fossils). Phylogenetic comparative methods will be used to investigate musculoskeletal, neurosensory, and feather microstructure changes across aerial to aquatic flight transitions. Techniques such as X-ray computed tomography, histology, and computer modeling will also be utilized.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts focus on interdisciplinary undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training in systematics, histology and biomechanics. Highlights include a mentored research experience for undergraduate students from under-represented groups. Public outreach and education activities include co-instruction of a 3 year Geoscience module of the nationally-recognized 'UTeach' secondary school teacher preparation program, 'Expanding Your Horizons' workshops to encourage young women to pursue science careers, web-cast lectures and distribution of curricular materials via university and museum  programs, and a dedicated blog.  Broad dissemination of research findings is achieved through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and data sharing via online databases.",

The goals of this project were to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of the living and fossil species of wing-propelled diving birds such as penguins, auks, and the extinct plotopterids, and to investigate the changes in the skeleton, brain, feathers, and vascular systems that are associated with adaptation to underwater &ldquo;flight&rdquo; in these birds. These goals were met, resulting in several discoveries important to our understanding of diving bird evolution and long-term patterns in diversification and extinction. An evolutionary tree of penguins and related birds was constructed using a large dataset including both morphological characters and DNA sequences. Extinct species were studied from fossils, allowing our team to estimate the dates for many key events in the natural history of diving birds. In addition to studying existing fossil material, new fossils were collected and prepared in New Zealand, including a skeleton of an extinct giant penguin species. Patterns of geographic dispersal were uncovered. Analyses revealed that penguins colonized Africa at least three separate times, arriving from South America. Research on penguin anatomical evolution revealed new patterns in the adaptation of these birds to underwater environments. Studies of the penguin flipper revealed that a key countercurrent heat exchange system evolved at least 49 million years ago, before the time when permanent ice sheets formed in Antarctica. This thermoregulatory structure was thus already in place before penguins began inhabiting extreme polar environments. Virtual models of the brain were created for living and fossil birds, revealing that key changes in neuroanatomy took place both during the evolutionary shift to a diving lifestyle and after the shift to flightlessness.
