 "awd_abstract_narration": "The precise assembly of neural circuits during development is critical in defining control of motor behaviors in the mature organism and remains a central problem in neurobiology. The focus of this project is to investigate the role of one family of DNA-binding proteins, gastrulation brain homeobox (Gbx), in the formation of neural circuits, which regulate motor functions, such as walking and eating. Gbx1 and Gbx2 are dynamically expressed in the developing nervous system and deficient expression of either has a deleterious effect on neural circuit development. This work will utilize molecular biology as well as genetic techniques and bioinformatics. Results from the project will provide valuable insights in to the function of Gbx proteins by identifying the genes which are under their direct control and are critical for positioning neuronal cells, guiding axons and ultimately, controlling motor behavior. Additional impacts of this award will be to help broaden the PI's scope in developmental neurobiology, molecular biology and bioinformatics, as well as contribute to his teaching and scholarly activities. Furthermore, training opportunities and the promotion of interdisciplinary research will be provided for students in an increasingly scientifically diverse and technology-driven society. The award will broaden participation of underrepresented minority graduate and undergraduate students by providing support for graduate student stipends and funding for research supplies. The experimental results of the research project will be published in scientific journals and students will be encouraged to present their findings at scientific meetings.",

Interestingly, the sensory and motor defects in Gbx1 null mice impact one of the simplest and best understood neuronal circuits in the vertebrate CNS, the spinal monosynaptic stretch reflex circuit.
