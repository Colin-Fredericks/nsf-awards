 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California at Merced has been awarded a grant to develop new tools and protocols for characterizing protein dynamics. While the focus of protein biophysics has traditionally been on the structure and interactions of the natively folded protein, there is now rapidly growing interest in the properties of denatured protein structures as related to the mechanisms of protein folding and in the function of so-called intrinsically disordered proteins. Molecular simulations have great promise in helping to understand disordered proteins; however, new tools are needed to characterize the defining property of these constantly changing systems--their dynamics. The long-term goal of this research is to develop new tools and protocols for determining the two most fundamental descriptors of protein dynamics, the effective dimensionality of the motion and the volume of structural space sampled by the protein. The tools will help answer the many fundamental, unresolved questions about the denatured or disordered states of proteins that are central to understanding protein function and folding. Specifically, these tools will determine to what extent denatured or intrinsically disordered proteins behave as random polymers or have motions constrained to lower dimensional dynamics. Additionally these tools will elucidate whether there are differences between the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins and natively folded proteins in the early stages of folding. Finally, these tools will help in determining the efficiency of different molecular simulations in sampling the denatured or disordered states of proteins. \r\n\r\nThis project will be an ideal multidisciplinary training experience for the students involved since it brings together three scientific disciplines: machine learning, molecular simulation, and polymer biophysics. The tools developed in this project will be used by graduate and undergraduate students in both molecular simulation and computer sciences courses at UC Merced and by students in summer research projects. The molecular dynamics community has a well established tradition of software tools that are developed and maintained by individual research groups and freely distributed to very large user bases. These established channels will be used to freely distribute all of the software tools developed in this project in source code format along with documentation and test data sets.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n \n\nProtein function has traditionally been understood in terms of the static three-dimensional \"folded\" structures that most proteins adopt.  A growing number of proteins are now known to work in unfolded or semi-folded conformations.  Determining the properties of these so-called \"intrinsically disordered\" proteins requires a new set of experimental and theoretical methods.  In this project, we developed a set of computational tools to describe the properties of intrinsically disordered proteins seen in detailed simulations of the protein motion.   The challenge can be illustrated by thinking of the protein as a long, flexible wire that has been crushed into a roughly spherical shape.  The protein \"conformation\" is described by the twists and turns of the wire.  Intrinsically disordered proteins are constantly changing their conformation, so that the \"wire\" will be constantly bending and unbending.  If the motions were completely random, they could be described by equations developed for simple polymers, but most intrinsically disordered proteins are believed to have some residual structure that determines their function in the cell.\n\n \n\nOne key challenge was to develop methods to give a precise numerical value for the similarity or difference between very different protein conformations.  To continue the analogy described above, if two equal length pieces of wire were crushed into similar size spheres, how could one describe how similar or dissimilar the detailed structures of folded wires are.  The tools usually used for proteins try to superimpose the two structures and then sum up the degree to which the two structures cannot be fully overlapped.  Our research showed that these methods do not work well for intrinsically disordered proteins since, beyond a fairly small degree of structural difference, they measure all structures to be equally dissimilar.  We have developed new tools based on comparing the magnitude of each twist and turn along the protein structure to calculate a structural difference.  These tools perform well in measuring meaningful differences in widely divergent protein structures.  We have been programming these methods into software programs that are available for other scientists to use.\n\n \n\nIn addition to developing the methods for comparing protein structures described above, we also used these tools as starting points to analyze the motions of intrinsically disordered proteins using large collections of conformations produced by computer simulations.  We adapted and extended methods from machine learning that have been used to analyze other forms of high dimensional data such as images and videos.  We investigated dimensionality estimation and reduction to visualize and quantify the differences in the movements of different conformations.  We applied these tools to the results of simulations of actual protein structures as well as to simplified \"model polymers\".  For the model polymers the tools worked correctly in distinguishing higher dimensional (i.e. more complex) polymers from lower dimensional polymers.  For the simulated proteins, these tools showed that their motions occur in a much lower dimensionality than for a simple flexible chain of the same length.  This confirms the presence of residual structure.\n\n \n\nThe tools described above could also provide estimates of the range of conformations adopted by different proteins during a molecular simulation.  We used these tools to show that proteins of different composition adopted different ranges of conformations during simulations and that these ranges constitute a reasonable measure of the degree of intrinsic disorder of different proteins.  A continuing challenge in the use of such methods to study protein disorder is separating the motions that are characteristic of a particular protein from the complex (high dimensional) inherent thermal motion of molecules.  We investigated different ways of separating the intrins..."
