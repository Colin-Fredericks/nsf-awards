The Chlamydomonas research community meets every two\r\nyears to exchange methods, develop collaborative efforts, disseminate recent\r\nadvances, and plan large-scale studies to improve the usefulness of this unique\r\nresearch organism. The objectives of this conference include the provision of a forum for all researchers using the unicellular Chlamydomonas and its multicellular relative Volvox to present and discuss their results, to exchange information, to develop new collaborations, and to improve the usefulness of shared database resources. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. This conference will provide opportunities for expanding the use of Chlamydomonas and related algae as research and educational tools and will promote and showcase the research of younger scientists, women and members of underrepresented minorities. Postdoctoral fellows, graduate (and some undergraduate) students, women and minorities are encouraged to present their research. \r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Cellular Systems Cluster and the Genes and Genomes Systems Cluster.\r\n",
