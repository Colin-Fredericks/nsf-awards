Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) is on the ecological dimensions of bioenergy sustainability.  Graduate students in Michigan State University?s Ecology, Evolutionary Biology & Behavior and Environmental Science & Public Policy programs who are engaged in STEM research at KBS will partner with teachers in the KBS K-12 Partnership for Science Literacy, the new Department of Energy Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC), and the NSF Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project on the Ecology of Agricultural Landscapes.  Project activities include establishing schoolyard science research plots in K-12 Partner districts that mimic aspects of GLBRC research plots and serve as the foundation for a schoolyard research network.  Fellows will work collaboratively with each other, their advisors, and project partners to incorporate their own research into K-12 research and inquiry activities that address Michigan and national science education standards.\r\n\r\nFellows will improve their ability to place their research in its broader societal and global contexts, to collaborate across disciplines, to integrate their research and teaching, and to communicate their research to professional, K-12 and public audiences. The opportunity to work collaboratively with fellows on authentic research related to pressing national needs will enhance the professional development of the K-12 partner teachers and enrich the education of K-12 students.  This project will also enhance ongoing efforts at KBS to recruit a greater number and diversity of young people into STEM science disciplines.\r\n\r\n",

Creating partnerships where 30 GK-12 Fellows, supported over 48 fellow-years, worked 10-12 hours per week with 31 K-12 science teachers in 39 schools in 30 districts in rural Southwest Michigan. Fellows co-taught and helped teachers introduce inquiry-based activities related to ecological literacy, the Fellow&rsquo;s research, and other science topics.</p>\n<p>2. Organizing and hosting annual Summer Institutes for Fellows, K-12 teachers, and MSU scientists that focused on providing inquiry-based approaches to learning for understanding and educational leadership.</p>\n<p>3. Organizing and hosting 2-4 school-year workshops per year, where Fellows, K-12 teachers and STEM education experts designed activities to support classroom efforts that incorporate inquiry-based learning.</p>\n<p>4.
