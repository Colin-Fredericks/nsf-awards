The project is updating lab facilities with Alternative Fuel Automotive training equipment and providing students with internships and job placement opportunities. The developed curriculum is being shared with regional and national faculty and service providers in a manner appropriate for the BFIT as a regional leader in automotive higher education training. The project is also providing an enhanced career pathway for minority and low-income students and other individuals by establishing links from high school to the BFIT for two-year and four-year degrees.",

We had such an interest in the Alternative fuels and Hybrid courses that we have all incoming students test the waters by taking a mandatory Alternative Fuels course their first semester. The students enjoyed the course and most are anxiuosly waiting for the next Hybrid courses, in their third and fou..."
