This workshop facilitates the cross-fertilization of ideas from the perfSONAR and network research communities to meet the needs of the federal and R&E (research and education) networks in the United States. The long term goal is to create a system for solving end-to-end performance problems in an efficient, scalable fashion on an ongoing basis.  The workshop brings together network researchers, applications developers, network developers, network managers, and others with an interest in network performance measurement. The workshop expects to generate community of interest coupled with a report summarizing the current community consensus on potential research focus areas, open issues, and operational requirements.",
