 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Davis & Santa Cruz Solar Team will investigate a transformative new paradigm of solar energy conversion: the high efficiency Multiple Exciton Generation (MEG) pathway and the corresponding challenge of charge extraction in all-inorganic nanostructured solar cells. MEG was recently observed in nanoparticles (NPs) and is not subject to the 31% theoretical limit of solar energy conversion.  The Solar Team will synthesize pure, doped and alloyed Si and Ge core-shell NPs to analyze their chemistry, quantum states and energetics in a wide range of sizes, dopings, and structures, using PbS NPs as reference.  The impact of complex factors such as the relaxation of the NP surface, the various core-shell structures, the exciton-exciton interaction and the NP-NP interaction on the chemistry and spectra of the NPs as well as on the MEG will be analyzed.  The tools of the analysis will include photoluminescence and transient absorption studies with femtosecond resolution; and forming fully functional NP based solar cells, complete with embedding charge transport layers.  These solar cells will be developed by optimizing the competing design principles of maintaining quantum confinement to preserve the efficiency of the MEG while embedding the NPs into suitably conducting layers for efficient charge extraction and transport.  A strong theoretical effort will complement the Team's experimental work. Density functional theories (DFT) will be used to capture the surface reconstruction and the energetics of NPs; time dependent DFT and Bethe-Salpeter methods to describe the exciton-exciton interaction; and non-equilibrium rate equations to determine the full rate of MEG. Mathematical projects will assist these efforts by developing a Lanczos coefficient extrapolation method, dramatically reducing the computational workload by replacing direct matrix manipulations with matrix by vector products; and by developing global statistical methods to qualitatively improve the analysis and extraction of the hidden dynamics from the noisy, ultra-high dimensional spectrotemporal dataset, obtained by the photoluminescence and transient absorption.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nEven in theory, the efficiency of solar cells is limited to a disappointing 31%. However, this limit was based on the traditional operation of solar cells, where an incoming solar photon excites only a single electron. A recent breakthrough showed that in nanoparticles one photon may excite several electrons, thus opening a new energy conversion paradigm not constrained by the above limit.  The Davis Solar Team will synthesize a wide variety of nanoparticles; perform ultra-fast optical experiments to characterize the energy conversion process in these particles; and construct fully functional solar cells by embedding the nanoparticles into charge transport layers. Path-breaking mathematical work will be performed to accelerate the computational techniques to unprecedented speeds to simulate the energy conversion process with great accuracy. Further, qualitatively new statistical analyses will be developed to uncover the complex factors embedded in the vast amount of data produced by the optical experiments.  The improvement of the solar energy conversion efficiency expected to emerge from this project can considerably increase the role solar technologies will play in the US transitioning towards renewable energy sources.  The Davis Solar Team will not only develop these new nanoparticle based solar cells, but also plans to chaperon this technology towards the marketplace. This will be pursued through working with the Solar Collaborative of the California Energy Commission (SC-CEC), where the Team played an early leadership role. The Team?s industrial collaboration will be developed through one of the PIs who is on the advisory board of a solar company. Besides working toward a wide acceptance of nanoparticle solar technologies, the Team will reach out and serve the solar community at large by analyzing and disseminating the latest academic research to the solar stakeholders: the PV manufacturers, utilities and the regulatory bodies through the SC-CEC. The Team will also develop a ?Solarwiki? as a platform for a broad electronic outreach to the interested public.  The Team will integrate its work with its activity in the ACS SEED program.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will work jointly with the groups of the Solar Team to foster interdisciplinary thinking and to prepare them to join the solar revolution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis proposal investigated a transformative new paradigm of solar energy conversion by studying charge extraction in all-inorganic nanostructured solar cells towards extracting higher efficiency by harvesting excited state carrier prior to their thermal relaxation.   This proposal was a collaborative proposal between the laboratories of Zimanyi, Galli, Kauzlarich, Bai, Larsen, and  UC Davis and Carter at UC Santa Cruz and combined interdisciplinary expertise in Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering.  This outcomes report focuses on the results from Carter\u00c6s laboratory at UC Santa Cruz. \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit: Understanding charge generation, extraction, and transport in nanostructured systems is a critical to both understanding the quantum mechanically properties of nanosystems but also their development into devices that can benefit humankind.  Our focus was on understanding charge transport properties in nanostructures formed from colloidal quantum dots of group IV materials, such as Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge) as it applies to solar energy conversion.   Our results demonstrated that the harvesting of more then one electron per photon is possible at solar relevant energies in PbS quantum dots solar cells, suggesting that multiple exciton generation can be realized in working devices.  In addition, simulations of PbSe quantum dots revealed that the observed dependence of the mobility on the nanoparticle diameter is due to Coulomb interactions between electrons on the quantum dots.   Thin films of Ge and Si quantum dots were also fabricated by overcoming, in part, challenges related to the strong bond energies between the quantum dots and their organic ligands.  However, solar cells fabricated from these group IV quantum dots had significantly lower currents then their II-VI and IV-VI counterparts due to reduced charge transport resulting from greater surface defects.  Nonetheless, these materials showed promising other properties, including high on-off ratios and large open circuit voltages in the dark, when used in photodetectors and memory devices. \n\nBroader Impact: Our results demonstrated that over 100% external quantum efficiencies can be achieved in quantum dot solar cells processed from solution at solar relevant energies, paving the way for low cost high efficiency solar cells.  Moreover, large changes in on-off currents in these quantum dot systems suggest that these materials can provide pathway towards a lower cost alternative to transistors, particularly for applications that require high density nanosized switches and both optical and electrical switching.   As part of our eduation outreach efforts, classes K-8 students on Optics in Nature, E&amp;M and Light, and Renewable Energy were developed that integrated interdisciplinary science topics with hand-on laboratories and demonstrations.  This integrated curriculum was taught to over 80 students with a wide range of socio-economic and learning challenges through both a summer camp and  trimester-long classes.   All students stayed engaged in the science classes, expressed a much greater interest in science careers, and happily signed up for additional science classes.  Such interdisciplinary hands-on curriculum provides  an additional model for teaching science that can engage a more diverse body of students to pursue science careers. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sue A Carter"
