 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal goal of the research project is to address some of the new analytical \r\nquestions of the theory of integrable systems which emerged from the recent developments in random matrix theory and in the related areas of exactly solvable quantum models. The problems under consideration include the  analytical description   of the Painlev\\'e  - type universalities in random matrix theory and the related study of special families of Painlev\\'e transcendents and generalized Painlev\\'e  transcendents arising in the critical asymptotics in  random matrices, statistical mechanics  and in the  enumerative topology. The third direction of the project is concerned with the analytical investigation of  the crossover phenomena in the classical theory of Toeplitz and Hankel determinants, i.e. with the study of the Painlev\\'e-type transition behavior between different non-critical asymptotic regimes exhibited by large size Toeplitz and Hankel determinants.  Each of the above mentioned directions is represented by a collection of concrete problems,  and they are proposed to be investigated within the same analytical framework,  which is the Riemann-Hilbert method.\r\n\r\nThe theory of integrable systems is an expanding area  which plays an\r\nincreasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and theoretical physics. Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytical tool for study of some of the fundamental  mathematical models arising in  modern nonlinear science and technology. The  new areas where the analytic techniques of integrable systems become more and more common  include random matrices, quantum field and string theories, enumerative topology,  stochastic  processes, number theory, and, most recently, entanglement in quantum  chain systems  which is expected to play prominent role in future  quantum computing  technology. The  problems considered in the proposal  have direct connections  with  the mentioned disciplines. In particular,  part of the proposal related to the  Toeplitz and Hankel determinants  is primary  motivated by the needs of the analytical theory  of quantum entanglement and by the challenges of analytical description of critical behavior in important stochastic and quantum field models. This part of the proposal is also\r\nessential for  testing the random matrix predictions in number theory.  Proposed study of the Painlev\\'e - type universalities and the families of special Painlev\\'e functions has  direct relation to enumerative topology and string theory. Success in  achievement of the proposal's goals will  have a notable impact on  research in all these areas.",
