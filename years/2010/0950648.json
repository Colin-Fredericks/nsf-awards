 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nPhotosynthesis, the production of sugars from water and carbon dioxide, takes place in plant chloroplasts and drives all life on our planet. The chloroplasts are also needed for the production of the oxygen that we breathe, and additionally make nitrogen and sulfur compounds necessary for plant growth and a healthy plant-based diet. Iron deficiency limits plant growth because iron is available only at very low levels in soils and iron is essential for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis requires numerous proteins, many of which are dependent upon iron-sulfur clusters for proper protein function.  This project aims to study how the machinery that assembles iron-sulfur clusters in chloroplasts is regulated. The integration of (1) sulfur and iron metabolism and their regulation and (2) iron-sulfur cluster assembly will get special attention in this project. The regulatory roles of plant-specific proteins that function in iron-sulfur cluster assembly will be delineated. This collaborative research additionally seeks to explore how selenium, which is similar to sulfur yet toxic, interferes with essential sulfur metabolism in chloroplasts.  Moreover, the role of specific iron-sulfur cluster-related proteins in selenium metabolism will be analyzed. An interdisciplinary approach involving a combination of biochemistry, genetics and plant physiology in the model plant Arabidopsis will be employed. New analysis methods for the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in vivo will be developed. These collaborative studies will provide much-needed insights into the mechanisms and regulation of assembly of the photosynthetic machinery in plants. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\n\r\nThis research involves collaboration between Coastal Carolina University, a primarily undergraduate institution with 18% minority enrollment, and Colorado State University. The project will train several undergraduate students, a graduate student, and a post-doctoral fellow. Undergraduate students at CCU will be engaged and trained in cutting edge research methods. The project directly involves students in a larger undergraduate course in the excitement of hypothesis-driven research in a unique and innovative part of the project, which integrates classroom teaching and research, thereby increasing scientific understanding of a large group of students. Iron is limiting to crop growth in many environments; selenium contamination is increasingly problematic. Therefore, the results of the collaborative project will also have direct implications for agriculture, biomass production, the production of fortified foods, and the environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSelenium is a naturally occurring mineral that is required by humans for survival.  Additionally, selenium compounds have anti-carcinogenic properties, and diets enriched in selenium may be beneficial.  In contrast, plants do not have a requirement for selenium, however, crops provide most of the dietary selenium to humans.  Thus, crops with elevated levels of selenium might provide nutritional and health benefits. However, excessive uptake of selenium in plants can be toxic and restrict growth.  The long-held view is that selenium toxicity occurs when it becomes misincorporated into protein, thereby affecting protein and cellular function.\n\nThe major goal of this research was to determine the mode of selenium toxicity in the plant Arabidopsis, a valuable model-organism among the plant biology community.  To meet this challenge, a plant with a mutation in the APR gene was grown on selenium and compared to control plants that were genetically unaltered.  Selenium severely restricted the growth of the APR mutant plants.  Intriguingly, the amount of selenium minsincorporated into protein in the APR mutant was lower compared to control plants.  This suggests that selenium has an additional mode of toxicity, and challenges the paradigm that selenium toxicity is caused solely by its incorporation into protein.  Increased selenium toxicity in the APR mutant was ultimately explained by the observed increase in reactive superoxide, which decreased the antioxidant glutathione.  Therefore, future efforts to elevate antioxidant levels in plants might alleviate selenium toxicity.  This finding could have implications to plant breeders who wish to create new varieties of crops with elevated levels of selenium without signs of toxicity.\n\nThese discoveries were made primarily by undergradatue students at Coastal Carolina University who performed collaborative research at Colorado State University.  Lastly, NSF-support facilitated the development of a new plant biology class and bolstered the scientific equipment used to train students at Coastal Carolina University.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/09/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas Van Hoewyk"
