 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\nThis project is establishing a remotely accessible laboratory at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) to improve the computer networking curriculum in both the electrical engineering and computer science departments.  The laboratory is using the OPNET simulation tool and allows students to perform large scale networking experiments remotely.  A senior level electrical engineering course and a senior level computer engineering course are being revised to use the new laboratory.  The laboratory is also being integrated into a virtual classroom based on MediaSite streaming technology to provide remote instruction and support to students.   The new laboratory and revised courses are using the Collaborative Project Based Learning model (CPBL), developed with previous NSF funding, to improve student achievement with an emphasis on students from underrepresented groups.  The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an independent evaluator.  The evaluation plan is designed to establish the quality of the materials and to ensure the project goals are met.    The projects results are being disseminated through conferences and journal publications.  Further, all of the project's products, including class notes, video tutorials, lab manuals, and guidelines for instructors on how to implement CPBL, are being made available for free download from the project website.  The project website has different portals for students and instructors so they can access different sets of materials and is being connected to the NSF National Science Digital Library (NSDL).",
