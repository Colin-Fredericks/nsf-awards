 "awd_abstract_narration": "A set of experiments will be performed that use atomic interference for precision measurements.  In atom interferometry, the quantum mechanical wave that describes an atom is split into two components that are separated in space.  When the two components are later recombined, the result encodes information about the atom's environment.  The project will investigate using interference to improve measurements of acceleration, rotation, and gravity, with the goal of improving sensor technology for inertial navigation and underground detection.   The project will also explore the use of interferometry to detect and count single photons, which could be useful for implementing or attacking various types of quantum communication schemes.\r\n\r\nThis work will have broad impact in a variety of areas.  Two graduate students will be supported and the experiments performed will likely form the basis of their PhD dissertations.  These students will receive training in advanced scientific techniques and will be well-prepared for a productive career in research.  The project could also have significant technological and social relevance due to the  growing importance of inertial sensing and quantum communication in commercial and national security applications.",
