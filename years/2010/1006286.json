 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: Many currently studied spintronics devices involve spin injection from ferromagnetic materials into nonmagnetic semiconductors. Recent studies show that significant diffusion occurs when Mn and Fe containing ferromagnetic metals are grown on GaAs or Si. There are also recent reports showing evidence of spin scattering after spin-polarized carriers are injected into nonmagnetic structures. It is therefore important to investigate this problem systematically, so that the analysis of injection results can be improved. This project focuses on diffusion of magnetic ions in the most studied systems, namely Fe/GaAs, FeCo/GaAs, MnAs/GaAs and GaMnAs/GaAs, and on selected structures involving silicon. The samples are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Diffusion profiles are determined using time-of-flight second ion mass spectroscopy and cross sectional scanning tunneling microscopy. The effect of diffused magnetic ions on spin injection is primarily determined with spin light emitting diode structures, which have been effective in determining the level of spin polarization of the injected electrons. The study is designed to provide quantitative information concerning the profile of diffused magnetic ions in nonmagnetic semiconductors, and their effect on spin injection. By examining diffusion as a function of temperature through annealing, one is able to put upper limits on growth and device processing temperatures. The project also explores the possibility of suppressing diffusion processes for the magnetic ions.\r\nNon-technical: This scientific work could have a significant impact on the development of future generations of information technology. It addresses a common issue that exists in most studies of spin effects involving transport of spin polarized currents from one material to another. This would include studies of spin light emitting diodes, spin lasers, spin valves and other more complicated spin-logic devices that involve ferromagnetic materials. The project also contributes to training the next generation of scientists by adding another venue to provide interdisciplinary training to students for the three investigators who have a long history of jointly advising graduate students in physics and chemistry. In addition, the project involves outreach to the Native American Magnet School (K-8) in Buffalo and engages, at an early stage, Native American and African American students in sciences and engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            This research addresses an issue common to modern materials science, but greatly understudied.  Most materials and structures of current interest involve physically combining different materials into one structure, which may be conductors, semiconductors, and magnetic materials, etc.  When such materials are physically connected to each other, atoms in different materials involved will always move from one to another, at degrees that can be either negligible or significant.  The work carried out in this project involved a specific combination, i.e., magnetic materials (mostly MnAs) and semiconductors (GaAs, InAs and their closely related alloys).  By combining the two groups of materials, one can form what is called spin-LEDs.  Electrons have two fundamental properties.  One is the charge that it carries and the other is a spin associated with every electron.  The purpose is to make use of the electron spin that had not been used for electronic operations until very recently.   To do so, one needs to align the spins so that they can be recognized (or detected) by external and macroscopic means. Some magnetic materials, and in this case MnAs, can be used for this purpose.  However, Mn is known to move in GaAs and InAs at very high rate, making it impossible to keep the properties of the materials before being combined.  Diffusion is typically random, and is in almost all cases detrimental to device properties.  The goal of this study is to find ways to minimize the movement of Mn (referred to as Mn diffusion), so that the combination of materials will behave in a way that we expect without Mn diffusion.  To this end, we were able to fabricate MnAs/GaAs based spin-LEDs operating in the near infrared and MnAs/InAs in the far infrared of the optical spectrum.  These LEDs showed minimal diffusion of Mn, making it possible for us to achieve the highest efficiency of spin injection in both cases.  In addition, we were able to characterize the diffusion behavior of Mn in such device structures and related structures. \n\n \n\n            Our findings should have a significant impact on the development of future generations of information technology.  It addresses a common issue that exists in most studies of spin effects involving transport of electron spin currents from one material to another, a critical ingredient for most of the envisioned devices using electron spins.  This project contributed to the training of the next generation of scientists by providing interdisciplinary training to students and postdoctoral researchers.  In addition, the program involved outreach to the Native American Magnet School (K-8) in Buffalo and engaged, at an early stage, under privileged Native American and African American students in sciences and engineering.  Specifically, this involved regularly going to the school to help students, having students coming over to our labs for exposure to modern scientific research, and training their teacher in research, such that she can better translate what happens in our laboratories to her students.  This has made a significant difference in their performance in standardized state tests, among other things that are not always easy to quantify. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hong Luo"
