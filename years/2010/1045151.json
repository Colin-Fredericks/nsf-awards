 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this research is to further develop, apply, and analyze a \r\ncomputational tool that can be used to examine the transport tendencies along \r\nthe U.S. East Coast including Florida, Georgia, and both Carolinas as they \r\nrelate to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The central piece of this \r\ncomputational tool will be the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic \r\nmodel. ADCIRC is a finite element model for solving time?dependent, free \r\nsurface circulation and transport problems in two? and three?dimensions. \r\nExisting finite element meshes of the region will be further developed to \r\nprovide an unprecedented level of resolution and physical detail, including \r\ndetailed coverage of coastal rivers and lagoons, tidal creeks, the Atlantic \r\nIntracoastal Waterway, and tidally flooded marshes. The ability to accurately \r\nsimulate the tidal dynamics of this region, as well as hurricane storm surge, \r\nwill be coupled with recent and ongoing development of the transport \r\ncapabilities of the ADCIRC model using discontinuous Galerkin methods. The \r\nintegration and further development of these three key components, i.e., the \r\nhigh-resolution finite element meshes, the ability to accurately simulate \r\ntidal and storm surge dynamics, and robust, mass-conserving transport \r\nalgorithms, will provide a powerful computational tool that will be used to \r\nsimulate the transport tendencies of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill along the \r\nU.S. East Coast.\r\n\r\nThe Deepwater Horizon oil spill began on April 20, 2010 as a result of an oil \r\nwell blowout that caused an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore \r\ndrilling platform located forty miles southeast off the Louisiana coast. A \r\nmajor and immediate concern related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is the \r\npossibility of the oil slick reaching the Loop Current ? a warm ocean current \r\nthat enters the Gulf of Mexico flowing northward through the Yucatan Strait \r\nand that exits flowing east through the Florida Straits continuing northward \r\nalong the east coast of Florida as the Gulf Stream. Oil entering the Loop \r\nCurrent would eventually be transported far afield to the Atlantic Ocean where \r\nthe presence of large-scale eddies that separate from the western edge of the \r\nGulf Stream have the potential to carry oil toward the U.S. East Coast. There \r\nis additional concern regarding the transport of oil that may occur during the \r\nupcoming Atlantic Hurricane Season, which has been forecasted by NOAA to be an \r\n?active to extremely active? hurricane season. The transport of oil towards \r\nthe U.S. East Coast ? by means of reaching the Loop Current or from the onset \r\nof a hurricane ? would obviously have a major detrimental impact on the \r\ncoastal environment, severely damaging their beaches and coastal wetlands, \r\nwhich serve as critical habitats to the fish and wildlife. The primary \r\nobjective of this proposal is to provide a computational tool that will be \r\nused to help analyze and assess possible damage from the Deepwater Horizon oil \r\nspill along the U.S. East Coast including Florida, Georgia, and both Carolinas.\r\nSpecifically, the fate and transport of oil spill remnants (e.g., tar\r\nballs) entrained in Gulf Stream eddies and feeding the U.S. East Coast will be \r\nmodeled along the shelf and into the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and \r\nestuarine systems. Using available data sources, simulations will be performed \r\nto ultimately identify areas especially susceptible to receiving transported \r\noil and likely areas of deposition.  The model and results will also be \r\ntransferable to other regions of the Gulf of Mexico.",

The two central components of this modeling system are the ADCIRC (ADvanced CIRCulation) and ADMESH (ADvanced MESH) modeling tools, which were further developed and applied for this specific scenario under this project.\n\nADCIRC is a computational model that has been extensively used to model flows for processes such as tides, storm surge, and flows within ocean basins, on shelves, in bays, through inlets,  and in rivers. An oil transport model was added to ADCIRC to simulate the fate and transport of oil due to different physical forcings, including tides, steady and seasonal constituents, ocean surface currents, winds, and riverine inflows.

The creation of such a mesh is typically a very time-consuming and user-intensive process. To address this issue, an advanced, automatic mesh generation tool, called ADMESH, was further developed to quickly and automatically generate high-quality computatio..."
