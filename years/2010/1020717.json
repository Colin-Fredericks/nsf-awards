 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mothers can influence the traits of their offspring through mechanisms beyond simple genetic transmission, and such maternal effects can serve as adaptations to local environmental conditions.  However, it is not known whether maternal effects contribute broadly to adaptive evolution.  This project will evaluate whether maternal effects contribute to population differentiation using the plant Campanulastrum americanum as a model system.  The research will integrate observational and manipulative field studies conducted across a latitudinal gradient to determine what portions of variation among populations in life-span are due to maternal genetic variation, within-generation genetic variation, or a combination of the two.  \r\n\r\nEffective response to environmental change requires improved understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that underlie adaptation in natural populations.  This research will evaluate whether maternal effects have a larger role in adaptive evolution than is currently recognized.  This research includes study of flowering time, which is of particular interest because broad-scale patterns indicate earlier flowering in response to contemporary warming climates.  The project will increase understanding of the potential evolution of flowering time in warming climates.  The project includes development of educational presentations and exhibits for the general public, as well as training of undergraduates, graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher in both scientific research and public outreach.",
