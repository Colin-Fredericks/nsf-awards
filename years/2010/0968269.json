 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vacuum (Casimir) energy in quantum field theory is of interest in the physics community and its connections with some mathematical topics in spectral theory and asymptotics of differential operators have recently become clearer. Thus this collaboration between physicists and mathematicians is an effective approach to further progress. The investigators intend to build on the results of their previous collaboration to make progress in two areas: (1) Gravitational significance of vacuum energy: The previous work has demonstrated that vacuum energy gravitates just as does any other form of energy. For plane geometries the divergences renormalize the masses of the material bodies confining the field. This analysis will be extended to general geometries. This requires the mathematical theory of the asymptotics of (Schwartz) distributions as well as sound physics. (2) Improved calculational methods: In the presence of curved surfaces, higher-order corrections are hard to calculate in classical-path analyses of vacuum energy and eigenvalue distribution. In the presence of sharp edges or corners (other than right angles) the semiclassical methods break down quite seriously (diffraction). The project will develop and apply more fundamental and accurate analyses, known as multiple reflection or multiple scattering. Previous success in treating the forces between dielectric bodies by multiple scattering will be extended and applications to practical configurations such as noncontact gears and multilayer surfaces are being pursued. Also, the multiple-reflection expansion will be used for accurate calculation of vacuum energy density and pressure near curved surfaces and edges and corners.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the project stems partly from its interdisciplinary nature. The subject not only combines physics and mathematics, but also combines topics within physics and within mathematics that are ripe for productive interaction. Vacuum energy is relevant both to new nanotechnological devices and to cosmological issues (dark energy). Mathematically, the connection between periodic-orbit theory and vacuum energy has only recently been exploited, and the implications of vacuum energy for spectral theory have barely been explored. Undergraduate and graduate student research assistants from both physics and mathematics will be recruited and their educations will be enhanced, and a diverse student population is being trained. The project will also foster future research interactions with other fields (gravitational implications, nanotechnology, quantum graphs, spectral geometry).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEugene Wigner famously observed that mathematics is \"unreasonably \neffective\" in physics and other natural sciences.  Both detailed \npredictions and conceptual understanding are obtained from simple \nmathematical models that are always approximations to reality.  \nHowever, overreliance on a favorite mathematical formulation may \nlead to sterility or just empirical inadequacy.  We must \nconstantly check whether we have fulfilled Einstein's \ninstructions to make things \"as simple as possible but not \nsimpler.\"\n\nThe principal physical phenomenon addressed by this project is \nthe Casimir interaction, an attraction between bodies that is \nattributed to the influence of their positions on the energy of \nthe electromagnetic field in its vacuum state, where no real \nphotons are present.  In the simplest model, where the bodies are \nperfectly conducting and the electric field is replaced by a \nscalar field, the energy density and pressure in the field are \ncalculable from the \"cylinder kernel\", a Green function \nassociated with the equation of motion of the field; this \nfunction forms a natural fourth member of the family of Green \nfunctions containing the more familiar fundamental solutions of \nthe heat, wave, and Schrodinger equations related to the \nparticular field equation and geometry under study.  Total energy  is rather easily calculated but is plagued by \"divergences\" -- \napparent infinities that must be argued away.  The physical \nreasons for these unwelcome terms, and the judgment on various \nstrategies for getting rid of them, should be sought in (more \ndifficult) calculations of energy density at every point.  A \ndistribution of energy that integrates to infinity may locally be \nperfectly plausible on physical grounds, and a modification of \nthe model (making the boundaries less than perfectly conducting \nin some way) can provide a physically acceptable improvement in \nthe theory.\n\nThis project has been largely concerned with responding to the \nobservation that rendering the divergences finite by ad hoc \ndamping of the contributions of high frequencies yields formulas \nfor energy density and pressure that are inconsistent with a \nfundamental aspect of conservation of energy called the \n\"principle of virtual work\".  This problem, which was totally \ninvisible in the global calculations of total energy, means that \nleaving this \"ultraviolet cutoff\" finite gives results that are \nnot acceptable as a serious model.  The project has made progress \ntoward a remedy in two directions:  replacing the sharp boundary \nby a \"soft\" or spread-out one, and introducing the cutoffs in a \nmanner that treats different dimensions in space-time in similar ways (instead of singling out time as special).  On the other \nhand, when the cutoff is regarded purely as a mathematical device \nthat should be taken to infinity at the end of a calculation, we \nhave shown (in the simplest situations) that the results are \nconsistent and plausible, using techniques of distribution \ntheory.\n\nAn improved understanding of the pressure anomaly having been \nachieved, it was natural to look for a similar situation in the \ntorque related to angular motion of the walls of a wedge.  \nSurprisingly, it appears that there is a torque anomaly that has \nnothing to do with the cutoff used to tackle divergences, but \nappears in the finite values of energy density and pressure for \nthe wedge geometry.  (These formulas have been known for decades, \nbut the discrepancy was not noticed until now.)  The resolution \nof this puzzle presumably has some relation to the behavior of \nthe field quantities near the vertex of the wedge, where a \ncertain divergence remains that is not completely handled by \nconventional cutoff procedures.  Global energy calculations in a \nsector with the vertex region removed do not show any \ntorque anomaly.  Full understanding will require local \ncalculations of energy density and pressure, which are difficult \nand still under way.\n\n\nThe mathematical tec..."
