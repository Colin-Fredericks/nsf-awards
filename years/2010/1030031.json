 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Peter K. Norquest (University of Arizona) and Dr. Sean S. Downey (Stanford University and University of Arizona) will undertake research on the effects of community-level language interactions on prehistoric migration patterns in Nusa Tenggara, a large region in eastern Indonesia. The history of this region remains obscure because contact between Papuan-speakers and Austronesian-speakers (circa 4,500 BP) and subsequent drift has since obscured many of the linguistic criteria which historical linguists typically use to reconstruct migrations. Recent developments in computational linguistic can help overcome some of these obstacles. The researchers will integrate two independent methodologies and improve on them by including both local and regional scales of analysis. Thus this project will produce new methodologies that can be used by other researchers concerned with problems that involve historical reconstructions of population movements where historical records are lacking.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will investigate the relationship between community-level and regional-level language patterns by analyzing a database of words collected from numerous locations across Nusa Tenggara. Two computational analyses will be used, each proven accurate at a different spatial scale, and these will be complemented by the more traditional \"comparative method\" in which a trained historical linguist manually classifies languages based on the phonological and morphological differences in their lexicons. The results of these analyses are expected to shed light on how linguistic interaction among people in neighboring communities have affected language patterns that are observed in the wake of large-scale demographic transitions. \r\n\r\nThe research is significant because it will clarify a poorly understood aspect of the last great human migration prior to the modern era: the Austronesian expansion from Mainland China into Indonesia and ultimately the colonization of islands across the Pacific Ocean. The methodology for integrating computational linguistic analysis across scales that will be developed during the course of this project will be applicable for reconstructing the demographic history of indigenous populations wherever historical records are unavailable.",
