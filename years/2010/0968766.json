 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to study the deformation K-theory of a discrete group and relate this to the topological K-theory of its classifying space.  This is analogous to the Atiyah-Segal theorem for compact Lie groups, with deformation K-theory playing the role of the complex representation ring.  The PI believes that these calculations will shed light on the topology of the stable moduli space of flat connections for surfaces as well as Casson invariants of three manifolds.  \r\n\r\nRepresentations of groups have been important throughout much of mathematics as well as in physics and other sciences.   The PI proposes to extend our understanding from finite and compact Lie groups to infinite discrete groups, using a variant of earlier approaches which relate representations to topological invariants. These results would add to our knowledge of surfaces as well as manifolds of dimensions three. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            This award resulted in important findings in three related fields: Yang-Mills theory, stable representation theory, and algebraic K-theory.  Mathematicians and physicists have studied Yang-Mills theory, a branch of mathematical physics, extensively over the last thirty years.  The PI used Yang-Mills theory to study the stable representation theory of surface groups, resulting in several new results and opening avenues for future study.  Representation theory focuses on the study of algebraic objects via their matrix models, and stable representation theory brings two new ideas to this subject: first, geometry is brought into play by considering continuous deformations of matrix models; and second, the dimensions of the matrices are allowed to increase without bound.  Algebraic K-theory can be viewed as a type of generalized representation theory, with applications to the geometry and topology of manifolds.\n\nThe PI\u00c6s work on Yang-Mills theory provided new, explicit calculations and new foundational results.

Mathematicians, chemists, and physicists have studied crystallographic groups and their matrix representations for over a hundred years.
