 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some studies predict that climate change over the next two centuries will lead to dramatic forest retreat at the prairie-forest border.  Such a rapid retreat would require both the death of established, long-lived trees and a failure of new tree seedling establishment, but not enough is known about these two processes to be confident in predictions how the prairie-forest boundary will change. How the dynamics of this boundary change has important implications for the health of the timber industry, for recreational opportunities, and for ecosystem services such as carbon storage.\r\n\r\nTo gain a better understanding of how tree mortality and establishment may respond to climate change, data will be gathered at six sites along a 250 mile transect crossing the prairie-forest margin in Minnesota. The transect will span a summer temperature gradient of 3.8\u00ba C (7\u00ba F) and an annual rainfall gradient of 23 cm (9 inches). Tree ring samples will be used to relate adult tree growth and survival to carbon dioxide and climate. Deer and seed predator exclosures will help separate the impacts of herbivores and climate on seedling success. Data from the transect will be used to parameterize new statistical models of forest growth along the prairie-forest border at the decade to centuries scale in the low-fire, high deer environments likely to prevail into the foreseeable future. \r\n\r\nSixteen undergraduate students will develop their scientific skills and credentials as research assistants on this project, and additional students at the University of Minnesota, Morris (UMM) will have an opportunity to participate via their coursework.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe prairie-forest ecotone divides the prairie of central Canada and the United States from the deciduous forest to the east.  The location of the ecotone has moved back and forth since the last ice age in response to changing climates.  For example, during portions of the last 10,000 years, the land that is now the state of Minnesota was almost entirely forested.  At other times, prairie grasses dominated.  The response of the prairie-forest ecotone in the face of current climate change is important for a variety of industries, including forestry and tourism. \n\nThe climate at the prairie-forest ecotone is warming and drying.  A simple model would predict rapid forest retreat as a result.  In many places, however, forests are expanding into the prairie.  Climate is just one of several known forcings that act on forests growing at the prairie?s edge.  For instance, suppression of fire makes it easier for forests to establish.  Conversely, rising deer populations make it harder for forests to regenerate.  Predictions of rapid climate-driven retreat of ecotonal forests comprised of potentially long-lived individual trees are based on two (often unacknowledged) assumptions:\n\n1) Existing adult trees will die off as a result of a changing climate, and\n\n2) There will be a recruitment failure so that new seedlings can?t replace dying adult trees.\n\nIn this project, we carried out fieldwork and data analysis to address the likelihood that both assumptions will hold true.  To do this, we began with a muli-pronged fieldwork plan, focused on three native tree species and a ubiquitous invasive tree.  First, in 2011, we established 72 large plots to monitor adult tree growth and survival spread across six sites along a north-south transect covering 250 miles in western Minnesota. Data from these plots were combined with extensive study of adult tree growth patterns using tree rings to get insight into the importance of climate to adult tree growth and survival.  Also in 2011, we built 72 small deer exlosures and 72 matching control plots, giving us 144 seedling plots in all.  In 2012, we transplanted several thousand seedlings into the seedling plots. We used a sensor network to monitor light and climate and also measured soil nutrients and sampled for invasive earthworms.  Half the seedlings were harvested in 2016, while the rest remain for long-term monitoring.   \n\nOn the question of adult tree survival, our results suggest very little threat of mortality from a changing climate for native bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), but substantial impact of climate on the performance of sugar maple (Acer saccharum).  Somewhat surprisingly, our results indicate strong moisture sensitivity for the ubiquitous invasive tree European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), which may limit its relative success in the future. \n\nOn the question of the regeneration of new trees, in the initial grant proposal we noted that there is currently a severe recruitment failure for native tree species growing at the prairie-forest ecotone in Minnesota.  Our results suggest that climate matters some, but that the overwhelming driver of this failure is deer herbivory.  For experimental seedlings protected from deer herbivory, native species grew robustly and survived well, outperforming the invasive European buckthorn.  We also find that light availability, the density of competing seedlings, invasive earthworms, and soil nutrients all also contribute significantly to seedling growth and survival.  Overall, climate is less important than deer and light, but more important to predictions of seedling growth and survival than the other factors we studied.\n\nThere is a much interest in how the extent of the forest biome will change over the next few decades.  Some models predict, for instance, that the state of Minnesota, which is currently two-third forest, will be all prairie by 2100.  Our results suggest, however, that adult trees are likely to be resilient in the face of climate change and that such rapid forest movement is unlikely.  Native tree seedling recruitment, on the other hand, is imperiled, but that is a function much more of increasing deer herbivory than climate.  Regeneration of invasive European buckthorn is strong, but a warming, drying climate may threaten the recruitment of that species.  If climate and herbivores combine to effectively eliminate all tree regeneration at the praire-forest ecotone, the forest will eventually retreat when the current adult trees reach the end of their lives. \n\nIn addition to the scientific results, this project has provided important opportunities to undergraduate research assistants.  Tweny-five undergraduate students directly participated in data collection and analysis, including 15 women and six students of color.  Students participated in weekly lab groups and every student has been involved in the preparation of at least one research poster and one on-campus oral presentation.  As of October 2016, twelve of the 25 students have presented results at national scientific meetings.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/17/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter H Wyckoff"
