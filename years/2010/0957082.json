 "awd_abstract_narration": "While areas of the US such as California and the East coast have major\r\nmedical centers near every population center, there are many areas,\r\neven in developed countries, with a widely dispersed patient\r\npopulation with significant obstacles to advanced medical care.\r\nVictims of large scale natural disasters and battlefield casualties\r\nalso lack state of the art care.  Telesurgery could potentially meet\r\nthese needs. There is a growing interest in computational research on\r\nintelligent telesurgery.  Today's telesurgery systems do not integrate\r\nwith medical imaging or have intelligent functions to assist the\r\nsurgeon. This project is building seven teleoperated  surgical robot\r\nand surgeon-interface systems powerful and precise enough to support\r\nresearch on advanced robotic surgery techniques at seven major\r\nresearch universities.   University of Washington and University of\r\nCalifornia Santa Cruz are building the seven robots and will\r\ndistribute them to Harvard, Johns Hopkins, University of Nebraska,\r\nU.C. Berkeley, and UCLA.   When completed, the seven research lab\r\nrobots will be networked together for sharing of software,\r\ninteroperability, and on-line telesurgery experiments.\r\n\r\nImpact\r\n\r\nThe results of this project will enable a network of  researchers to\r\nprototype advanced surgical robotics techniques, and evaluate them in\r\nrealistic contexts including appropriate animal procedures.  Besides\r\nnew and less invasive cures, such a technology can provide easier\r\naccess to care in remote parts of the US, and the developing world.\r\n The seven cooperating labs, and external partners will be able to\r\ninterconnect their systems, share modules of software, and replicate\r\neach others experiments.",
