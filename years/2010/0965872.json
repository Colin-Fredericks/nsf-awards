 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n S-STEM scholarships are being awarded to a cohort of 24 full-time students in biotechnology or environmental science associate degree programs. Students are recruited from high schools, nonprofit organizations, and the college's student population; selected based on financial need and academic talent, and; assisted by support infrastructures including a learning community, ongoing monitoring, added counseling, problem-based learning projects, industry contact, and internships (an existing degree component). \r\n\r\nObjectives \r\n1. Enhance and increase student support services via curricular and extracurricular activities; \r\n2. Improve academic support through Problem Based Learning (PBL) and Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL); \r\n3. Increase the number of educated and skilled employees in biotechnology and environmental science; \r\n4. Provide an internship in local industry and academic and governmental labs; \r\n5. Provide assistance with job placement or career advancement; \r\n6. Increase student networking through a learning community between the two degree programs. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nAcademic Models: \r\nIn Problem Based Learning (PBL), students work in small groups to solve a structured curriculum-related problem. Students systematically define what information is needed and what resources are available to solve a problem. As proficiency increases, PBL activities become more complex to reflect realistic situations with few clues. \r\nIn Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL), a learning model where students work in teams to solve structured problems under a trained peer leader, large numbers of students are engaged through both course material and interaction among study groups. Evaluation of a 10-year study in 12 institutions shows that the PLTL approach improved performance and retention, communication, course satisfaction, and interest in pursuing further study in science. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\nCommunication across two related disciplines, biotechnology and environmental science, and the implementation of PBL activities, can serve as a general model for supporting engagement and success in other academic and workforce preparation fields. Also, by eliminating economic barriers for financially needy, talented students, diversity in the sciences is improved.\r\n",
