 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Study of Arctic Change (ISAC) project office, located in Stockholm, Sweden, is dedicated to the coordination of international efforts complementary to the themes of the US SEARCH program.  It offers a venue for continuing and emerging national science efforts to exchange ideas and visions for an Arctic Observing System, integrated pan-Arctic modeling, and climate change mitigation strategies.  It also includes amongst its broad scientific goals free and open sharing of datasets and translation of natural scientific results into a social context through outreach to Arctic communities and networks of social scientists.  It has produced an internationally-reviewed science plan outlining ISAC objectives and is now moving into an implementation phase based on that plan.  \r\n\r\nIn the next three years, ISAC will expands its role in the Arctic, developing memoranda of understanding with Asian Arctic countries while strengthening collaborative agreements amongst American, Canadian, and European partners.  ISAC will host several workshops dedicated to observing, modeling, and responding to Arctic change, including the assimilation and distribution of socio-economic datasets.  The ISAC executive director will have a visible presence at several international conferences, where Arctic indigenous communities and early career researchers will be engaged, as well as participate in meetings of other high-level international Arctic groups, such as the Arctic Ocean Science Board and International Arctic Science Committee.  Relevant news and activities related to these efforts will be disseminated on the ISAC project office website through a newsletter to the broader Arctic research community. \r\n",
