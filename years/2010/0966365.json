 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tiospaye in Science is a scholarship program that aims to increase the number of American Indian students graduating from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT) with bachelor's degrees in science.  The targeted degree programs are chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, and physics.\r\n\r\nTiospaye is a Lakota word meaning 'extended family'; in this scholarship program, the extended family of science supports American Indian students in their academic, professional, cultural, and social activities.  The financial support through the scholarships in combination with the web of support facilitated through one-on-one and one-on-small group contact with the science extended family serve as strong anchors to increase the pathways to success for American Indian students in science.  The science extended family includes the scholarship recipients as well as the other students, staff, faculty, administrators, alumni/alumnae, employers, the community, student family members, tribal members, and tribal college partners - most notably Oglala Lakota College.  Tiospaye in Science also partners with Tiospaye in Engineering, another scholarship program at SDSMT.\r\n\r\nThrough Tiospaye in Science, fifteen scholarships are being awarded to academically talented and financially needy students with a special emphasis on recruiting Native Americans that are members of federally recognized tribes, graduates of tribal high schools, or transfers from tribal colleges or universities.  To ensure success for scholarship recipients, the program:\r\n\r\n     1.  Recruits academically talented students with financial need and a commitment to a science career. \r\n     2.  Retains these students in an environment that promotes academic and professional success, while supporting the students socially and in their cultural traditions.\r\n     3.  Places these students in appropriate employment or further education through programs emphasizing career planning and professional options.",

The PI traveled to all nine South Dakota Indian Reservations to a total of 18 high schools, as well as several border high schools and a few high school in neighboring states.

In addition to South Dakota, scholars came from Arizona, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, and Nebraska. Majors represented were Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Mathematics, and Physics. In addition to the Principal Investigator (Engineering Professor), the staff included a mentor, student assistants, and tutors. The management team consisted of the Co-PIs, consisting of faculty from Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. The Tiospaye in Science Program was operated in parallel with our NSF S-STEM Tiospaye in Engineering Program. Scholars were awarded scholarships of up to $8000 per year depending on their FAFSA unmet need. The scholarships were renewable annually if scholars maintained a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5, made adequate progress toward their BS degree, and participated at an acceptable level in program activities. Scholars were required to meet with the PI at least once per month and the program mentor at least weekly. Scholars were required to attend weekly study recitation sessions with the mentor and bi-weekly professional lunch meetings. Topics at these meetings included study skills, testing tips, financial aid, career planning (summer internships, co-operative education, and permanent positions), graduate school opportunities, Native elders, counseling services, summer research opportunities (including NSF REUs), assessment activities, etc. Scholars were required to meet with their academic advisor at least once per semester and register for classes up to two semesters in advance. Scholars were expected to register for cohorted sections in College Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus I/II/III, College Chemistry, and University Physics courses. The PI and mentor worked with scholars to develop their resume and update them at least once per semester. Scholars were expected to join and participate (at least moderately) in the American Indian Science &amp; Engineering Society (AISES), as well as a professional society in their department. The university provided a Tiospaye study room, which was accessible to scholars, not only on school days, but also most evenings and weekends.
