The aim of this conference is to  stimulate cooperative research among group theorists who are using varied approaches to the study of groups.   Algebraic, analytic and geometric approaches  to group theory are robust areas of mathematical research.  The conference will highlight notable recent achievements in these areas, presented in a manner that will be accessible to researchers with adjacent interests.   There  will be an emphasis on particular areas where all of these approaches have been successful, such as the mathematical theory of buildings.\r\n\r\nGroup theory is a cornerstone of abstract algebra, one of the primary branches of mathematics.  The goal of this conference is to stimulate cooperative work among researchers who are using different approaches to the study of groups.  An emphasis will be placed on gathering an unusually broad mix of mathematicians, with many different subfields of mathematics being represented by a diverse group from senior faculty to graduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major activity supported by this grant was the conference Approaches to Group Theory: Using Algebraic, Analytic, and Geometric Tools in the Study of Groups, held at Cornell University October 9-11, 2010.\n\nGroup theory is the mathematical study of symmetries.  Obvious geometric symmetries arising in the study of crystal structures in chemistry furnished an early impetus for the study of groups.  However, the careful study of the much subtler symmetries of algebraic or differential equations proved even more fruitful --- it furnished deep insights into the nature of the solutions, via Galois theory (in the case of algebraic equations) and Lie theory (in the case of differential equations).  Harmonic analysis, inspired by Fourier's study of the equation governing heat flow, is also a direct outgrowth of this circle of ideas.\n\nResearch in group theory has burgeoned in recent years, as the development of many new tools and ideas has widened the scope of applications to many disparate areas of mathematics and the sciences.\n\nThe aim of this conference was to stimulate cooperative research among group theorists using techniques from three very different areas of mathematics, namely algebra, analysis, and geometry, as well as to bring group theorists into direct contact with researchers in other areas who make fundamental use of group theory in their work.  The conference highlighted recent developments by researchers in these fields.  Such cross-fertilization of ideas and methodology has great potential for stimulating further breakthroughs in group theory itself, as well as for generating powerful applications of group theory across the mathematical landscape.\n\nThe conference included plenary lectures by ten of the world's leading researchers in group theory, as well as 18 shorter invited and contributed talks.  The plenary and shorter talks were chosen to represent a balance among the various methods used.  Many other researchers, including established leaders, postdoctoral scholars, and students, joined these speakers for three days of intense mathematical interaction; there were a total of 72 registered participants at the conference.\n\nThe conference provided a congenial, informal setting for the participants to collaborate and to forge connections, resulting in many lively discussions likely to stimulate new research.  The conference also enhanced the representation of more junior mathematicians, as well as members of under-represented groups, in this field.  The organizers were proactive and successful in promoting diversity among both the speakers and participants.\n\nThe grant funds were used exclusively for participant support, and were primarily targeted for use by graduate students and early career mathematicians.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen Vogtmann"
