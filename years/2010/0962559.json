 "awd_abstract_narration": "Between the winter of 2006 and the summer of 2008 prices of the world's four most importat staple food commodities (rice, wheat, corn and soybeans) more than tripled. These four staple crops comprise about 75% of the world's caloric base. This project develops a new methodology to use detailed data about weather and agricultural output to examine how climate change affects food commodity prices and particularly commodity price variability. \r\n\r\nThe project begins with using econometric techniques and detailed data on weather and agricultural output. The data are used to estimate and test a statistical model of a non-linear relationship between weather and output; the results of that model are predictions about the yield variability of the four major staple crops in all major global production regions. The next step uses existing climate change projections to develop sensible predictions for future specific changes in weather patterns, including changes in the mean/average outcome, changes in the variability of climate, and correlation between the different production regions. The results of the first two steps are then combined to give a prediction of how climate change will change the distribution of agricultural yields. \r\n\r\nThe next step is to consider how past weather shocks have affected supply and demand for these staple crops. This information is used to estimate a structural model of supply and demand for each of the four staple crops. Combining this market model with the predicted changes in the distribution of agricultural yields allows the PIs to make predictions about how future climate change will affect commodity prices. The models will also be used to examine the likely effects of changes in government policy and changes in how farmers and commodity traders store crops from year to year. \r\n\r\nThe specifics of the research plan include\r\n\r\nA: Linking weather and yield variability.  The PIs extend their earlier work to examine yield variablility of the four major staple crops throughout the world.\r\n\r\nB: Climate change projections.  The PIs summarize the predictions of various General Circulation Models on (i) mean outcomes; (ii) changes in variability, and (iii) correlation between production regions.  Each one of these three changes in weather patterns would directly influence the distribution of yields.\r\n\r\nC: Predict yield distributions\r\nCombining parts A and B gives revised yield distributions under climate change.  The non linear temperature-yield relationship from part A implies that even a mean increase in temperatures with constant variance could impact yield variability, as would a change in weather variability.  Finally, if weather becomes more (or less) correlated or if the geography of agricultural production becomes more (or less) concentrated, idiosyncratic productions shocks will no longer average out and total world production could become more (or less) variable.\r\n\r\nD: Yield variability and commodity prices.\r\nUsing weather-induced yield shocks as instruments allows the researchers to estimate supply and demand elasticities for the four staple crops.  While randome yield shocks have previously been used to estimate demand elasticities, lagged yield shocks can also be used to identify supply elasticities, as past production shocks are linked to the current period's effort through storage.  With the elasticity estimates the researchers can translate their yield distribution into a distribution of commodity prices.\r\n\r\nE: Simulate the effects of competitive storage and government policies.  \r\nFarmers and commodity traders are likely to resond to changes in production and price variability by adjusting inventory holdings.  Inventories help to attenuate price variability in the face of year-t0-year productions variability.  Inventory adjustments will therefore partly buffer changes in production variability, as could continued expansion of irrigated agriculuture.  On the other hand, export restrictions and other government policies might exaggerate price variability.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project brings economists, agronomists, and environmental scientists together. The results will be useful for guiding both policymakers and farmers as they adjust to future climate change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Four food commodities (corn, wheat, rice, and soybeans) account for 75% of all calories that humans consume worldwide - either directly or indirectly as they are used as feedstock. The United States? accounts for roughly a quarter of the calories produced from those four commodities, making it by far the largest producer.  The market share is largest for corn and soybeans, where US production accounts for 40% of global production.  Prices of the four commodities tripled between 2005 and 2008, leading to widespread media attention.\n \nAs part of this grant we published several articles that examine in further detail the drivers of food commodity prices.  We show how bad weather outcomes, especially extreme heat, defined by a variable that measures by how much and for how long temperatures exceed 30C (86F), are a crucial predictor of yields.  We find a comparable relationship both in statistical model of observed yields and weather across the globe and over years, as well as in crop models that are based on plant physiology.  This has strong implications for climate change as the frequency of these extreme temperatures is expected to rise sharply, threatening the caloric base of the food supply of humankind.  While there has been tremendous success in increasing average yields over time, this has come at a cost of higher sensitivity to extreme heat and less drought tolerance.  In other words, higher average yields can be achieved at the cost of a more fragile crops that will lose a larger share of their maximum yield under suboptimal weather conditions.  Climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in suboptimal weather conditions for current growing areas.\n \nAcross the globe, most areas where these four commodities are grown have seen an increase in temperatures over the growing season.  We calculate the predicted decline in global output given the observed temperature trend, i.e., how much lower output was compared to a hypothetical example where we assume the warming trends had not occurred.  Global maize and wheat production declined by 3.8 and 5.5%, respectively. We develop a novel statistical way to identify how quantity changes translate into price changes.  Food commodity prices are roughly 20% higher than what they would have been in case those warming trends had not occurred.  The increase in food commodity prices is roughly equivalent to the price increase due to the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires that corn-based ethanol is used in gasoline.\n \nWhile there are limited solutions to adapting to average higher temperatures that are profitable at current prices, we show that adaptation to an increase in the variance can easily be accomplished through storage.  A calibrated competitive storage model is capable of replicating observed price behavior over the last 40 years.  When we simulate a future with more volatile year-to-year production shock, almost all of it can be buffered through increased storage levels if a change is climatic conditions is anticipated by market participants:  they simple store more.  A crucial ingredient for this to work is that both climate change is anticipated (a model without anticipation leads to much more variable prices) and that governments don?t intervene in the market, e.g., through export or price restrictions, thereby taking away the incentive to store.  While this might limit price spikes in the short-run, it will lead to larger price spikes in the long-run as fewer market participants are willing to store crops.\n \nIn summary, while we found little evidence to adaptation to changes in average temperature over time or across space, there are ample adaptation strategies to changes in the volatility or variance.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wolfram Schlenker"
