 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation?s strategy for 21st century innovation depends explicitly on the creation and effective use of cyberinfrastructure. The National Science Foundation has established a Campus Bridging Task Force to address the broad issues involved in improving campus interactions with cyberinfrastructure. These issues include identifying best practices, promoting interoperability of software across the nation and around the world, suggesting policies for research universities, and identifying solicitations to support this work.\r\n\r\nCyberinfrastructure must be coordinated on campus, regional, and national levels. Researchers, research groups, and campuses must be bridged through virtual organizations and telecollaborations. The Campus Bridging Task Force is charged with investigating practical steps that the US, led by the NSF, can take to create a more effective, better interconnected national cyberinfrastructure. This proposal funds a meeting to be held to coordinate the task force.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this activity is in the identification of important challenges facing the nation's science and engineering research communities, and assembling a group of national leaders in information technology who will be qualified to offer excellent intellectual as well as practical insight on ways to identify best practices and strategies for bridging cyberinfrastructure\r\nfrom the campus level to national collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this activity will result from discussion and suggestions about how to better integrate smaller schools, particularly Minority Serving Institutions, into the national cyberinfrastructure.",
