 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the fundamental nature of artificial nano-structured magnetic systems, where individual nano-sized magnetic elements play the role of \"atoms\" of an artificial \"crystal\".  The interaction between these \"atoms\" can be designed-to-order by choosing the geometrical and magnetic parameters of the \"atoms\", and the magnetic ground state of the system can be controlled in real time by the pulses of bias magnetic field.  The research will lead to the development of novel man-made dynamically controllable magnetic materials for applications in microwave signal processing. Theoretical analytical and numerical efforts are directed towards the creation of a clear fundamental picture of the static and dynamic collective behavior of such materials. The fabrication and experimental efforts are directed towards the development of materials with optimized magnetic parameters that can be used in reciprocal and non-reciprocal on-chip microwave signal processing devices. The US teams from Oakland University (OU) and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) concentrate on theory (analytical and numerical) (OU) and fabrication and characterization of magnetic nano-structures (ANL). The Spanish team from Universidad del Pais Vasco (UPV) works on the theory of magnetic dots in a vortex state and on the measurements of static characteristics of fabricated nano-structures. The Ukrainian team from Kiev National University (KNU) concentrates on microwave experiments.\r\n\r\nThis research of the properties of novel dynamically controlled artificial magnonic materials, combining theory, numerical simulations and cutting-edge experimental techniques, is expected to have a broad impact that extends beyond magnetism to other fields of materials science and electrical engineering. The work will have a transformative effect on the field of microwave magnetic materials, and will lead to the development of a novel class of on-chip signal processing devices compatible with the existing planar semiconductor technology. Significant emphasis is placed on the training of young researchers in the USA and Europe by engaging them in state-of-the-art research in a highly collaborative and international environment. Students and postdoctoral fellows learn modern theoretical and experimental techniques that provide them with the tools for successful careers in science and technology, and will make them highly employable in either academia or industry. Activities include extended inter-group visits of students and senior participants, and the interaction between academia (OU, UPV, and KNU) and a national laboratory (ANL). The project synergistically combines theorists, experimentalists, and fabrication specialists, as necessary for the rapid development of a fundamental understanding and practical applications of the proposed artificial magnetic materials based on arrays of interacting magnetic dots.",
