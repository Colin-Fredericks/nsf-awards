The approach is to utilize ultrafast carrier relaxation in intersubband transitions in wide band gap II-VI semiconductor quantum wells.\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe proposed material systems have the potential to overcome many of the disadvantages associated with the materials currently used for ultrafast all-optical switches. The knowledge gained and the technology developed through the proposed research will not only enrich the spectrum of available materials for photonic devices used in telecommunication networks, but may also lead to new important applications of the proposed materials. In addition to producing devices with better performance, the outcome of the research advances the understanding of material properties of II-VI low-dimensional systems, which may lead to the discovery of new scientific phenomena.\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThe devices based on the proposed materials, if commercialized and implemented, will greatly increase the data transmission rate of telecommunication networks. The proposed research will have a substantial societal impact because multimedia and data communication are now an integral part of daily lives. The proposed research program is also poised to have extensive educational and outreach impact. Particular effort will be devoted to increase the number of students from underrepresented and disadvantaged groups in science and engineering. The students involved in the research will acquire training and knowledge in a competitive field and thus will be better prepared to enter the workforce with highly valued skills.",
