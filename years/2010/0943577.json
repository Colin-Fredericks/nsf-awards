 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistics curricula have required excessive up-front investment in statistical theory, which many quantitatively-capable students in ``big science'' fields initially perceive to be unnecessary.  A training program at Carnegie Mellon will expose students to cross-disciplinary research early, showing them the scientific importance of ideas from statistics and machine learning, and the intellectual depth of the subject. Graduate students will receive instruction and mentored feedback on cross-disciplinary interaction, communication skills, and teaching. Postdoctoral fellows will become productive researchers who understand the diverse roles and responsibilities they will face as faculty or members of a research laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe statistical needs of the scientific establishment are huge, and growing rapidly, making the current rate of workforce production dangerously inadequate.  The Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University will train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in an integrated program that emphasizes the application of statistical and machine learning methods in scientific research. The program will build on existing connections with computational neuroscience, computational biology, and astrophysics.Carnegie Mellon will recruit students from a broad spectrum of quantitative disciplines, with emphasis on computer science.  Carnegie Mellon already has an unusually large undergraduate statistics program. New efforts will strengthen the training of these students, and attract additional highly capable students to be part of the pipeline entering the mathematical sciences.",
