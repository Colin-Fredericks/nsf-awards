 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyanobacteria possess a complex and unique network for carbon metabolism, enabling them to thrive on the minimal nutrients available in aquatic environments. This research develops and applies 13C-assisted metabolic flux analysis tools to study photoautotrophic metabolism in the model cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Cyanothece 51142. The research objectives include: 1) improving GC-MS-based metabolite and isotopomer (isotopic isomer) measurement techniques, 2) developing a dynamic flux model to decipher carbon fluxes and metabolic regulation based on isotopomer distribution in fast-turnover metabolites, 3) applying the flux model for metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria to synthesize butanol via non-fermentative pathways. This research will generate 13C-assisted flux analysis tools to understand enzyme functions and metabolic regulations in cyanobacteria. This study will also develop strains to produce biofuels from carbon dioxide and sunlight.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThis project explores cyanobacterial applications, offering a potential solution to both energy and environmental crises. The 13C-assisted flux analysis tools developed in this project can be used to investigate many other photosynthetic organisms including plants used for commercial agriculture. Furthermore, research and education efforts will be combined through the following: 1) Two biotechnology courses (Bioprocess Laboratory and Synthetic Biology) will be created to improve both biological laboratory skills and bioscience knowledge for undergraduate students; 2) the CAREER research will be integrated with the Washington University iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition) team project, encouraging participation of female/minority students; 3) the CAREER research will be integrated with the Clean-Coal Program at Washington University (supported by local companies in St. Louis) to provide students with industrial experience.",
