The purpose of the conference is to explicate the theory on mathematics curriculum enactment, defining key constructs and explaining how they are expected to interact, and why, in order to facilitate the systematic accumulation of knowledge about mathematics curriculum enactment that can guide policy and practice.  The conference agenda builds on work of the Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum (CSMC) and work by NCTM to develop a research agenda for mathematics education. The conference proceedings will include the conceptual model developed during the conference, the priority research questions that were identified, and the instrument development agenda for addressing those questions.",
