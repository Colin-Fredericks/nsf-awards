 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enzymes isolated from microbes play significant roles in daily life, ranging from photosynthesis and oxygen production by algae to yogurt formation by Lactobacilli and Lactococci bacteria.  The proposed research will investigate a unique, poorly-understood mechanism for the methylation of unreactive carbon and phosphorus atoms used by enzymes in Streptomyces, a large genus of beneficial bacteria that naturally produce many antibiotic, anticancer, and herbicidal chemicals used commercially.  To date, all enzymatic methyl transfer reactions have been characterized as nucleophilic substitution reactions.  However, the substrates for these Streptomyces methyltransferases are not amenable to nucleophilic activation, suggesting the need for and use of another catalytic mechanism.  Biochemical, spectroscopic, and synthetic organic techniques will be used to determine whether these enzymes catalyze methyl transfer using a four-iron, four-sulfur cluster to generate organic radicals from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and methylcobalamin, a derivative of vitamin B12.  Understanding the mechanism of these reactions will provide a framework for engineering these and related enzymes to produce novel carbon-carbon and/or carbon-phosphorus-carbon bonds.  The enzymes, cofactors, and microbes studied in this research will be linked to an educational outreach program targeting K-5th grade children of the rural, agricultural Palouse region, which is 300 miles from the nearest metropolitan area.  In partnership with the Palouse Discovery Science Center, interactive presentations focusing on beneficial microbes and enzyme chemistry will be presented to families and classes throughout the area.  Giveaways will be combined with assessments to improve retention and obtain feedback for improvements. \r\nSimilar presentations incorporating experimental results will also be made available in an accessible online format to reach a larger audience.  The ultimate goals of this proposal are to improve overall understanding of microbial enzyme chemistry and encourage children to pursue future careers in microbiology and/or biochemistry.\r\n",

Our laboratory\u00c6s focus over the past several years has been the study of an unusual, poorly-understood mechanism for the methylation of unreactive carbon and phosphorus atoms by enzymes from Streptomyces, a large genus of beneficial bacteria that naturally produce many commercially-used antibiotic, anticancer, and herbicidal chemicals.  When we began this project, all characterized enzymatic methyl transfer reactions were nucleophilic substitution reactions in which a methyl group donor is attacked by an electron-rich methyl group acceptor. However, the substrates for the methyltransferases of interest to us were unlikely to conduct this type of chemistry.  This suggested the need for another catalytic mechanism, potentially the transfer of a methyl group as an organic radical as had been shown through model chemistry by others.  Such chemistry is believed to be facilitated by some members of the \"radical SAM\" (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) superfamily of enzymes, a diverse group of proteins that contains over 100,000 members, the majority of whose functions remain unknown.  Our primary research goal was to begin to study two methyltransferases whose activity had remained elusive for ~15-20 years.  We also wanted to integrate these studies with biochemistry and microbiology outreach to K-5th grade children from underserved rural populations.\n\nOur major results include:\n\nEvidence supporting the hypothesis that the PhpK methyltransferases from Kitasatospora phosalacinea and Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tu494 rely on iron-sulfur, methylcobalamin (a derivative of vitamin B12), and SAM chemistry for catalysis. \n\nPhpK methylates a biosynthetic precursor to phosphinothricin (PT), the only naturally-occurring compound with a stable carbon-phosphorus-carbon bonding sequence.  PT has antibiotic activity but is best-known for its herbicidal properties and is commonly used as an alternative to glyphosate (\"Roundup\").  In studying PhpK, our group was the first to successfully isolate any of the radical SAM, B12-dependent methyltransferases.  We used two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to successfully demonstrate PhpK-catalyzed methyl transfer to the substrate N-acetyldemethylphosphinothricin to produce N-acetyl-PT.  We also showed that the methyl group is directly transferred from B12 and that a chemical reductant, presumably for the iron-sulfur cluster, and SAM were also required.  Methylation activity appears to occur in a one-to-one ratio with the amount of enzyme, suggesting that our assay conditions are probably not physiologically relevant but are in line with our currently-postulated mechanism.\n\nEvidence supporting the hypothesis that the Fom3 methyltransferase from Streptomyces wedmorensis that catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic fosfomycin also requires iron-sulfur, B12, and SAM chemistry for catalysis. \n\nAmino acid sequence comparisons between PhpK and Fom3 suggested that the two enzymes were related and thus might be likely to use similar catalytic chemistry.  Again, using NMR spectroscopy, but this time in one dimension, we successfully demonstrated methyltransferase activity by Fom3 on the substrate 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate to form 2-hydroxypropylphosphonate.  As for PhpK, Fom3 activity was only observed in the presence of a chemical reductant, B12, and SAM.    \n\nBiochemistry and microbiology outreach programs reaching nearly 700 K-5th grade students, family members, and teachers.\n\nWe linked the microbes, enzymes, and cofactors of interest to our scientific research program to an educational outreach effort targeting elementary schoolchildren.  During the first three years of this CAREER award, we held three \"Family Science Saturday\" hands-on events at the Palouse Discovery Science Center here in Pullman, Washington.  At these events, children engaged in activities such as coloring sheets, capturing candy antigens ..."
