 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: Every cell in an organism carries the same sets of genes. However different cells perform different functions because only subsets of genes are activated in each cell. One way that cells activate specific sets of genes is by chemically modifying particular pieces of DNA. This project investigates how one such modification, DNA methylation, affects development in the honeybee. Honeybees are well-known social insects and represent important species for studying DNA methylation because of their ecological and economic importance. In addition, the differentiation of honeybee castes represents one of the most spectacular examples of developmental plasticity: queens and workers arise from the same genes through differential gene activation mediated by DNA methylation. Consequently, determining how DNA methylation affects development in honeybees would help link specific molecular mechanisms to the production of different developmental forms and provide insight into the factors affecting social behavior.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will result in several broader impacts to society. For example, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in integrative multidisciplinary research. Research findings will also be implemented in university classes and laboratories. Moreover, research findings will be disseminated through popular press and scientific meetings thereby increasing scientific literacy. Finally, because honeybees are critical species for pollinating crops, these studies will contribute to improving agricultural outcomes in the United States.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThough honey bees are typically considered to be models for highly cooperative social behavior, our studies have examined layers of hidden conflict within this species.  Using genomic, physiological, and behavioral studies, we examined the mechanisms mediating conflict between honey bees, within the genomes of honey bees, and between honey bees and their pathogens.\n\nOur studies have demonstrated conflict between a honey bee colony's reproductive queen and the tens of thousands of (mostly) sterile workers.  The queen releases a pheromone that attracts workers to the queen (and causes them to pick up the pheromone and spread it through the colony), inhibits worker ovary activation so that they remain sterile and rear the offspring of the queen, and inhibits the rearing of new queens. Workers vary greatly in their ability to activate their ovaries (their reproductive potential).  Our studies demonstrated that the workers with the highest reproductive potential are least likely to cooperate with the queen.  Compared to their sisters, workers with high reproductive potential are less attracted to the queen, less likely to rear new queens if the old queen is lost, and more likely to activate their ovaries.  These behavioral differences are associated with differences in ovary size; indeed, surgically adding additional ovaries to a bee caused her to behavior more selfishly. \n\nIn a sexually reproducing species, individuals inherit a set of genes from their fathers (patrigenes) and mothers (matrigenes).  Patrigenes and matrigenes usually work cooperatively to improve the health and reproductive abilities of the individual.  However, the \"kinship theory of intragenomic conflict\" predicts that if patrigenes and matrigenes are inherited unequally among siblings, patrigenes and matrigenes can be in conflict.  In honey bees, the queen mated with multiple males.  Thus, there are multiple patrilines and a single patriline present in the workers in a colony. Under these conditions, it is predicted that patrigenes will favor selfish behaviors, while matrigenes will favor altruistic behavior.  Using 18 crosses of stocks of Africanized and European honey bees, we demonstrated that the patrigenes regulate reproductive physiology and reproduction (while the matrigenes are essentially silent for these traits) and patrigenes are overexpressed relative to matrigenes in reproductive workers.  Thus, our results verify the general and specific predictions of kinship theory of intragenomic conflict, and indicate that conflict between matrigenes and patrigenes may play an important role in shaping social behaviors. \n\nFinally, there is also conflict between honey bees and their parasites.  We demonstrated that viral infections in honey bee workers causes changes in the expression levels of one set of genes, and changes in the DNA methylation levels of another set of genes.  Interestingly, many of the differentially methylated genes have been shown to function in host-virus interactions in mammals, but not in insects.  Thus, there appear to be two parallel genomic pathways - transcription and methylation - that respond to viral infections in honey bees.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/11/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christina Grozinger"
