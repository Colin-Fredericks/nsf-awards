 "awd_abstract_narration": "Echinoderms include familiar animals such as starfishes, sea urchins, and a wide array of extinct forms stretching back to the Cambrian Period, circa 500 million years ago. Echinoderms share a common ancestor with backboned animals and thus provide a crucial link to understanding a huge portion of the entire tree of life as well as the history of our species. This project, the Echinoderm Tree of Life Project, will resolve the phylogenetic placement of Echinoderms within the tree of life and clarify important unresolved relationships among major echinoderm lineages using data from genetic sequencing and anatomy.\r\n\r\nEchinoderms are fascinating, and their unique features, such as mutable ligaments and novel means of detecting light, have biomedical engineering applications.  Because research on such marine animals and their adaptations is naturally attractive to young people, excellent students are expected to be recruited and the importance of science will be communicated to a broad audience. Long-term impacts, embodied by scientific publications, textbooks, anatomical and genomic data, and extensive pages in the Tree of Life and Encyclopedia of Life web projects, will provide resources to researchers and educators.  Outreach will include videos and broadcasts about marine exploration and applications of fundamental biological research across the biomedical sciences.",

Over 5,000 species of echinoderms are alive today, inhabiting virtually every marine environment, including the deep sea and polar oceans. Echinoderms are amazingly diverse in appearance and ecological specialization. While this makes them fascinating to study, it has also made it difficult to discern their relationships. A team of over two dozen researchers at several universities brought a range of experties to bear on this problem. The role of my group was to gather information about the genome sequences of 40 echinoderm species representing a broad range of groups. We used high-throughput DNA sequencing to discern the sequences of several thousand genes from each of the species. We then passed this information along to other researchers on the team who used it to infer genealogical relationships among the species based on similarities in gene sequences. This was, by far, the largest data set that has ever been assembled to study evolutionary relationships among echinoderm species. From analyses of these data, the team was able to resolve relationships among the five major groups of echinoderms, something that has been difficult because the groups are each so distinct. The analyses also focused on finer-grained relationships within specific groups, such as seastars, where the evolutionary history as been difficult to discern because of convergence in anatomy. The large dataset from many different genes allowed the team to deduce relationships independent of anatomy. The historical framework that emerged from these studies provides detailed insights into evolutionary changes in echinoderm anatomy, physiology, ecology, behavior, and life history.
