 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is intended to improve understanding of the importance and consequences of rapid industrialization in China not only for the environment of China but also for the environment of the world as a whole.  China is now the world's largest national emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) and leads most likely also in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).  This research will implement studies of the processes affecting the abundance of ozone (O3) and other important chemical species in China, making extensive use of the GEOS-Chem 3-dimensional model applying the model to, among other sources of data, measurements from an observing station established in 2004 in collaboration with colleagues at Tsinghua University at Miyun, a rural site located approximately 100 km northeast of Beijing.  Essentially continuous data on O3, CO (carbon monoxide) and CO2 are available from this site since December, 2004, complemented more recently by continuous measurements of NO, NOy and SO2.\r\n \r\nAddressing the challenge of potential present and future climate change is recognized as a globally significant objective.  The ultimate outcome will depend in large measure on development decisions made in China.  The research outlined here will feed into a larger multi-disciplinary program at Harvard conducted in collaboration with Chinese institutions and colleagues seeking to identify optimal sustainable paths for future development.  The results of this research will be integrated into the training and teaching of both undergraduate and graduate students at Harvard and will be published in a timely basis in the professional scientific literature.",

The study found that when the cost differential for electricity generation using gas rather than coal falls below a critical value (2-3 cen..."
