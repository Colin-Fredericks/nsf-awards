This Sino-USA summer school in Vision, Learning and Pattern Recognition (VLPR 2010) is held in Xi'an City, China. It brings together a high-quality team of leading American and Chinese researchers in computer vision to offer a one-week educational program to students and junior scholars from both US and China. This education program provides an important opportunity to discuss recent advance in Perception, Motion and Events, and allows technical and culture exchanges between researchers from two countries. Such interactions are important for fostering new understanding and new collaborations in science, education, and culture. \r\n\r\nSummer School web site: http://vlpr2010.eecs.northwestern.edu/",
