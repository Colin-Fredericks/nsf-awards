The second laboratory will be utilized for research on the role of prion-like protein aggregation in the normal biology of the cell using the model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The improvements will provide greater opportunities for students to participate in research and research training. The improvements to the two labs will include cabinetry, chemical fume hoods, improved electrical and power outlets, sinks, gas outlets, overhead lighting, flooring and ceiling tiles, and white boards. The funds will provide the addition of a new environmental system for the two labs and their support spaces. A single, dedicated air handler with energy saving enthalpy wheel and a new general laboratory exhaust system will be provided in a remote unit located on the roof directly above the two labs. With the addition of a new vertical duct chase, the similar orientation of the labs will allow efficient stacking of supply and return ductwork. The new single unit will provide centralized, efficient temperature and humidity control for both labs in an easily accessible roof top unit. Reinforcement of the roof structure above lab 210 will support the loads of the new air handling unit. The HVAC will be supplied with hot water from the college's central steam plant and chilled water from the college's central chiller plant.",
