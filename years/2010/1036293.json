 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Targeted Infusion project entitled - Development of Courses in Renewable Energy in Support of a Renewable Energy Engineering Curriculum - seeks to  improve the quality and scope of undergraduate engineering programs at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC). The project will develop anchor courses in renewable energy for the proposed renewable energy engineering (REE) degree program.  By instituting a new BS degree program in Renewable Energy Engineering, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will be leading the way for its students to enter the growing world of renewable energy resources. The planned degree and courses will serve the needs of students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, as well as the newly created College of Urban Agriculture, Sustainability, and Environmental Sciences. \r\nThe specific objectives of this project are: 1) the development and establishment of four new course modules in renewable energy engineering; 2) training of students in REE-focused technology and research; 3) acquisition and installation of new laboratory equipment to complement the new courses; and 4) the initiation of a BS degree in renewable energy engineering. Students enrolled in these courses will be better prepared to enter the 21st century engineering workforce, particularly in the emerging field of renewable energy, and will be prepared to matriculate in graduate programs.",
