 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a RAPID award to respond to the Deep Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This research applies a new methodology to assess the transformation of crude oil, over time, in coastal marine sediments.  The research seeks to identify unique electromagnetic (EM) geophysical signatures that reflect specific changes in sediment physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics.  Research involves time-series measurements of geophysical signatures in oil contaminated, oil/dispersant contaminated, and uncontaminated sediments.  Corresponding microbial community structure and composition, as well as corresponding geochemical characteristics of the sediments will be determined.  This will be the first use of EM geophysics for biogeophysical studies in saltwater and brackish systems. Field sites and sample locations will be selected in Louisiana and Florida.  Broader impacts of the work will have immediate implications for assessing the oil contamination and microbial vitality of coastal sediments impacted by the Deep Horizon oil spill.  It will develop new methodology that allows the remote sensing of microbial activity in the subsurface.  The project trains students in state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and biogeophysis.  It also supports two minority PIs from an institution in the EPSCoR state (Oklahoma), one of whom is from a gender under-represented in the sciences.",
