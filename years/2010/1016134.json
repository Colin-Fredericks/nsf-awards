 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern software engineering is a highly social activity, which is in contrast aimed at producing technical artifacts. As a result, complex dependencies between the technical elements of software systems and the social structures of the developers that are tasked with their creation have a direct effect on software quality: in projects that exhibit a high degree of congruence between the design of a software system and the social communication structures of its developers, teams are more productive and systems contain fewer faults. This research project aims to create the necessary tool support so that software engineers can be made keenly aware of these socio-technical dependencies within the familiar context of their everyday development activities. By providing this information in this specific context ? at a time when it is useful and actionable ? the broader impacts of this research have the potential to dramatically transform software engineering habits and practices by bringing into sharper focus the existing and emerging socio-technical trends of a development effort, allowing developers to intervene when they diverge, and ultimately improving the quality of the software systems produced.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these objectives, this research project is grounded on the creation of an architecture-centric toolset that supports the analysis of social network patterns, designed to be an addition to the popular Eclipse development environment. This toolset will support continuous awareness of emerging socio-technical dependencies by collecting data and providing a host of displays that allow developers to visualize their project?s software architecture, dependencies between source code units, and the social network formed through analysis of developer communications. Key contributions and advances of this work include the novel integration of social aspects of development with the architecture of software systems, the provision of concrete socio-architectural congruence metrics, and the presentation of this information to developers during ongoing development efforts.",

The focus of this software  engineering research grant is an investigation of the methods and  research challenges in better integrating insights from the study of  socio-architectural dependencies into software engineering practice in a  way that is useful during ongoing development efforts.\n\n \nThe  architectural design of a software system captures the system\u00c6s  decomposition into modules and the interface contracts that govern their  interactions, which makes it play a key role in determining the  communication needs of the developers assigned to the project. This  influence, however, is not one-way: architectures are also affected by  the existing organizational and communication structure of developers  who are assigned to specific work tasks: The divisions between teams,  the distribution of technical expertise, the co-location or distribution  of developers, and the communication practices of developers are just a  few examples of factors that may influence architectural design.\n\n \nGiven  this interplay between architectural design and organizational  structure, a key factor in the software engineering of successful  systems is the degree of congruence or match between the design of a  system and the communicative behaviors of its developers. The research  area of socio-technical analysis (STA)  has grown around the study of these dependencies between technical and  social artifacts: Interesting results from this research show that a  high degree of match between the technical dependencies among artifacts  and the actual communication patterns exhibited by the team result in  higher quality software and faster development times, which ultimately  results in better software systems that are less costly.\n\n \nApplying  these insights in an ongoing software development process, however, is  very challenging: In modern development settings, architectures evolve  rapidly and often drift away from their original form. As a result, it  is unlikely that a high degree of congruence between communication  patterns and architectural design will be maintained, even if the  original design was carefully crafted to exhibit it. Current STA  research has also been largely centered on data collected from already  complete development efforts that are of little value to the software  development process itself. Further exacerbating this is the fact that  the analytical focus has been heavily placed at the level of source code  files, which does not focus on the cross-boundary design artifacts that  are most critical in understanding the communication needs of a  development effort and limits how well these analyses scale.\n\n \nThis  project focused on providing the means with which to leverage insights  from socio-technical dependencies in ongoing development efforts. Our Architecture-centric Social Network Awareness Environment (ArSoNAE) toolset (built in the Eclipse development environment) provides software developers with functionality that provides continuous awareness and supports in-depth exploration of a software system\u00c6s socio-architectural dependencies: the couplings between a system\u00c6s architectural design and developer communication patterns.\n\n\nThis  project laid the groundwork for transitioning the research community\u00c6s  increased understanding of the complex dependencies between the social  and technical artifacts of software engineering into the everyday work  of software engineers, while also answering research questions  concerning the integration of social insights..."
