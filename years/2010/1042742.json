 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the ocean observing community moves forward into the next phase of IOOS, federal agencies remain committed to cooperating among themselves and with partners throughout the ocean community. Coordination among the federal agency partners will remain the responsibility of the (IWGOO) along with NOAA as the designated lead federal agency for IOOS. The IWGOO is a formal chartered body, and will see IOOS through this transition period. The IWGOO decided that some Ocean.US activities would continue under the leadership of the IWGOO. This proposal requests funds for partial support for the Interagency Working Group on Ocean Observations (IWGOO) Support Office hosted at the Consortium for Ocean Leadership.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nInteragency collaboration is essential to achieve ocean science and technology priorities and, in particular, for planning and coordination of an ocean observation system. The IWGOO support office provides administrative assistance the federal agencies on all of the IOOS planning activities. A balanced, highly-functioning IWGOO that works through collaboration supports efforts to integrate coastal and ocean observing assets, establishes effective mechanisms for Integrated Ocean Observing System budget planning and transfer of resources, creates links with other environmental observing efforts, provides integrated coastal and ocean data, facilitates the delivery of applications and decision-support tools, advances research, incorporates new technology into operations, integrates IOOS into education and workforce training, and coordinates ocean observing priorities. An IWGOO that is able to effectively support these goals will make meaningful contributions to broader societal goals related to climate, maritime operations, natural hazards, national security, public health, ecosystems, and natural resources.",
