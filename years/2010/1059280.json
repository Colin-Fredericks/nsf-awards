 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop titled \"Pervasive Computing and Smart Environments with Applications\" is being proposed, to be held in the Fall of 2010. The goals of the workshop are to foster the continued emergence of smart environment design; to define challenging and beneficial applications of pervasive computing and smart environment; and to identify key research areas in pervasive computing and smart environment design that will support and challenge this growing field. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will consist of four long and approximately thirty short invited talks, three panel / discussion sessions, and two breakout sessions.  Invited talks will provide perspectives on the field from funding agencies, from industry, and from leading academic research labs. Attendees will use the breakout sessions to discuss issues and brainstorm ideas related to embedded devices, new networking and middleware paradigms, interfaces and modes of interactions, and application of technology to smart grids, social networking, health care, and beyond. An outcome of the workshop will be a set of steps to recommend that NSF take to nurture the maturing and transformation of this field. Following the meeting a report will be prepared that summarizes the workshop and details the recommendations. This report will be provided to NSF and posted on the NSF web site.",

On the one hand, the field has matured to the point where tangible, beneficial prototype testbeds such as smart homes, body area networks, health monitoring systems, and social networking media are becoming fairly commonplace.  These visible successes are built on mature underlying technology that performs device communication, information routing, sensor fusion, activity recognition, and user preference learning.
