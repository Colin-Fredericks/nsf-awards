 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops efficient routing schemes for large scale multi-hop \r\nwireless sensor networks with a complex shape. As sensor networks grow large \r\nin size, terrain features or non-uniform energy usage may leave the network \r\nwith holes. Efficient routing becomes difficult as some knowledge of how to \r\n\"get around\" the holes is needed.\r\n\r\nThe novelty of this project is to use conformal geometry to compute a proper \r\nembedding of the network such that simple, distributed greedy routing schemes \r\nachieve desirable properties. Conformal geometry shows that any surface can \r\nbe deformed to three canonical shapes: the sphere, the plane and the disk. \r\nThus, one can \"regulate\" any sensor field shape to be of a canonical, simple \r\nform. The complexity of the routing problem and the domain specifics are \r\nencapsulated in the embedding such that routing decision becomes trivial. \r\nThe conformal mapping of a sensor network is computed using Ricci curvature \r\nflow, an intrinsically distributed computation routine that can easily \r\nincorporate the dynamic changes of wireless links. This project focuses on \r\nconformal mapping and the companion greedy routing solutions that guarantee \r\ndelivery, achieve good load balancing, facilitate in-network storage and \r\ndata-centric routing, are resilient to network failures, and generalize to \r\nboth 2D and 3D networks.\r\n\r\nThis project explores the unique cross-disciplinary area of wireless networking and differential geometry. Although the main thrust of this proposal is theoretical, it is expected that the project can also provide practical routing solutions for large scale sensor networks.",
