 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) project at Syracuse University (SU) is providing two-year scholarships to eighteen master's students enrolled in programs with an information assurance focus.   Three cohorts of six students each are being formed and each student is performing an internship at a federal agency.   Students also have the opportunity to conduct research in an information assurance related area. Syracuse university has a strategic partnership with JPMorgan Chase that is developing a new curriculum in Global Enterprise Technologies and that established the JP Morgan Technology Center to provide opportunities for faculty research and student internships that focus on the information assurance challenges encountered in the financial sector.  Syracuse University received the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security (NSA/DHS) Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) designation in 2001, and was re-designated as such in 2004 and 2007. Syracuse University also received the NSA/DHS Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research in 2009.  The project includes an assessment and evaluation plan coordinated by an independent evaluator to ensure that the project achieves its objectives.   The project's results are being disseminated through conference and professional presentations.",
