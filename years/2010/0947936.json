This proposal will train a new cadre of graduate students to apply their particular engineering skills to enhance the math and science education of high school students through the context of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand Challenges while concurrently illustrating the global nature of these societal issues. Through this process, the graduate Fellows will themselves better understand and develop the linkages between their research and these very significant global societal challenges.\r\nThe strategy for accomplishing this is the development of a unique presentation model that uses the NAE Grand Challenges as examples and as a vehicle through which to integrate and enrich the teaching of science and mathematics in the School District of Philadelphia while embedding feedback and interactive processes by which the Fellows, Teachers, and students communicate shared experiences. The high school students and Teachers will gain an appreciation for the science and mathematics concepts in an applied, real world context linked to global technical/scientific issues.  Concurrently, the Fellows will become knowledgeable in pedagogy through direct application of their technical/scientific expertise in the context of the classroom setting, interaction with the Teacher, and mentoring students.  Thus the graduate Fellow, Teacher, and the students will all ?learn-by-doing?.\r\n\r\n",

Goals and Strategy</em></strong></p>\n<p>Through a technology-driven contextual foundation, the goals of the NSF GK-12 &ndash; Catalyzing STEM Education via the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand Challenges program at Drexel University were to: 1) Enrich and excite the science and math learning experiences of high school students by introducing the NAE Grand Challenges as context for classroom education; 2) Improve &nbsp;the &nbsp;teaching, communication, and team skills of STEM graduate student Fellows; 3) Provide mentoring experiences for the Fellows; 4) Provide &nbsp;content &nbsp;enhancement &nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;K-12 &nbsp;Teachers; &nbsp;5) Further strengthen the existing partnership between the School District of Philadelphia (SDP) and Drexel University.<strong><em></em></strong></p>\n<p>The strategy for accomplishing this was the development of a unique presentation model that uses the NAE Grand Challenges as examples and as a vehicle through which to integrate and enrich the teaching of science and mathematics while embedding feedback and interactive processes by which the Fellows, Teachers, and students communicate shared experiences.

The engineering disciplines represented by the Fellows included electrical and computer, mechanical, chemical, biological, civil and environmental, materials science, and biomedical &ndash; 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 also included a Fellow from the biology department. Fellows were paired with a Teacher and class(es) at one school for the entire academic year, representing an average of 9 parallel interventions.</p>\n<p>Teachers also included underrepresented groups in STEM and came from six different schools representing six different pedagogical philosophies: &nbsp;an all-female school, a high-achieving selective public school, a charter school focused on science leadership, a charter school focused on the performing arts, an urban neighborhood school, and a suburban school in New Jersey. Five of the six schools were in the School District of Philadelphia (SDP), the eight largest in the United States. As of October 2016, the SDP had a total enrollment of 134,041 in grades K-12 and more than 70% of those students belonged to groups of underrepresented minorities in the STEM fields &nbsp;(African American, Hispanic, or Native American). Of the students who were surveyed two to three times an academic year throughout our program, an average of 95% were of racial or ethnic minorities.</p>\n<p><strong><em>2b.

One of the Kenyan schools was ranked 35<sup>th</sup> out of 4000 and the other was ranked 1<sup>st</sup>. Both were all-boys schools. During the academic year, students from the Philadelphia and Kenyan schools exchanged videos and messages about how STEM affected their every-day lives.

High school students are presented with a context for their STEM education via the NAE Grand Challenges and develop an understanding of and increased desire to pursue careers in engineering.\n\n2. Broader Impacts\n\n2a. Demographics\n\nThe program during the 2010-2016 academic years consisted of an annual average of 9 Fellows chosen out of 19 applicants serving 445 students from the School District of Philadelphia.\n\nThe Fellows included underrepresented students in STEM, including minorities and females.   All Fellows were pursuing a Doctoral Degree in Engineering.
