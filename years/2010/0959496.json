Dybowski and Sharon Rozovsky from the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at the University of Delaware will acquire a very specialized 750 MHz NMR spectrometer with a series of probes that will support research in solutions and solids. The instrument will be used to support exciting research activities in areas such as: 1) biophysical and bioinorganic chemistry; 2) structural biology of proteins and protein assemblies; 3) materials for photonics, alternative energy, and environmental remediation applications; 4) bioengineering and biomaterials; and 5) molecular cell biology.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. A high-field NMR spectrometer provides exceptional sensitivity. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have a positive impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, the environment and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit\n\nThis project has brought the research infrastructure on the University of Delaware campus to a qualitatively new level.  The 850 MHz NMR instrument has enabled and will continue to enable cutting-edge interdisciplinary science in many areas, such as biophysics, structural biology, biochemistry, materials science, chemistry of pharmaceuticals, alternative energy applications and others.  Since the spectrometer was installed, exciting discoveries have been already made into the structures and mechanisms of large protein assemblies such as cytoskeletal protein assemblies and HIV-1 protein assemblies, as well as of bioactive molecules containing insensitive low-gamma quadrupolar nuclei.  Furthermore, new technologies have been developed that enable structure determination of large macromolecular assemblies inaccessible by other techniques.  Many more experiments are under way and planned, which are anticipated to yield critical knowledge into structures and functions of biological and inorganic systems unavailable by any other means, and which in turn will drive progress in basic and applied science.\n\n \n\nBroader impacts\n\nThe 850 MHz NMR spectrometer at the University of Delaware has already made and is likely to make an impact on a variety of disciplines, including but not limited to Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biophysics, Structural Biology, and Materials Science.  In a broader sense, many of the scientific directions pursued using the capabilities of the 850 MHz NMR spectrometer will likely make societal impact beyond science, engineering, and academe.  For instance, understanding how large proteins and protein assemblies from various organisms perform their unique functions will contribute to the shared global knowledge of how nature works and may inspire engineering of fundamentally new biomaterials.  Understanding structure and physical properties of polymorphs is anticipated to facilitate design of novel pharmaceuticals.  Studies into the materials for alternative energy, photonics and environmental remediation applications will address global societal needs in the respective areas. \n\nThe new instrument has had outstanding positive impact on human resources development at the University of Delaware.  It has already provided and will continue to provide outstanding opportunities for training and professional development of students and personnel at all levels. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tatyana Polenova"
