These areas are:\r\n - Greenlight International - TL/SL will investigate monitoring for energy consumption in selected international-reach experimental networks.\r\n - SCCSnet - TL/SL will support the Science Cloud Communication Services Network by assisting projects that are developing high-performance communication services tailored for computational clouds used by data-intensive scientific applications. These projects are addressing the high-volume, high-performance national and international communication requirements of scientific computational clouds versus general consumer and enterprise clouds, which use the commodity Internet. \r\n - CineGrid ? TL/SL will help enable the production, use and exchange of very-high-quality digital media, including scientific collaborations and visualizations, over photonic networks. UCSD will serve as the lead on CineGrid activities. TL/SL funding will offset personnel time involved in conducting international trials, and for partial participant costs for the annual CineGrid conferences in 2010, 2011, and 2012, held at Calit2.\r\n - High-Performance Digital Media Network (HPDMnet) ? TL/SL will work with international partners to develop new services based on high-performance optical transport (i.e., optical multicast) of large-scale data streams, including high-resolution digital media streams, as well as new capabilities for high-volume scientific data. \r\n - iGENI (International GENI) ? TL/SL will connect existing StarLight resources with current GENI backbone transport resources.\r\n - SAGE - TL/S will help transition SAGE from a transformative research prototype to a hardened technology that provides production-quality, community-driven open services for visualization and collaboration utilizing shared national and international cyberinfrastructure, for the advancement of scientific research and education. Partners sites are in the US, Australia, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nContributions from this project have the potential to strengthen activities in network modeling, exploring leading edge green technology research, simulation, advanced imaging transmissions enabling the IRNC program to play a formative role in the emerging discipline of network science, and enhancing NSF's leading role in sustainable stewardship of cyberinfrastructure\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe proposed work will help IRNC operators better understand their networks by making more effective use of data they already collect as well as newer technologies for measurement and visibility of their networks. The data will have broad applicability to other researchers and pragmatic network operations.",
