The project advances knowledge about and understanding of additive manufacturing by providing standardized vocabulary, materials, specifications, and quality benchmarks that can be replicated and accepted by industry and their customers.  The project improves technician education by providing student technicians with more comprehensive and up-to-date skills and experiences with AM industry processes and methods.",
