 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the registration and travel costs for junior attendees of the 2010 FASEB Summer Conference on Retinal Neurobiology and Visual Processing. Basic research into the function of the retina is crucial for understanding neurobiological mechanisms involved in the functional aspects of visual systems. Crucial to this effort is the open exchange of new research findings among the community of vision scientists. The FASEB Summer Conference on Retinal Neurobiology is the premier meeting in the field of retinal biology and visual processing. This cutting-edge meeting attracts the best retina scientists from around the world and maximizes scientific interactions at the highest level.  Diverse areas of retinal research will be explored, including development of retina circuitry and remodeling of that circuitry upon extrinsic insults, the specialized synaptic connections between retinal neurons, activity dependent changes in retinal circuitry, and the information contained in the signals sent from the retina to the rest of the brain. Every effort is made to foster participation in this conference by young people in the field: a significant number of speakers in the plenary sessions are graduate students or postdoctoral fellows, and an entire oral session features their exciting and timely work, which is drawn from poster session abstracts. In addition, a \"Data Blitz\" session features very brief presentations by young investigators, thereby introducing them to the entire group and advertising their posters and the two poster sessions.",
