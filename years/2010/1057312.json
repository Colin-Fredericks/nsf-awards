The program and its predecessors, the Trusted Computing and Cyber Trust programs, now fund more than 400 Principal Investigators. New researchers entering the field need to understand the research areas these programs cover, how they relate to other NSF programs, and how they relate to programs funded by other U.S. government research funding agencies.",
