 "awd_abstract_narration": "The magnitude 8.8 earthquake that occurred in Chile on February 27, 2010, presents a unique opportunity to study the response of the modern built environment to large ground motions. Through support under this RAPID award, the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) equipment site operated by the University California, Los Angeles (UCLA), will send personnel and state-of-the-art monitoring equipment to Chile in March to gather strong-motion aftershock data from buildings and other structures as part of the NSF-supported Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) post-earthquake reconnaissance team.  The UCLA team will deploy two 24-channel digital monitoring systems at initial monitoring sites to be selected with the EERI team and collaborating Chilean researchers.  With Chilean support, the UCLA team will then deploy the monitoring systems on multiple structures for an initial two-week period. One of the monitoring systems will remain on structures in Chile through March and April, and be operated by newly-trained Chilean university staff and students. Data and equipment will then be retrieved during a second trip by one of the UCLA NEES staff in early May. The primary objectives of this RAPID award are the following: (1) to gather timely important data on the response of damaged and undamaged structures to strong shaking during aftershocks, (2) to provide a structural monitoring resource for the EERI post-earthquake reconnaissance team and Chilean researchers, and (3) to demonstrate the use of NEES resources for post-earthquake studies. Results of the monitoring will be posted on a web site as they are completed and widely publicized so that interested researchers will have access to information about these activities.  This award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merits\n\nThis project involved rapid deployment of NEES post-earthquake building monitoring equipment to Chile following the February 27, 2010 Mw 8.8 earthquake.  \nThe vast majority of buildings over five stories in Chile are constructed using reinforced concrete shear walls, a system that also is very common in the US. \nChilean and US Seismic design requirements are very similar, and design of RC buildings in Chile is based US ACI 318-95, with only minor modifications.\nInstallation of monitoring equipment in buildings provided a unique opportunity to collect data on both damaged and undamaged buildings subjected to significant shaking levels.\nThe project provided an excellent opportunity to assess shipping, logistical, and legal issues associated with deploying NEES@UCLA equipment to foreign countries following a large earthquake.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBroader impacts\n\nBuilding drawings and data collected will be archived in the NEES Data Repository and widely available for future studies.  \nThis project, along with a similar effort in Istanbul, Turkey, have provided the NEES@UCLA Equipment Site with valuable experience, increasing the potential that unique and valuable structural response data will be collected by NEES in future earthquakes, either in the US or abroad. \nThe project provided an excellent opportunity for the US to assist and support a foreign country and collaborate with their engineering community following a major crisis. \nThe project funds supported researchers and faculty from under-represented groups. \n\n\nStatement of Significant Result(s) and Explanation\n\nTwo, 24-channel monitoring NEES@UCLA monitoring systems arrived in Chile 14 days after the earthquake and were deployed in buildings within four days. One of the 24-channel systems remained in Chile for two months. No significant issues occurred related to shipping the equipment to and from Chile, but much was learned about such logistics that can be applied to future NEES deployments. \nStrong collaboration with universities in Chile enabled the equipment to be deployed in four different buildings over a period of two months. Graduate students from Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica de Chile were trained to use the equipment. \nBuilding drawings and data collected are archived in the NEES Data Repository. \nResults were presented in a Special Session at the October 2010 NEES/PEER Quake Summit held in San Francisco. \nA peer-reviewed paper that summarizes project results is being prepared for EERI Spectra Journal. \nBased on the results of this work, similar projects were undertaken in New Zealand following the devastating earthquake in Christchurch in February 2011.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/11/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John W Wallace"
