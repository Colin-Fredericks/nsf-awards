 "awd_abstract_narration": "While children successfully learn the language of their environment, adult learners do not show the same degree of success in acquiring a second language (L2). An L2 speaker of English might say \"she pass the exam yesterday,\" omitting the -ed past marker in the verb \"passed\"; the sentence, while understandable, does not conform to English grammar. This type of error has been observed in Chinese native speakers of Chinese acquiring English as adults, even when they have lived in an English-speaking country for a long time and can communicate effectively. This dissertation project examines the production of simple past and plural marking in L2 English, considering factors that have been argued - separately - to affect L2 acquisition at advanced levels of language acquisition: (a) syntactic deficits (e.g. Hawkins and Liszka 2003); and (b) transfer effects of the first language (L1) phonological system (Goad and White 2006). In this project, three different groups of learners of English are compared according to their L1: Mandarin, Japanese and Spanish. Each group of learners will perform experimental tasks designed to elicit the use of simple past and plural marking, in both oral and written form. The different syntactic and phonological properties of these three languages will allow investigators to compare how syntax and phonology weigh on the use of English simple past and plural marking.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study will provide robust evidence for or against (a) syntactic deficits and (b) transfer effects of the L1 phonology. If this project shows that the L1 phonological system is an important factor for L2 past and plural production, then focused training on pronunciation of L2 phonological properties that are not part of the L1 is warranted. Thus, the results of this study may have an impact beyond the cognitive study of L2 mental representation for curricular development at many levels.",

In this project, we have attempted to provide part of the answer to the problem of how adults are less successful than children by focusing on some challenges that adults face. Specifically, in an utterance from an adult second language speaker of English such as &ldquo;she pass the exam yesterday&rdquo;, the &ndash;ed past marker in the verb pass-ed has been omitted, and therefore the sentence, while understandable, is incorrect. This particular type of error has been consistently observed in adult native speakers of Mandarin (Chinese) learners of English, even when they can communicate effectively and/or have lived in an English speaking country for a long time. One well-positioned proposal is that this type of error stems from the very particular way that the Mandarin language expresses past. In Mandarin, verbs are not marked for &lsquo;past&rsquo; or &lsquo;non-past&rsquo; so that the sentence &lsquo;John kan dianying&rsquo; can be understood as &lsquo;John is seeing a movie&rsquo;, but also as &lsquo;John saw a movie&rsquo;. However, this does not mean that Mandarin speakers are uncertain about whether activities take place in the past or in the present. In fact, in real-life communication, this sentence would most likely include an expression like &lsquo;last night&rsquo; or &lsquo;yesterday&rsquo;. <br />Thus, one hypothesis is that when Mandarin natives say &lsquo;she pass the exam yesterday&rsquo;, this error comes from the prevalent influence of their native language (Mandarin) on English: since Mandarin does not mark past on verbs, they do not mark past in English either. However, a competing hypothesis is that the challenge in marking the verb with &ndash;ed comes from a different source: the pronunciation. Mandarin disallows consonant clusters of the [st] type, and therefore perhaps the difficulty comes from pronouncing these unfamiliar combinations of sounds. This project tested both of these hypotheses by comparing three groups of adult learners: native speakers of Spanish, Mandarin and Japanese. The reason for choosing these languages was that the restriction on the [st] consonant cluster is similar in all these languages, but crucially Spanish and Japanese have overt markers for past tense, in a way similar to English. <br />The results of the study revealed that native speakers of Mandarin&rsquo;s performance was native-like when they needed to provide verbs in simple past in written, but significantly different from native speakers&rsquo; when they needed to provide those same verb forms orally. The group of native speakers of Spanish showed a similar pattern, while the Japanese group was the group with the closest performance to native speakers of English. Overall, the results suggest that the specific challenge of uttering unfamiliar clusters of sounds (e.g., [st] or [ld]) is difficult enough to negatively influence production of verbs in simple past, although by no means the only factor. Thus, the influence of the first language in learning a second language helps explain why second language speakers seem to fail to learn all aspects of the second language, and specifically, verb morphology was found to be problematic especially when it requires articulation of unfamiliar groups of sounds, even though the mental representation for certain properties might be target-like.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/09/2011<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gonzalo&nbsp;Campos</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
