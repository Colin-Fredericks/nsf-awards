 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit.  This project addresses the role of H-O-C fluids in heat transfer associated with formation of a Paleozoic belt of metamorphic 'hot spots' exposed in a north-south transect across New Hampshire (NH). At each of these localities, steep gradients in metamorphic temperature and rock geochemistry are centered on syn-metamorphic quartz\u00b1graphite vein networks. Chamberlain and Rumble (1988) proposed the hypothesis that these features represent zones where large quantities of hot fluids ascended through fracture networks during Acadian regional metamorphism. On the other hand, numerical modeling studies have shown that typical regional metamorphic devolatilization is unlikely to transport sufficient heat to strongly perturb regional geotherms. It would appear that hot spots can only be produced if the fluid fluxes are enormous and the timescales of flow are extremely short, but it is unknown if such fluxes and timescales are realistic. A multidisciplinary approach is proposed to test this hypothesis. Field work will focus on well-exposed hot spot localities near Bristol and Nelson, NH. The hypothesis must pass five crucial tests. (1) Fluid fluxes must have been large. Time-integrated fluid fluxes through veins will be estimated by quantifying chemical and isotopic (O, H) mass transfer in the vein networks. (2) Fluid flow must have been in a direction of decreasing temperature. The nature and extent of chemical and isotopic metasomatism will determine the direction of fluid flow, and elucidate fluid sources and pathways. (3)  Timescales of flow must have been short (<10^6 yrs). The absolute timing of hot spot formation will be determined using Sm/Nd dating of garnet in metamorphic rocks, and U/Pb dating of monazite and zircons in metamorphic rocks and any magmatic dikes in the field areas. Furthermore, chemical diffusion profiles in calcite, apatite, and garnet will be used to constrain timescales of peak heating. (4) The timing of peak thermal conditions must have been nearly synchronous across isograds (test via Sm/Nd and U/Pb dating). (5) Metamorphic pressures must have been roughly constant across isograds at the present level of exposure. Thermobarometry will be done to determine peak conditions, regional T/P gradients, and P-T-t paths. Knowledge of the time-integrated fluid fluxes and timescales of flow will allow estimation of the actual fluid fluxes through the hot spots as well as gradients in the fluxes across the field areas. This information, together with the P-T-t history, age(s) of fluid flow, and field relations, will provide the initial and boundary conditions needed for modeling of fluid flow (2-dimensional) and its effect on regional thermal structure. If the hypothesis fails then other alternatives will be investigated, including magmatism and upwelling of lower crustal gneiss domes. The Ague lab will take primary responsibility for thermobarometry, mass transfer analysis, and diffusion and flow modeling; the Baxter lab for Sm/Nd garnet dating; and the Chamberlain lab for stable isotope and U/Pb work. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  Large fluid fluxes poentially transport mass as well as heat. Therefore, if correct, the hypothesis of fluid-driven heating would bear on problems of societal relevance including ore metal transport and the transfer of greenhouse gases out of metamorphic belts. Human resources will be developed because Ph.D. graduate student and undergraduate involvement is critical. PIs and students will take part in field work and, in Years 2 and 3, coordinate \"group meetings\" at international conferences. All of the PIs have advised women students and are committed to diversity, including the involvement of underrepresented minority groups in science. Ague spearheaded development of the new Hall of Minerals, Earth, and Space (HoMES) at the Yale Peabody Museum, allowing integration of new research results into Earth science displays viewed by over 150,000 visitors annually. A large fraction of these visitors are schoolchildren, many of whom live in the urban centers of New Haven, Bridgeport, and other Connecticut cities. Moreover, Ague has separate NSF funding to develop educational programs based on the new Hall for area schoolteachers. Baxter will incorporate the field area into his annual \"RoBOT: Rocks Beneath Our Toes\" outreach program as a part of his Fall mineralogy class. The program engages Boston area high school students and BU undergraduates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMetamorphism during continental collision creates conditions of heating and burial whereby rocks are transformed, melted, and mass is transferred within this active crustal regime.  Most common geodynamic models for such tectonic settings call for long durations of heating and burial gradually achieving moderate peak conditions.  However, some recent work worldwide has suggested that metamorphic heating may occur instead in very short bursts.  In this study, we have studied enigmatic metamorphic \"hotspots\" in New England to study the timing, duration, and causes of their extremely elevated and localized temperatures.  In the course of study, we re-visited the classic \"hotspot\" locality in Bristol NH, dating metamorphic garnet mineral growth in ten samples in a several km2 geographic area.  These are the first metamorphic ages from the Bristol hotspot.  We discovered that garnet growth spanned 399 to 381 million years ago, but large individual garnet crystals dated from their core to their rim appear to have grown very rapidly (within a few million years at most), and at different times.  This suggests that metamorphic heating and garnet growth occurred heterogeneously in time and space during short spurts during this ~20 million year span.  Thermal modeling by our collaborators also suggests that maximum temperatures in excess of ~800 C were reached only during brief pulses.  We also discovered two brand new \"ultrahigh temperature\" metamorphic localities, one in central Massachusetts and another in northeastern Connecticut, where Zr-in-rutile thermometry indicates temperatures in excess of 900 C and 1000 C, respectively.  Garnets from these localities gave younger metamorphic garnet ages of 380-353 million years ago in MA and 340 million years ago in CT.  This apparent age and peak thermal gradient for high and ultrahigh temperature metamorphic rocks from NH (399-381 Ma and &gt;800 C) to MA (380-352 Ma and &gt;900 C) to CT (340 Ma and &gt;1000 C) has not been recognized before.  To explore the possible sources (or consequences) of this extreme metamorphic heat, we also measured the ages of geographically associated igneous rocks in NH and MA via both igneous zircon and igneous garnet geochronology.  This revealed a similar age progression from the oldest igneous zircons in NH (399 Ma) to the youngest igneous garnet in southern MA (341 Ma).  This supports a genetic link between igneous and metamorphic heating along this north-south trending orogeny parallel high to ultrahigh temperature terrane.  This unique regional metamorphic geochronological dataset supports paradigm shifting hypotheses calling for short spurts of metamorphism, likely related to localized igneous activity and/or fluid flow, superimposed during long-lived mountain building.\n\nThis collaboration involved one female BU PhD student, and two BU undergraduate students (one female) each of whom participated in field sampling, and hands-on garnet geochronology in the BU TIMS Facility.  Each student produced a thesis, and presented their work in at least one major conference.  The two undergraduate students have now moved to graduate degree programs on the strength of their undergraduate research experiences supported by this grant.  This grant has fostered the continued collaboration of Jay Ague and his students at Yale University, bringing together our strengths in geochronology and Ague\u00c6s strengths in thermodynamic pressure-temperature modeling.  Undergraduate Mineralogy classes taught by Baxter have visited several of the research sites and incorporated them into coursework.  In fact, both undergraduates became interested in pursuing senior thesis projects in this area from their exposure during the Mineralogy class.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ethan F Baxter"
