 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objectives of this award are to study the effectiveness of polymer cross-linked aerogel -- a nano-encapsulated material with polymer coated nanoparticles -- in a damping-enhanced strengthening (DES) system for seismic retrofit and protection of reinforced concrete structures and to develop design guidelines for the use of this system in performance-based design of these structures. The DES system integrates the two attributes of strengthening and damping which are often used separately. The study will characterize the strength and energy absorption abilities of the aerogel, create a compact DES protective system with optimized damping and strengthening attributes using aerogel, and develop methods for performance based design of structures with the DES systems under multiple earthquakes of varying magnitudes.  The DES system will be numerically modeled to study its performance in seismic retrofit of bridges. Deliverables include aerogel material performance specifications, characterization of the interfacial behaviors between retrofitting system and existing structure, fabrication and testing of the systems to demonstrate its effectiveness,  modeling, analysis and design tools with DES systems, and engineering student education.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will provide an opportunity to create compact, cost-effective engineering systems that enable the performance-based design of critical infrastructures with an optimal use of both damping and strengthening materials.  Example applications include the seismic retrofit of buildings and bridges with optimized performance under different earthquakes and multiple performance objectives.  The DES systems offer the advantages of being flame retardant and impact resistant and can be used in other civil and mechanical engineering applications. The research results will be disseminated to allow the implementation of a prototype DES system that has increased design flexibility, reduced cost, and reduced weight. Graduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. K-12 students will be engaged to provide them firsthand experience through demonstration projects.",
