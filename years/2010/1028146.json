 "awd_abstract_narration": "The environmental fate and interaction of nanoparticles with water, air, soils, and organisms in the natural environment are growing areas of global interest and concern as the production and use of human-engineered nanoparticles  increases.  As such, dialog between researchers in this critical area across the spectrum of disciplines is important and necessary to move the science forward and to improve our understanding of the effects of nanoparticles on environmental health and safety.  This award provides funds to support student travel to the 5th International Conference on the Environmental Effects of Nanoparticles and Nanomaterials.  This conference brings together researchers from different fields and countries who would not normally interact with one another; thus, acting as a crucible for ideas and information exchange.  The goal of the conference is to facilitate discussions that lead to innovative, collaborative efforts that address the research and education needs in this important area of science and engineering.  Participants from academia, industry, and government from seven counties in Europe, Asia, and North America are slated to attend.  Broader impacts of the work and key conference outcomes will be (1) a paper for the publication that summarizes research presented at the conference and that identifies critical research needs and (2) the publication of a special journal issue.  Significant efforts, through outreach to professional societies and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, will be made to encourage the attendance of under-represented minorities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "5th International Conference on the Environmental Effects of Nanoparticles and Nanomaterials\n\n \n\nThe goal of this conference was to facilitate interdisciplinary discussions that will lead to innovative, collaborative efforts to address the research and education needs in this area.  Specific objectives of the conference were the following:\n\nPresent and discuss current research on the environmental effects of NMs.\nFacilitate creative interactions among participants\nDevelop a synthesis paper that summarizes current research and identifies critical research needs\nOrganize and publish a special issue of the journal Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (ET&amp;C) composed of manuscripts from the conference.\n\n\nTwo hundred nanomaterial scientists from five continents came to Clemson for four days to present and discuss the current knowledge on the environmental behavior and toxicity of nanomaterials.  A two-day short course was held prior to the conference to provide training for faculty and graduate students.  The course was so well received that we will offer it again at the 6th International Conference to be held in London, 2011.  During the four days of the conference over 65 platform presentations and over 100 poster presentations were made.  Over 50 graduate students made research presentations.  Twenty of these students received travel grants funded in part by the National Science Foundation. \n\nUndergraduate students, women, and underrepresented groups were recruited for the meeting.  We were successful in supporting almost 20 undergraduate attendees and several underrepresented minorities.  Almost half of the attendees were women.\n\nA post-conference workshop evolved four critical reviews and a special ET&amp;C Focus article.  These five manuscripts along with 25 manuscripts from the conference presentations will be peer-reviewed for inclusion in a special \"Nanomaterials in the Environment\" issue of ET&amp;C.  We expect this issue to be published in September or October, 2011.\n\nPost conference evaluation (conducted via the web) found that the majority of conference attendees were very positive about their conference experience, that they had ample opportunity to interact and discuss potential collaborations with other attendees, and that they would return for another conference.\n\nContact:  Stephen J. Klaine, Professor and Director, Clemson University  Institute of Environmental Toxicology, sklaine@clemson.edu\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen J Klaine"
