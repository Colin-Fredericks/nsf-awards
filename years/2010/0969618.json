 "awd_abstract_narration": "A comprehensive effort to improve the mathematics abilities of science and engineering students is being undertaken.  Included in the effort is the reform of precalculus and calculus courses, incorporation of active learning into mathematics courses, implementation of a uniform mathematics placement policy, and cooperation with school districts sending large numbers of students to the institution to modify high school mathematics courses to meet the expectations of the university.  All the planned activities are grounded in a detailed investigation of the current reasons for the lower rate of retention of majors STEM.\r\nThe project is the result of a synergistic approach amongst faculty from the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education, and the College of Engineering that utilizes best practices in STEM education to increase the number of STEM graduates.  The project is both advancing knowledge in mathematics and the associated comfort level of STEM majors by removing barriers linked to poor performance in STEM math classes and the associated lower retention to graduation in a STEM major.  Addressing the issue at the pre-college level through articulation with regional feeder high-schools, at the math placement level, and inside and outside the initial mathematics classroom is a holistic and potentially transformative approach.",

Advanced undergraduate students with a strong background in the course material were hired to attend class meetings and assist students inside and outside of class.

A placement system based on ACT or ACCUPLACER scores was implemented.  As part of its placement efforts the grant team provided incoming freshmen in STEM majors with a recommended schedule of math and science courses for their first semester.  The University expanded that effort so that all incoming freshmen are now provided with their initial course schedule when they attend orientation in the summer before enrolling.\n\nThe MSSM grant team sought to delve deeper than the usual student success metrics of average grade, grade distributions, and DFW rates for courses by tracking individual student trajectories in required math courses to degree.
