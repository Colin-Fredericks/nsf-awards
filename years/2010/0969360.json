 "awd_abstract_narration": "Milwaukee Area Technical College (MATC) is addressing local and national initiatives to increase the number of students transitioning to baccalaureate degrees in STEM disciplines through the Biochemical Excellence in Science and Technology (BEST) program.  The primary goals of this project are to strengthen the Associate of Science degree program and offer students different tracks within this degree, most notably in the biochemical sciences.  Enrollment in all STEM fields is expected to increase.  This five-year project offers an array of recruitment, academic support and enrichment activities to ensure academic success and stimulate interest as students explore career pathways in science and technology when education and research are integrated.  It includes summer workshops for high school seniors, research internships for college students in cooperation with four-year institutions and businesses, and a STEM-focused professional development course for high school teachers and counselors.  The program is open to all, but minorities, women and other under-represented populations are major target groups for recruitment.  The BEST program provides a model for integrating student learning and research through development of curriculum and key partnerships with research institutions.  The bridge internships create stronger transfer relationships between MATC and local colleges and universities.  More importantly, there is a broader impact on the number of technicians to meet the workforce development needs of Wisconsin business and industry, where biochemical science and technology provides some of the fastest growing job opportunities in the state.",
