 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support to the University of Kansas experimental particle physics group (KU) to continue studies with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, the D0 experiment at Fermilab's Tevatron, data analysis from the CLEO experiment, efforts on international linear collider (ILC) detectors, using radio detection techniques for high-energy cosmic rays, and performing public outreach. The range of studies by KU form the basis for the high intellectual merit of the program since these studies have the potential to provide a greater understanding of matter and energy at the smallest distance scales and so address some of the most fundamental questions in science. The broader impacts of this proposed activity are also considerable. Graduate students and postdocs will receive extensive training. The group also has a strong record of success in undergraduate research and will continue such involvement. The Quarked!  Project, started by Professor Alice Bean in 2004, as well as the QuarkNet program provide an important outreach focus as will the continuation of the program to disseminate research findings via the Internet with web sites aimed at different communities.",
