The lead institution of the proposed Center is Georgia Tech with a site location at the University of Kansas. \r\n\r\nCPMF proposes to explore areas important to pharmaceutical manufacturing and improved formulations for pharmaceuticals. The Center plans to develop methods and technologies that will produce better pharmaceuticals, make them last longer, be more effective, and safer. By combining the efforts of Georgia Tech, Duquesne University and the University of Kansas, the PIs have proposed a number of potentially important projects that could significantly advance the applied knowledge necessary to make better pharmaceuticals. CPMF will allow pharmaceutical companies a lower cost approach to advancing risky research in a cooperative manner such that important manufacturing needs and innovations can be pursued with shared risk and mutual gain. CPMF has assembled a very strong group of researchers who are well-qualified to perform the research outlined in the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Center will promote the rapid development of safe and efficacious drugs and drug formulations, and will identify potential problems with proposed drug formulations, with the potential of improving or even saving human lives.  The Center plans to involve graduate students and post-doctoral associates in performing and presenting their research, thereby creating an opportunity for them to interact with counterparts from pharmaceutical and medical areas.  Plans for dissemination of results are well thought out and audiences are appropriate.  The proposed Center also plans to put emphasis on recruiting under-represented groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Center for Pharmaceutical Development (CPD), established in February 2010, provides a forum for academic and industrial scientists to develop novel approaches and improvements of process development and scale-up, manufacturing, formulation, drug delivery, and analytical methods for pharmaceuticals (Image).  The two CPD sites at the Georgia Institute of Technology, supported by Emory University, both Atlanta (GA), and at the University of Kentucky in Lexington (KY), supported by the University of Kansas in Lawrence (KS), in phase I (2010-2015) have focused on the topics of developing selective biocatalysts for the synthesis of drugs, of developing more stable drug formulations, both in the liquid and the solid state.     \n\n Intellectual merit\n\nSupport from the CPD enabled the development of a novel biocatalyst for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure amines.  One third of the best-selling pharmaceuticals contain a chiral amine group.  The Georgia Tech site of the CPD succeeded in developing the first three amine dehydrogenase enzymes, catalyzing ketone reduction with ammonia to highly enantiomerically pure amines, a high-priority goal.  The same site developed a rapid test (1 hour rather than days or weeks) for accelerated aggregation of protein therapeutics targeted at accelerated drug development, which is expected to lead to decreased cost of new drug development.\n\n Broader impacts\n\nThe Center for Pharmaceutical Development (CPD) materially contributes to solving a range of challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry but directly impacting patients and consumers:\n\n1) Aggregation of therapeutic proteins not only reduces efficacy but also might lead to immunogenic reactions, 2) understanding solubility challenges in the formulation of new drugs will enable new drugs to be delivered safely to the patient, 3) radically streamlined pharmaceutical manufacturing processes minimizes environmental footprint with respect to solvent consumption and emissions, and 4) a novel paradigm for pharmaceutical manufacturing opens the path to less expensive drugs.\n\nThe above-mentioned challenges draw in a significant number of women and underrepresented minority students.  The CPD wholly or in part supported nine of seventeen women graduate students (53%) and three of seventeen underrepresented minority graduate students (17.6%). \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andreas S Bommarius"
