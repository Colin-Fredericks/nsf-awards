 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is aimed at exploring fundamental physics and potential applications of controlled quantum systems at the interface of quantum optics and nano-science. The program involves the synergistic interplay between theory and experiment. The work makes use of nanophotonic platforms featuring sub-wavelength localization of optical radiation to explore the interfaces between isolated AMO-like systems and solid-state systems. The aim is to understand and control interactions between atoms and photons confined to sub-wavelength dimensions and to develop new hybrid quantum systems using photons and atoms. Specifically, a novel system for cavity QED, in which photonic crystal cavities and waveguides are deterministically coupled to atom-like solid state defects, the so-called nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, will be implemented. This system will be used for fundamental cavity QED studies, for investigation of nonlinear optical phenomena at a single photon level, and for exploration of strong coupling between photons and multiple NV centers. In addition, use will be made of nanophotonic systems to investigate the interface between individual neutral atoms and nanoscale solid-state systems. The interface is enabled by optically trapping the atom via the strong near-field generated by a sharp metallic nanotip. The group will investigate unique properties of this novel trapping technique, study radiative interactions between isolated atoms and nanoscale optical plasmons and explore novel realizations of hybrid AMO-solid state quantum systems.\r\n\r\nTheoretical research within the project focuses on fundamental understanding of atom-photon interactions at sub-wavelength scales, investigating the use of nanophotonic systems for exploring novel regimes of atom-atom interactions and studying the quantum dynamics of strongly interacting atom-photon systems in one dimensional waveguides. The emphasis is on using coherent and dissipative mechanisms to control the quantum states of many-body systems. In addition to supporting the group's own experimental efforts, the theoretical work will provide 'seeds' for new research projects and directions. Finally, the group will study applications, ranging from quantum information systems to sub-micron integrated optical circuits and nanoscale sensors for monitoring dynamics of complex biophysical processes. \r\n\r\nThe Broader impacts include development of a new, interdisciplinary area of physical sciences. This work provides critical insights into the fundamental physics of controlled, complex quantum systems. New tools will be developed that make use of coherent quantum phenomena for applications ranging from information science to biology and medicine. This collaborative program provides opportunities for education and training in at the interface of fundamental physics, material science, and device engineering. Outreach activities include a program to bring young Russian scientists to Harvard, thus providing them with a unique opportunity to become involved in cutting-edge research and exposing them to the US educational system. The group will also continue to develop new and efficient ways for dissemination of physics knowledge through teaching.",
