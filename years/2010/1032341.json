 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research establishes MIST, the MIddleware Security and Testing facility,\r\nto identify security vulnerabilities in middleware, which include e-commerce\r\nsystems, supercomputers, and scientific and commercial networks. The\r\nresearchers are identifying limitations in current abilities to identify and\r\nremediate vulnerabilities in the middleware. The limitations include assessment\r\ntechniques that provide insufficient focus on critical vulnerabilities and are\r\nsubject to high false-positives, tools that provide limited abilities to \r\nfind serious vulnerabilities, little or no formal characterization of\r\nvulnerabilities, lack of trained security analysts to perform vulnerability\r\nassessment, scarcity of curricula, both in academia and professional training,\r\nfor training security analysts, scarcity of training in software engineering\r\nand design techniques for secure systems, and lack of independent vulnerability\r\nassessment activities in middleware software development.\r\n\r\nThe researchers are developing first principles based vulnerability assessment\r\n(FPVA) that starts with architectural and resource analysis of the software,\r\nidentifying high-value assets, and then derives threats based on how the\r\nassets are used. This research includes new and extended algorithms and\r\ntechniques for tools to help improve the automation of this task, and new\r\nsoftware engineering and coding techniques for developing secure systems.\r\nResults from their FPVA assessment activities are used to develop formal\r\ncharacterizations of these hard-to-discover vulnerabilities and, from these\r\ncharacterizations, develop algorithms for detecting these vulnerabilities.\r\nFrom algorithms, they are developing new automated tools for detection. The\r\ntools take the form of plug-ins to existing tools (to reduce unnecessary\r\neffort and time-to-deployment). \r\n\r\nThis project expands the skills software developers by developing training\r\nmaterials in the form of tutorials, short courses, and a new undergraduate\r\ncourse in vulnerability assessment and secure coding practices.",
