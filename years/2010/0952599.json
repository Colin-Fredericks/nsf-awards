 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three major fires occurred in the foothills and mountains above the greater Santa Barbara area in 2008 and 2009, all within watersheds with on-going, multiyear measurements.  Because high rainfall is expected during the El Nino conditions forecasted for 2009-2010, burned ecosystems will show their greatest responses this year and afford an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of fire on terrestrial and stream ecosystems. Measurements will be made of short-term changes in burned and unburned watersheds, comparing the influence of fires on a variety of ecological and environmental responses including: stream discharge and the export of sediment and nutrients, soil movement and landslides, re-growth of vegetation at the watershed-scale using high resolution remote sensing and at the transect-scale by direct measurements of re-sprouting plants, and stream biota and ecosystem processes. \r\n\r\n Modeling will permit prediction of flooding, soil movements, and stream water quality across a range of climatic conditions during post-fire periods. This information will be of value to natural resource managers and public safety officials. Participation in public meetings will further disseminate the findings.  In addition, three graduate and four undergraduate students will gain invaluable experience in watershed ecology, hydrology and management.",

The multiple wavelengths detected with the imaging system allowed clear identification of areas covered with ash and estimates of the severity of the fires.
