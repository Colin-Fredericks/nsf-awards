  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health issue, and the emergence \nof multiple drug resistant (MTR) strains has decreased the efficacy of traditional \nfront-line drugs, increasing the length and cost of treatment, and the urgency \nfor eradication.  Traditional therapy involves frequent high doses of multiple \ndrugs which dissolve and are distributed throughout the body, but this method \nof drug delivery is inefficient in many ways.\nWith the development of nanoparticle drug delivery systems it is now possible \nto build customizable particles which carry thousands of molecules and specifically \ndeliver drugs to a target site, limiting systemic distribution.  However, the administration \nof nanoparticle formulations remains a developmental challenge.  The objective of \nthis research is to develop a carrier, which incorporates nanoparticles in \"fruit \njello\" architecture.  The carrier particles are to designed to efficiently deliver drug via \ninhalation to the lungs, the site of infection in a majority of TB cases, and subsequently \ndissolve away, leaving behind the nanoparticles, to be taken up into infected cells.\nThis research brings together groups with individual expertise that synergistically fit \ntogether to contribute to the fields of both particle engineering and drug delivery. The \nPrud\u00c6homme laboratory at Princeton University specializes in particle engineering on\nthe nano scale using a novel process called Flash NanoPrecipitation.  The Chan research \ngroup at the University of Sydney has expertise in the spray drying of pharmaceuticals \nsuitable for inhalation. The collaboration under this EAPSI funding to combine nanoparticles\nand mannose matrix phases via spray freeze drying to create inhalable carriers for \nnanoparticles is a new area of research collaboration between the groups.\nThis initial stage of research explored the use of mannose, an inexpensive simple sugar, \nto form carrier particles by rapidly freezing a liquid spray over in a cryogenic fluid.  \nThe frozen droplets were dried by lyophilization and characterized to determine the \nfraction of the inhaled dose that is delivered to the lungs.  The two significant findings from \nthis research were (1) the amount of the powder administered to the lungs can be tailored \nby controlling the amount of mannose in the aqueous droplets during the freezing step \nand (2) as high as 60% of the test dose had the appropriate properties for lung delivery, \nwhich implies improved localization of anti-TB drugs at the infection site over traditional \noral administration.  The next steps for this research are includes the administration \nof the carriers, loaded with nanoparticles, to investigate toxicity and evaluate gained \ntherapeutic advantages in an animal model.\nIncreased international travel dictates that even developed countries must be prepared \nfor the incidence of MDR-TB, which makes this research timely for both under developed \nnations, which requires minimizing the cost of each dose, as well as in the US and Australia, \nwhere  limiting the duration of therapy has major implications in the associated cost of \nhealth care. The drivers are different in the different contexts, but the need for the \ninnovative research sponsored by this EAPSI grant is substantial in either case.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/12/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Suzanne M D'addio"
