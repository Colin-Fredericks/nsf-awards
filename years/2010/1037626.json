 "awd_abstract_narration": "College of Menominee Nation (CMN), together with the University of Wisconsin Madison and the \r\nUniversity of Wisconsin Platteville, is applying to the National Science Foundations Science, Tribal \r\nColleges and Universities Program (TCUP) Pre-engineering Education Collaborative grant to strengthen \r\nCMN?s capacity to establish CMN as an Associate Degree granting engineering program of distinction.   . \r\nThe CMN PEEC: Providing for the Education of American Indian Engineers collaborative project \r\nproposes the following objectives: \r\n&#61607; To build CMN?s capacity and infrastructure to sustain a Pre-engineering Associate Degree Program. \r\n&#61607; To implement a Pre-engineering program of distinction. \r\n&#61607; By September 2015, to graduate at least twenty students from CMN?s pre-engineering program and \r\n   transition into U.W. Madison?s and U.W. Platteville?s engineering programs. \r\n \r\nProject Intellectual Merit:  This project recognizes and embraces diversity and the role Tribal Colleges \r\nplay in coordinating demonstrative research on increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities \r\nin STEM fields. Tribal Colleges are key contributors to the body of knowledge on American Indians. \r\nProject research, data, and outcomes focused in the ultimate outcomes of increasing the number of and \r\nperformance of American Indian students in engineering, leading to increased numbers of American \r\nIndians in engineering careers, will provide key nationally recognized research. This collaboration will \r\ndevelop, apply and assess evidence-based practices shown to increase the participation of \r\nunderrepresented minority students in science and engineering. Furthermore, the partnership between \r\nCMN and its UW partners is tailored to establish robust connections between institutions that will serve as \r\na model for the engineering community in general and other minority-serving institutions as we assess, \r\ndocument and disseminate the success of this process. \r\n \r\nProject Broader Impact: This project will build upon the research of previous STEM activities, continuing \r\nthe investigation of essential research in discovering and understanding how Tribal Colleges and the \r\nunique strategies they implement promote education in minority students. The project further advances \r\nthe research of American Indian undergraduate education in engineering and contributes to the global \r\nbody of knowledge in underrepresented minority engineering education. The short term outcome of this \r\neffort will be to increase the knowledge, understanding and interest in engineering among students in \r\nrural populations, with emphasis on the American Indian population of Northern Wisconsin.  The long \r\nterm outcome will be an increase in the participation of American Indian students graduating with degrees \r\nin engineering.  This will ensure that the voices, perspectives and talents of a population that is so \r\nunderrepresented in engineering have an opportunity to contribute to the development of the engineering \r\nprofession.",

Faculty at CMN provided the UW-Platteville team with information about courses at CMN that could fulfill the general education requirements at UW-Platteville. As a result, a transfer agreement between the two institutions was established. The agreement states sensitivity to historical trauma and recognizes the infusion of culture and language in the CMN curriculum. UW-Platteville accepts the study of Menominee and Oneida languages for students from the pre-engineering program at CMN and this also signifies that CMN transfer students have met foreign language requirements. Including a statement regarding historical trauma and the acceptance of culture and language as part of CMN&rsquo;s curriculum was historically significant in that no other known articulation or transfer agreements includes this type of wording.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Throughout the project UW-Platteville faculty and staff developed recruitment materials and aided CMN staff in recruitment efforts. Support was provided for 3 Native American students that each earned 1 college credit for GE 1030 Introduction to Engineering projects, a required course through the Explore Engineering Summer Program. The first EESP at CMN was in summer 2013. Both UW-Platteville and CMN faculty were instructors, providing opportunities for UW-Platteville faculty to develop cultural awareness. A second EESP at CMN was planned for Summer 2014 but was cancelled due to flooding on the Wolf River. A third EESP was planned for summer 2015, but was cancelled due to some unfortunate events in the community. That year, focus shifted to establish and strengthen relationships between the community and faculty who were attending as instructors.

The program manager developed and modified an Academic Action Plan specifically for the needs of CMN Pre-engineering students. This two-part document was used as a guide for CMN students to establish academic and person goals, identify academic and personal champions, and to assist students as they prepare to matriculate to a four year mainstream partner. The goal of the Academic Action Plan is to bring balance to a student&rsquo;s academic career as it fits with community, faculty, and school.</p>\n<p>UW-Platteville delivered STEM course content and supplemental instruction to CMN.

CMN students who have matriculated to the engineering programs at UW-Platteville are also using the materials directly to aid in current courses and as a review of previous courses.
