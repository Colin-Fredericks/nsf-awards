 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this proposal is to fully develop click chemistry reactions to create a dynamic in vitro 3D cell culture platform that will enable researchers to explore how cell-material interactions influence important cellular functions.  These biomaterials will give the user control of specific physical, chemical, and biological cues comprising the cell microenvironment in both time and space.  To accomplish this significant challenge, the proposed work will exploit the classic alkyne/azide click chemistry, modified to enable a cytocompatible copper-free polymerization, to synthesize basic hydrogels as a simplified mimic of the extracellular matrix in the presence of cells.  The biochemical functionality of the gels will then be tuned using a new variant of click chemistry, a thiol-ene photoaddition reaction, that is fully compatible with peptide chemistry and allows spatiotemporally regulated introduction of biological epitopes.  Finally, a photodegradable linker will be integrated into the crosslinks of the base gel formulation to allow light directed degradation of the material.  Using these three independent and cytocompatible reactions for gelation, photodegradation, and photocoupling, dynamic biomaterials systems will be created that will provide newfound opportunities to probe the dynamic exchange of information between cells and their microenvironment.  The specific aims of this work are to: (1) synthesize click-based hydrogels using orthogonal chemistries that allow manipulation of the material properties through photodegradation and introduction of biological epitopes through a photocoupling reaction, (2) manipulate the properties of the above hydrogels through photodegradation, photocoupling, and combined photodegradation and photocoupling, (3) culture human mesenchymal cells (hMSCs) on 2D gel surfaces and characterize morphology, cytoskeletal organization, and focal adhesions as a function of elasticity and patterned adhesive ligand presentation, (4) encapsulate hMSCs in 3D and examine their response to material-directed morphological changes and spatially varying adhesive ligand distribution, (5) train a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of polymer chemistry and molecular biology, and (6) disseminate these results to the industrial and academic public to assure maximum impact on fundamental and applied biomaterials chemistry.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  This new class of multifunctional hydrogels will help overcome numerous problems with existing 3D cell culture platforms by providing a facile means for manipulating material functionality and mechanics with spatial and temporal control.  These new materials will enable researchers to probe fundamental biological questions via a variety of previously unattainable 3D cell studies.   The efficient nature of the gel chemistry will allow its adoption by a wide array of non-experts. These material systems should find applications for basic 3D cell culture, design of tissue engineering matrices, platforms for drug delivery and screening, stand-alone biomaterials implants, as well as other non-biological applications. The multidisciplinary team environment in the Anseth laboratory, coupled with long-standing collaborations with world-class clinical and biological laboratories, will provide an exceptional educational environment for multiple graduate and undergraduate students. The PI and her research group have a history of extensive outreach to high school students and the general public, and the team will work diligently through multiple mechanisms to highlight the impact of biomaterial science in benefiting society.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit.  Methods for culturing mammalian cells in a biologically relevant context are increasingly needed to study cell and tissue physiology, expand and differentiate progenitor cells, and to grow replacement tissues for regenerative medicine.  Two-dimensional culture has been the standard for in vitro cell culture; however, evidence suggest that cells behave differently when they are isolated from their native tissues and placed on petri dishes that present cells with an un-naturally high stiffness, polarize them, etc.  As a result, researchers are often faced with the need for a more physiologically relevant 3D culture environment.  The research supported by this grant sought to synthesize and develop new material systems, specifically hydrogels, as custom 3D microenvironments with highly controlled chemical, biological and physical cues for cell culture.  Our approach used bio-orthogonal click chemistries, which proceed with high efficiency and functional group tolerance, to create hydrogels from precursor molecules present in a suspension of cells.  After gelation, a cell-laden hydrogel is fabricated in situ that permits long-term cell culture in microenvironments with defined biophysical properties.  But the native extracellular matrix (ECM) is far from static, so the second part of this project designed photochemical reactions to functionalize the hydrogels, allowing one to add and substract biochemical cues to direct cellular behavior.  These light based chemistries enabled us to dynamically change the local cell environment in a way that is controlled in both space and time.  Experiments were designed to better understand how adult bone marrow derived stem cells differentiate in response to matrix ligands and illustrated how temporal changes in matrix signaling influences cell fate. Ultimately, this information is important to improve the development of bioscaffolds for applications ranging from wound healing to delivery vehicles for cell-based therapies to engineering tissue structures.\n\nBroader impact.  This grant support led to the publication of &gt;15 peer-reviewed manuscripts and 4 perspectives/review articles/book chapters that are widely read and available.  The research has also been presented at 30 invited lectures from 2010-2013.  In addition to more broadly impacting the research field through the dissemination of technical knowledge, the project directly impacted the education of six graduate students, including the completion of two PhD theses and two that are currently in progress.  Eight undergraduate students participated in aspects of this research, and thus, received hands on training in use of state of the art equipment, as well as learning to solve open-ended problems.  Over the course of the grant, we also hosted four high school students and guided them through the completion of successful science fair projects.  Finally, the PI aws active in training of the broader scientific community through teaching of short courses to materials researchers, stem cell biologists, and clinicians.  Each of these seminars focused on educating researchers from diverse fields as to how advances in polymer chemistry can meet diverse needs in applications ranging from cell culture to biomaterials devices. In collaboration with others, the PI also developed educational modules for undergraduate students and high school teachers that included on hands-on activities to learn about polymer science and its applications in biology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kristi S Anseth"
