 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"A Cluster Randomized Study of Heuristic Teaching vs. Intelligent Tutoring for Community College Students with Disabilities in Algebra\" is an investigation of the effectiveness of two intervention strategies for problem solving on the performance of community college students with disabilities in an Elementary Algebra I course and persistence in STEM coursework and degree programs.  A heuristic math teaching method with an embedded content independent metacognitive strategy (HMTM) and a computer based individualized student intervention (ITS) will be compared.  The University of Hawai`i Community Colleges will participate in the research study with Honolulu Community College and Windward Community College targeted for initial selection; these two schools currently participate in the NSF-funded Pacific Alliance for Students with Disabilities in STEM.  The design involves using a cluster-randomized trial with a control group and repeated measures.  The study will be conducted with 32 Elementary Algebra I classes and 128 SWD, focusing on the following three research questions:\r\n\r\nRQ 1. To what extent does HMTM, as a single intervention component, improve student a): Algebra I course completion rate and b) persistence in the STEM related course work?\r\n\r\nRQ 2. To what extent does use of ITS (specifically Cognitive Tutor), as a single intervention component,improve the two areas of student outcomes (successful completion of Algebra I and persistence in STEM)?\r\n\r\nRQ 3. To what extent do the use of HMTM and ITS in combination, improve the two areas of student outcomes?\r\n\r\nAn independent evaluation of the project will be conducted by Dr. Crystal Mills, who is Professor and Chair of the University of Hawai`i's Master of Social Work program and an Emeritus Professor of Social Work at Eastern Michigan University.\r\n\r\nThe following dissemination strategies will be utilized:\r\n1. A replication manual detailing project methods and results, based on the summative and formative findings, will be prepared and comprehensively disseminated on the project website.\r\n2. Manuscripts will be published in professional journals.\r\n3. The methodology and findings will be presented at national professional conferences.\r\n4. Findings will be posted on the project website and presented at the Annual Meeting of the NSF investigators.",
