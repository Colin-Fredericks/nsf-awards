 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Semantic Web is based on describing the meaning ? or\r\nsemantics ? of data on the Web by means of metadata ? data describing\r\nother data ? in the form of ontologies. The World Wide Web Consortium\r\n(W3C) has made several recommended standards for ontology languages\r\nwhich differ in expressivity and ease of use. Central to these\r\nlanguages is that they come with a formal semantics, expressed in\r\nmodel-theoretic terms, which enables access to implicit knowledge by\r\nautomated reasoning.\r\n\r\nProgress in the adoption of reasoning for ontology languages in\r\npractice is currently being made, but several obstacles remain to be\r\novercome for wide adoption on the Web. Two of the central technical\r\nissues are scalability of reasoning algorithms, and dealing with\r\ninconsistency of the ontological knowledge bases. These two issues\r\nare being addressed in this project.\r\n\r\nThe scalability issue has its origin in the fact that the expression\r\nof complex knowledge requires sophisticated ontology languages, like\r\nthe Web Ontology Language OWL, which are inherently difficult to\r\nreason with ? as witnessed by high computational complexities, usually\r\nExpTime or beyond. This project builds on recent new developments in \r\npolynomial time languages around OWL in order to remedy this. \r\nIn particular, in this project efficient algorithmizations and tools are \r\ndeveloped for the largest currently known polynomial-time ontology language, \r\ncalled ELP. Reasoning with knowledge bases with expressivity beyond ELP is\r\nenabled through approximating these knowledge bases within ELP.\r\n\r\nThe inconsistency issue has its origin in the fact that large knowledge\r\nbases, in particular on the web, are usually not centrally engineered,\r\nbut arise out of the merging of different knowledge bases with\r\ndifferent underlying perspectives and rationales. \r\nIn this project tools are developed for efficient, i.e., \r\npolynomial-time reasoning with inconsistent ontologies.\r\n\r\nThe concrete outcome of the project is an open source reasoning\r\nsystem which is able to reason efficiently with (possibly)\r\ninconsistent knowledge bases around OWL, in at least an approximate\r\nmanner. \r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web page at \r\nhttp://knoesis.wright.edu/faculty/pascal/projects/tron.html",
