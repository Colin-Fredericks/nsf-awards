The microscope would provide essential imaging capabilities of cellular and sub cellular structures. The microscope benefits students by allowing them to gain experience in the application of research techniques in classes and independent projects. The results of the research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at\r\nprofessional meetings.",
