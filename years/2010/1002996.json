 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project addresses the need for Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFV) professional technical education by applying National Automotive Technicians Education Foundation standards for Alternative Fuel and Hybrid Vehicles. The project adapts best practices in AFV curriculum to address regional needs; and provides the incumbent automotive workforce, emergency responders and automotive educators with First Responder Safety Training for AFV.\r\nThe 45-credit AFV certificate serves the needs of rural communities in which employers range from small independent automotive service businesses to multiple manufacturer specific services. By combining onsite and online teaching and learning this project meets the needs of time and place bound students and incumbent workers. Faculty members from multiple disciplines collaborate to identify and demonstrate science and mathematical themes and concepts necessary to understanding AFV technologies. The project incorporates the Integrated Basis Education Skills Training model in which Adult Basic Education and discipline specific faculty work together to ensure that students are equipped for the rigors of an advanced certificate program.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn October 2010, Peninsula College (PC) was awarded a 24-month grant (DUE 1002996), categorized as a \"Small Project Grant\". Peninsula College is unique in its leadership in the area of automotive technology education, as the only National Automotive Technicians Education Foundation (NATEF/ASE) certified program in the region.  Through this grant, the college expanded its leadership in automotive technology to include Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFV) education. \n\nWhile there are many colleges and universities that offer classes in alternate fuel vehicle technology, very few, if any, offer a complete certificate program.  The college is sharing its program with institutions across the U.S. and this grant has catapulted Peninsula College into a role as a national leader in AFV education and training. \n\nPC is already one of three community and technical colleges in Washington State that are included in the National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium (NAFTC), and the only one in its region.  An underlying strategy of this grant was to qualify the NATEF certified program at PC in alternative fuels, to join an elite group of four other colleges in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, the I-BEST (Integrated Basic Education Skills Training) model was used in all classes.  The I-BEST model is highly successful in ensuring that under-prepared and/or returning students are academically equipped for the rigors of advanced certification.  In the model,  Adult Basic Education/ESL instructors were paired with the Alternative Fuels Technology instructors to create an enriched learning environment. As an example, students might get a lesson in math that is specific to a testing procedure for engine performance monitoring.  The I-BEST instructor would work with them on the contextual math necessary and then students would work with the AFV instructor on applying that knowledge directly to the procedure.\n\nProject Outcomes:\n\nThrough the activites of th is grant, Peninsula College added an AFV Certificate Program to their existing certified automotive program. Alternate fuel topic areas included:\n\nLiquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)\nCompressed Natural Gas (CNG)\nFlex Fuel\nHybrid\nHydrogen and Hydrogen Fuel Cells\nElectric and Diesel/Biodiesel\n\n\n These alternate fuel topics were applied to the following:\n\nElectric/Electronic Systems\nEngine Performance\nLPG and CNG Diagnosis, Repair and Maintenance\nLPG and CNG Conversion/Installation\n\n\n Other outcomes:\n\nApproval of the AFV program by the Peninsula College Curriculum Committee and the Washington State\nBoard for Community and Technical Colleges \nQualification of the program for the Federal PELL Grant Program, allowing students to obtain financial aid.\nPurchase of new equipment that will yield return on investment long into the future for the AFV program. \nFirst Responder safety training for 71 participants over the two years.\nProvided professional development for 43 faculty, far exceeding the grant measure of 15. \nProvided exposure to AFVs to 45 high school students, again far exceeding the grant measure of 15.\nAttained an average of 92% excellent ratings for all dimensions evaluated for all professional development courses offered. \n100% of faculty participants were satisfied with the workshops attended.\nRecognition of the AFV program by the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) Sustainability Education and Economic Development (SEED) Center network program, which makes accessible the PC curriculum to any legitimateteacher in the country and moves PC into the national arena of sustainability education.\nThe regional auto dealers and repair shops provided major support for the AFV program.  These groups are very active on the Peninsula College Advisory Committee and worked very closely with co-PI Mike Hansen on developing/delivering curriculum, sending technicians to the classes and providing alternate fuel vehicles for use in classes and workshops.\nThe activities of this grant are being institutionalized through the interdisciplinary collaboration between the Chemistry Department and the Automotive Technology Department and through the permanent improvement of Automotive Technology lab equipment for training and education of students and incumbent workers.\n\n\nThe curriculum is fully complete and includes equipment lists, laboratories, lectures, PowerPoints and assessments.  All elements of the curriculum will be made available at no charge to any teacher in the United States upon request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert W Lawrence"
