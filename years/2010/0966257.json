 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to document and analyze, from an acoustic perspective, the sound system of Shipibo-Conibo, an endangered Amazonian language indigenous to Peru. Shipibo has long puzzled linguists because of the ways its consonants and vowels interact with other aspects of the language (in particular, its prosody and morphology). Besides the study of vowels and consonants, this project will provide a detailed characterization of the intonational patterns of Shipibo as well as an acoustic examination of the phenomenon of nasalization. The results obtained will allow for a much better understanding of how human languages vary cross-linguistically. In addition to the dissemination of the results through publications, a substantial amount of high quality digital audio recordings will be made available to the wider linguistic community through the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (http://www.ailla.utexas.org/).\r\n\r\nA key element in the project is the educational potential it will yield. The project interweaves its research objectives with the training of graduate students, undergraduate students, and the collaboration of Shipibo native speakers in recording, analyzing and publishing the data. Part of the project includes the production of a bilingual (Spanish-Shipibo) children's book, the creation of which involves three generations of the Shipibo community. One of the aims of the children's book is to facilitate ways in which the Shipibo can participate in the conservation of their linguistic heritage.",
