There are macroscopic free\r\nboundary models, which are based on observable quantities and are\r\nneeded to deal with singularities due to topological changes of\r\nfree boundaries, and microscopic continuum models, derived at the\r\nmolecular level and (always) well-posed.  One goal of the project\r\nis to derive critical information from continuum models for free\r\nboundary models when the latter become indeterminate.  Another is\r\nto develop new microscopic continuum models for phase transitions\r\namong phases such as solid/liquid and different grains in a\r\npolycrystalline material.  The main tools used here are theories\r\nof partial differential equations, singular perturbations,\r\nasymptotic expansions, complex analysis, bifurcation, center\r\nmanifolds, global analysis, dynamical systems, and geometric\r\nmeasure.  From time to time, computer assistance is used to first\r\nstimulate, then validate, and further extend theoretical\r\nconclusions. \r\n\r\n     The investigator studies interfacial phenomena, which are\r\ncommonplace in nature and occur whenever there is a continuum\r\nthat can exist in at least two different phases and there is some\r\nmechanism that generates a spatial separation of these phases. \r\nThe spatial boundaries that separate these phases, referred to as\r\ninterfaces or free boundaries, evolve with time due to some\r\nenforcement of transitions of phases from one to another.  A\r\ntypical two-phase transition is a solidification process of a\r\nliquid.  A classical multi-phase transition arises from\r\nevolutions of grains in a polycrystal where alignments of atoms\r\nin different grains do not match at grain boundaries.  The growth\r\nof a solid polycrystal from a liquid involves a two-phase\r\ntransition between liquid and solid and a multi-phase transition\r\namong grains.  These phenomena motivate new theoretical\r\ndevelopment in free boundary problems, systems of parabolic or\r\nelliptic partial or ordinary differential equations, and\r\ndynamical systems.  Insights gained from the project increase\r\nconnections between mathematicians and materials scientists.  New\r\nmodels developed here provide scientists with tools for\r\nunderstanding and designing new materials.",
