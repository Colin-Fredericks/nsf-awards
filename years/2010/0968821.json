Since then other universities have joined this Center: the University of Maine, the University of Washington, the University of Georgia and the University of Florida.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of the proposed research site within CAFS will be to provide additional and specialized expertise and research platforms in the areas of endophyte selection and deployment, seed orchard pest protection and geospatial projections. The proposed activities at UI will augment current CAFS projects, and will more fully address the needs for scientific and technological advances for enhancing the competitiveness of the US forestry sector.  \r\n\r\nThe effort at the University of Idaho has the potential to improve the competitiveness of the forest products industry by solving key problems using applied research and enhanced institutional collaboration. The community will benefit from refereed publications and presentations at scientific meetings focusing on key nationwide research questions. The proposed work at the University of Idaho will expand training of graduate students with unique interdisciplinary skill sets. The proposed site also has a plan to address diversity issues in this field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDue to population growth and increasing standards of living there is growing demand for advanced renewable materials including wood, paper, power, composites, polymers, and liquid fuels .  There is also increased recognition that forests will produce these products indefinitely if managers maintain the quality of soil in which trees are grown.  Yet while demand is increasing, the productive forest land base is shrinking.  To address this forest product supply and demand conflict, the University of Idaho conducted several projects to improve forest productivity through participation in the NSF Center for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS).  These UIdaho CAFS projects included tree seed orchard protection from pests, isolation and testing of endophytic microbes that are capable of enhancing growth and pathogen resistance, development of genetic markers to aid breeding and selection of superior tree varieties, and management of stand density to enhance forest health and vigor.  Each of these projects had significant outcomes and important impacts. \n\nSeed orchard protection work demonstrated the superiority of the insecticide emamectin benzoate to control cone beetle and cone worm in Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine.  Based on these results, industry partners are operationally applying systemic insecticides to control seed orchard pests in areas where broadcast insecticide applications may not be efficient or desirable\n\nA better understanding of western conifer seed bug feeding habits and reproductive success could provide insight for developing additional control measures of this common yet difficult to monitor seed orchard pest. We found that adult females oviposited more frequently on ponderosa pine, and nymphs survived longest and were most likely to complete development on lodgepole pine than on other conifers hosts.  This information then allows us to focus control on pine species. \n\nModifying microbial communities through inoculations of select endophytes can provide control for pathogens.  We found that inoculation of ponderosa pine needles with endophytic fungi modifies the disease severity of red-banded needle blight, both positively and negatively depending on the endophyte used.  We found that inoculating seedlings with naturally occurring conifer root endophytes reduces seedling mortality from nursery pathogens. Other forest root endophytes reduce fecundity of Fusarium species, which are severe pathogens in forest nurseries.  Incorporation of forest endophytes into conifers nursery production of seedlings for reforestation and plantation establishment may increase out-planting survival and reduce fungicide use. \n\nTo develop genetic markers to aid breeding and selection for western white pine, we tested markers on samples from the Bingham Seed Orchard and found over 50 markers to be useful.  We then conducted simulation studies to estimate the number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers needed to differentiate offspring with common parentage.  The simulation showed that the high degree of relatedness of trees at Bingham would require about 200 SNPs to ensure a high degree of accuracy of parental reconstruction. With costs of SNP genotyping continuing to decline and because of previous success with Douglas fir using modern sequencing techniques, we decided to broaden the scope to develop 20,000 SNP markers for genomic selection in both Douglas-fir and Western white pine. Once developed during Phase II of CAFS, these markers will provide a broad platform for future studies aimed at examining the relationships between important traits and specific SNP markers. \n\nTo enhance forest health and vigor through stand density management, we are monitoring both thinned plots and plots reserved from thinning at over 60 locations throughout the Inland Northwest.  Of those, we selected 14 locations to represent the range in productivity and initial stand density.  We found that thinning increased light availability by 400%, i..."
