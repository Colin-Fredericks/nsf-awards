 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nSaint Joseph's College of Maine is purchasing a 60 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR), an infrared spectrometer (IR), and software to investigate the effect of both horizontal and vertical inter-laboratory integration on STEM students' ability to collaborate, cooperate, mentor and learn.  The project is using spectroscopy (UV-Vis, IR, and NMR) as a unifying theme between courses.  Each physical science course is implementing lab experiments where students in different groups or sections are exchanging data and working with students in another group or section (horizontal integration).  Students are also exchanging data between different courses and academic levels (freshmen, sophomore, etc.) (vertical integration).  Facilitated and ad hoc meetings and virtual communities are forming to accomplish tasks, solve problems and to gain skills in forming professional relationships and scientific collaborations.  \r\n\r\nProject evaluation is being accomplished through surveys and academic assessments by the internal and external consultants.  Results are being reported on websites, at national professional society meetings, and in peer-reviewed journals.  This project is being conducted in an institution where nearly 70% of all students and half of all students majoring in science disciplines are women. Approximately 60% of the students are the first in their families to attend college, one quarter qualify for Pell grants, and of these, about half are from families whose incomes fall below the federal poverty line.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\n \n\nThis project investigated the use of spectroscopy as a tool to implement and investigate the effect of both horizontal and vertical inter-laboratory integration on students\u00c6 ability to collaborate, cooperate, mentor and learn. By horizontal integration we mean the exchange of data and knowledge between students in the same course. By vertical integration we mean the exchange of data, information and knowledge between students in different courses.  \n\n \n\nThe use of shared data and student collaborations model data sharing and collaborations that graduates will encounter in their professional careers. Spectroscopic data sharing will be facilitated by the use of a Spectral Database Manager which is uncommon in the undergraduate laboratory facilities.\n\n \n\nThe principle spectroscopic techniques used to effect the integration were infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis.) spectroscopy.  Both NMR and IR spectrometers were purchased as part of the project.  The investigations spanned the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, from freshman to senior years, and presented a progression of knowledge of spectroscopic techniques that served to unify and reinforce core concepts of inorganic, organic, analytical, and physical chemistry throughout the program.\n\n \n\nA baseline assessment of students\u00c6 spectroscopic knowledge was taken before and after each chemistry course.  In the second year of the study, we modified our assessment instrument to produce a refined assessment which measured students\u00c6 attitudes, their opinions, and their theoretical and practical knowledge.\n\n \n\nThree new undergraduate experiments were developed; one concerning IR in general chemistry, one concerning IR in organic chemistry and a kinetics experiment for general chemistry.  These all incorporated the sharing and/or pooling of spectroscopic data and subsequent class discussions.  The general chemistry IR experiment incorporated a technical writing component and the written product was reviewed by more senior students as per our vertical integration objective.  An additional experiment concerning the isolation and spectroscopic identification of seaweed pigments is being developed. \n\n \n\nAssessment results show that students showed significant improvement in both their confidence and ability in choosing the best spectroscopic technique for a problem and in interpreting spectroscopic data as a result of the project.  Several students attained a high degree of competency in obtaining and interpreting different types of spectra.\n\n \n\nAn online spectroscopy resource website suitable for undergraduate students and instructors was first established on an internal network and later migrated to the internet by student coding.  This site is currently being redesigned for easier upkeep.\n\n \n\nWhile the development of several new experiments and increased competency of students concerning spectroscopy are significant outcomes, the extensive integration of spectroscopy throughout the chemistry curriculum was not achieved.  The small number of science students proceeding beyond the sophomore level of chemistry, changes in the science staff and college administration during the period of the project and difficulty in achieving \"by-in\" by other faculty and staff being the major obstacles.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicholas Benfaremo"
