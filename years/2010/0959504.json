While most scientific visualization occurs in two dimensions, selective use of three dimensional immersive technology for modeling and simulation projects is proposed by Drs. Joiner, Chang and Morreale at Kean University in collaboration with Dr. Manson of the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey.  The specific research projects include topics in biochemistry, environmental studies, biology, meteorology, applied mathematics, psychology and computer science.  There is a strong STEM education component to the proposed activities since Kean and Stockton are first and foremost, teaching universities.  Nearly half of Kean's undergraduate population is minority and both schools have a significant percent of their student population who are first generation college students.  The award from NSF's Office of Cyberinfrastructure supports acquisition of advanced scientific visualization tools, with Kean receiving the most significant grant. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
