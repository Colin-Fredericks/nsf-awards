 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is awarding annual renewable scholarships to academically talented, financially needy undergraduate engineering students. The first cohort consists of 15 scholarship students. The second year, the program is funding 25 Engineering Leadership Pathway Scholars (ELPS) consisting of new and continuing scholarship recipients. The program size grows each year to a maximum of 35 scholarships. Scholars are recruited from sophomore and junior courses as well as community colleges and have completed the first two semesters of calculus. Scholarship recipients form a group of students engaged in personal leadership development activities in parallel with their academic development. Students develop their own visions of leadership and emerge with personal and professional goals, which help them make the best of their own talents as well as be prepared to tackle the challenges that face the nation's technical leaders. Eligible engineering disciplines include aerospace, chemical, civil, computer/software, electrical, materials, mechanical, industrial, and general. \r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT: The project provides the support services and activities to motivate and prepare students to complete the B.S. degree with attitudes, knowledge and skills to be leaders in the 21st century workforce and to pursue graduate degrees. The four-year program is generating 55 to 60 future leaders who can serve as role models for other students. An additional outcome is a better understanding of the characteristics that define leadership and effective programs to develop those characteristics. The ELPS program is housed in the Engineering Student Success Center, which provides meeting space, study carrels, computer facilities, advising, and professional development guidance. ELP Scholars also benefit from tutoring, workshops, field trips, as well as interaction with faculty, graduate students participating in research, and practitioners. \r\nBROADER IMPACTS: The ELPS program is recruiting a diverse applicant pool (many of whom are underrepresented in STEM or who are first generation in college), and providing U.S. industry with engineers who have practiced leadership skills. The ELPS program is meant to serve as a model for leadership development throughout the College of Engineering. Development of activities with three feeder community colleges involves community college students in leadership development. Lessons learned are being disseminated through conferences, presentations, and archived articles, and used to expand the ELPS program to all interested engineering students.",
