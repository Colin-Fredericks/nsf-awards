 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide travel fellowships to support US students to \r\nattend the 2nd workshop on Large-scale Data Mining: Theory and Applications \r\n(LDMTA) in conjunction with KDD 2010 on July 25, 2010 in Washington DC. The \r\nLDMTA workshop will cover topics on  scalable machine learning and data mining \r\nalgorithms, and their applications, such as medical informatics, \r\ntelecommunications, social network analysis, and e-commerce. PIs aim at \r\ninvestigating the scalability and efficiency of existing machine learning and \r\ndata mining algorithms with respect to both theoretical and experimental \r\nperspectives. \r\n\r\nDue to the recent data explosion in many applications, governments and \r\ncompanies can easily collect data spanning terabytes, petabytes or more. \r\nSeveral traditional data mining algorithms need to be replaced, or drastically \r\nre-designed, to handle such volumes through parallel architecture such as \r\nMapReduce/Hadoop. The focus of the workshop is exactly to bridge the gap \r\nbetween theory and practice of data mining, focusing on the fundamental \r\nresearch on large-scale data mining theory and applications. The goal of this \r\nworkshop is to assemble the leaders in data mining research and industry to \r\npresent their views on the need and challenges for large-scale data mining and\r\nalso attract graduate students to study on large-scale data mining.\r\nThe proposed student support will attract the US students to participate in \r\nthis workshop and present their works on topics related to large-scale data \r\nmining, to encourage them to focus on the extremely promising research \r\ndirection of large-scale data mining as their thesis research. In particular,\r\nPIs will try to broaden the involvement of female and minority students by\r\nprioritizing the award to them. \r\n\r\nFor further information about this project see the project website at \r\nhttp://arnetminer.org/LDMTA2010",
