Forty new Video on Demand videos generate new understandings and address knowledge gaps identified by Season 1 participants.  \r\n\r\nWhile focusing on evidence of usage, the new videos contain a 101 Series to delve deeper into educational and career pathways with more in-depth looks at industry, and Technicians Tips.  The project advances knowledge and understanding across the ATE disciplines and bridges users, information and resources for audiences that include students, technicians, parents, educators, high school guidance counselors, industry leaders and policy makers.",
