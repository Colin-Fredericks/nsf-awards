  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOnly the educational/public outreach portion of this award was funded: The Launchpad Astronomy Workshop for Writers (www.launchpadworkshop.org).  The goal of the workshop is to train writers in modern astronomy so that they will include more and better astronomy in their work, leading to some stealth education for the public in their entertainment, as well as inspiration for the next generation of scientists (who often self-report that science fiction led to an interest in science more generally).  The workshop ran for a week each in July of 2011 and 2012, resulting in training some three dozen writers of diverse backgrounds and audiences (as well as several editors and one movie director).  Of particular interest are the screenwriters for TV and movies who reach a very large number of viewers, as well as the writers of children and young adult fiction.  Participant evaluations were uniformly positive.  The payoff will come over time as these creators incorporate workshop knowledge and utilize the newly developed networks to check their science in their future stories.  One immediate constructive result was that a 2012 participant, novelist and editor Jody Lynn Nye, selling a Launchpad anthology series to feature astronomy-based short stories, to be co-edited with the principal investigator Mike Brotherton.  Brotherton is, in addition to being a professor of astornomy, also a published science fiction novelist. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael S Brotherton"
