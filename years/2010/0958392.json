 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural language processing, information extraction, information\r\nintegration and other text processing solutions are central components\r\nof computer science, and key tools for addressing the ever-increasing\r\nproblems in information overload.  Issues of information overload are\r\nnot only personal problems, but critical for business productivity,\r\nnational defense, and increasingly government decision-making and\r\ntransparency.\r\n\r\nState-of-the-art natural language processing is increasingly based on\r\nmachine learning.  However, the methodologies can be complex, and\r\nsoftware infrastructure necessary for such systems is generally\r\ndifficult to develop from scratch.  To address this need we have\r\ncreated MALLET (MAchine Learning for LanguagE) and FACTORIE (Factor\r\ngraphs, Imperative, Extensible), open-source software toolkit that run\r\nin the Java virtual machine.  They provide many modern\r\nstate-of-the-art machine learning methods, specially tuned to be\r\nscalable for the idiosyncrasies of natural language data, while also\r\napplying well to many other discrete non- language tasks.\r\n\r\nThe project will fill three critical gaps: (1) broadening these\r\ntoolkits' applicability to new data and tasks (with better end-user\r\ninterfaces for labeling, training and diagnostics), (2) greatly\r\nenhancing their research-support capabilities (with infrastructure for\r\nflexibly specifying model structures), and (3) improving their\r\nunderstandability and support (with new documentation, examples,\r\nonline community support).\r\n\r\nThe project will have a direct positive impact on NLP and other\r\nmachine learning research, on teaching, and on collaborative research\r\nactivities.  Well-designed toolkits not only help researchers avoid\r\nduplicate implementation effort, but (a) they encourage sharing of\r\nalgorithms and code, and thus also cultivate increased collaboration\r\nand intellectual flow of ideas; (b) they foster the communication of\r\ndetailed clarity of algorithms and scientific reproducibility; (c)\r\nthey help \"level the playing field\" by providing state-of-the-art\r\nimplementations of foundational building blocks and recent methods to\r\ntop-tier and small institutions alike; (d) they supply a teaching\r\ntool, not only by making it easy for students to experiment with the\r\nsupplied research methodologies.  Furthermore, by providing multiple\r\nready-to-use systems, non-programmers will have access to modern,\r\nscalable implementations of text processing tools that will spread\r\nknowledge and use of these techniques across fields, to the social\r\nsciences, humanities, and bio-medical fields.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at the URL:\r\nhttp://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/nsf-mallet",

Issues of information overload are not only personal problems, but critical for business productivity, national defense, and increasingly (as the Obama administration has made a stated goal of \"evidence-based\" policy) government decision-making and transparency.\n\nState-of-the-art natural language processing is increasingly based on machine learning.  However, the methodologies can be complex, and software infrastructure necessary for such systems is generally difficult to develop from scratch.  To address this need we have created MALLET (MAchine Learning for LanguagE) and FACTORIE (FACTOR graphs, Imperative, Extensible), open-source software toolkits that run in the Java virtual machine.

We completed integration of FACTORIE into the Apache SPARK pipeline (a widely-used fast and general engine for big data processing).  As a result, FACTORIE can now seamlessly be used to run a complete natural language processing pipeline in parallel, using SPARK distributed parallelization on data stored in SPARK storage standards; we coordinated with the SPARK team in making this possible.\n\nBy providing reusable building blocks of cutting-edge machine learning capabilities to natural language practitioners, our work has accelerated research in these areas, advanced and spread understanding of scientific details not often sufficiently explained in the text of research papers, and integrate research and education.  By providing multiple ready-to-use systems, non-programmers now have access to modern, scalable implementations of text processing tools that have spread knowledge and use of these scientific techniques across fields, to the social sciences, humanities, and bio-medical fields.\n\nMALLET 2.0 and FACTORIE 1.2 have been publicly released as open source software, and are available through mallet.cs.umass.edu and factorie.cs.umass.edu respectively.\n\nMALLET is now widely used for topic modeling in the social sciences and humanities.
