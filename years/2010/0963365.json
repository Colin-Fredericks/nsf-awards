 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe new Marist College technology research lab provides students and faculty access to cutting edge technologies for research and research training projects. It supports applied research projects with industry and academic partners and also provides a research training environment for over 600 members of the Enterprise Computing Community that was formed through a NSF CPATH award.\r\nFaculty members use the facilities to conduct research in a wide variety of STEM areas, including mathematical modeling of ocean currents and wave propagation, data mining for the detection and prevention of errors in the coding of medical diagnoses, application of computationally intensive routines to address problems in classical thermodynamics, and exploration of the use of cutting edge large system technologies such as virtualization and cloud computing to help small to medium-sized companies become more efficient and cost effective. \r\nMany of the research questions explored in the new lab are introduced by industry partners. These applied research collaborations are aimed at solving real-world business problems. Undergraduates and graduate students also benefit by learning the discipline of inquiry based research and experience the rigor of scientific methods and practices.  Students learn firsthand how to apply new skills through their participation in research projects with faculty as well as academic and industry partners.  \r\nResearchers will disseminate their findings through peer-reviewed journals and presentations at national conferences. Students will also present their work at both regional and national conferences. Applied research results will bring practical benefits to individual companies and by extension to the marketplace.",

Individual students were hired as research assistants by the faculty using the lab.\n\nMarist has attracted additional grants and research opportunities:\n\nA new mainframe system was added to the lab with funding from a \n2011 Major Research Instrumentation grant from the NSF.  The system was installed February 2012 and is now running dozens of research projects.\n\nThe ECRL facility was a strong consideration in Marist being awarded $3M grant from New York State (NYS) in December 2012.  Marist was designated a NYS Center of Excellence in Cloud Computing and Analytics.  Additional research equipment will be installed in the lab, expanding its performance and capabilities to address new areas of research, e.g. business analytics, 'big data' applications, in-memory computing, and high performance computing. The grant will enable Marist to be a full participant in the High Performance Computing Consortium, a research network between major research universities across New York State.\n\nIBM has given Marist faculty awards in research areas such as SDN, Analytics, Mobile applications, and Cloud Computing.  Marist has established an SDN research facility for university and academic researchers and now offers a compliance testing facility for new equipment providers, one of the first in the country.
