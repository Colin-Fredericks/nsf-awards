The laser fluorination system will allow small-scale isotopic variation studies, increase sample throughput, and allow isotope measurements on ?resistant? minerals. Isotopes will be used to understand the role of aqueous fluids in the genesis of magmas, hydrothermal systems, sedimentary basins, hydrothermal vent systems, shallow subduction zones, and in groundwater circulation. Water-rock interaction history will be applied to understand metamorphic rock exhumation. Laser fluorination would allow oxygen isotope measurements on individual minerals within rocks, allowing better constraints on geochronologic cooling. As part of the Geoscience Diversity Enhancement Program (GDEP), samples from the Catalina Schist will be analyzed by the new system to better understand petrologic and tectonic evolution. Oxygen isotope data from thermally-altered intrusions will be used to establish the degree of isotopic disequilibrium to estimate water-rock ratios and duration of hydrothermal activity in the Southern White Pine Range in Nevada. In addition, fluid inclusions will be analyzed using laser fluorination to reveal silica sources. Stable isotopes will be used to source historic gunflints and paleoindian quartzite tools. Biogenic silica and sediment organic matter will be analyzed and used as a proxies to estimate past oxygen and salinity concentrations. This fluorination system would allow CSULB to provide a system-wide facility for geology and archeology isotope and trace elements (GAITE) measurements. The instrument will be used for undergraduate and graduate-level student training. CSULB is a Hispanic Serving Institution and is highly ranked for conferring minorities with bachelors. The Institute for Integrative Research in Materials, Environments, and Society (IIRMES) was formally established in 2004 with a purpose to promote intellectual exchange and foster interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty and students with different educational and research backgrounds. The PI will be responsible for building the vacuum lines The instruments will be installed at the CSULB stable isotope laboratory in the IIRMES facility. The facility will operate as fee-based for outside samples. \r\n\r\n***",
