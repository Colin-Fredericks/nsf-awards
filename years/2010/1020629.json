 "awd_abstract_narration": "Streams and rivers worldwide, and their streamside (riparian) ecosystems, are in trouble.  The habitats in these linked ecosystems, and the organisms they support, are declining at an alarming rate.  Many native species of freshwater fish, crayfishes, and mussels in North America are already imperiled or extinct.  Representative case studies show that rivers on the western Great Plains have already dried substantially and some are projected to be lost completely within a few decades due to pumping for agriculture, extirpating all aquatic species.  In addition, mountaintop removal to mine coal in Appalachia has buried 1200 miles of headwater streams so far.  Urbanization and increased storm water runoff continues to cause serious impairment to streams throughout the United States.  The public is largely unaware of these drastic changes, and there is limited national recognition of the need for conservation of stream ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to write a highly readable book that eduates a wide audience about the importance of streams and rivers, their biota, and their strong interconnections with riparian forests and grasslands.  This work will synthesize nearly 20 years of NSF-funded research with Japanese and American colleagues, and capitalize on a documentary film (RiverWebs) that has been broadcast by television to >70 million homes in 30 states.  The approach will be to develop engaging stories which pique the reader's interest, while teaching them how aquatic ecologists conduct their work and about the wonder and serendipity of scientific discoveries.  Subsequent chapters will explore what scientists have discovered about streams, and present several case studies on the drastic decline in their biota.  The final chapter will ask what the future is for rivers and streams, develop an ethic and philosophy for why humans need rivers to sustain healthy societies, and chart a course for how we can maintain functioning streams.  An additional goal is to reach two new audiences beyond traditional book readers: the mobile generation that uses the web and social networking sites, via video clips and podcasts; and some of the 2.9 million U.S. students with learning disabilities, using rich illustrations, an audio book, and targeted learning resources, to engage them in science, especially field ecology.",

The aim of the book is to communicate the science of stream ecology and conservation to a broad public audience by drawing them into a powerful story, teaching them in lay terms about streams and how scientists study them, and presenting a personal philosophy about why streams and rivers are essential for human well-being.  The writing was aided by two writer\u00c6s residencies in Oregon during fall 2011 at the Andrews Forest Long-Term Ecological Research Site and the Sitka Center for Art and Ecology.  I commissioned 10 pen-and-ink drawings for the chapter title pages to add value to the book.  I collaborated with the non-profit organization Freshwaters Illustrated to film and produce six short video \"book trailers\" in Japan (summer 2012) and the U.S. (2012-2013) on themes in the book, to draw readers in.  I created a website to provide these videos to potential readers, as well as blogs about the themes, and reviews and events.  The videos have been viewed by &gt;3700 people so far, and the blog page by nearly 550 people.\n\nAfter the book was published in February 2015, I engaged potential readers and followers in the mobile generation on Twitter and currently have 105 followers.  I gave 18 invited talks to diverse audiences throughout the U.S. focused on the ideas in the book, the process of communicating science, and the book itself (or a combination of these things).  I also gave 8 invited presentations about the science and ideas behind the book at various institutions and agencies throughout the world.  I lead a group of collaborators to organize a special session linked to a keynote talk at the Joint Aquatic Science Meeting in 2014 (Portland, OR) on science communication, and spoke about the book in that session. \n\nI have solicited opinions about the book and how it could best be used in education from a small sample of middle and high school teachers.  All were enthusiastic about the book and thought that it and the videos will be highly useful for classes in general biology, ecology, and environmental science.  I plan to focus next on promoting the book to this audience of STEM educators.  I also plan to narrate an audio book and provide a coordinated set of materials to teachers, especially teachers of students with disabilities.\n\nThe book has received good reviews, both in the press and based on comments by others.  Overall, the book and videos have been successful in reaching at least a segment of a broad public audience with an inspiring story about science, streams, and why these ecosystems are essential for our future.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kurt D Fausch"
