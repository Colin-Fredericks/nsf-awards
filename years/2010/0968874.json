 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work continues and further develops a highly successful collaboration among several institutions in the US and Brazil to investigate the interactions of low-energy electrons with polyatomic molecules, and in particular with biofuels and other biological molecules. The collaboration includes scientists from California State University, Fullerton, the California Institute of Technology, the State University of Campinas. It involves both experimental and theoretical groups who have come together to work jointly on problems where they have overlapping interests and complementary expertise. Major focuses in future work will be electron-impact excitation of polyatomic molecules and dissociative electron attachment to polyatomics. Calculations and measurements of electron-impact excitation processes in polyatomics are challenging, and results are scarce despite the need for such data in understanding reactive plasmas and discharges. To build expertise in this area, measurements and calculations are carried out for two prototypical molecules, ethylene and furan, both of which have low-lying triplet states well isolated from other thresholds. Following that, measurements and calculations of electron-impact excitation cross sections for methanol and ethanol will be done. Electron-impact excitation of these prototypical and ubiquitous alcohols is of fundamental interest and also has high technological relevance: dissociative excitation and ionization are key processes in spark ignition of alcohol fuels, and rate data are needed for modeling and optimizing the ignition process. Collaborators in Brazil affiliated with the Bioethanol Science and Technology Center in Campinas are initiating studies of spark ignition that will involve both laboratory measurements and numerical modeling, and those studies will make direct use of the electron-impact excitation cross sections that will be measured and calculated as part of this project.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are that electron-molecule collisions at low energy present many features of fundamental interest and pose a great challenge to both experimental and computational methods, but they also have wide technological significance, being relevant to the physics of plasmas and discharges, the upper atmosphere, and circumstellar and interstellar media. In the specific case of methanol and ethanol, accurate cross-section data for the major collision processes, including elastic scattering, excitation, and ionization, are needed for numerical modeling and optimization of discharges used to ignite alcohols used as fuels. Such modeling may lead to improved spark-plug designs that produce more complete combustion and thus higher fuel efficiency. Moreover, an understanding of electron driven excitation and dissociation in the alcohols may give insights into the same processes in related biomolecules, including sugars. A central component of the project is providing opportunities for young scientists to gain experience doing science in an international context, with US students making extended visits to do research in Brazil and vice versa. This project is co-funded with the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
