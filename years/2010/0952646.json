 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to predict the aggregation kinetics of monoclonal-type antibodies, and to explore novel strategies to prolong antibody's shelf life. Antibody is important for disease treatment and medical diagnosis. Aggregation is a critical concern in antibody drug manufacturing, delivery, and storage. Because once aggregated, the unfolded antibodies will fail to recognize or bind antigens, which will reduce the drug efficacy and may cause harmful immune responses. To achieve the goal, the proposed research approaches are to: (a) identify the role of mobility of monoclonal antibodies in drug solutions, (b) predict the aggregation kinetics, and (c) provide a computational tool that can facilitate the antibody drug development. Models will be developed and validated against light scattering, spectroscopy, and rheological experiments.\r\n\r\nAvailability of high quality, concentrated, yet low cost antibody drug has great economical and societal impacts. If successful, the project will enhance the antibody manufacturing and storage processes, which can save billions in healthcare costs and make the life-saving medicines broadly available especially in developing countries. The integrated research and education project will provide interdisciplinary training on nano-bio-mechanics for students in engineering and pharmaceutical science programs. Innovated modeling courses will be developed. The scientific materials will be demonstrated to high school teachers and K-12 students and will be made available to public using podcasting technology. Advanced results will also be disseminated in a scientific workshop.",
