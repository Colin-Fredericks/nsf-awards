The PIs are well qualified to plan and implement this workshop at a high level of proficiency and professionalism. \r\nThe plan for the workshop is well organized and thought of including guest speakers, and activities with  keynote speakers. This would be more rigorous than the current plan. The workshop outcomes are very comprehensive and well presented, with evaluation plan to cover outcomes as well as integrating diverse research ideas and approaches to advance breast cancer research.",
