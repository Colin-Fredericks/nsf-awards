 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cloud computing provides economic advantages from shared resources, but security is a major risk for remote operations and a major barrier to the approach, with challenges for both hosts and the network. NEBULA is a potential future Internet architecture providing trustworthy networking for the emerging cloud computing model of always-available network services. NEBULA addresses many network security issues, including data availability with a new core architecture (NCore) based on redundant connections to and between NEBULA core routers, accountability and trust with a new policy-driven data plane (NDP), and extensibility with a new control plane (NVENT) that supports network virtualization, enabling results from other future Internet architectures to be incorporated in NEBULA. NEBULA?s data plane uses cryptographic tokens as demonstrable proofs that a path was both authorized and followed. The NEBULA control plane provides one or more authorized paths to NEBULA edge nodes; multiple paths provide reliability and load-balancing. The NEBULA core uses redundant high-speed paths between data centers and core routers, as well as fault-tolerant router software, for always-on core networking. The NEBULA architecture removes network (in) security as a prohibitive factor that would otherwise prevent the realization of many cloud computing applications, such as electronic health records and data from medical sensors. NEBULA will produce a working system that is deployable on core routers and is viable from both an economic and a regulatory perspective.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n* Overview\n\n    The emerging cloud and mobile environment is the latest\n incarnation of the 1960's vision of \"utility computing,\" whereby a\n trustworthy network would enable end-users to connect from\n anywhere to services that are always available.  The NEBULA-FIA\n project was a multi-institutional collaboration to design and\n prototype a network architecture capable of supporting cloud-based\n critical applications via secure, highly available, and robust\n communication services.\n\n* Intellectual Merits\n\n Enabling trustworthy cloud computing is a demanding goal.  It\n entails, for instance, strong guarantees of availability of cloud\n services and of integrity and/or secrecy of traffic to, within,\n and from the cloud.  To tackle this challenge, the NEBULA-FIA\n project envisioned an architecture consisting of three tiers: (1)\n the network core (NCore) that connects cloud data centers to each\n other; (2) the Nebula data plane (NDP) that connects data centers\n to the access networks (and hence to end-users); and (3) the\n Nebula Virtual and Extensible Networking Techniques (NVENT) that\n offers users a dynamic and flexible spectrum of connectivity\n choices (e.g., HIPAA-compliant or high-reliability paths).\n\n The NEBULA-FIA subteam at Stevens focused on defining and\n prototyping a design for NDP (joint with collaborators at Stanford\n University and at the University of Texas at Austin), as well as\n on integrating this prototype with select components of the NVENT\n layer (joint with collaborators at the University of\n Pennsylvania).  The proposed data-plane design [1] incorporates a\n novel path verification mechanism to prevent unwanted traffic from\n consuming network resources (e.g., bandwidth available on\n transmission links, or state maintained in routing equipment).\n Technically, this is accomplished by ensuring that before data\n packets are sent over any network path, each domain along the path\n has (explicitly or through delegation) consented to the use of the\n path.  A domain's consent is embodied in a cryptographic token\n called a proof of consent, which the sender embeds in each packet\n that she launches along the path.  As the packet traverses the\n path, it is incrementally marked with proofs of provenance, which\n essentially certify that the packet has indeed traveled through\n each domain on the path, in the correct order.  The requirement\n for explicit consent is a major difference from the current\n Internet architecture, and has substantial potential for improving\n security: for instance, since all traffic must be explicitly\n authorized and strong cryptographic mechanisms thwart spoofing,\n denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are much harder to carry out.  (In\n a DoS attack, malicious network actors, whether evil end-users or\n rogue network operators, overwhelm the victim with spurious\n service requests, causing a degradation in the quality of service\n experienced by honest end-users, or even interruption of service\n altogether.)\n\n The Stevens-UPenn integration effort resulted in a prototype\n combining the proposed NDP design with a control plane based on\n the RapidNet [2] declarative networking engine and on the\n service-access capabilities of the Serval [3] architecture.  While\n bare-bone, this prototype exhibits the increased resilience to\n network failures that was one of the goals of the NEBULA-FIA\n project.  A demo clip available at the project web site\n (http://nebula-fia.org) shows a video being streamed over a\n redundant connection, unaffected by multiple faults that were\n injected in the underlying network paths.\n\n* Broader Impact\n\n Besides contributing to the design space on network architectures\n with strong security guarantees, the work supported by this grant\n demonstrated the plausibility of carrying out rich per-packet\n cryptography at network line rates.  Specifically, the packet\n format and authentication component of the proposed data-plane\n design were shown to be amenable to hardware optimization\n resulting..."
