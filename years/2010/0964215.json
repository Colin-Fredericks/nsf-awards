 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns one of the fundamental challenges facing\r\ncontemporary science and engineering today, namely, the efficient\r\nprocessing and analysis of massive amounts of high-dimensional data,\r\nsuch as images, videos, web pages, and bioinformatics data. In short,\r\ndata now routinely lie in thousands or even billions of dimensions. On\r\nthe one hand, massive data collection is motivated by 1) scientific\r\ndiscovery and 2) the need for better engineering systems. On the other\r\nhand, the difficult task now is to conduct meaningful inference in\r\nsuch high dimensions, and draw correct conclusions from limited\r\namounts of sample data and with limited computational\r\nresources. Fortunately, scientific or engineering data often have very\r\nlow intrinsic complexity and dimensionality.  This project addresses\r\nthe opportunities offered by this common situation, establishes\r\nconditions under which reliable inference is actually possible, and\r\ndevelops computational tools for extracting key information from huge\r\ndata sets.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project is expected to have three outcomes: 1)\r\nthe development of innovative mathematics needed to study the recovery\r\nof data matrices from partial and corrupted information 2) the\r\ndevelopment of effective algorithms for recovering low-rank matrices\r\nand performing accurate dimensionality reduction with corrupted data\r\nand 3) the development of novel applications in which these techniques\r\nare expected to considerably advance the state-of-the-art.  With these\r\nnew tools, scientists and engineers will be able to efficiently\r\nextract correct information from data, which was previously\r\ninaccessible or intractable by conventional techniques. This will\r\nenable the development of far better computer vision systems for face\r\nrecognition, better compression schemes of video sequences, a better\r\nunderstanding of gene expression data, or better search engines for\r\nweb documents and images.",
