If employees believe that their jobs are endangered (even if they actually are not), they are less committed to their organizations, may look for alternative job opportunities. National governments and organizations thus have an interest in understanding the forces that affect employees? perceptions of their job security and employment prospects. By distinguishing between policies that focus on reducing employees' vulnerability (unemployment benefits) and policies that focus on reducing power differentials between the employee and the employer (dismissal protection), the effectiveness of different types of labor market institutions will be tested. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe findings of this research can be used to inform the development of public policies and organizational measures to reduce job insecurity and its negative consequences.",
