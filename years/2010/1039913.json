Faculty members from the College of Engineering and Physiological Sciences have been involved in this new program. There has been a significant increase in research activities and collaborations among these faculty members, in the areas of biomechanics, biomaterials, bioelectricity, bioinformatics and bio-nano technology. Many research projects conducted by these faculty members involve protein-protein interactions and biomarkers studies. The surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) ProteinChip reader is a rapid and high throughput system to study proteomics, protein interactions and enzymatic kinetic reactions. This technology has a high repeatability and only requires minimum sample volumes, which is a significant advantage for many low-yield biological systems. The ProteinChip reader can achieve ample information that would be otherwise undetectable from other measurement techniques. The ProteinChip technology will contribute significantly to the developing biomedical research in proteomics and biomarker studies. A SELDI ProteinChip reader will provide researchers, not only from OSU, but also those from nearby research institutes, a powerful new tool to broaden their research capabilities and to advance their research in proteomics and biomarker studies significantly.",
