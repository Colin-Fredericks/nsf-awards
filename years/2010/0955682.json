 "awd_abstract_narration": "Habitat modification and climate change are occurring at unprecedented rates globally. While tools to predict future environments have become increasingly sophisticated, there is little understanding of how biodiversity will respond to novel environments. The current proposal represents collaboration among eight entomological collections in California to digitize specimens and thus allow assessment of how distributions of organisms have been modified through environmental change. It makes use of a long history of entomological collecting in the state to develop a database of approximately 1 million georeferenced specimens collected at focal localities over the last century. The specimen data will be used in geospatial analyses to understand the relationship between the distribution of species and the type and extent of habitat modification. The project will serve as a model for integrating data across multiple institutions and incorporating the combined data within a geospatial framework. Human-driven environmental change has already caused huge impacts on biological systems. To understand how biodiversity will respond to environmental change in the future, we must learn from their responses in the past. A large amount of data is available on organisms that existed in environments before and after habitat modification over the last century; however, much of this information is hidden within museum collections, held on labels among millions of specimens. The proposed digitization and georeferencing of these collections will transform research capability and access to information by both scientists and the public. It will result in a fully georeferenced database of target taxa from natural reserves throughout California that will be searchable and available on web-accessible maps. The proposal includes entomological museums of all sizes and audiences in California and provides education of graduate and undergraduate students in taxonomy and systematic, coupled with the use of bioinformatics and geospatial modeling as applied to habitat modification and climate change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Project Outcomes for\n\"Collaborative Research: CalBug, an Interactive Database Using Arthropods to Examine Impacts of Climate Change and Habitat Modification\"\n \n\n     CalBug is a collaboration of the eight major entomology collections in California that captured capture nearly a million specimen-level data records from our combined holdings. As a preliminary we focused on developing and testing methods and workflows to increase the rate of data capture, while maximizing data quality.  These data were then analyzed using geospatial technology to explore the relationship between changes in distribution and habitat modification.\n\n     The California Academy of Sciences (CAS) is one of the partner institutions.  CAS co-PI?s Charles Griswold and the late Norman Penny supervised staff, volunteers and students to capture 221,370 new arthropod specimen records which were augmented by 577,591 records from other CAS projects to total 798.961 individual arthropod specimen records captured from CAS alone.  Theses comprise at least some data for 153 different families of Arthropods. All these data have been entered into an application of Symbiota called Monarch that will soon have a public portal.\n\n     In addition to the involvement of numerous volunteers by co-PI Penny, co-PI Griswold involved and supervised three female MSc students through San Francisco State University: Erika Garcia, Tracy Audisio and Liz Morrill.  All contributed to the database and conducted research on evolution and taxonomy of spiders.\n\n     Finally, as a model of the sorts of insights available only through collaborative projects such as Calbug, let us examine the results of the California Odonata database*, which was pioneered by UC Berkeley PhD student and project participant Joan Ball-Damerow.  She accessed 32,025 records from all combined sources, comprising 106 species within nine families that are known to occur in California.  The earliest records in the database were from 1879 and the last year of record in the database was 2013.  Her project proved that Odonata species in California have expanded northwards by an average of around 78 km and demonstrated an average increase in northern range margins of 65 km.  While species richness at individual sites did not change significantly, we found that odonate assemblages have become more similar across sites.  Homogenization is a result of the expansion of highly mobile habitat generalists, the decline of both habitat specialists and species with an overwintering diapause stage.\n\n     This model study reveals the richness of biodiversity data and predictive power that are possible only through collaborative studies like \"Collaborative Research: CalBug, an Interactive Database Using Arthropods to Examine Impacts of Climate Change and Habitat Modification\" and shows the promise of comparable and timely studies to come.\n\n \n *From: Ball-Damerow JE, M?Gonigle LK, Resh VH (2014) Changes in occurrence, richness, and biological traits of dragonflies and damselflies  (Odonata) in California and Nevada over the past century.
