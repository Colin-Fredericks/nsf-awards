 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project tests the hypothesis that past abrupt changes like the Younger Dryas cold event, the Older Dryas cold period, Intra-Aller\u00f8d cold period, and the 8.2 ka cooling event, as well as future abrupt changes related to human alteration of the atmosphere, may be immediately preceded by \"variance amplification\" that drives the system to tipping points that usher in the new steady-state climate conditions. The researchers aim to test for such variance amplification during deglaciation using tree-rings from the Great Lakes region as high-resolution climate proxies.\r\n\r\nThe Great Lakes region is targeted by the researchers for investigating variance amplification because it is close enough to the North Atlantic to be strongly teleconnected to climate events spawned there and events in the Great Lake region itself may have triggered some of these hemisphere-wide climate excursions.\r\n\r\nThe primary broader impacts involve supporting undergraduate students in the project and creating a summer short course in dendroclimatology and related sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBACKGROUND\n\nAfter the Last Glacial Maximum 21,000 years ago, temperatures began to rise as the last ice age gave way to the warm Holocene interglacial period beginning 11,500 years ago.  However, the final millennia of the Late Pleistocene warming experienced abrupt rise of CO2, large-scale reshuffling of atmospheric circulation, and a \"flickering\" climate characterized by several short-cooling excursions with full-glacial-like temperatures.  Heretofore, ice cores, marine sediments and pollen records have provided the means of detection of these events and their impact on the environment, but the high-resolution records contained in tree rings of mid-North America had not been systematically explored because of their relative scarcity.\n\nThis project focused on gathering Late Pleistocene tree-ring proxies from the Great Lakes region for studying annual, decadal and centennial climatic variability and its consequences to the environment and ecosystems. The region notably experienced the retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet, which opened up terrain to major vegetation and faunal transformations (including humans and megafauna). The overarching goal was to develop a comprehensive network of subfossil tree-ring chronologies from buried and submerged forest beds, and from glacial and flood-deposited logs dating between 14ka and 8 ka in the Great Lakes region.\n\nPRIMARY OUTCOMES\n\nDespite risks associated with this type of project, it was remarkably successful in terms of finding old and new sites, and obtaining multiple samples at many of the sites, which helped contributes to robust chronologies.  The products of this project comprise records of climate proxies from tree rings (width, d13C and d18O), primarily from within a four-state network of subfossil wood sites (over 65 locations), whose temporal placements were well-constrained with radiocarbon dating.  Individual records provided important environmental information for conditions at specific sites, but the whole dataset afforded the opportunity detailed, multi-scale reconstruction of hydroclimatic settings during the period of flickering climate.
