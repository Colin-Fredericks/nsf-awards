 "awd_abstract_narration": "The solid earth plays a major role in the long-term geologic carbon cycle.  Atmospheric, oceanic, and mantle derived CO2 or CO2-rich fluids reacts with silicate minerals and/or dissolved cations in the lithosphere to form secondary carbonate minerals in a variety of geological environments (regional metamorphism, contact metamorphism, subduction zone metamorphism, hydrothermal and ore-forming systems in the continental and oceanic crust, sedimentary basins, and weathering).  The net rate, timescales, and fluxes of CO2 into secondary carbonates via these carbonation reactions thus exerts a first order control on the global carbon cycle balance, and serves as a monitor of broader chemical transport via fluid flow and related tectonic processes within these diverse lithospheric contexts.  In order to interrogate and quantify these matters of rate, timing, and flux of CO2 (and hydrothermal fluid flow in general) within the lithosphere over geologic (i.e. >1 Myrs) timescales, an accurate and precise carbonate geochronometer is required.  \r\n\r\nCarbonate geochronology has proven to be a significant challenge due to natural complexities and analytical limitations.  This study is focused on improving our ability to directly measure the timing of carbonate mineralization by refining and validating both the U/Pb and Sm/Nd carbonate geochronometers.  Its developmental emphasis will be on the less-frequently tested Sm/Nd system for carbonates, and on the subsequent integration and cross-checking of Sm/Nd and U/Pb data.  This development will take advantage of new analytical and sample preparation techniques that have already been developed at BU and elsewhere.  Preliminary data suggest that carbonate minerals datable by Sm/Nd do exist, though the exact context and identity of the datable mineral?s occurrence is not clear.  The team will seek to refine carbonate geochronology by, 1) careful sample characterization to identify the exact minerals that are ultimately being dated as well as their geological occurrence, 2) refining sample preparation methods to separate and extract datable co-genetic phases for precise Sm/Nd and U/Pb geochronological analysis, 3) establish protocols for testing the accuracy of carbonate geochronology.  Three field contexts of carbonate mineralization will be explored including 1) regional metamorphic carbonate, 2) hydrothermal carbonate associated with sulfide/sulfate or ore forming systems, and 3) modern carbonates forming at hot springs and on the sea floor.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide new tools that solid-earth geoscientists can use to 1) explore, quantify, and illuminate the role of the solid-earth in the global geological carbon cycle, and 2) explore the rate, timing, and flux of fluid flow and associated chemical transport and tectonic processes in the lithosphere in general.  Through undergraduate coursework and high school outreach programs in place at BU and Stanford, students will be educated as to the relevance of the solid earth in broader geoscience issues including carbon management, climate, and earth evolution.  The project will bring together two geochemists with complementary tools and interests and will contribute to the establishment of new lab infrastructure at Stanford for an early career PI.  The BU graduate student who will drive this research will contribute to work in both the BU and Stanford labs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCarbonate minerals (ex. calcite, magnesite, ankerite, siderite) represent an important storehouse of carbon-dioxide in the solid earth.  They can form when crustal fluids become saturated in carbon-dioxide and/or react with silicate minerals to precipitate secondary carbonate minerals in veins or cracks within the solid earth.  This carbonate thus represents the solidification of carbon-dioxide from crustal fluids, carbonate-mineral reactions, faulting where cracks form, or even ore forming processes where carbonate is involved.  Thus, the ability to accurately date such carbonate mineralization is important in understanding the long term geologic reservoir of carbon-dioxide and processes like fluid flow, metamorphism, faulting, and ore mineralization.  Carbonate geochronology has proven to great challenge with only limited success having been shown for the uranium-lead radioactive dating method.  Here, we have explored a new geochronometer for secondary carbonate mineralization using the samarium-neodymium technique.  We have found that many secondary hydrothermal carbonates contain enough radioactive samarium (relate to daughter neodymium) to make the Sm-Nd system viable for geochronology.  We have established and tested an \"internal isochron\" method whereby we expose a single carbonate sample to a sequence of acid treatments, thus extracting Sm and Nd from multiple carbonate micro-reservoirs.  The resulting data array usually produces an \"isochron\" with age significance.  We have found that use of other isotopic systems (e.g. strontium or oxygen) can aid in identifying which carbonate fractions formed in equilibrium and at the same time, thus removing outlier data and leading to more accurate age.  While the Sm-Nd geochronometer does not always work for carbonates, we find that it tends to work best in systems where the uranium-lead method breaks down.  Major and trace element analyses of carbonate fractions (via electron microprobe mapping of carbonate thin sections and ICP-MS analysis of dissolved solutions) allow us to identify some of the micro-reservoirs we are chemically extracting.  Thus, the new Sm-Nd method provides a nice complement to U-Pb.  We tested the Sm-Nd carbonate geochronometer in several carbonate samples including: calcite/ankerite in New England metamorphic rocks, magnesite/calcite in Vermont talc-carbonate mineralization, siderite in Arizona hydrothermal copper ore, Austrian magnesite mineralization, and calcite in deep sea hydrothermal \"white smokers\" with ages spanning from 1.8 billion years old to modern \"zero-age\" samples.\n\nThe project has involved a team of collaborators from Boston University, Stanford, and Hannover (Germany).  A Boston University PhD student undertook the majority of the analytical work, learning valuable skills in isotope geochemistry.  Our methods have been presented at an international conference, and will be published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.   We expect this new tool to be of use to a broad range of geologists and geochemists wishing to track the movement of carbon-dioxide within the solid earth over geologic time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/26/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ethan F Baxter"
