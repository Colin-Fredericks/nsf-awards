 "awd_abstract_narration": "The standard instrumentality for the criminal acquisition and\r\ndistribution of images and video of child sexual exploitation is\r\npeer-to-peer (p2p) networks. Over 160,000 users based in the US\r\nare sharing child pornography (CP) using Gnutella alone. Past\r\nstudies have found that: 21% of CP possessors had images\r\ndepicting sexual violence to children such as bondage, rape, and\r\ntorture; 28% had images of children younger than 3 years old; and\r\nthat 16% of investigations of CP possession ended with discovery\r\nof persons who directly victimized children.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work aims to make significant advances in forensics\r\nmethods of investigating criminal acts on peer-to-peer file\r\nsharing networks. The project represents a unique\r\nmultidisciplinary collaboration between computer science and\r\ncriminology with close participation from existing law\r\nenforcement partners.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The project makes the following broad\r\ncontributions:\r\n\r\n- It proposes novel methods of tagging a remote computer over the\r\nnetwork with information that can uniquely identify it during a\r\nforensic examination. These serve as both identifiers and as\r\nindicia of intent.\r\n\r\n- It proposes to gather a foundational dataset regarding the\r\nprevalence and rate of spread of child pornography on p2p\r\nnetworks. Further, it proposes to measure and quantify the\r\nrelationships between child abuse and the trading of child\r\npornography on p2p networks.  Finally, it proposes the\r\ndevelopment of models to detect the trafficking of deliberately\r\nhidden child pornography on these networks.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact. The project aims to reduce the number of children\r\nsexually exploited each year by thwarting the trafficking of\r\ntheir images on p2p networks and via the capture of the contact\r\noffenders that rape, torture, or otherwise brutalize them.  This\r\nwork will increase cross-disciplinary collaboration between\r\ncomputer science and criminology and between law enforcement and\r\nacademia; effect technology transfer to law enforcement in the\r\nfield of online child pornography investigations, which will help\r\nreduce the number of victims of crimes in the future; and\r\nfacilitate broad educational outreach and recruitment of\r\nunder-represented minorities in undergraduate and graduate\r\nresearch in digital forensics.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at the URL: \r\n     http://prisms.cs.umass.edu/CNS-1018615",
