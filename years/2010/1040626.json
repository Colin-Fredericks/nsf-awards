 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at the design and experimental validation of a comprehensive clean-slate future Internet architecture. The proposed MobilityFirst architecture is motivated by the ongoing paradigm shift of Internet usage from today?s fixed PC/host (client)?server model to emerging mobile data services and pervasive computing applications. The major design goals of the architecture are: mobility as the norm with dynamic host and network mobility at scale; robustness with respect to intrinsic properties of the wireless medium; trustworthiness in the form of enhanced security and privacy; usability features such as support for context-aware services, evolvability, manageability and economic viability.  The key components of the MobilityFirst network design are: (1) separation of naming and addressing, implemented via a fast global dynamic name resolution service; (2) self-certifying public key network addresses to support strong authentication and security; (3) generalized delay-tolerant routing with in-network storage for packets in transit; (4) flat-label internetwork routing with public key addresses; (5) hop-by-hop transport protocols operating over segments rather than an end-to-end path; (6) a separate network management plane that provides enhanced visibility; (7) optional privacy features for user and location data; and (8) an integrated computing and storage layer to support programmability. The project?s scope includes architectural design, validation of key protocol components, testbed prototyping of the MobilityFirst architecture as a whole, and real-world protocol deployment on the GENI experimental infrastructure. The results of this project will provide architectural guidance for cellular-Internet convergence, and are expected to influence future technical standards in the networking industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe outcomes of this project have been primarily in two areas.  First,\nthe project has developed new approaches for scaling policy\nenforcement on networks.  Network security policies specify the\nconditions that traffic must meet to be routed on the network; these\nconditions might depend only on the packet header information (e.g.,\nthe source address, destination address, and protocol ports) or on\ntraffic content itself (e.g., whether analysis detects malware in the\npacket).  Traditional policy enforcement occurs at the ingress points\nof a network, but this means that each ingress point must be\nprovisioned with enough hardware to perform analysis during the peak\ndemand at that ingress.  Instead, our work has shown that there are\nsmarter ways to leverage available hardware resources elsewhere in the\nnetwork (e.g., at a datacenter) to enforce policies on network\ntraffic.  In particular, our work shows how to do so while respecting\nthe capacities of links and nodes, as well as limits on how much\nlatency increase can be imposed on network traffic (to get the traffic\nto the datacenter), for example.  Moreover, we have shown that it is\npossible to quickly recompute policy-enforcement assignments in\nresponse to changes in the traffic patterns.  While this capability\nhas immediate applications in scaling policy enforcement in networks\ntoday, it was motivated by an envisioned future internet in which\ninternet service providers might enforce policies on traffic at the\nrequest of other networks, e.g., to recognize and drop\ndenial-of-service traffic or other unwanted traffic well before it\nreaches the destination network.  The prospect of enforcing policies\non behalf of many destinations will place new scaling demands on these\nsystems that our innovations seek to address.\n\nSecond, our work has demonstrated a new design for global-scale\nservices that are dominated by read operations on objects but that\nstill support frequent updates to them.  In the context of a future\ninternet architecture, we anticipate this capability being used to\nbuild services to support naming (somewhat like today's Domain Name\nSystem, or DNS), routing, and propagating status updates about\ndifferent parts of the network.  Among the most difficult challenges\nto building such services is that updates in one part of the system\ncan take a long time to propagate to other parts of the system, in\nwhich case many of the read results might be stale.  At the core of\nour design is a new approach to limiting how out-of-date a read result\ncan be.  Previously known approaches to tightly limit the staleness of\nread results also come with fundamental performance costs.  In this\nwork we developed an alternative approach to limiting this staleness\nthat we believe should suffice for a wide range of applications.  We\nshowed using traces of DNS requests served by the world's largest\ncontent distribution network (Akamai) that our design is effective at\nscaling to massive demand while strongly limiting the staleness of the\ndata read from it.\n\nThis grant has served as the locus of research for two\nPh.D. students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nOne completed his dissertation during the course of this project and\nhas gone on to work in industry.  The other laid the foundation for\nhis dissertation but will continue his research past the grant's\ncompletion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Reiter"
