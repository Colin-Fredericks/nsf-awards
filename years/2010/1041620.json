 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports graduate student attendance and participation at the Second International Conference on Plant Peroxisome Research, which will be held as a satellite conference to the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Plant Biology (ASPB) in Minneapolis in 2011.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit.  Plant peroxisomes are involved in a variety of functions unique to plant physiology and development.  Many exciting discoveries about the biogenesis, function, and dynamic behavior of these organelles in plants have been reported recently.  Following the first International Workshop on Plant Peroxisomes (Edinburgh, UK) in 2009 and because of the importance of this topic, a decision was made to hold the next meeting in North America as part of the 20122 Annual ASPB Meeting.  Major scientific objectives of the meeting are the following:  (1) to report on the most recent advances in plant peroxisome research,  and (2) to promote further collaborations among laboratories world-wide.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts.  Plant peroxisomes are agriculturally and economically important.  Yet, a complete understanding of these organelles is lacking.  This meeting brings together plant peroxisome researchers to exchange the most recent and exciting scientific findings and to establish new collaborations.  This meeting also provides an excellent educational opportunity for the broader plant community and, in particular, graduate and undergraduate students  to learn about these important organelles.",
