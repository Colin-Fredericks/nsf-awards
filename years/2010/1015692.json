  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary focus of my research is the evolution of sea lions, seals, and walruses, and interpreting the behavior and ecology of their extinct ancestors.  To do so I am looking at how diet influences skull shape, as well as developing ways to determine the body weight and length of extinct pinnipeds based on skull measurements.   Participation in the Japan EAPSI program has greatly aided my research on this topic.  While in Japan I was able to collect data on a range of East Asian fossil seals, and also visited several museums in order to measure and photograph and extensive series of skeletal material referable to living species.  This has allowed me to develop a series of equations to accurately determine the body size of extinct species known from even very fragmentary material.  Extinct seals early on developed a wide variety of body sizes, particularly walruses, which had both small species similar to harbor seals in body size, as well as larger species more comparable to elephant seals.  I have also found a relationship between diet and the shape of the palate.   Within earless seals I was able to distinguish four different dietary groups: krill feeders, sea floor foragers, fish-eating suction feeders, and fish-eating bite feeders.  This has allowed me to interpret the ecology of fossil seals, which possess skull shapes correlating to both types of fish-eater. One extinct group, Acrophoca, has a strangely elongated skull and pursued a lifestyle not found amongst living species.  None of the fossil seals so far examined were interpreted to be primarily sea floor feeders or krill feeders, which suggest these are more recent adaptations.  Among walruses and sea lions, two groups are recognized, specialized suction feeders and generalist bite/suction feeders.  Walruses were found to be mostly suction feeders, even the early species which lack many of the characteristics of living walruses.  Beyond the data I collected during EAPSI, my time in Japan also gave me a greater appreciation of Japanese culture, and allowed me to develop create collaborative relationships with Japanese researchers.  This will strengthen my future research and enhance my career as a scientist.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Morgan M Churchill"
