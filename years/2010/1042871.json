 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference addresses questions that are fundamental to our understanding of biological function. It will bring together experimentalists and theorists from the fields of biology, applied mathematics and physics to focus on the role that is played by noise, dynamic fluctuations, and heterogeneity in determining the biology of cells and organisms. It will explore the intersection of several fields, including experimentation at the single-molecule and single-cell levels, stochastic physical theory, networks of biochemical and genetic interactions, and the evolution of cells.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe conference will promote the development of biology at its interface with physics, by bringing together leaders in the field with young investigators to enhance communication, seed new research ideas, and develop new leadership. The Conference will broaden participation in this field by addressing diversity (particularly with respect to underrepresented groups and women) in participants, speakers and session chairs.\r\n\r\nRecommended for award by the Cellular Systems and Biomolecular Systems Clusters",
