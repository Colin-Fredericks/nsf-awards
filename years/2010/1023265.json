 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective is to utilize a suite of instruments, including\r\nan airglow imager, to investigate short-period\r\ngravity waves in the Arctic atmosphere over Alaska. Short-period\r\ngravity waves are an important component of the larger atmospheric\r\ncirculation as these waves are believed to transport a large amount of\r\nvertical moment flux into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT)\r\nregion. While the propagation nature  and sources of these waves have\r\nbeen studied extensively at low- and mid-latitudes, little is known about their behavior at high latitudes. Recent efforts have\r\nbegun to characterize the waves over the Antarctic continent, while\r\nthe project proposed here will focus on the Arctic. Specifically, the\r\nproposed research will establish a long-term winter time series of\r\nshort-period gravity waves in the Arctic, including their dominant\r\nsource regions, and influences of large-scale tidal and planetary wave\r\nmotion. The co-located Rayleigh lidar will provide essential high\r\nvertical resolution temperature measurements to help elucidate the\r\nvertical wave propagation, individual wave contribution to the\r\nEliassen-Palm (EP) flux, and coupling between the lower and upper\r\natmosphere during stratospheric warming events.",

Gravity waves are an important atmospheric phenomenon naturally generated by strong weather disturbances, such as storms and fronts, and they can transfer large amounts of energy into the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. Remote-sensing measurements of these waves provide an important way to study their influence on the upper atmospheric dynamics and the coupling of weather into the Earth\u00c6s near-space environment. \n\n Coordinated measurements were made over three winter seasons to quantify wave characteristics using a specialized \"night-vision\" camera, a laser ranging (lidar) system and powerful radar system co-located at the Poker Flat Research Range in central Alaska.  Our primary role at Utah State University has been to provide expertise in image data analysis of the gravity waves by guiding the development of a graduate student (Mr. Michael Negale) in the analysis of these joint data sets and their interpretation.   His studies, focused on wave properties and coupling, have demonstrated quantitatively that variations in the middle atmospheric winds were responsible for the strong asymmetry observed in the wave propagation headings, helping establish that \"wind filtering\" is a key mechanism for controlling the upward flow of wave energy at high-latitudes.
