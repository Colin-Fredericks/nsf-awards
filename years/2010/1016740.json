 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spatial data collections with an incomplete coverage yield regions\r\nwith holes and separations that often cannot be filled by\r\ninterpolation. Geosensor networks typically generate such\r\nconfigurations, and with the proliferation of sensor colonies,\r\nthere is now an urgent need to provide users with better information\r\ntechnologies of cognitively plausible methods to search for or\r\ncompare available spatial data sets that may be incomplete. The\r\nobjective of the investigations is to advance knowledge about\r\nqualitative spatial relations for spatial regions with holes\r\nand/or separations.\r\n\r\nThe core activity is the study of the interplay between topological\r\nspatial relations with holed regions and topological spatial relations\r\nwith separated regions to address the potentially complex\r\nconfigurations that feature both holes and separations. Three\r\ncharacteristics of such a set of topological relations are addressed:\r\nthe formalization of a sound set of relations at a granularity that\r\nallows for the distinction of the salient features of holed and\r\nseparated regions, while offering the opportunity to generalize to\r\ncoarser relations in a meaningful and consistent way; the relaxation of\r\nsuch relations so that the determination of the most similar relations\r\nfollows immediately from the applied methodology; and the qualitative\r\ninference of new information from the composition of such relations to\r\nidentify inconsistencies and to drawn information that is not\r\nimmediately available from individual relations.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis is that combining the relation formalization with sound\r\nsimilarity and composition reasoning yields critical insights for a\r\nsufficiently expressive, common approach to modeling topological\r\nrelations for holed regions and regions with separations. The resulting\r\ntheory of topological spatial relations highlights a parallelism\r\nbetween relations with holed regions and regions with separations,\r\nwhich is most apparent when these regions are embedded on the\r\nsurface of the sphere, while some parts of these regularities are often\r\nhidden in the usual planar embedding.\r\n\r\nSince topological relations are qualitative spatial descriptions, they\r\ncome close to people's own reasoning, so that a better understanding of\r\nthe relations for compound spatial objects will have ramifications for\r\nqualitative spatial reasoning, without a need for drawing graphical\r\ndepictions to make inferences. It also lays the foundation for\r\nlinguistic constructs to communicate in natural language spatial\r\nconfigurations, ultimately leading to talking maps. An immediate impact\r\nof this theory of topological relations between holed and separated\r\nregions is on the querying and reasoning about dataset that are\r\ngathered by geosensor networks.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web page:\r\nURL:  http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~max/holesAndParts.html",
