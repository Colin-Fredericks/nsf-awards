 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of life's major decisions and issues about which individuals negotiate concern outcomes that will be experienced far off in the future (e.g., health decisions, vacation plans, business deals, retirement options, military strategy). In this project it is argued that just as the amount of time or temporal distance from when negotiation outcomes will be experienced can be an important element of negotiation, so too can the amount of physical (geographical) distance in a negotiation.  The proposed research relies on a framework that treats temporal and physical space as manifestations of the same concept (distance).  Prior research by the principal investigator has demonstrated that increased temporal distance is beneficial for individuals during certain types of negotiations (e.g., integrative situations - where parties involved have different priorities across the issues under dispute).  The current research investigates whether large amounts of distance in negotiation increase individuals' focus on higher level information (motives, values, dispositions) in the midst of lower level, contextual information, which should both benefit as well burden certain interpersonal and group dynamics. The research will also examine whether and to what extent negotiations that involve smaller amounts of distance will produce desirable outcomes under alternative circumstances.  Ultimately, by conceptualizing temporal and physical distance in negotiation under the same theoretical umbrella, these research tests novel predictions and addresses important gaps in the negotiation domain. \r\n\r\nThis award will permit a junior investigator to further develop a program of research already under way, and to support a graduate research assistant.",

The research was grounded in a construal level theory of physical distance, which argues that greater physical distance from things (e.g., people, world events) leads individuals to think about those things in more abstract, less detailed terms. Research from my own lab and others supports this claim. The proposed research was explored in two contexts: 1) personal negotiations, in which individuals negotiate on behalf of themselves and 2) representative negotiations, in which individuals are represented by others (e.g., elected officials) who negotiate on the behalf of those individuals (i.e., their constituents). Regarding personal negotiations, findings from my research that used experimental methods revealed that individuals who engaged in electronic negotiation with someone who was believed to be physically faraway (vs. nearby) were more likely to make concessions on unimportant issues in exchange for concessions on important issues, consequently achieving more mutually beneficial negotiation agreements. These findings are described in a paper by Henderson (2011). Regarding representative negotiations, findings from my research that used experimental methods revealed that individuals were more likely to evaluate their representatives using their political ideology when their representatives were physically faraway (vs. nearby), showing a large divide between how liberals and conservatives evaluated their representatives who were faraway from them. These findings are described in a paper by Henderson &amp; Rohrbach (2012). Moreover, research from a different set of experimental studies revealed that the physical location of representatives affected whether individuals supported their representatives (e.g., their likelihood to vote for them) when their representatives made decisions on behalf of them. These findings are described in a paper by Burgoon, Henderson, &amp; Wakslak (2012). In the process of studying the impact of physical distance on negotiation outcomes and satisfaction, I was involved in several review papers that are related to the theoretical foundation of my research.
