Innovative design, prototyping and CFD analysis was conducted to develop a unique MVCO injector to enable advanced mixed-mode combustion. State of the art laser diagnostics instruments were used to characterize spray droplet size distributions, droplet velocity and spray pattern profiles of a new prototype MVCO fuel injector. KIVA simulations were conducted to identify the merits of MVCO injector enabled mixed-mode combustion. The results have shown that: (1) MVCO fuel injector produces much more homogeneous spray distribution than conventional multihole fuel injectors; (2) MVCO fuel injector produces more uniform and finer droplet size distributions which are desirable for premixed combustion; (3) MVCO injector can enable an advanced mixed-mode combustion which has merits of significant higher thermal efficiency and lower NOx emissions comparing with diesel combustion enabled by a conventional fixed-spray-angle multihole injector; (4) MVCO injector could be potentially used for multi-fuels engines contingent on suitable injection pressures due to its flexible spray patterns.\n\nThe results have demonstrated a strong flexibility and capability of MVCO fuel injector for different injection timings and operating conditions to overcome the limitations of conventional fixed-spray-angle multihole injector for advanced combustion. This new flexibility is attributed to the variable spray patterns and homogeneous atomization of MVCO injector. The MVCO injector could be a key enabler to extend premix combustion operating maps for practical engine applications. The Phase I objectives were well met. The Phase I results provide sufficient merits to support further prototyping and engine combustion testing in phase II.\n\nThis work has broader potential benefits for auto industries, environment, energy security, and consumers. US automakers are facing significant challenges to meet government regulations for emissions and fuel efficiency while improving profit margins. The MVCO fuel injection technology will enable high efficiency in-cylinder clean combustion thus cut the cost of engine aftertreatment and fuel consumption. The results would also be valuable for high efficiency clean internal combustion engines with flexible fuels, including biodiesels and ethanol, direct injection gasoline engines, and clean engines used for hybrid applications, since the MVCO fuel injector can provide significant flexibility for atomization requirement for different fuels.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT &amp; DISCLAIMER               This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0945850.
