 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project targets the study of exciton energy transport in supramolecular organic systems by means of spectroscopic investigation of individual nanotubular J-aggregates used as a model light-harvesting system. Cyanine dyes such as C8S3 self-assemble in aqueous solution to form nanotubular supramolecular assemblies that are 13 nm in diameter and several microns in length. These nanotubes are similar to the highly efficient antenna systems of the natural light-harvesting complexes in Green Sulfur Bacteria and are thus attractive as a model for studying light harvesting in quasi-one-dimensional excitonic systems. These J-aggregates are studied using a combination of laser spectroscopy, near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM), and confocal microscopy that allows probing of individual nanotubes. Additionally, fluorescence imaging is used to directly measure the spatial extent of energy transfer in individual nanotubular aggregates to understand exciton transport in supramolecular organic systems. \r\n\r\nThe project has a number broader societal impacts: an increase in the number and diversity of students pursuing chemical research, the development and dissemination of tools for nanoscale characterization of heterogeneous materials, molecular electronics, and an expanded understanding of light harvesting as it pertains to harnessing solar energy. Educational efforts leverage the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) at UT-Austin, a program designed to bring capable underrepresented student populations  that might otherwise not chose research as a career goal into the research laboratories. \r\n\r\nThis award is made by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the Division of Chemistry and the recipient is David Vanden Bout of the University of Texas at Austin.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlants harvest light energy from arrays of antenna molecules that transport that energy to a locations where it can be converted into chemical energy.  The antennas consist of large numbers of interacting molecules.  These collections of molecules or supramolecular systems have properties that are distinct form those of the individual molecules that make up the assembly.  These supramolecular systems have optical excitations called \"excitons\" that are spread out over many molecules and that can move around the antenna system.  This research examined the properties of an artificial antenna systems to ask two questions.  Can we understand the origin of the excitons in the supramolecular system?  And how far can these excitons travel along an antenna?  To accomplish this we used a model system consisting of small dye molecules that self-assemble into double-walled tubes similar to the antenna found in deep sea bacteria that are among the most efficient at harvesting light.  We used solution chemistry, temperature dependent spectroscopy, and high-resolution microscopy to understand how the optical excitations were spread out along and between the two molecular tubes in these materials.  We learned how the excitons in the systems could be controlled with chemical modification. Finally we were able to directly observe the energy spreading out along these antenna with high spatial resolution microscopy.  Light excitations were found to travel nearly ten times farther than the distances previously assumed for these systems. This most exciting result is shown in the figure below.  The image on the left shows the size of the focused laser spot used to deposit optical excitations into the nanotube antenna system.  The image on the right shows the resulting fluorescence from the nanotube (shown with the dotted lines).  It is obvious from the image, that the initial excitation spot spreads out along the tube as the energy migrates away from the intimal excitation.  The ability to use such materials to transport optical excitations could prove useful in artificial photosynthetic systems or photovoltaic applications.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Vanden Bout"
