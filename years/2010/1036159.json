Mathematical-based and rigorous inverse solution methods have the potential to replace costly trial-and-error, and brute-force forward predictions. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit.  This grant provides partial support for graduate students to attend the 2010 Inverse Problems Symposium at Michigan State University on June 6 - 8, 2010.\r\nInverse problems have received increasing attention in the heat transfer and thermal transport processes community, and novel methods are needed in order to effectively utilize recent advances in, for example, computational architecture. One benefit of a rigorous inverse analysis is its ability to unveil multiple solutions for a given objective function. These otherwise-unknown, yet valid solutions may be more economical to implement, may produce less waste or consume less energy, and may provide enhanced productivity in an industrial setting.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. NSF funding will provide support for the attendance at the symposium by engineering and food science graduate students who are engaged in heat transfer research. The students will be provided with a unique opportunity to interact with a highly-multidisciplinary cadre of international leaders in the field of inverse problems and solution methodologies. Efforts will be made to identify and involve participants from underrepresented groups.",
