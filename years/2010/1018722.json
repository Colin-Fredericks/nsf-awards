 "awd_abstract_narration": "Controlling Uncertainty: On the Sequential Refinement of Belief\r\nThis research focuses on a variety of information acquisition and sensing applications in which a\r\ndecision maker, by carefully controlling a sequence of actions with uncertain outcomes,\r\ndynamically refines his belief about a phenomenon of interest in a speedy, accurate, and efficient\r\nmanner. The model includes a class of applications in communications, design of experiments,\r\ncognitive science, and sensor management. In particular, the following three problems are\r\ntackled.\r\n? Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing: There are a set of hypotheses, one of which is true. A\r\ndecision maker is asked to identify the correct hypothesis by sequentially employing either one\r\nof available sensing actions. Actions costs differently and produce statistically distinct\r\nobservations. Given a penalty for error in declaration, the work investigates the optimal\r\nselection of sensing actions.\r\n? Feedback Schemes for Joint Source-Channel Coding with Bandwidth Expansion: A message is\r\nto be conveyed to a receiver over a noisy memoryless channel with feedback. The expected\r\ndistortion between the message and the receiver?s construction is sought to be minimized over\r\nthe choice of causal encoding functions as well as the decoding function.\r\n? Joint Source-Channel Coding over a Multiple Access Channel with Feedback: Multiple\r\ntransmitters convey messages to a common receiver over a noisy memoryless multiple access\r\nchannel with perfect output feedback.\r\nThese problems boil down to the sequential control of a dynamical system whose system is the\r\nconditional distribution of the unknown (true hypothesis, message, etc) and whose dynamics is\r\ndictated by the Bayes? rule. In particular, the optimal choice of actions, i.e. refinement in the\r\nconditional distribution and reduction of uncertainty, is investigated.",
