 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite a decade of research, the problem of securing the Internet's interdomain routing system is far from solved. For a long time, it seemed there was a problem of technical feasibility; research focused on designing more and more lightweight protocols, by reducing computational or communication overheads, or considering weaker security guarantees.  It has now become clear that the challenge of deploying these protocols is not one of technical feasibility, but one of incentives.  The Internet is a complex, distributed system that is not controlled by any one entity, but instead has thousands of players with different economic incentives.  The real challenge is to create incentives for these players to band together and deploy a secure routing protocol that will significantly improve the reliability and security of the Internet.\r\n\r\nTo address this challenge, this project develops: (a) Metrics for measuring the utility of different network security protocols, (b) Algorithms that identify a target set of Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet that should be initially convinced or incentivized to adopt the new security protocols, so that the rest of the Internet has the incentive to follow suit, (c) Guidelines for using secure routing protocols when they are partially deployed in the Internet, (d) Models for evaluating improvements in security as ASes gradually deploy the protocol.  The approaches in this project combine domain knowledge and validation on real network data, with problem formulations inspired by emerging ideas from cryptography, game theory, and the literature on social networks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEvery few months, a new incident highlights the surprising fragility of the Internet's routing system -- a system that contains few safeguards against malicious attacks, manipulations, or even innocent local errors that can have global repercussions.  The threats to the security of the Internet's routing system have been well understood for almost two decades, and a vast number of solutions for securing routing have been proposed.  Why, then, has no security solution seen widespread adoption in the Internet?\n\nWhile most work in this area focuses on the \"endgame\" setting, when the solution is fully adopted in the Internet, this project tackled this question by studying the entire process of adopting a secure routing protocol. Specifically, this project took the following steps:\n\nRecommending a solution. For over a decade we have lacked metrics for comparing different routing security solutions, leading to disagreements among practitioners about which solution should be adopted in the Internet. As such, our research papers combined tools from algorithms with simulations on empirically-derived graphs of the Internet topology, to compare the efficacy of different secure-routing solutions at preventing routing attacks.  Our team also worked with members of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the body for Internet protocol standardization, to develop a specification of a secure routing solution.\n\nCreating incentives for adoption. Once standardization is successful, there must be incentives for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to actually adopt the standard.   Our research papers developed a set of practical guidelines for the adoption process, that allows a small set of early adopters to trigger a cascade that eventually leads to global adoption.  To do this, we proposed designing the adoption process so that ISPs that adopt the standard can attract more revenue-generating traffic to their networks.  Following this work, the FCC convened a working group to recommend processes for the adoption of secure routing solutions, that members of this project served on from 2011-2014.  In March 2012, nine major American ISPs, collectively serving 80% of U.S. Internet users, committed to following the working group's initial recommendations, and the group's final report was unanimously approved by the FCC's Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council.\n\nMitigating the risk of abuse. The final aspect of this project deals with another (counterintuitive) concern that may be delaying secure-routing protocol adoption; namely, that a secure-routing protocol can make it easier for governments or law enforcement  to block access to certain destinations on the Internet.  The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a hierarchical cryptographic infrastructure, currently in the early stages of its adoption, that is widely regarded as a first step towards a full cryptographic secure routing solution.  Research done during this project suggests that the RPKI is an effective way to prevent the most devastating attacks on Internet routing.  However, there is concern that the hierarchical structure of the RPKI could introduce a new set of risks, where parties at the top of the hierarchy can exercise unilateral control over parties lower in the hierarchy. This project used modeling with network data to assess this risk, and proposed safeguards against abuse including a stand-alone RPKI-anomaly-detection system, as well as cryptographic modifications to the RPKI standard itself. Thus far, our work on the RPKI has been included in reports of the FCC, discussed by the IETF working group that is standardizing the RPKI, and awarded IETF/IRTF Applied Networking Research Prizes.\n\nA primer on the state of routing security and the various issues considered in this project appears in the Communications of the ACM (ACM Queue).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sharon Goldberg"
