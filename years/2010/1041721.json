The decomposition of austenite is one of the most important solid-state phase transformation known, since it dramatically influences the relationship between the microstructure and properties of steels. The  Austenite Formation & Decomposition IV (AF&D IV) symposium will bring together researchers in an informal setting, with ample time for discussion and interaction. NSF funds will be used to defray the cost of registration fees for 10 students, 4 postdoctoral researchers, and 2 young faculty. Appropriate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young faculty will be identified by the organizing committee. In addition to student, postdoctoral researcher, and young faculty authors who have already submitted abstracts for the symposium, the organizing committee may also invite such candidates by contacting university departments and/or laboratories that are known to have strong programs in physical metallurgy. Every effort will be made to encourage candidates from underrepresented groups to apply.",
