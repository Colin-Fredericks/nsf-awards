 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Karen I. Goldberg of the University of Washington will develop detailed mechanistic understanding of fundamental organometallic reactions that can selectively cleave carbon-hydrogen bonds, can activate molecular oxygen to enable its use as a selective oxidant, and can selectively produce functionalized organic products through the formation of new carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen bonds. These reactions are vital to study and understand because they can be applied to the manufacturing of chemicals and materials that are essential to our society - from plastics and building supplies, to new agricultural products and pharmaceuticals. Many of these chemicals are produced on huge scales. But the current processes are complex, consume large amounts of energy and/or produce significant waste. Professor Goldberg's efforts may enable chemists to conduct the reactions more quickly and selectively using less energy, using less dangerous reagents, and producing fewer by-products. The broader impacts involve outreach to high school students, teachers, and the general public as well as training of undergraduate and graduate student researchers.\r\n\r\nThis work will enhance our fundamental understanding about catalytic processes. There is a substantial need for more efficient ways of making bulk chemicals from petroleum-based products.  In addition, being able to activate and selectively transform C-H bonds in alkanes could significantly impact our dependence on oil by providing new routes to efficiently transport and utilize natural gas reserves.",

The goal is to develop catalysts that could transform current operating procedures in the chemical industry.  In particular, the researchers concentrated their efforts on learning how transition metals activate and cleave C-H bonds, ubiquitous in hydrocarbons, and in understanding how oxygen from the air could be used in transition metal catalyzed reactions. Being able to selectively cleave C-H bonds would enable the industry to use a host of previously unreactive and widely available chemicals as substrates for reactions to produce valuable chemicals.

Through this award, we have discovered, studied and elucidated the mechanisms of a variety of new reactions that break and make C-H, C-C and C-O bonds and have learned a significant amount about how O2 reacts with transition metal complexes.
