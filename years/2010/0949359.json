 "awd_abstract_narration": "A primary concern of biologists is the discovery and documentation of earth's biodiversity.  Documentation and investigation of the evolutionary relationships of organisms are the first steps towards understanding the origin and distribution of that diversity and what forces were involved in its generation.  Lizards of the genus Anolis are model organisms for such studies in the Caribbean. This project aims to: 1) understand the evolutionary relationships of mainland (Central and South American) anoles and 2) investigate and explain the origin and distribution of this mainland lizard group.  To achieve these aims, the project will collect specimens across a broad distributional range and analyze morphological and molecular data to test hypotheses of the evolution and distribution of these lizards.  \r\n\r\nThe project involves graduate and undergraduate students from varied disciplines. Biology students will be trained in field and laboratory techniques, including publication and presentation of results at international meetings. Students completing a minor in Museum Studies (from diverse majors such as History, Art, and Anthropology) will be trained in the everyday tasks of museum work from managing specimens to developing exhibitions on the results of this project.",

One species, <em>N. pentaprion</em>, we were unable to collect adequate samples to analyze, as it is a cryptic canopy species. In addition, most species seem to have split early in their distribution in Panama into east and west coast populations that moved along the two mountain versants as they traveled northwards. The timing for the origin of each species is still being analyzed, but appears to be similar among the species, and much earlier than originally predicted by other studies. Lastly, the basal branches throughout the tree seem to be very short, followed by very long branches within each species' group, suggesting incredibly rapid radiation throughout the mainland clade, followed by long periods of <em>in situ</em> change. I have designed and installed a museum exhibit based upon this work that launched February 2012, and is currently being revamped to include more of the specific results of my current work. The exhibit is geared towards all ages, called \"Journey Through the Jungle\", and introduces visitors to the flora, fauna, and cultures of Central and South America. Because my work could not be completed until we had all the samples, and we could only collect during the summer, and most of the lab work was conducted by undergraduates, we have only just finished the data collection and have the results. However, my students have experienced great success from this training and work, all have gone on to graduate school or med school. We have published two papers so far, three are in review (mostly short notes from our field work), but we have six papers in preparation that we hope to have submitted this summer or fall 2013. One large monograph published in the journal <em>Zootaxa </em>has received incredible response from scholars in the field, and has spawned a stimulating conversation concerning classfication and taxonomy.
