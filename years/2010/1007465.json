 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1990, the Southeast Geometry Conference (SEGC) has been  an annual gathering of mathematicians working in geometry (and related areas) at institutions in the southeastern United States.   In recent years, talks at the conference have covered a wide range of subjects, such as computational geometry, convex geometry, differential geometry, geometric optimization, integrable systems, knot theory, and mathematical physics. By bringing together geometers with researchers applying geometric techniques to other areas of mathematics, the broad focus of the SEGC helps people in each group to recognize unexpected connections and new directions for future research.  The conference also plays an important role in connecting researchers in the Southeast with potential collaborators from other parts of the U.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Southeast Geometry Conference is the only regular multi-day geometry conference in the southeastern U.S.  Since the year 2000,  the conference has rotated among the University of Georgia, the University of South Carolina, and the College of Charleston, and has involved speakers and participants from a broad spectrum of types of institutions (public and private research universities, prominent regional universities, and liberal arts colleges). Moreover, the organizers have actively sought to involve young researchers and graduate students in the conference.  In particular, the SEGC provides a rare venue for new and recent PhD recipients to give full-length presentations(typically, 45-50 minutes) of their latest results.  In recent years, the SEGC has also included a poster session for graduate students to present their dissertation research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Southeast Geometry Conference (SEGC) is an annual 2-day conference that brings together geometers (that is, mathematicians who study geometry) in the southeastern states, for the purposes of exchanging research ideas, giving presentations about their results, and forming new collaborative relationships.\n\nThe kind of geometry these mathematicians work on is usually not the kind of Euclidean geometry that the average person learned in high school:  it usually concerns the study of curved objects, often in higher dimensions, and these geometers often use tools from other areas of mathematics (such as algebra, calculus and differential equations) to solve complex geometrical problems and answer subtle questions.  Although the most challenging problems often concern higher-dimensional objects, some questions can be almost mundane; for example, one recent SEGC lecturer talked about determining the exact shape of a drop of liquid clinging to two parallel plates, and as the volume of the drop increases, determining at what point the drop becomes unstable and drips. Other questions can be on a cosmic scale, as another recent lecturer proposed a modification of Einstein's equations of general relativity that would provide a better model for dark matter and the formation of spiral galaxies.\n\nThe SEGC is usually held in the spring, rotating among several universities in the southeastern US; the institutions that have most often hosted conferences in this series (now in its 23rd year) are the University of Georgia in Athens, the University of South Carolina in Columbia, and the College of Charleston.  Conference speakers have been based at these universities, other research universities in the region (e.g., Duke, Georgia Tech, UT Knoxville, and the University of Alabama in Birmingham); however, the organizers have also regularly invited a few promising young researchers from institutions in the rest of the U.S., and occasionally from Canada and Europe.\n\nFor much of its existence the SEGC has been generously supported by the National Science Foundation.  These funds are used to pay for travel expenses for conference attendees---both those giving presentations, but also graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and young faculty members who don't have their own grants.  Indeed, part of the mission of the SEGC is to elicit participation by young researchers, and every conference has included some talks by geometers at or near the beginning of their careers.  Unlike most general mathematics conferences (such as regional meetings of the American Mathematical Society), which are packed with 20-minute talks in many different sessions running in parallel, and more specialized conferences, where the speakers are usually senior mathematicians, the SEGC provides a rare opportunity for young researchers to give a full-length research presentation before a plenary audience of specialists in their field.  The SEGC has also sometimes included poster sessions where PhD students, whose thesis research may still be a work in progress, can present their results and interact with other participants in a more informal setting.\n\nOver the funding period of 2010-2012 covered by this grant, the SEGC has provided an important venue for exchanging of ideas, for mentoring and training young researchers, and fostering cooperation among geometers working in this area.  Plans are now underway to combine the SEGC with another regional series of one-day meetings, the Southeast Geometry Seminar, to produce an even stronger regional geometry conference in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas A Ivey"
