 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to conduct an in-depth investigation and development of a systematic control methodology that synergistically combines in-cylinder condition (ICC) estimation, ICC control, and active fueling control to enable smooth and robust transient operations of advanced multi-mode combustion Diesel engines which are highly-efficient and ultra-clean. To systematically address this real-life, energetically and environmentally important challenge, the following three main research elements will be conducted in a theoretical and experimental fashion: 1) fundamental research on non-equilibrium transient trajectory shaping (NETTS) nonlinear control theory; 2) observer-based ICC cycle-by-cycle estimation; and 3) systematic and novel integration of air-path-based and active-fueling-based ICC tracking and NETTS control for advanced multi-mode combustion Diesel engines. System evaluations and validations will be conducted through simulation studies and experiments. \r\n\r\nThe research, upon successful completion, will have the potentials of enabling widespread applications of advanced combustion modes on Diesel engines, and thus significantly benefiting the national transportation sector's energy efficiency and environmental impacts (including CO2), as well as reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil. The research findings will enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. automotive industry. The ICC control methodologies can be extended to control of thermodynamic boundary conditions for other energy conversion systems. The NETTS nonlinear control theory can provide new control techniques that are potentially useful for many other transient-trajectory-critical systems. The research results from this project will be used to enrich three undergraduate/graduate/distance courses. Moreover, undergraduate student B.S. Honors Program research opportunities will be generated through this project to attract students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to engage in the research.  In addition, the PI will conduct K-12 and public outreach activities and industrial dissemination of the research findings.",
