Executive Summary \r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to request funding support to increase US graduate and undergraduate student participation in the 2010 Solid-State Sensors and Actuators Workshop (Hilton Head 2010). The purpose of the workshop is to share and disseminate research results on MEMS practices amongst a group of participation which is primarily from the Americas. The workshop agenda includes plenary speakers from academia and industry to discuss state-of-the-art in research areas on the fringe of ?micro/nanosystems.? The workshop is set up in a single session format. There will be 27 contributed oral presentations, and ~65 contributed posters. The Hilton Head workshop is very selective, and with travel support for student presenters, advisors are much more likely to send their students. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe workshop will disseminate MEMS research and technology breakthroughs. The workshop consists of 27 contributed oral papers, and contributed posters. There will also be an open poster session where recent work (and educational programs) can be discussed. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\nThe workshop will have broad impact for the entire MEMS community. The knowledge gained and experiences shared from the workshop will be captured electronically and broadly disseminated via a website. By receiving travel support, students will get the opportunity to present their newest research results among their peers. The discussions which result from such presentations are invaluable as an educational aid. Benefiting from the recommendations and improved teaching and training, students will be better prepared for both MEMS research and MEMS-focused careers.",
