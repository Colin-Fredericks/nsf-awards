 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study scientific argumentation in middle school classrooms. The research team, led by investigators from George Washington, includes linguists, anthropologists, education researchers, and cognitive and social psychologists. Over the course of this project, they will: (1) identify argumentation episodes that naturally occur in a sixth grade science class; (2) analyze contextual factors that prompt such episodes; and (3) relate these findings to student performance on an end-of-unit science test. The investigators hope to determine how contextual factors affect the prevalence and complexity of student argumentation.. \r\n\r\nThe study is based on a corpus of over 250 hours of videotape hyperlinked to 35,000 pages of transcriptions of classroom interaction collected with prior NSF funding during the implementation of an inquiry-based physical science unit called Exploring Motion and Forces. It will also have access to a related quantitative database of student achievement data. The data capture the students during group work at lab tables engaged in spontaneous arguments about the curricular content. The project should provide a methodological and empirical foundation upon which to base further studies that promise to inform science curriculum development as well as teacher training.",

Coding results indicate that the majority of argumentation episodes  were conceptual in nature.  Importantly, the percentage of episodes about key science concepts also increased significantly over time. \n\nMicroanalytic methods offer exciting preliminary results about the contextual \"triggers\" or prompts for student argumentation.  First, the written questions in the unit appear to have prompted most of students\u00c6 argumentation in the unit .  Furthermore, the arguing students do when prompted by written questions is significantly longer than when otherwise prompted, and more likely to focus on the key concepts of the unit.  We know, too, that certain types of questions prompt more, and more conceptually rich, argumentation than others; those that explicitly concern \"evidence\" play a key role in sustaining argumentation. \n\n\nClose analyses of the linguistic nature of the written question-prompts reveals that ITR questions more frequently nominalize key science ideas.

We have isolated cues in the context that trigger argumentation episodes.  For example, argumentation is more likely to proceed when students read something out loud to each other, when they shift linguistic registers (using non-colloquial, \"scientific\" language), and when they orient their bodies in relation to each other, creating a shared physical space. The longest and most socially complex episodes tend to coincide with a regi..."
