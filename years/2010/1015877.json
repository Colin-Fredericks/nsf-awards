 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  The proposed project is a strategic study addressing how existing knowledge about women in science and engineering gets transmitted from the producers of the research studies to the consumers of the knowledge. Although a wealth of data and knowledge about women in science and engineering has been produced, this knowledge often fails to reach important intended consumers: working women scientists, students, department chairs, administrators, and all those interested in engaging in productive action to improve the status of women in science and engineering.  The project will explore the key initial dimensions of this problem and will identify blockages and inefficiencies in the current system of transmission of knowledge, as well as promising initiatives and models of transmission. The study of such a flow of knowledge about women in science and engineering is unusual (and even unique)and the potential payoffs are high in both intellectual merit and broader impacts.  The methods involve bibliometric means, individual interviews, and organizational case study analyses in two research steps. The first step characterizes the relevant actors (\"nodes\") in the network of transmission: including social scientists, funding agencies, university administrators, science reporters and editors, key committees of professional associations, national organizations for women in science and engineering, and working scientists, instructors, and students. The second step defines what constitutes the connections (\"links\") between these actors.  The project will create a description of the transmission zone that, in itself, will be novel, interesting, and useful for the organizations and individuals concerned with the status and conditions of women in science and engineering. Further, it will prepare the bases for a systematic and comprehensive network survey of information flows and their blockages as well as facilitators\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The significance of the project lies in its high potential for revealing and understanding both the challenges of, and opportunities for, the transmission of knowledge about women in science and engineering; and for establishing the feasibility of, laying the groundwork for, and heightening the probability of success of a more comprehensive network study of this ?transmission zone? of knowledge.  The EAGER program is the ideal vehicle for this study?as no other existing NSF program is situated to consider such an unusual, exploratory, and high-potential proposal.  By identifying blockages and inefficiencies in the current system of transmission of knowledge, as well as promising initiatives and models of transmission, this study will lay the foundation for making the transmission of knowledge about women in science and engineering more efficient and useful. Furthermore, the study has potentially even broader impact insofar as it may be applicable to the dissemination of scientific knowledge in other areas.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "A.  Major Goals of the Project\n\nAlthough a wealth of data and knowledge about women, science, and engineering (WSE) has been produced and published, 1) the extent and nature of this knowledge has not been assessed previously; and 2) the knowledge that exists often fails to reach important, intended consumers, including working women scientists, students, department chairs, and others interested in women, science, and engineering.\n\nWe address these two issues in a strategic and innovative study.  1) We determine the extent and key characteristics of the published knowledge over time, 1966-2010. This results  in the first quantitative description of \"knowledge production\" about WSE.  2)  We investigate how this knowledge gets transmitted from \"producers\" to the \"consumers,\" including facilitators of, and barriers to, transmission.\nB.  Approach\n\nThe study uses a mixed-methods approach.  The bibliometric component is a unique undertaking identifying the publications on WSE, 1966-2010, using the Web of Science, with the addition of the specialized Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering, not in Web of Science.  We used processes of inter-coder reliability in examining 22,464 publications &ndash; from which 3,414 publications are eligible for inclusion. Interviews occurred with 13 directors/representatives within 11 organizations key to the transmission of knowledge about WSE (two divisions in a federal funding agency; two foundations; two national committees; four national organizations; and two science media).\nC.  Outcomes &ndash; Results\n\n1.  Significant results of the bibliometric component:\n\na.  Knowledge production over time:\n\nOnly 21 publications (0.62% of the total) occur in 1966-70; followed by 162 (4.75% of total) in 1971-1980; and 379 (11.1% of total) in 1981-1990.  Sharp increases occur in the decade of the 1990s (1206 articles, 35.3% of total).  In the most recent decade, 2001-2010, research activity continues to rise with 1646 articles (48% of total in 44 year period). The activity of this latest decade is notable, and represents a potential trend of WSE as an established area of research. \n\nb.  Journals (places) in which publications appear:\n\nThe journal with most numerous counts of articles is the specialized, Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering (JWMSE), with 27.8% of total articles.  (Note that this is not a Web of Science journal, and thus citation data do not appear.)  Counts are followed by the Journal of Research in Science Teaching (13.9%/total), the International Journal of Science Education (11.1%), Psychology of Women Quarterly (9.72%), Sex Roles (7.75%), and Psychological Reports (6.37%).\n\nOf the 12 journals leading in numbers of articles published on WSE, four are in psychology; and three in science teaching and education.  This reflects, in part, the size of psychology as field with numerous potential researchers; the umbrella organization, American Psychological Association, has 134,000 members.\n\nc.  Journals most influential in citations:\n\nConsidering the journals that have more than 300 citations to articles published on WSE, leading in citations is American Psychologist (2867 citations).  Close in citations (N=2020) is the Journal of Research in Science Teaching.  The four journals with 1001-1999 citations are in psychology or education  Thus, in impacts assessed by citations, psychology and education journals lead as they do in numbers of articles.\n\nd.  Span of authors publishing:\n\nAs in other areas of research, most of the researchers have published few articles on WSE; a very small group publishes many.  Given that we are looking only at researchers with articles published, those who publish no articles will not appear.\n\nThe vast  (84.29%) majority of these authors of the articles on WSE have published just one article. Ten percent (10.46%) have published two; 3%, three; and 1.13%, four.  Only a little over one percent (1.04%) have published five or more ar..."
