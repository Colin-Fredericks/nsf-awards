To accomplish the goal the project creates a four-week preparatory distance course for incoming students and develops a set of modules with engineering problems for the Calculus I and Calculus II courses. In addition, the project creates a mentoring system such that upper-level engineering students meet weekly with the calculus students to cover the engineering content of the modules. The mentors provide real time instructive feedback, offer guidance on efficient studying habits and time management, and connect students to campus resources.",
