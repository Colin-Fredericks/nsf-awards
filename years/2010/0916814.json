 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will discuss the linkages between science, technology and the economy. These meetings will engage physical scientists, economists, science policy experts and other interested groups on these critical issues. Some of the questions to be addressed include: What have been the distinguishing characteristics of science and technology influences on economic growth? How can these lessons be applied to current structural issues facing the U.S. economy and future economic growth? What are the key science and technology challenges that must be addressed to achieve energy and environmental sustainability? How would the policy framework maximize the effectiveness of science and technology investments in supporting sustainable economic growth? The Summit will complete its objectives with a series of events, including plenary Summit meetings in Spring 2010 and 2011 and more focused workshops in the interim.",
