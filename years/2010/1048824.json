 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smartphones are fast becoming a full-fledged computing platform that\r\nour society depends upon.  Smartphone applications that access data\r\nand computing resources in the \"cloud\" are inevitable given the\r\nprocessing and storage limitations on the phones.  Today the burden of\r\npartitioning smartphone applications between the phone and the cloud\r\nlies squarely with the programmer.  This manual approach to\r\npartitioning applications is fundamentally limited and will not scale\r\nup to allow smartphones to become a truly rich and robust computing\r\nplatform.  Manual partitioning is tedious and error prone.  Moreover,\r\nmanual partitioning requires the programmer to make important\r\ndecisions that cannot be properly made until run time.\r\n\r\nThis project explores the requirements, design, and implementation of\r\na programming system for cloud-enabled smartphone applications that is\r\ninherently adaptive, partitioning applications transparently in order\r\nto cope with a diverse set of dynamic constraints.  The project is\r\nstudying cloud-enabled smartphone applications from a variety of\r\ndomains in order to understand application requirements, constraints,\r\nand tradeoffs in practice.  The project is also pursuing programming\r\nmodels that allow developers to flexibly and declaratively express an\r\napplication's components along with their dependencies and\r\nconstraints.  Finally, the project is developing a prototype system\r\narchitecture that collaboratively executes an application on the phone\r\nand the cloud subject to the application's requirements.  Within a\r\ndecade, smartphones will transform the way health and lifestyle\r\nchoices are delivered to much of the population.  This project is\r\nhelping to enable this transformation by making a rich class of\r\nsmartphone applications much easier to create, adapt, and understand.",

Users can share photos either through cloud-based photo sharing services like Flickr or Picasa, or popular social networking services like Facebook or Google+. However, this development has generated privacy concerns. Private photos have been leaked from a prominent photo sharing site. Furthermore, widespread concerns have been raised about the application of face recognition technologies in Facebook. Despite these privacy threats, it is not clear that the usage of photo sharing services (PSPs) will diminish in the near future. This is because photo sharing services provide several useful functions (like scaling and cropping images before downloads) that, together, make for a seamless photo browsing experience.  The third outcome of the project is a privacy-preserving photo sharing algo..."
