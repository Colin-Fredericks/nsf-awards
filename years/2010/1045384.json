This rich program will expose students to new ideas, and allow them to interact with other researchers. In particular, the student workshop is geared to provide students an opportunity to present their work in progress, receive feedback on their work, and obtain valuable experience in writing and presenting technical papers.\r\n\r\nApproximately 10 US-based graduate students are provided the opportunity to attend CoNext. The travel awards will target graduate students, in particular female and under-represented minority students, since they often have limited travel funds to attend workshops; attendance at such events is an important part of their educational experience.",
