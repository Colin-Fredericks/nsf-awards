 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility of creating surfaces that actively manage solar heat gain by switching between infrared transmittance and reflectivity. The ultimate objective is to develop skylights, windows, and roofs\r\nthat adapt to seasonal, regional, and diurnal changes in solar flux and heating and cooling requirements. The Phase I objective is to develop electrofluidic pigment materials systems incorporating infrared-reflecting particles and other infrared strategies. The infrared modulation\r\nperformance of these new materials systems will then be demonstrated in low cost electrofluidic modules. These modules change the optical properties of surfaces by moving pigment from a small area reservoir to full surface coverage in a similar manner to the way squids change their skin color. The innovation in this work is the development an entirely new materials system and\r\nmethod for managing near-infrared light over a large surface area.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. U.S. building energy consumption (40% of total U.S. Energy Consumption) can be reduced significantly by maximizing sunlight for lighting, while effectively managing solar heat gain. Current passive technologies (windows, insulation, paint, etc.) do not readily adapt to\r\nseasonal, regional, and diurnal changes in solar flux and heating and cooling requirements. By empowering buildings to actively manage solar heat gain, U.S. energy consumption can be reduced by more than 1 quadrillion BTU per year, while adding minimal cost to building infrastructure. There is also a large commercialization opportunity in selling active skylights, windows, roof tiles, etc. through partnerships with existing manufacturers.",
