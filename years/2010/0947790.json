This project seeks to transform graduate education in all of the STEM disciplines at Dartmouth by building on existing partnerships with five local school districts to foster in middle school students the scientific creativity we scientists find so appealing.  Supported by training in strategies shown to foster creativity as well as in principles of teaching and learning, Graduate Fellows are paired with a middle school teacher for one year.  During this time Fellows use their research and science backgrounds to work with partner teachers to develop hands-on, educationally sound, active, inquiry-based lessons that emphasize the creative aspects of building connections between research and curriculum -- from simple exercises to promote better brainstorming and idea generation to more in-depth visualization and creative writing techniques.  Fellows are encouraged to share with middle school students not only an appreciation for the discipline and rigor of science but also for the individuality and imagination involved.  In so doing, Fellows improve their communication skills through interactions with diverse audiences and gain a more contextualized and nuanced understanding of their research by learning to view their work from alternative perspectives.  More broadly, this program improves middle school students? and teachers? attitudes toward science and facilitates the building of connections to existing knowledge among participants, which has been shown to improve learning.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of the Dartmouth GK-12 Project was to integrate resources into sustainable initiatives that i) expanded opportunities for professional development of graduate students and ii) built Dartmouth\u00c6s capacity to translate research to broad audiences.  We sought to achieve this goal by developing a program that enabled Graduate Fellows to improve their communication skills through interactions with diverse audiences and to gain a more contextualized and nuanced understanding of their research by learning to view their work from alternative perspectives. \n\nThe Dartmouth GK-12 Project provided funding and support for 44 graduate students from STEM disciplines across Dartmouth to work with middle and high school teachers from local schools &ndash; many of which were under-resourced rural schools - to develop inquiry-based activities designed to increase the understanding of, and interest in, science of more than 1500 middle school students.

Graduate Fellows had opportunities to teach middle and high school students and were mentored by their Partner Teachers as well as GK-12 Program Staff.\n\nAs evidenced by our external evaluations, the Dartmouth GK-12 Program achieved its objectives. \n\nGraduate Fellows improved their communication skills and ability to communicate with broad audiences;\nGraduate Fellows gained a more contextualized and nuanced understanding of their research;\nPartner Teachers gained awareness of current trends in STEM disciplines, had opportunities for professional development, and opportunities to develop ongoing relationships with researchers at Dartmouth College;\nMiddle and high school students\u00c6 learning of, and attitudes toward, STEM improved by working with graduate student role models on lessons that emphasized the creative process of science; and\nGraduate education at Dartmouth was transformed to begin making participation in these opportunities an integral part of graduate student training.\n\n\nThe Dartmouth GK-12 Program fostered the creation of a sustainable approach to graduate student professional development and outreach at a relatively small school in a rural setting.  In part because of Dartmouth\u00c6s small size, our program was intentionally designed to have a cross-cutting theme (creativity in STEM) rather than a disciplinary focus.  The result was a program that drew participants from 13 different STEM disciplines across Dartmouth.  Our focus on \"breadth\" was reinforced by our large leadership team of equal partners.  The diverse backgrounds of the leadership team enhanced \"buy-in\" to the program from different constituencies as each could recognize one of their own in project leadership.  A consequence of our broad reach was the development of broad support for the program across campus and within the broader community and, as a result, broad support for the continued institutional support of the Science and Technology Outreach Office after the GK-12 program ended.\n\nOur rural setting also meant that our partner K-12 schools were small, and thus that we could not partner with just one school, but instead had to create a network of partner schools.  Ultimately we created a network of 24 local middle and high school teachers from 19 different schools.  This network is an invaluable legacy of the GK-12 Program.\n\nRural science teachers are more likely than urban teachers to teach outside of the fields in which they are certified, and less likely to have access to professional development, special services, and opportunities for peer collaboration.  This meant that there was a critical need for us to offer meaningful professional development opportunities for our Partner Teachers.  As noted by our external evaluators, \"The project successfully met these needs while simultaneously improving the reputation of Dartmouth within the community.\" In our final annual..."
