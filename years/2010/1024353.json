 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project combines experimental and multi-scale modeling efforts to investigate novel deformation mechanisms occurring in metals during extremely high rates of stress and strain. In this study, nanostructured samples will be subjected to laser-generated stress waves of sub-nanosecond rise times. As a result, the material experiences 50 GigaPascals or higher stresses within 1 nanosecond. The material's response to such dynamic conditions has not been explored in detail before. The laser shock experiments will be combined with electron microscopic characterization of the same samples before and after deformation and multi-scale modeling. This approach enables direct correlation between the evolved structures and experimental parameters of pressure and strain rate. Additionally, the sample geometries are amenable to modeling and thereby allowing for a direct comparison. These studies will establish scientific underpinning for the experimentally-observed and/or simulation-predicted new deformation mechanisms and provide an atomic-scale understanding of the material stability in extreme environments.  \r\n\r\nThe work should help in the design of alternate energy systems and advanced armors. The combination of advanced nanofabrication and microscopy, sophisticated optics and mechanical testing, and state-of-the-art modeling strategies provides excellent interdisciplinary training for graduate students and undergraduates. To promote awareness of the research ideas: the Los Angeles Unified School District high-school students will be provided with research opportunities; research results will be integrated into the engineering curriculum; and, underrepresented groups and undergraduates will be encouraged to participate in the research activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUse of metals such as aluminum, steel and copper is ubiquitous in society.  Metallic components are widely used in construction, automobiles, airplanes, electronics, consumer products, and military assets. An attractive property of the metals is that they do not shatter like brittle ceramics when they are bent or dropped on hard surfaces.  They absorb energy by undergoing plastic (permanent) deformation. Metals however display these properties only when deformed slowly or at lower rates of loading.  They too fail in a brittle fashion when subjected to impact loads over a very short duration (thousandth to millionth of a second).  Such high rates of loading occur when metallic components are hit by projectiles or a blast wave such as those generated during explosions. High rates of loading also occur during high speed machining when shaped them into parts, during collisions and accidents, during usage in mining and drilling, and when using in protective gears (helmets).  In this research our goal was to first understand how these metals respond at the atomic level when subjected to extreme rates of loading.  Of specific interest was to study the atomic level deformations as a function of the size of the metal specimens.  To this end, we fabricated very small sized columns of lengths and diameters one hundredth to one thousandth of the thickness of an average human hair and loaded them by shock waves generated by high-power lasers.  These shock waves loaded the specimens at extremely high rates of loading.  The post-shocked samples were examined using very high magnification microscopes to determine the local movement and rearrangement of the atoms.  We discovered an extremely important deformation behavior that has major implications for design.  We found that very small size copper columns were still able to deform in a plastic fashion at such extremely high rates of loading and that they bent gracefully without undergoing brittle fracture.  The stress level at which these deformations occurred were an order of magnitude lower than what other researchers had established for decades.  This new discovery can be used to develop metals with very fine grain sizes similar to the size of the columns used in our study.  Metallic components made with such new metal microstructure will not fail in a brittle fashion when subjected to very high rates of loading.  We are continuing this research to inquire if our observations will hold for other classes of metals.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vijay Gupta"
