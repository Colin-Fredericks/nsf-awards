 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER proposal seeks to make fundamental contributions in our understanding of earthquake interaction and fault slip behaviors through systematic analysis of earthquake triggering and \"non-volcanic\" tremor, based on the large seismic data collected from the EarthScope experiment and other permanent seismic networks in the US, and permanent and temporary seismic deployments in East Asia. The project will prepare next-generation seismologists to be capable of analyzing large seismic data through various training courses and research projects. The research results will be dissimilated to general public through sonification and visualization tools.\r\n\r\nThe proposed tasks include:\r\n1.\tEarly aftershocks. The researcher will detect and locate missing aftershocks immediately after the 2008 Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake in China, and several recent large earthquakes in California and Japan, using a waveform matched filter technique. The newly identified events will be used to test whether aftershocks are triggered by static or dynamic stresses, or other time-dependent mechanisms.\r\n2.\tRemote triggering: a systematic survey of remotely triggered seismicity in active regions in the Western US, and relatively stable intraplate regions such as Continental China and the Central and Eastern US. I hope to identify necessary conditions and constrain physical mechanisms for remote triggering in active and intraplate regions.\r\n3.\tNon-volcanic tremor: a systematic study of non-volcanic tremor, focusing on California and Taiwan. The obtained results will be used to better understand the physical mechanisms of tremor generation and how accumulated strain is released in seismic/aseismic events. \r\n4.\tTraining next-generation seismologists. The researcher will provide many undergraduate research opportunities through summer internship programs, and collaborations with researchers in undergraduate institutions. He will develop an online tutorial and training material for Seismic Analysis Code (SAC) and data management, which can be used to train senior undergraduate and incoming graduate students in Georgia Tech and other institutions.\r\n5.\tSonification and visualization of seismic data. Research results on earthquake triggering and non-volcanic tremor will be made accessible to general public through sonification (i.e., making sounds from seismograms) and visualization. In addition, the PI will work with IRIS Education and Outreach (E&O) specialists to generate sounds and animations for significant events based on seismic data archived at the IRIS Data Management Center (DMC).",

Large shallow earthquakes are generally followed by numerous small events, known as aftershocks. Sometimes large earthquakes are preceded by increased seismic activities known as foreshocks. In other times, seismic waves from large earthquakes thousands of kilometers away can perturb a region, and trigger many small-size events, generally termed remote or dynamic triggering. Recent studies also show that active faults can slide at much slower speeds than during regular fast-rupturing earthquakes, generating subtle seismic signals called deep tectonic tremor. All these new observations (Figure 1) are changing our views on how faults release tectonic stresses and interacts from nearby to long-range distances. However, their underlying physical mechanisms are still not well understood.</p>\n<p>This CAREER project seeks to make fundamental contributions in our understanding of earthquake interaction and fault slip behaviors through systematic analysis of earthquake triggering and deep tectonic tremor around the world. Our research activities mainly focused on the following directions.</p>\n<p>First, we conducted a global search for remotely triggered microearthquakes (Figure 2), and found that most of them occurred in regions with external stress perturbations such as geothermal/volcanic regions with excessive fluid pressures, or regions with human induced seismicity (e.g., waste-water injection, mining, or reservoir loading). These results suggest that crustal faults are not close to failure everywhere (and ready to be triggered) as originally proposed. If so, then we can use remote triggering as a beacon to identify critically stressed regions that are almost ready to break.</p>\n<p>Our results from systematic global studies of triggered tectonic tremor have shown that the amplitudes of the surface waves play an important role in determining its triggerability in a given region. In addition, the frequency contents, and incident angles of the surface waves also affect the triggering potential. In most regions, triggered tremor is simply a sped-up version of regular or ambient tremor, and they likely reflect a slow-slip event triggered by distant waves. Finally, we have found many inland strike-slip regions with triggered tremor (e.g., Cuba, Haiti, the Queen Charlotte and Denali fault), indicating that tremor could exist in a wide range of tectonic environments (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>During this project, we have developed a waveform matching method that allows us to detect missing earthquakes by scanning massive amount of Big Seismic Data. These newly detected events have opened up windows for better understanding earthquake triggering from near to far fields. Based on these newly identified events, we confirm the existence of &lsquo;stress shadow&rsquo;, a shutdown in seismicity from negative static stress changes. We also see evidence of dynamic triggering in many regions immediately following the mainshock, including in stress-shadow regions. These results suggest that both static and dynamic stress changes control triggered seismicity in the near field, but their spatial reach and time scales are different (Figure 4). We also applied the same waveform matching method to detect both foreshocks and aftershocks of recent large earthquakes. Our results suggest that sometimes foreshocks could be dynamically triggered by another distant earthquake. However, in other cases, either we did not find any foreshocks, or the foreshocks did not show any differences as compared with other seismic activities in that region. Hence, it is still challenging to use them as a precursory signal. Most aftershocks show systematic expansion with time since the mainshock, suggesting that they are driven by continuous creep (known as afterslip) following the mainshock.</p>\n<p>The project involves many students/collaborators to analyze large seismic data through various training courses and research projects. More than 40 peer-reviewed papers have been published. This project has supported two postdocs, 6 Ph.D. and 3 M.S. students. This project provided partial support to fund summer internships of 14 domestic REU participants (many are female or from minority groups). All of them were well trained to conduct scientific research in the frontier of seismology, and most of them have continued their career path within Geophysics.
