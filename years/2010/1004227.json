 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site program is focused on multidisciplinary research in ecologically sustainable production and processing of biomass-derived fuels. The overarching objective of the proposed REU program will be to train talented undergraduate students in research methods appropriate for the conduct of state-of-the-art research in science and engineering. Specific goals of the program are to:(1) educate a diverse group of science and engineering undergraduate students about ecologically sustainable production and processing of biomass for biofuels;(2) train students to conduct high-quality research in science and engineering; and (3)motivate and prepare participants for graduate research and training in science and engineering. The program will be hosted at Iowa State University's (ISU) Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering (ABE) department a premiere program that is located in the biofuel \"breadbasket\" of the U.S. The project will support a ten-week immersive research experience for ten undergraduate students each summer for a period of three years.   Undergraduate students will be trained to conduct high quality scientific research, and mentored by faculty and graduate students to seek out graduate education and career opportunities in science and engineering.  Research and enrichment activities will focus on topics related to ecologically sustainable production and processing of biomass-derived fuels. This will be accomplished through: (1) an intensive experience in laboratory and/or field research; (2) exposure to state-of-the-art knowledge through multiple research seminars in biomass production, harvest, transport, storage, conversion, processing, and environmental stewardship associated with these steps; (3) education about various components of the biomass to biofuel agro industry complex through field trips; (4) professional development through a seminar series, ethics workshop, and travel to a national conference; and (5) networking and social development through a variety of community building activities.\r\n\r\nBiomass-derived fuels have emerged as a promising source of renewable energy with a potential to reduce energy imports while decreasing atmospheric emissions of fossil-fuel derived CO2.  This REU Site program will educate the next generation of scientists and engineers about biomass-derived fuel production, train them to conduct high quality scientific research and inspire them to pursue graduate education with a potential to yield transformative technological innovations in sustainable energy production.",

In 2012, nine students (three men and six women) participated in the REU and completed both the pre- and post-program surveys. Finally, in 2013, ten students (four men and six women) participated in the REU and completed both the pre- and post-program surveys. Of these 28 students, 57% were women, 23 identified as White, two identified as Black or African American, two identified as Hispanic or Latino/a, and one identified as Asian.\nAnalyzing the data across cohorts reveals that students registered statistically significant changes in basic research skills from the beginning of the program to the end of the program (Figure 1 - attached). These skills were related to lab safety, finding and using reference materials, literature research, ethical research, use of statistics, technical writing, and technical communication (n = 28, p &lt; .05). As shown in Figure 2 (attached), students across cohorts also reported statistically significant gains on a number of more advanced research skills including seeing connections among multiple disciplines, applying knowledge to solve problems, understanding of graduate degree options, understanding of ethics, analyzing data, asking questions to clarify the problem, knowing what information to include in a research report, and comfort interacting with an audience and responding to questions (n = 28, p &lt; .05).\nIn 2012 and 2013, students were asked a series of questions about their knowledge of topics related to biorenewable resources (Figure 3 - attached). Overall, these students reported statistically significant gains in their understanding of fundamental principles related to biomass conversion and processing; harvest, transport, and storage of biomass; hydrologic and water quality impacts of biomass production; modeling and analysis of biomass production systems; and the environmental impact of their work (n = 19, p &lt; .05).\nPerhaps as informative as the numerical results above are the qualitative results that are reflected in the numerous e-mails, thank you cards, and expressions during the exit focus groups that we have seen. For example, in 2012, one student commented, \"It was an incredible learning experience. Not only did I gain practical skills, but I also became more comfortable working with other departments, making and presenting a poster, and designing my own research project.\" One 2013 student called the experience, \"life changing,\" while another indicated, \"This REU will better direct me toward my goals and give me a more concrete focus for grad school.\"\nStudents from many smaller Ag/Biosystems engineering departments were particularly vocal about the value of going to the Annual International Meeting of the ASABE. They found that seeing the true breadth of our discipline, rather than just a small corner of it as may happen (e.g., as noted in Kaleita and Raman, 2012), was inspiring. Kaleita and Raman\u00c6s work (2012) illustrated the challenges faced by the discipline of agricultural and biosystems engineering &ndash; which is simultaneously becoming more relevant in a hungry and warmer world, while working in a historical context of local (state to state) variation in curricula. By bringing students together around critical topics,  this REU program has a significant cohesive impact on the discipline.\nIn addition, the PI is involved in multiple other educational initiatives including running an ERC-themed REU s..."
