 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social-networking sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, etc.) and other online collaborative tools have emerged as places where people can post and share information.  This information-sharing has many benefits, ranging from practical  (e.g., sharing a business document) to purely social (e.g., communicating with distant friends). At the same time, information sharing inevitably poses significant threats to user privacy. In social-networking sites, for example, documented threats range from identity theft to digital stalking and personalized spam.  As a result, a growing number of such sites allow individual users to specify fine-grained policies that indicate who can access their data, and to what extent. However, studies have consistently shown that most end-users find the task of specifying access-control policies for their own data overwhelming; as a result, users often skip the process altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to help collaborative and social-media users gain control of their data.  To that end, the project will include three main components: assisted specification, feedback, and refinement recommendations.  To assist users in initially specifying access-control policies for their data, the project will develop a \"privacy wizard,\" which employs data mining and machine learning methods, including active learning, to construct an accurate policy, with minimal input from the user.  To provide feedback regarding existing privacy settings, the project will pursue two approaches: aggregate scores and visualizations.  For example, an aggregate score can be used to concisely explain to the user how her settings differ from those of other users.   Preliminary work found that Item Response Theory (IRT) can be used effectively for this purpose.  Finally,  the project will consider how aggregate scores and visual feedback can be enriched with recommendations for refinements to help the user achieve an expressed level of social exposure.\r\n\r\nOnline collaborative tools and social media offer great promise in a number of arenas. In addition to communicating with friends via social networking sites, collaborative tools are now used in fields as diverse as business, medicine and education. However, the absence of usable privacy and access control prevents such tools from realizing their full potential.  Results of this project will be disseminated via prototype implementations, as well as research publications. New undergraduate and graduate curriculum modules will also increase awareness of the importance of policy-specification and emerging research in this area.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHumans have a need to communicate and interact with other human beings.  Technology can facilitate such communication, particularly through social media.  However, humans also have a need for privacy, or the ability to control this sharing of information.  There are things you may say to friends you wouldn\u00c6t say to your family, and vice versa.  There are things you may say to friends and family that you wouldn\u00c6t share in your office.  When this sharing is mediated by technology, users may often not understand privacy settings or may miss specifying appropriate restrictions, and hence may not be able to exercise the control over information sharing that they would like.\n\n \n\nThis project studied whether technology can itself be harnessed to address this technology created need.  Can we have computer systems correctly figure out what sharing a human is likely to desire, and then implement this automatically without need for explicit human specification.  Our answer is that technology can go a long way towards addressing this challenge, though it cannot (yet) do so without human intervention.  We developed several techniques to accomplish this.  The general underlying principle of these techniques is to learn from user privacy expressions in one context and apply them in other related contexts.  Our expectation is that this research will lead to all of us in society being able to better manage our privacy.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: H. V Jagadish"
