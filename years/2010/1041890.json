This workshop will be held October 1-3, 2010 and is expected to provide an opportunity for both experimental and theoretical physicists to obtain an update on recent progress and exchange ideas in the field of underground science. The workshop will cover some of the most fundamental questions in high-energy physics, cosmology and astroparticle physics. It will bring together a total of about 60 experimentalists, theorists and young scholars who are working and seek to collaborate in several key areas such as non-baryonic dark matter, nucleon decay, long-baseline neutrino physics, neutrinoless double beta decay, etc.",
