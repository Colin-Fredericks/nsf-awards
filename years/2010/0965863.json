These substances can enter surface waters with runoff and may have deleterious effects on aquatic ecosystem such as the feminization of native fish at exceedingly low concentrations (ng/L).  While microbial degradation has been documented to occur and is believed to be the primary degradation pathway, some of these substances can persist for months after the application of CAFO waste.  Uptake and depuration by plants may be a cost effective means to intercept hormones, their synthetic analogs, and antibiotics in these wastes that have been applied to croplands through the use of riparian buffer strips along surface waterways.  Further, evidence show that plants and sorption to soils can also prevent the introduction of these substances to groundwater.  In this proposal the PIs wish to examine whether economic crop plants can transform these compounds or merely accumulate them.  They will test the hypotheses that: (1) hormones (synthetic analogs and natural) and antibiotics can be taken up by plants based upon the physicochemical properties of these substances; (2) plants can both accumulate and transform these substances to benign derivatives; and (3) plant uptake and degradation complement natural attenuation in soils and in combination are an effective means to passively treat these substances.\r\n\r\nTo test these hypotheses, they will examine the plant uptake and degradation of 17\u00e2-estradiol, its metabolite estrone, zeranol (a non-hormone growth promoter), and tylosin (an antibiotic) using soybean plants, a row crop plant; hybrid poplars, a tree that can be ideally used in riparian buffers; and arrow root, a native non-invasive aquatic plant.  They will assess 1) sorption/desorption characteristics of the target compounds and how this process will affect their bioavailability to the plants, 2) whether transformation occurs in the plants, 3) where the compounds and their metabolites accumulate in plant tissues, and 4) the role of microbial communities in soils and the rhizosphere in the overall degradation of these compounds.\r\n\r\nHormones, their synthetic analogs, and other pharmaceuticals released to surface waters from CAFO waste pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems. Even though natural attenuation can degrade many of these compounds, manure fertilizer can still leach these substances at levels that can harm aquatic organisms months after land application.  Plant uptake and degradation complements native microbial degradation and in combination may reduce the concentration of these substances in CAFO waste to less harmful levels.  The proposed work will support the graduate education of two students.  The PIs are also active in disseminating this information to both the scientific community and the public at large.  These include active programs involving K-12 students, the P.I.s, and their research groups.  Finally, they will coordinate their efforts with their respective university extension programs to help farm communities cope with agricultural waste.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project examined the fate of estrogenic and their analog compounds present in animal manure from concentrated animal feed operations (CAFO).  The first stage of our research examined the sorption of these substances: 17&alpha;- and 17&beta;-estradiol (17&alpha;-E2 and E2), estrone (E1), melengestrol acetate (MGA), 17&alpha;- and 17&beta;-trenbolone (17&alpha;-TB and 17&beta;-TB), trendione (TND), tylosin (TYL), and progesterone (PGR), and zeranol (ZAL) to soils to assess their bioavailability to the target plants.   All of these substances are used as growth promoters in CAFO.  We found that all the compounds obeyed linear sorption behavior and this phenomenon was best predicted using a simple one-parameter linear free energy relationship model.  This enables us to assess the bioavailable fraction of similar compounds using a chemical property such as its octanol-water partition coefficient.  The one exception to this observation occurred for tylosin, which was best described using a non-linear sorption model (the Freundlich equation).  Further, we could not account for all of the TYL sorbed, and attribute these losses to abiotic degradation by mineral oxides present in percent levels in our soil samples.   This observation was corroborated by batch degradation experiments whereby significant losses of TYL occurred in both the presence of manganese and iron oxide to form a variety of derivatives. \n\nThe second part of our project involved studying the uptake of four estrogenic compounds: E2, E1, ZAL, and zeralanone (ZAN) by corn.  Since corn is one of the most important agricultural commodities we wanted to assess the degree to which these compounds are absorbed by the roots and translocate to other parts of the plant.  We were able to show that in germinating corn the estrogenic substances are actively taken up by the plants in much greater excess relative to sorption alone.  After 22 days both E2 and E1 were undetectable, while only 4% of ZAL and ZAN remained in solution.  Further, we also demonstrated that all compounds were translocated from the roots to the shoots.  Thus, we demonstrated that the plant is actively mobilizing the compounds from the root zone to shoots well beyond simple sorption. \n\nWith respect to attenuation of the estrogenic compounds within corn we showed that plants are capable of transforming the reduced estrogenic compounds (E2 and ZAL) to their oxidized species (E1 and ZAN respectively), which has been observed to occur in the presence of bacteria and archaea.   What was surprising, however, is that plants are also capable of converting (reducing) the oxidized forms back to the reduced parent compound i.e., E1 to E2 and ZAN to ZAL.  This is the first documentation that we are aware of that demonstrates this reverse process by plants.  Microorganisms in contrast can only oxidize the parent compounds and not the reverse.  Regardless of the mechanism corn seedlings were able to rapidly attenuate all the target compounds to other unknown products, which we were unable to detect.  Thus, we conclude that estrogenic substances found in CAFO manure are readily and rapidly attenuated by plants and cannot be reintroduced to the environment when the plant is no longer viable. \n\nThe final aspect of the project involves assessing uptake and transformation of these estrogenic compounds by hybrid poplars, which are commonly planted in riparian buffer strips to attenuate contaminants from overland flow.  We demonstrated that viable poplar trees were highly efficient at removing the target compounds (97% removal) relative to non-viable plants (71-84%) after 10 days.  Further oxidative transformation occurred quickly in the viable plants, which was able to transform the metabolites into other products in the roots after 5 days.  In contrast metabolites formed much more slowly in the non-viable plants, and did not form other derivatives over time. \n\nIn conclusion our research definitively demonstrated that estrog..."
