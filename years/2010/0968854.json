 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the PIs will study fundamental physics at the subnuclear level and its impact on our understanding of the Cosmos. A broad range of topics in particle physics such as supersymmetry, extra dimensions, neutrino physics and grand unification are covered. Topics in cosmology cover the nature and origin of dark matter and dark energy and their implications for large scale structure of the universe. The unifying theme is the search for new physics that explains various puzzles of the successful standard model of particle physics and cosmology and their tests at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and various ongoing non-accelerator searches for new physics such as dark matter, neutrino mixings, astrophysical anomalies and cosmic microwave background. These projects will extend the frontiers of our understanding of quark-lepton phenomena and the early Universe and may lead to discovery of new particles and forces. The research program will support graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The PIs will develop a strong program of research for high school and undergraduate students, with an emphasis on students from historically black colleges. The research work of this group will be disseminated through public and school lectures, participation in science fairs, and media broadcasts. The proposal will also enhance scientific collaboration with Johns Hopkins University as well as partnerships with Howard University, Hampton University, and the University of Iowa.",
