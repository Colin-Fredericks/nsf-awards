Professors Nada Assaf-Anid of New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) and Alan Mickelson (U Colorado-Boulder) together with a cohort of scientists and engineers from NYIT and other institutions will visit with faculty at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NUPT).  The visit will take place in conjunction with the two-day forum, Think Green: Energy, Education, \r\nEnvironmental Initiatives, that will be held April 8 ? 9, 2010, as a collaborative and multi-disciplinary effort between NYIT and NUPT, in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.  The goal of the visit is to undertake onsite discussions about research collaborations between NYIT?s School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, the University of Colorado?s Mortenson Center in Engineering for Developing Communities and NUPT, building on the three institutions? combined expertise in information and communication systems, tele-health, tele-education, embedded-systems technologies.  Discussions will revolve around the development of independent, sustainable power-generation systems, such as pico- and micro-hydro or solar devices, wind and hybrid power systems, as well as smart gridding and smart networks with the development of environmental monitoring/control technologies.\r\n\r\nThe technical impact of this collaboration is likely to benefit engineering and computing research in all three institutions. Progress on new energy systems will yield global benefits. The collaboration will also enhance scientific cooperation between Chinese and US faculty and provide students from both nations with opportunities for international research experience.",
