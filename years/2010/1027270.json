 "awd_abstract_narration": "The large plant genus Oxalis holds an amazing diversity of forms, including small shrubs, succulent herbs, long vines, and alpine cushion forms.  Many species survive cold or dry seasons underground by means of various kinds of storage structures: tubers, tuberous roots, rhizomes with fleshy scales, woody crowns, and two different kinds of bulbs. This diversity makes Oxalis a compelling subject for studying the evolution of plant form, especially of these storage structures.  This project uses DNA sequences and comparisons with morphology to study the evolutionary relationships among species of Oxalis, to help understand how storage structures such as bulbs evolve, and from what precursors.  The results will also shed light on the evolution of plant breeding systems, chromosome numbers, and biogeography.\r\n\r\nThis project will build an international group of researchers to collaborate on Oxalis research, including partners in Brazil, Germany, Holland, South Africa, and Uruguay.  It will provide research experience and training to at least one graduate student and numerous undergraduate students.  The project broadens participation in research by supporting research led by a female PI, and undergraduates of targeted underrepresented groups in the sciences will be recruited.  Members of the PI's lab will incorporate the research process and results into many ongoing educational and outreach activities.  In addition, the research results may eventually help in potential improvement of crops grown for edible bulbs, or grown from bulbs.",
