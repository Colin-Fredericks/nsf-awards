The fluorimeter \r\nis used to study the structure, stability and interactions of proteins \r\nand other biological macromolecules.  Major experiments that will be \r\nperformed with the fluorimeter include fluorescence resonance energy \r\ntransfer, providing information on the distribution of distances between \r\nfluorophores attached to biomolecules, and anisotropy (polarization), to \r\nstudy interactions between biomolecules.  Some of the molecules of \r\ninterest in these studies include neurolysin, neuropeptidase, and \r\nnitroreductase.  In addition, the instrument is available for use by \r\ninvestigators at other regional institutions and used in the annual \r\nBiofluorescence Symposium at the University of Kentucky.  The results of \r\nthese research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through \r\nabstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active \r\nparticipation of students and faculty at professional meetings.",
