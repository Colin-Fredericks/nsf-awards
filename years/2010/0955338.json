 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The field of grain boundary engineering (GBE) has demonstrated the many advantages of having low Sigma; (Sigma less than or equal to 29) grain boundaries for enhanced physical and chemical performance of materials. The study of nanoscale twin boundaries allows for the next stage of microstructural material design by the control and manipulation of both grains and boundaries at the nanoscale. Therefore, the research objective of this proposal is twofold: a) to understand the evolution of nanoscale growth twins by studying the defects formed under various processing conditions and their relationship to twin formation and b) to relate how growth twins interact with boundaries to generate low Sigma grain boundaries. In order to accomplish the set objectives this project will focus on some key aspects such as the evolution of growth twins to provide a framework for the introduction of nanoscale growth twins in many different systems by using a controlled synthesis method: magnetron sputtering.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This study presents a new direction for materials development by introducing engineered structures using traditional materials science and nanotechnology. Even though nanoscale materials have shown tremendous potential there are typically two limiting factors to their application: thermal stability and low ductility. This research proposal aims to provide fundamental research on an area that promises further improvement of nanostructured materials. This ability can further aid in the design of new thermal resistant coatings and micro- and nano-scale MEMS systems. In addition, this projects focuses on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) learning since the PI will work with Iridescent, a non-profit, educational organization, to provide high quality, exciting, real-world science education that targets low-income Hispanic and African-American children in the Los Angeles area. A ten-session workshop on green materials processing will be developed for the Iridescent program by the PI's Engineering Freshman Academy class at USC. Thus, research, teaching and outreach are seamlessly combined as part of the PI's broader impacts.",
