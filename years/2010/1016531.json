 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is on development and simulation of a multiscale \r\nmodel for heterogeneous particulate flows, in which the motion of a very \r\nlarge number of small solid particles is coupled with a Newtonian \r\nincompressible fluid. The problem derives from particle transport, \r\nsedimentation, fluidization and separation processes that are common in \r\nmany applications. Currently, there are two major approaches to simulate \r\nsuch flows: one of them is based on averaged equations, the other one - on \r\ndirect numerical simulations. The first approach requires homogeneity in \r\nthe flow which is often violated in applications, while the second one is \r\ncurrently limited to a relatively small number (compared to applications) \r\nof particles. However, practical applications involve millions and \r\nbillions of particles whose small size leads the problem of interest to \r\nspan two length scales: fine scale - the scale of particles, and coarse \r\nscale - the scale of the application. In developing the proposed approach \r\nthe variational multiscale framework is employed, in which the problem is \r\nsplit into two problems corresponding to the coarse and fine scales. It is \r\nassumed that in each coarse grid the particle distribution can be of three \r\ndifferent regimes depending on their concentrations: dilute, moderate and \r\ndense. The main goal of the proposed study is to design a multiscale \r\nmethod that can handle heterogeneous flows in all three regimes in a \r\nunified way. The key idea of the proposed approach is, after separating \r\nthe two scales, to use properly chosen subgrid models adaptively to \r\nrepresent micro-scale flow and particle dynamics on a coarse grid. In the \r\ndilute limit, a modified viscosity is used to represent averaged effects. \r\nIn the dense limit, the discrete network approximation method to \r\napproximate the subgrid effects is utilized. Network models allow avoiding \r\ndetailed fine-scale simulations in the dense regimes and provide \r\nsubstantial CPU savings. In the intermediate regime, fine-scale features \r\nwithin a target coarse-grid block are resolved. The issues to be focused \r\non are (1) coarse coupling, (2) boundary conditions for local problems, \r\n(3) approximation of subgrid effects, (4) effective solution strategies.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project provides tools to simulate heterogeneous particulate flows of small rigid particles in an incompressible fluid which have been \r\nof great interest for the last decade and are commonly encountered in many \r\napplications and fundamental fluid mechanics. The complexity of this \r\nproblem due to the presence of two different length scales is enormous and \r\nonly very recently the development of numerical techniques for direct \r\nnumerical simulations and computing power allowed for some attempts to \r\nnumerically resolving flows containing a relatively large number of \r\nparticles. However, existing direct numerical simulations methods have \r\nbeen developed for flows where the maximal number of particles to be \r\nhandled does not exceed a couple dozens of thousands while for practical \r\napplications much larger amount is of primary importance. This dictates a \r\nneed in developing a state-of-the-art predictive multiscale model for \r\nheterogeneous particulate flows which allows one to obtain a detailed and \r\naccurate representation of the flow, and which is the main focus of the \r\nproposed research.",
