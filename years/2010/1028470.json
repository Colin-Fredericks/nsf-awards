 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important characteristics of organisms is their body size -- influencing all physiological processes, life history traits and, ultimately, each of the fundamental processes affecting the diversity and geography of life (immigration, evolution and extinction).  Despite its fundamental and pervasive importance, body size varies tremendously among as well as within species.  This variation, however, is far from random, exhibiting ecological, geographic and temporal trends that are so general and intriguing that they are termed ecogeographic \"rules\" of nature (e.g., Bergmann's rule, the island rule and Cope's rule).  The investigators will conduct empirical research to develop an integrative theory that will provide a single conceptual construct in which to understand patterns of body size variation across space and time; patterns that are typically viewed as unrelated phenomena.  The international and integrative research program the investigators have developed combines theoretical, experimental and comparative approaches across a range of disparate, but strategically selected species and over a broad range of time scales (from the recent and historic periods through the Pliocene), thus allowing them to explore the generality, antiquity and causality of geographic variation in this fundamental feature of life.  The principal approach in this project will be to compare body sizes of museum specimens to test for predicted geographic and ecological trends among three focal groups of mammals: 1) mammals inhabiting paleo-islands during the Pliocene and Pleistocene; 2) extant, native mammals inhabiting islands across the globe, and 3) mammals introduced onto islands by Polynesians and by Europeans during the past 2000 years.  \r\n\r\nThis research will provide an integrative understanding of the factors influencing one of life's most fundamental characteristics -- body size, and its variation over space and time.  Given that body size influences all physiological, behavioral and ecological characteristics of organisms, these studies will provide important information on the capacities of animals to adapt to environmental challenges including climate change and modification of native landscapes.  The products of the fully funded research will include development of international partnerships between research labs in Europe, New Zealand and Hawaii, web access to all scientific data, mentoring of a Ph.D. level graduate research assistant and undergraduate assistants, development of an undergraduate field course in Biogeography, Evolution and Conservation of Insular Biotas, partnership with natural history museums to create an exhibit on The Evolution of Body Size on Islands, and consultations with conservation organizations to assist them in developing effective strategies for conserving not just diversity per se, but also a fundamental aspect of the natural character of native species -- their body size.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe most fundamental characteristic of an animal is its body size, which influences all of its physiological, behavioral and ecological characteristics including what it feeds upon, how much it consumes and whether it is a predator or prey and how it competes with other species.  Given the overriding importance of body size, we would expect that variation in body size among animals (within as well as among species) would be under strong pressures of natural selection and, therefore, relatively limited.  However, body size exhibits substantial variation among species and, perhaps more surprisingly, among populations within species across space and time. \n\n \n\nOur research sought to describe these patterns in intra-specific variation in body size across the globe and throughout the recent to Holocene (~ past 100,000 to 1 million years) for mammals &ndash; in particular, those inhabiting islands.  One intriguing pattern that has emerged over the past few decades is the island rule &ndash; a graded trend from gigantism exhibited by small mammals to dwarfism exhibited by large mammals.  The pattern is marked at its extremes by genuine marvels of island life &ndash; the oxymora of giant ?shrews? (sometimes over 100x the mass of the mainland ancestors) and pygmy ?mammoths\" (including those that dwarfed to less than 5% the mass of their mainland ancestors). \n\n \n\nOur research established the generality of the island rule patterns, confirming that it occurs across a variety of mammalian orders, geographic regions, trophic categories (herbivores, carnivores, &hellip;) and time periods.  We also developed a general explanation for body size variation across space and time, which asserts that body size is strongly influenced by ecological interactions with other species, which promotes diversification in size in high diversity (mainland) systems and convergence on intermediate body size (small species increasing in size, large species decreasing in size) in low diversity systems, i.e., on islands. \n\n \n\nOur research also revealed that these sometimes striking bouts of body size evolution can occur over just tens to hundreds of generations, and that anthropogenic extinctions and species introductions onto islands can diminish or eliminate the natural patterns of body size variation over space and time.  Our continuing research on mammals introduced onto islands again confirms the rapidity of body size evolution on islands, with introduced populations exhibiting the island rule within a few centuries of their establishment on islands.\n\n \n\nIn summary, our research established\n\nthe generality of variation of this fundamental trait of animals &ndash; body size &ndash; across the globe, that these patterns (i.e., of variation between mainland and insular systems, and over gradients of island area, isolation and latitude) \nthey are consistent with a general theory which holds that the optimal body size is a function of environmental and ecological characteristics of the islands, but that \nthese natural patterns have been fundamentally transformed by humanity.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark V Lomolino"
