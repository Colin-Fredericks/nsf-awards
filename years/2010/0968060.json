 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two primary goals.  The first is to solve the problem of the unitary dual: to describe the irreducible unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups. The primary tool is an algorithm to compute the unitary dual of any given group, which we are implementing inside the \"atlas\" software. We plan to use this information to prove results about the unitary dual, beginning with the unitarity of Arthur's unipotent representations. The second primary goal is to make information about representation theory of real groups accessible to non-specialists, via the software, a web site, public workshops, and other means. The atlas software is freely available on the atlas web site, and will continue to be maintained there indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe idea of using symmetry to study problems in mathematics and science dates back to Fourier's work on heat nearly two hundred years ago. In the hands of Hermann Weyl, Eugene Wigner, and Andre Weil, symmetry has come to play a central role in quantum mechanics and in number theory. Lie groups, named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, are the mathematical objects underlying symmetry.  Representation theory studies all of the ways a given symmetry, or Lie group, can manifest itself. The problem of understanding all \"unitary\" representations (in which the symmetry operations preserve lengths) is one of the most important unsolved problems in the subject, and has potential applications in many areas; for example, it is an abstract version of the question, \"what quantum mechanical systems can admit a certain kind of symmetry?\"",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnitary representations of Lie groups are at the center of much of the mathematics developed in the twentieth century. The most important outcome of FRG: Collaborative Research: Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations:  Unitary Representations is an algorithm to determine the set of unitary representations of a reductive Lie group.  This outcome has the potential for broad impact both within and beyond the discipline of mathematics, and the algorithm's implementation in the software package atlas has significant potential for the training of future students in this central area of mathematics.\n\nTo place the outcome in context, we recall that in the early part of the century, classical Fourier analysis became understood as an example of unitary representation theory of abelian Lie groups.  This viewpoint led to vast generalizations in modern harmonic analysis, which has since become one of the fundamental tools in engineering, signal processing, and image analysis.\n\nMeanwhile unitary representations of (nonabelian) compact Lie groups became prominent in quantum mechanics (for example in the spherically symmetric solutions of the Schroedinger equation for the hydrogen atom) at about the same time certain noncompact Lie groups like the Lorentz group were being systematically studied for their role as symmetries of space-time. Later, Langlands introduced a fundamental new viewpoint in which central arithmetic objects were understood in terms of unitary representations. More modern physical theories (from the standard model to string theory) continued to rely on the language of unitary representations to understand the role of symmetry in their formulations.\n\nAn underlying principle (codified most completely in Gelfand\u00c6s school of abstract harmonic analysis) emerged: understanding all irreducible unitary representations of a given Lie group G (the so-called unitary dual of G) placed highly nontrivial constraints on problems from the fields of harmonic analysis, automorphic forms, physics, and many others.\n\nDespite the intense amount of interest in unitary representations, an algorithm to determine the unitary dual of a noncompact Lie group was obtained only recently, and is the major outcome of the project FRG: Collaborative Research: Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations:  Unitary Representations.  Substantial parts of the algorithm have been implemented in free open-source software.\n\nIn addition to the algorithm described above, other important restults were obtained about unitary representations of related objects (so-called split p-adic groups) which are fundamental in Langlands' theory.  A key outcome of the current project was the discovery of p-adic analogs of Dirac operators for spinor bundles on Riemannian symmetric spaces.  This has led to advances in the unitary representation theory of p-adic groups.\n\nThe outcomes describes above were the subject of a number of scholarly articles.  The outcomes were also disemminated widely through seminars, conferences, and minicourses.
