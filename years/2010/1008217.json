 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project,  Dr. Thorstensen will continue his longstanding effort to provide observational tests of the theory of cataclysmic variables (CVs).  Formerly called novae, CVs consist of close binary stars in which mass is flowing from an evolved red giant onto a compact white dwarf.  The material piling up on the white dwarf surface can undergo thermonuclear fusion, leading to a significant temporary brightening of the system.  Dr. Thorstensen and his students will obtain measurements of orbital velocities and distances of CVs, which will improve mass estimates of the components of the binaries and to determine the volume density of CVs near the Sun.  \r\n\r\nDr. Thorstensen will provide research experiences for undergraduates by including them on observing runs, and will supervise a graduate student who will work on the analysis of new and existing data.  He also plans to improve certain widely-used software packages which he has previously written and distributed to the community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBackground: When new stars form, they often form in pairs, or even multiple systems.  Often these pairs form so close together that later on, as the stars evolve, matter spills from one star to another.  Usually one star has more mass than the other, and hence is the first to swell into a red giant.  The red giant balloons to such a size that it can engulf its companion.  The energy of the orbiting companion somehow strips away the outer layers of the red giant, causing the mutual orbit of the stars to shrink dramatically.  Eventually, the red giant burns away its remaining nuclear fuel and shrinks to become a white dwarf, an earth-sized star containing almost as much mass as the entire sun.  If the orbit continues to shrink, or the companion swells up, matter from the companion can now fall onto the white dwarf.  White dwarfs have such powerful gravity that the infalling matter must give up a great deal of energy, causing it to glow brightly.  Systems of this kind -- close double stars in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a closely-orbiting companion -- are called cataclysmic variable stars, or CVs, because in many cases the transfer of mass onto the white dwarf occurs in sudden episodes, causing the star to brighten dramatically literally overnight.\n\n\nWhat we did: In this project, we observed a large number of CVs with telescopes and instrumentation at Dartmouth's shared observatory, near Tucson, Arizona, and made reliable measurements of their basic characteristics, most notably their orbital periods -- the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other.  The stars are so close together that they typically make a round trip in a few hours, or even more quickly.

First, when white dwarfs are loaded up too heavily, they undergo catastrophic nuclear explosions called Type Ia supernovae, which synthesize and distribute the heavier elements such as iron and calcium, which are needed to form rocky planets and living creatures.  These same explosions can be seen from far across the cosmos, and are excellent signposts for measuring the universal expansion; it is from these that the existence of dark energy was first inferred.  CVs are the best laboratory we have for understanding how white dwarfs gain matter on their way to exploding.  Also, the processes that give rise to CVs are \"messy\" enough that they are very hard to calculate, yet they are important not only for understanding CVs, but for many other kinds of stars such as black hole binaries.  By measuring the population of CVs -- in particular, how many of each kind there are in our solar neighborhood -- we can hope to tightly constrain just how those \"messy\" processes go, in order to properly understand the evolution of these objects.\n\nBroader Impacts:   As mentioned earlier, this is an ideal training ground for students, because they get to see results right away. We frequently take undergraduate students along on observing runs and give them hands-on experience. In addition, the last student trained on this grant, Julie Skinner, is a committed education/public-outreach person, whose influence will spr..."
