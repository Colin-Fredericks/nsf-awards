 "awd_abstract_narration": "Renewed interest in the physics of nuclei is fueled by experiments at rare isotope beam facilities, which open the door to new regions of exotic nuclei; by astrophysical observations and simulations of neutron stars and supernovae, which require controlled extrapolations of the equation of state of nucleonic matter in density, temperature, and proton fraction; and by studies of universal physics, which unite cold atom and dilute neutron physics.  The projects funded by this award address this physics by combining effective field theory, which provides a systematic expansion of nuclear forces including the important three-body forces, and renormalization group methods, which decouple troublesome high-energy contributions from the low-energy parts we want to describe.  The results are controlled calculations that can better exploit the steady improvements in computing power.\r\n\r\nThe training received by undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates in carrying out the proposed activities contributes directly to the building of a diverse scientific workforce.  The mix of analytical and numerical computation employed is excellent preparation for both academic and industrial research.  The emphasis on universal aspects of physical systems, fostered by effective field theory and renormalization group approaches, as well as the direct application of techniques to problems beyond the nuclear domain, leads to enhanced collaborations between disciplines.  Outreach efforts will bring interactive science to a wide range of Ohio residents.",
