The goal of the project is to test the hypothesis that southern Mexico experienced prolonged wet conditions during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA) that was coincident with a more La Ni\u00f1a-like state of low sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe primary broader impacts involve the education of a doctoral student and the development of English and Spanish guides to cave science for interested members of the public in the U.S. and in Mexico.  Also, the science results could have broad application to many areas in the physical and social sciences.",
