 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is to develop solution methods for\r\nsolving magneto-hydrodynamics flows in three-dimensional domains comprising conducting\r\nand nonconducting regions and variable/discontinuous magnetic\r\npermeability.  The method to be developed will be robust enough to\r\nhandle High Reynolds flows and high Prandtl numbers. Lagrange finite elements \r\nwill be used and novel mathematical formulations will be developed\r\nto make Lagrange finite elements to converge\r\nin non-smooth domains and with non-smooth interfaces. \r\nThe code to be developed will be fully parallel.\r\nThe applications targeted\r\nare the geodynamo, sea-water/oil separation and liquid metal flows.\r\nThe solution strategy to be developed will be\r\nflexible enough so as to be easily modifiable to simulate plasma flows\r\nin Tokamak geometries and thus to contribute to the ongoing global\r\ninternational effort on magnetic confinement of plasmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe focus of the research program is to propose and analyze new\r\nnumerical strategies for simulating three-dimensional fluid flows\r\ninteracting with electromagnetic fields in heterogeneous media at high\r\nspeed. One phenomenon of interest is the so-called fluid dynamo\r\neffect.  The dynamo phenomenon arises in astrophysics. It is\r\nresponsible for the magnetic fields that are observed around stars and\r\nplanets with liquid cores. This phenomenon arises also in experimental\r\nsetups aiming at reproducing the dynamo effect. The fluid may be\r\nplasma in stars and in tokamaks, molten iron in planets, or liquid\r\ngallium or sodium in experimental setups. The dynamo effect may have\r\nundesired consequence on heat extraction processes from fast breeder\r\nreactors. This research will also prepare the ground for further\r\ndevelopments on plasma flows in Tokamak geometries. This research\r\nproject will involve large scale parallel computing and will lead to new\r\nnumerical strategies to simulate high speed flows interacting with\r\nmagnetic fields.",
