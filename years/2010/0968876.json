The new institutions will add strategically to Center goals, because of their strong histories in applications of modern CAx software.  The proposed research will support the existing Center?s infrastructure research in all four thrust areas, but will strongly complement Thrust II: New Paradigms and Processes.  The intellectual merit will be measured by how the rather subtle perturbations to the computer operating systems (OS) and CAx architectures collapse product development times for multi-users.\r\n\r\nThe new universities bring cultural diversity to the research that will be demanded by research prototypes. BYU will extend and integrate CAx applications through API libraries, computer OS architectures, network security, and business team conflict resolution. While BYU has strong relationships with several international institutions that have expertise in gaming technologies, UPR has backgrounds in constraint relationships as they relate to design parameters. BYU's and UPR's strong dependence on both undergraduate and graduate students for development and testing, will provide students a rich educational experience. The universities also plan to involve K-12 and post K-12 levels in the Center.",
