The funds will support a total of about 20 researchers from the US to attend the symposium. The Symposium will consist of three days of technical presentations and keynote speeches, followed by post-symposium technical tours to major university research laboratories and industry production facilities in Japan. This grant will stimulate the technical discussion among researchers in the field and foster future collaborations. The benefits to the U.S. researchers attending the symposium will include the knowledge gained from the technical presentations and discussions on various processes and systems and underlying principles of flexible automation.\r\n\r\nJapan is one of the world leaders in nano-manipulation, nano-machining, robotics and control, sensors, system analysis and integration, the support will enable many researchers (faculty, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students), scientists and engineers from U.S. to gain the first-hand knowledge of research, development, and implementation of flexible automation technologies in Japan.",
