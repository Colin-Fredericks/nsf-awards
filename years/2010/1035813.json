 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study, develop and implement a comprehensive set of techniques that will eventually enable automobiles to be driven autonomously.   The approach taken is to (a) address cyber-physical challenges of reliable, safe and timely operations inside the automobile, (b) tackle a range of physical conditions and uncertainties in the external environment, (c) enable real-time communications to and from the automobile to other vehicles and the infrastructure, and (d) study verification and validation technologies to ensure correct implementations.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: The project seeks to make basic research contributions in the domains of safety-critical real-time fault-tolerant distributed cyber-physical platforms, end-to-end resource management, cooperative vehicular networks, cyber-physical system modeling and analysis tools, dynamic object detection/recognition, hybrid systems verification, safe dynamic behaviors under constantly changing operating conditions, and real-time perception and planning algorithms.   Multiple intermediate capabilities in the form of active safety features will also be enabled. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Automotive accidents result in about 40,000 fatalities and 3 million injuries every year in the USA. The global annual cost of road injuries is $518 billion. Many accidents are due to humans being distracted. Autonomous vehicles controlled by ever-vigilant cyber-physical systems can lead to significant declines in accidents, deaths and injuries.  Autonomous vehicles can also offload driving chores from humans, and make time spent in automobiles more productive.  Vehicular networks can help find the best possible routes to a destination in real-time.  Broader impacts in this area are amplified by the project's partnerships with companies in the transportation and agricultural technology industries, and in information technology.  Broader impacts are also sought through demonstrations and outreach to attract students into science and technology, and in particular to cyber-physical systems research.",

Annually, there are about 35,000 automotive fatalities in the US and a staggering 1.3 fatalities around the world.    More than 10 times these numbers are injured, and automotive accident counts exceed more than 100 times these numbers.   These lead to several hundred billion dollars of economic damage, besides the grief, sorrow and long-term impact on individuals, their families and their communities.   Unfortunately, most of these crashes happen due to human distraction.   Connected automation can significantly reduce these numbers over time.    The average adult in the US spends more than 51 minutes per workday commuting to and from work as a single person in a vehicle.  We also waste about 38 hours per year (almost an entire work-week) stuck in traffic.    If vehicles can drive themselves, these mostly wasted durations can instead be used for productive purposes.   Finally, with automated vehicles, the elderly, the disabled and the legally blind, who are unable to drive themselves, can regain mobility options and independence and thereby have a much higher quality of life.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on multiple fronts including computer vision, behavioral logic to follow the rules of the road, redundancy management for tolerating fafults, path planning algorithms, control techniques, connectivity with other vehicles and the infrastructure, localization techniques to know where the vehicle is on a map for making navigation decisions, and to route planning.\n\nThe need for intelligent software to make complex driving decisions coupled with the difficulty of real-world driving environments makes connected and automated vehicles a flagship application domain for cyber-physical systems where the cyber-components of computing and communications must monitor and control entities in the physical world safely, reliably and in real-time.
