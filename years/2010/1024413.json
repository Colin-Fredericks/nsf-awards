 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans have influenced fire regimes for thousands of years through their impact on ignition rates, fuels, and land cover.  Changes in fire-regimes have dramatically altered ecosystem dynamics by shifting plant communities, creating opportunities for recruitment of new species, and restructuring land-surface processes and nutrient cycles.  Paleoecological and archeological data indicate widespread deforestation in New Zealand about 700 years ago associated with the first known Maori (Polynesian) presence.  Abrupt deforestation through the use of fire was achieved by small transient Maori populations in the absence of climate change, a situation that is contrary to other temperate rainforest regions where deforestation was associated with sedentary populations and significant climate change.  New Zealand offers one of the most dramatic examples of human-caused deforestation through the deliberate use of fire, and its vegetation and fire history provides an important case study for understanding the consequences of wholesale burning of rainforests.  Earlier research used high-resolution charcoal and pollen data to document a distinct period of burning following Maori arrival on the South Island of New Zealand.  This event now is termed the Initial Burning Period (IBP).  This research project will address the following questions:  What spatial and temporal patterns of fire are evident during the IBP, and do they suggest the motivation for burning?  Were the environmental consequences of the IBP largely shaped by the nature of the burning, the introduction of a novel disturbance, or by site-specific physical characteristics?  What limited the recovery of native New Zealand forests after the IBP?  The investigators will use recently recovered records to closely compare fire regimes on the South Island, where agriculture was relatively unsuccessful and populations were transient, with those on the North Island, where settlements were well established and large.  They will acquire new lake-sediment cores from the eastern coastal plain on the South Island and the fertile volcanic regions of the North Island.  They will develop high-resolution macroscopic charcoal and pollen records that span the last 2,000 years and examine changes in fire regime and vegetation during the IBP.  They will reconstruct detailed vegetation histories for each site and develop high-resolution chronologies to synchronize paleoenvironmental proxy from multiple watersheds.  They will examine high-resolution geochemical, limnobiotic, and magnetic susceptibility data from multiple sites to document the sequence of watershed events during the IBP, and they will use a GIS database for multiple-site comparisons of patterns of fire with archeological, physical, and environmental characteristics.  They will compare independent paleoclimate proxies with variations in fires during the past 2,000 years and use landscape simulation models to understand the sequence of events during and after the IBP.  In coordination with the Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College, the investigators will develop and disseminate educational materials for broad outreach in the U.S. and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute new information to debates about the extent to which pre-European landscapes were pristine or humanized.  The application and refinement of new tools, such as molecular biomarkers (used to identify and characterize charcoal in sediments), and approaches to document and understand past fires have the potential to transform fire-history science into a truly interdisciplinary field.  The project also will provide information about the historical range of variability of fire and post-fire consequences for natural resource managers and educational materials on the topics of human-environmental interactions, sustainability, and scientific discovery.  The project's application of landscape simulation models to study fire behavior and spread will allow scenario testing of different combinations of fire, fuels, and landscape conditions to explain the past consequences of human action and its effects on ecosystems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHumans have used fire as a tool to manage ecosystems for their benefit for millennia yet the extent to which prehistoric societies used deliberate fires to shape ecosystems is still not well understood.  Evaluating the degree to which environments were relatively pristine or mostly humanized landscapes prior to the Industrial Revolution is critical for anticipating how feedbacks and interactions between land-use, changing climatic conditions and fire will shape future resources we depend on.  In New Zealand, Polynesian arrival approximately 700 years ago marked the onset of one of the most dramatic ecosystem transitions known worldwide.  Here, nearly half of the closed forests were converted to open shrublands.  This conversion persisted until Europeans arrival in the 19th century led to a second increase in fire activity that further expanded non-forest vegetation. \n\nTo better understand the sequence of events that led to the demise of extensive native forests in New Zealand, we used an array of indicators of past change to reconstruct fire activity and environmental change (e.g., pollen, charcoal, diatoms, insects).  Data from our network of over 30 lake sediment cores from both the North and South islands document the frequency and magnitude of fires that were responsible for forest loss.  Within a few decades of Polynesian arrival, fire activity increased dramatically at all but the wettest sites in New Zealand.  Reconstructions of climatic conditions during the interval of increased fire activity, we call the Initial Burning Period, indicated that human-set fires rather than changes in climate (e.g., extended droughts, warming temperatures) were responsible for the shift from a fire-sensitive to a fire-prone system.  High-resolution chronologies for the deforestation interval also showed that persistent forest transitions occurred in as a few years to 1-2 decades, highlighting the speed at which widespread forest transitions took place.  Evaluation of the impact of European-set fires and the introduction of nonnative species in the 19-20th centuries revealed levels of forest loss, erosion and vegetation change that equaled or surpassed the first wave of human-set fires.\n\nThe deforestation that followed human arrival in South Island, New Zealand was remarkable because it was accomplished by small, largely transient, nonagricultural populations (&lt;0.3 people km2) in places remote from any settlement.  We used simulation models to better understand the mechanisms that allowed small populations to initiate high levels of fire activity in a landscape where fire was naturally rare.  Models were designed to test whether targeting human-set fires in more flammable young vegetation or during extremely warm and dry years could lead to the loss of greater than 40% of closed forests.  The results showed that targeting ignitions in small patches of highly flammable young vegetation was sufficient to initiate a positive feedback between fuels and fire, and this in turn, increased overall landscape flammability allowing large expanses of forests to burn in subsequent fires.\n\nOur discoveries have profound implications for landscapes in the United States.  We compared the history of human settlement and associated environmental change in New Zealand with that of the northwestern United States and southern South America and found that even wet, relatively \u00e6fire-free\u00c6 landscapes, could experience a rapid shift to a more fire-prone state with changes in the location and frequency of ignitions.  While comparable forests in the western US never experienced the extent of forest loss due to prehistoric human-set fires, our comparison highlights how feedbacks and interactions can lead to widespread forest transitions as climate warming and land-use change influence fire activity in the future.\n\nIn summary, our research findings in New Zealand suggest that rapid, human-caused shifts in fire activity and the vegetation transitions may occur in s..."
