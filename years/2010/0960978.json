 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title:   DMTCP: Checkpoint-Restart on the Desktop\r\nPI:  \t Gene Cooperman\r\nNSF Proposal Number:  0960978\r\n\r\nABSTRACT:  \r\n\r\nThis work builds upon the existing open source, user-space DMTCP package\r\nfor transparent, distributed checkpointing.  Three goals will be accomplished:\r\n(i) checkpoint-restart of long-running computations on the desktop;\r\n(ii) save-restore of interactive software packages; and (iii) a universal\r\nreversible debugger.  The first two goals will allow software development\r\nteams to add to their package a reliable \"save workspace\" feature --- with\r\nno requirement for a kernel module or other privileged operations.\r\nThe third goal is to enhance any debugger with reversibility (e.g. a\r\nback-step command), and with a reverse expression watchpoint command to\r\nmove backwards from a software error to the original software fault.\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT:\r\nWhile checkpointing has existed for over 20 years, earlier packages\r\nwere difficult to maintain.  The unprivileged, user-space design of\r\nDMTCP has a five-year track record.  It is ideal for integration into\r\nother software, where any end-user requirement for installation of a\r\nkernel module or other administrative privilege is incompatible with\r\nwidespread distribution.  Finally, DMTCP is the first package able to\r\ndirectly checkpoint a gdb session (the gdb process and its target process)\r\n-- a key feature for the envisioned new type of reversible debugger.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT:\r\nCheckpointing and process migration have long been of interest for science\r\nand engineering, but too often suffered from software fragility or special\r\nrequirements.  The DMTCP approach removes these obstacles.  Further,\r\nthe wider use of ``time-traveling (reversible) debuggers'' will greatly\r\naccelerate software development due to the greater ease of finding bugs.\r\nA NIST report estimates the cost of software bugs to the economy at\r\n$59.5 billion per year.  Finally, the excitement factor of checkpoint-restart\r\non the desktop helps attract and motivate students toward the learning\r\nof sometimes arcane systems issues in this critical technology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCheckpoint-restart allows one to save a running computer program or computation to disk, and later to restart it from where it stopped.  This is important for long-running programs or long interactive sessions.  A checkpoint-restart package, DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPointing), has been designed around the idea of plugins for process virtualization.  Plugins allow it to adapt to an execution environment that is different on restart, as compared to prior to checkpoint.  This new platform was the key to creating a modest-sized, easily maintainable support for the several results described below.\n\nThe checkpoint-restart package is distributed as free and open-source software at http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net .  It is also available as a package for the most common Linux distributions.  The DMTCP forum provides free technical support.\n\nThis platform enabled three especially significant results (firsts for checkpointing) for which two are published and one represents ongoing work.\n\nCheckpoint-restart has been extended to directly support checkpointing over the InfiniBand network.  This eliminates the need for an MPI-specific checkpoint-restart service to \"tear down the network\", delegate to a single-host checkpointing package, and then \"re-build the network\".\nCheckpoint-restart has been extended to checkpointing of a network of virtual machines (QEMU over KVM, while checkpointing the Tun/Tap bridge network).  This has important applications for Cloud Computing. \nCheckpoint-restart has been extended to provide support for checkpointing the state of programmable GPUs (using modern shaders).  The mechanism demonstrated is: record-prune-replay.\n\n\nIn particular, the support for InfiniBand, in conjunction with a principled implementation of checkpoint-restart for the ssh protocol allow DMTCP to transparently checkpoint various dialects of MPI.  This technology provides the potential in the future to transparently checkpoint and restart entire batch queues for high performance computing (HPC).  Such a capability will make more efficient use of expensive computer resources in HPC.\n\nIn addition, a reversible debugger, FReD, has been demonstrated as a proof-of-principle.  This supports a novel debugging technique, \"reverse expression watchpoint\" (also called \"reverse transition watchpoint\") has been demonstrated.  A single mechanism for supporting GDB, the Python debugger and the Matlab debugger has been demonstrated, and can be easily extended to additional debuggers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gene Cooperman"
