 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AUM Seamless Admission Summer Bridge program for Engineering Students is a potential national model that will provide a welcoming campus environment and immerse participants in a culture of rigor, encouragement, and connectivity within the campus. The emphasis on females will address the continuing low number of women in engineering fields, particularly in graduate education and the professoriate. LSAMP support and engagement will bring in intellectual and material resources to ensure success and bring the national conversation on engineering preparation into the program design and implementation. Students will gain foothold on their college degree program through the advising, strategies for success, tutoring and mentoring, as well as receive a stipend which will allow them to participate and benefit from the activities instead of working during the summer. Students will be exposed to research and career opportunities for a well rounded experience. The faculty have a clear and confident vision of the program. The one-on-one interaction between faculty and students; and other demonstrated experts in the broad scope of engineering fields is important to both faculty and students. \r\nValue added includes the tours of local engineering companies and the US Space and Rocket Center, which will provide access that the students would not otherwise have. The seminars, workshops, and required poster projects broaden the student experience well beyond coursework. The dissemination of lessons learned in the national LSAMP magazine will share the program with a national audience, expanding the potential impact.",
