 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this project is to develop simple yet robust methods for massively producing well-positioned nanostructured materials composed of DNA or DNA-based nanocomposites, which possess unprecedented regularity, over a large area (i.e., large scale). Subsequent functionalization of highly ordered DNA can serve as multifunctional materials for a variety of potential applications in nanoelectronic devices. Three specific research goals will be pursued throughout this proposed project: (1) Produce highly ordered structures of DNA and DNA-based nanocomposites by controlling the flow of an evaporating liquid. (2) Develop a reliable and scalable strategy for integrating individual nanoscale building blocks (i.e., DNA) into functional two-dimensional devices with high density. By performing two consecutive evaporation-induced self-assemblies, it is possible to create highly ordered 2D DNA nanowire arrays. (3) Understand the formation mechanisms of ordered structures. The ability to predict the length scale of periodicity, height, and width and compare them with experimental observations is key to the understanding on the structure formation.\r\n \r\nThis research is transformative in that it seeks to mass produce high-density functional nanodevices and nanocircuits, built upon well-positioned, highly ordered DNA or DNA nanocomposites for use in nanoelectronics, nanotechnology, and biotechnology, thereby transitioning fundamental scientific discoveries into useful technologies. The research project will be integrated with nanoscience and nanoengineering education. The educational efforts include recruitment of female undergraduate students, recruitment of high school teachers and students with an emphasis on minority in summer to perform one week of research, and development of lesson plans on DNA and DNA-based nanocomposites by high-school female interns.",
