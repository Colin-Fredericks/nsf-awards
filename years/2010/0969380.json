 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost all of the visible mass that we see in the universe is contained in the atomic nucleus.  It is of vital importance to gain experimental data about how nuclei are constructed to explain the early history of the universe, the abundances of the chemical elements in our solar system and even the distribution of these elements in our galaxy.  An excellent nucleus to study for this purpose is the common isotope of helium, He-4.  This nucleus will be a subject of study at Jefferson Lab by measuring the probability of knocking out protons with different energies using the high-energy electron beam.  Another method of gaining insight into how nuclei are constructed is by placing short lived particles called hyperons in nuclei and observing the energy levels of these hypernuclei.  \r\n\r\nThese experiments will provide vital training for graduate students and undergraduate students in nuclear and particle physics.  The activities of these students will include helping set up the experiments, making the experimental measurements, analyzing the data and learning sophisticated simulation techniques.  There is a desperate need for well trained physicists in the near future.  The training the students receive has been shown to be transferable to other fields besides physics that benefit from the keen analytical skills they learn.",

The graduate student whose MS thesis is based on the 4He experiment(E08009) came to the Physics and Astronomy Department with an undergraduate degree in sociology and transitioned to an MS degree in physics. She is now seeking a teaching credential. Her broaden experience will be an important asset to her students. \nAnother graduate student was interested in medical applications of nuclear physics. He developed a Monte Carlo simulation to generate low energy neutrons from proton accelerators found at hospitals. The aim is to have a ready supply of neutrons for neutron capture therapy for cancer treatments. The present practice of Boron Neutron Capture therapy requires moving the patient to nuclear reactors. Some results from his analysis are shown in the figures for the 50 MeV and 200 MeV simulations he made. \nOur research group included two students who were dual majors in physics and mechanical engineering. Both these students gained valuable transferable training at Jefferson Lab which they can exploit when they enter the work force or continue into graduate school. \nOne of our students graduated and went on to the PhD physics ..."
