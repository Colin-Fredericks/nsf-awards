 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dawn of the massively parallel sequencing technology has propelled\r\nresearch in epigenetics, from genome-wide methylation profiling,\r\nhistone modification patterns clustering, to identifying gene\r\nregulation through spatial interactions. The power of epigenetics\r\nhas already been felt, such as its use in making drugs for treating\r\nseveral diseases, but unfortunately, it has also been recognized that\r\nit may be exploited for the bad. The powerful, rapidly acquirable,\r\nstable, and heritable features of epigenetic could be a perfect vehicle\r\nfor bio-terrorism. The regulatory mechanism of gene expression may\r\nbe altered based on the epigenetic principle to create mutant cells\r\nwith devastating consequences very quickly. To counter the potential\r\nof such threat, the detection of changes in epigenetic marks is a\r\nkey issue. This project aims to develop likelihood based as well\r\nas Bayesian methodology, computational algorithms and associated\r\nsoftware for analyzing massively parallel epigenomic sequencing data\r\nthat are tangible for detection of biological threats. The focus will\r\nbe on chromatin signature and structure analysis to study histone\r\nbinding patterns in promoters and enhancers and spatial interactions\r\nbetween promoters and enhancers within a protein complex. Methods and\r\nalgorithms developed will be implemented in three software packages:\r\nDIME, ChAPE, and BASIC. It is anticipated that the analytical tools\r\ndeveloped will contribute to uncover global host-response epigenetic\r\npatterns.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin's publication of \"On the origin of species\" 150 years\r\nago has taught us that evolutionary changes take many generations\r\nof natural selection. In recent years, however, a new scientific\r\narea called epigenetics is helping to usher in a paradigm shift. It\r\nis hypothesized, based on amassed scientific evidence, that powerful\r\nenvironmental conditions may leave an imprint on the genetic material,\r\nwhich can lead to passage of new traits in a single generation\r\nthrough the epigenetic process. The importance of epigenetics has\r\nbeen recognized in the scientific community, and indeed, epigenetics\r\nhas been used for the good, such as its utilization for producing drugs\r\nfor treating complex diseases. Unfortunately, it may also be exploited\r\nby bio-terrorists. In other words, gene regulation mechanism may be\r\naltered to create mutant cells, which could pose great threats with\r\ndevastating consequence. Anticipating the potential of such type of\r\nthreats, this project proposes statistical methods and computational\r\nalgorithms to analyze epigenetic data from advanced genomic sequencing\r\ntechnology to detect mutant cells that may have gone through epigenetic\r\nchanges. These tools are anticipated to contribute to early detection\r\nof exposure to potential biowarfare pathogen. This project will also\r\ncontribute to the training of the next generation of researchers in\r\na cutting-edge interdisciplinary research area that fuses knowledge\r\nin biology, statistics and computer science.",
