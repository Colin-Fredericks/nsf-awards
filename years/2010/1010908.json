 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\nNortheast Indiana is home to several major defense/aerospace contractors and a number of smaller suppliers that collectively have the potential to hire thousands of new and replacement workers in the next five years. To support this growth it is important to educate new master's-level professionals with broad skills in systems-engineering and a strong background in wireless technology.  This Science Master's Program at Indiana University - Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) is addressing this need.  \r\n  \r\nThe integration of systems engineering and wireless technology is a novel aspect of this program.  The curriculum is designed so that students develop both depth in the area of wireless technology and breadth in systems engineering.  In addition to traditional courses, students participate in internships with local companies, perform research and produce a thesis, and manage an undergraduate student design team.  The activities in the program are supported by an innovative graduate seminar series.  \r\n\r\nThis program has developed a unique, integrated graduate curriculum and is providing students with research experiences, internships, and management experiences.  These support additional learning through peer interactions and project-based learning.  Graduates of the program will have a high-degree of workforce readiness and unique expertise.  This project will ultimately strengthen the defense industry in northeast Indiana, which is of strategic importance to the state and the entire nation.",
