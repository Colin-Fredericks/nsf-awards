 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless ad-hoc networks consist solely of cheap, mobile nodes that operate in the absence of expensive fixed infrastructure such as base stations. In order to save energy, increase data rate, or improve robustness, some nodes may act as helper nodes, relaying some or all of the information.  In the simplest form of relaying, data packets are forwarded node-by-node in a manner akin to a fire bucket brigade. In more advanced methods, such as those considered in this research, several nodes can cooperate to forward information. The key design questions are two-fold.  First is the design of cooperative communication techniques, i.e., physical-layer approaches for relaying information from one set of nodes to the next.  Second is routing, i.e., identifying which of the available nodes should participate in the transmission and what system resources (time, energy, bandwidth) should be allocated to each. \r\n\r\nThis research analyzes interconnections between these two key questions, treated separately in most prior work.  We consider the routing problem when rateless codes are employed at the physical layer.  Such codes allow receiving nodes to accumulate mutual information (instead of just energy) from multiple transmitting nodes.  This yields greater network robustness and efficiency. The research investigates the effect of interference, which automatically arises when multiple messages are being transmitted simultaneously.  By using stochastic network optimization, optimum resource allocation can be provided without the need for centralized knowledge of all states of nodes and propagation channels. Cooperative transmission techniques based on a hybrid of network-coding and compute-and-forward, their rateless variants, and application to cooperative routing are investigated as well. The concepts are validated through experiments.",

The question of routing with advanced physical layers is novel, scientifically challenging, and practically important. The challenge arises because solutions require a combination of information theory, optimization theory, and knowledge of systems and wireless propagation.  Over the course of the project we significantly advanced our knowledge in this area.  We developed new methods to deal with streaming data systems, multiple information routes, and applied new tools from stochastic network optimization to characterize the stability region of such networks from a queuing perspective. \n\nOne assumption of our early project results was knowledge of network channel state information (CSI).  Inspired by work in the systems community we investigated how to acquire such CSI passively by observing the empirical occurances of collisions and transmission failures.  Inference from passively-collected data greatly reduces the network effort required to estimate such information, in particular in comparison to standard active \"probing\" techniques.  We applied tools from sparse graph inference to develop the scaling laws that underlie such inference problems. While initially motivated by centrally operated enterprise networks, these technique appear applicable to next-generation cloud radio access networks (CRAN).\n\nIn the project we developed results on two further aspect of information flow through networks. The first was in the study of rank-metric codes.  These codes are used for error-correction in non-coherent network coding.  In the project we developed information-theoretic bounds and constructions for these codes and connected them to problems of matrix completion and rank minimization over finite fields.  We also investigated questions of physical layer security in the form of secret key generation.  We developed a prototype for, and information theoretic bound on, the generation of secret keys based on the randomness intrinsic to wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.\n\nDevelopments over the course of the project were not constrained to wireless networks.  Part-way through we realized that the methods we were developing for routing could be applied to the placement of jobs and virtual machines in data centers.  This initiated a fruitful sequence of papers with colleagues in computer architecture that investigated the use of queuing-theoretic analysis and optimization perspectives and techniques to manage computing systems efficiently.  In one thrust we developed methods to manage the state of a processor system (the number of active cores, the sleep state processors are put into, and the speed-energy tradeoff effected by dynamic voltage frequency scaling) to minimize energy usage while meeting target quality-of-computing constraints.  In another we determined how jointly to set CPU and memory-bus speeds in future systems containing tens to hundreds of processors.\n\nThe collaboration with computer architects also led to a final thrust in the project, which exploits the use of technique of error-correction coding to generate partially-redundant copies of a computation.  The basic idea was that we could spread computation across a cluster of cloud-type compute notes with the dual objectives of robustifying computation and decreasing time-to-completion.  This thrust has involved us with industrial partners and generated a number of interesting and fruitful directions in approximate computing and large-scale optimization for machine learning type applications.\n\nIn parallel with the techical results described above, the project also helped fund a number of outcomes in professional development, outreach, and curriculum redesign.
