 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the workshop is to foster long-lasting international \r\nscientific collaborations to investigate the scientific foundations, design, and feasibility of a future \r\ninternational cyber architecture. Such an architecture must allow for transnational data repositories \r\nand be capable of enforcing both today's and future diverse security and privacy policies. Topics to \r\nbe addressed may include, among others, how to determine whether a set of privacy or access \r\ncontrol policies is consistent, whether it can be efficiently enforced, and if so what techniques are \r\nmost effective.  Different data exchange applications will require tailored mechanisms that allow for \r\nsecurity, privacy, anonymity, and provenance to be maintained. Of particular interest are (1) data \r\nconcerning malware detection (attack signatures, number/pattern of compromised systems, botnet \r\nmembership, vulnerability pricing data, etc.), (2) network management data (traffic patterns, \r\nheaders, routing updates, etc.), (3) social network data (usage patterns within social networking \r\napplications, status of data posted within these applications, etc.), as well as data from other \r\ndomains such as (4) healthcare data (electronic health records, including images, diagnostic notes, \r\nlaboratory reports, etc.), and (5) financial data (individual transactions, interbank transfers, credit \r\nreporting, etc.).The workshop will consist of several keynote talks, panels, and breakout sessions. \r\nIn addition, information will be presented about funding opportunities to support international \r\nresearch collaborations.",

The workshop was held in collaboration with the European INCO-TRUST project, to foster long-lasting international scientific collaborations to investigate the scientific foundations, design, and feasibility of a future international cyber architecture. (INCO refers to \"International Collaboration\" and TRUST refers to \"trustworthy information and communication technology\".)  Because the scope of cyberspace is global, it is critically important to have international communication and collaboration.  The INCO-TRUST workshops were noted in the United States Strategic Plan for the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Program (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/fed_cybersecurity_rd_strategic_plan_2011.pdf) as an example mechanism for promoting and advancing the U.S. cybersecurity research and development plan.\n\n The Second INCO-TRUST workshop had 45 participants from academia, industry, and research funding agencies from the United States, Europe, and other countries, and addressed issues of privacy, anonymity, provenance, transnational storage and dissemination, and ownership of data. The workshop addressed both technology challenges for trustworthy data exchange as well as the complexities resulting from diverse transnational policies, legal aspects, and cultural and societal considerations of use of information and data.
