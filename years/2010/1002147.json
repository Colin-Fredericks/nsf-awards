 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanomagnetism is one of the most active areas in science that presents us with a wide range of fundamental scientific problems as well as important and emerging technologies.  Many spin-based devices are still in their infancy and a thorough understanding of the underlying materials and electronic properties and their effect on device performance will be essential for all future applications.  The proposed research studies the relatively unexplored and emerging field of electric field control of metallic magnetic systems and exploits these effects in novel spin-based devices.  The proposal will address the electric-field control of the intrinsic magnetic properties of transition metals and their alloys and compounds. The materials parameters to be studied include the magnetic moment density, magnetic anisotropy, Curie temperature and non-adiabatic spin-transfer parameter in magnetic transition-metal systems.  All systems studied will be chosen such that they magnetically order near or above room temperature.  Because these materials are conducting, the electric field (and its affect on magnetism) is confined to the near surface region; therefore this research will focus on thin films and heterostructured devices where the surfaces can dramatically affect the magnetic properties. \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal stems from the prospect of achieving a fundamental and predictive understanding of the electric-field modification of itinerant magnetism at the nanoscale.  By combining skills in thin film synthesis and device fabrication, transport and magneto-optical measurements in device structures, and advanced characterization techniques, a complete data set will be obtained.  These results will test current models of magneto-electric coupling in metallic systems and it is anticipated that interesting and unexpected new magnetic phenomena will emerge in this study.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the research will be both technical and educational.  This research will address fundamental issues of magnetism and spin transport at the nanoscale and train undergraduate and graduate students in important areas of materials synthesis and characterization, device fabrication, nano-science, and nano-technology.  An understanding of electric field effects on magnetism will have broad ranging impact from understanding the performance of current magnetic tunneling devices, to assessing the potential of electrical control in future spin-based electronics.  The transformative goal is to provide the scientific underpinnings of next generation energy efficient, ultrafast, and ultrasmall magneto-electronic devices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNanomagnetism is one of the most active areas in science that presents us with a wide range of fundamental scientific problems as well as important and emerging technologies.  Many spin-based devices are still in their infancy and a thorough understanding of the underlying materials and electronic properties and their effect on device performance will be essential for all future applications.  This NSF funded project explored the relatively new and emerging field of electric field control of metallic magnetic systems and further exploits these effects in novel spin-based devices.  The project addressed the electric-field control of the intrinsic magnetic properties of transition metals and their alloys and compounds. Because these materials are conducting, the electric field (and its affect on magnetism) is confined to the near surface region; therefore the research focused on thin films and heterostructured devices where the surfaces dramatically affect the magnetic properties. \n\nIn the course of the research we studied fundamental electro-magnetic response of ferromagnetic metal-oxide heterostructures including CoFeB/MgO, Fe/MgO, Co/AlOx and transition metal heterostructures with lead zirconium titanate (PZT).  We quantified the interface anisotropy of the Fe-MgO and CoFeB-MgO interface in epitaxial heterostructures.  An example is shown in Figure 1 for epitaxial MgO/V/Fe/MgO and MgO/C/Fe/MgO structures.  These systems been widely used to fabricate magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) for spin-transfer-torque magnetoresistive random access memory (STT-MRAM) and read heads for magnetic hard disk drives.   The response of these systems to electric fields is a key component of emerging technologies.  In the process we have developed novel synchrotron techniques (both magnetic circular dichroism and coherent x-ray diffraction (CXD)) to probe the underlying electronic phenomena at the interfaces, to map the strain and piezoelectric response of PZT, and electric field response of magnetic systems.  This research uses novel device structures as shown in Figure 2 where simultaneous magneto-transport and synchrotron x-ray measurements could be performed.  The CXD approach can be further exploited to directly probe the ferro-electricity within a film or islands.  The contrast mechanism is coupling to the displacement vector within the polarized domain.  We have applied to continuous films and have measured formation of stripe domains and followed their evolution with applied voltage.  Shown in Figure 3 is an image of the phased vector map of electric polarization vector field for poled PZT that shows that film has mixed  domains even at maximum electric field.  We furether discovered canted modes piezoelectric states when PZT is patterned to the nanoscale. \n\nIn the process of the research we educated both undergraduate and graduate students and collaborated with leading international, industrial, and national user-facility scientists.  These collaborations broadened the impact of the research and provided important educational and post-graduate career opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric E Fullerton"
