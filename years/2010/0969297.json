 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to learn how different types of quarks can combine to form short-lived particles.  These data help physicists to understand more about the fundamental theory of the strong force, called quantum chromodynamics or QCD for short.  This is the same force that binds together protons and neutrons inside the nucleus of an atom.  The particles being studied here have a heavier quark, called the strange quark, which is not found isolated in a stable nucleus.  Instead, these particles are created using the energy of a collision between a beam of gamma-rays (high-energy photons) and a stationary target of protons, called photoproduction.  The reason to look for particles with the strange quark is that the properties of particles with heavy quarks are easier to calculate than are particles with only light quarks.  Even though strange particles are not abundant in nature, they help us understand the theoretical calculations of QCD, which also apply to stable particles and the nuclei of all atoms.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research is to advance technology and to train young scientists.  Advances in technology come from building new particle detectors, such as the Pre-shower Calorimeter which is part of the CLAS12 detector being constructed at Jefferson Lab.  This detector measures the energy of charged particles that strike it.  New materials, such as wavelength-shifting optical fibers, along with  high-speed electronics are part of the technology used for this detector, which is funded in part by the NSF.  Young scientists, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels, are helping to construct and test the detector.  Past graduates of this program have gone on to work at other laboratories, universities and private industry, both in the USA and abroad.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is for research in particle physics and in particular to investigate the substructure of particles, such as the proton or neutron, in terms of more fundamental constituents, quarks and gluons.  The theory of how quarks and gluons go together to form particles is called quantum chromodynamics (or QCD), and experimental tests of the predictions of this theory are the basis of the current project. Only recently have computers become sufficiently powerful to make firm predictions directly from QCD, and one of the interesting results is that it predicts many short-lived particles, which should be seen in experiments but have not yet been experimentally detected.  New data from the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Laboratory, located near the East coast in Virginia, are used in the current project to search for new particles (called mesons and baryons) that have not been seen in previous experiments, or in some cases have only been poorly measured.   \n\nIn particular, one type of baryon (called the Sigma* resonance) has been produced in large numbers at the particle detector called CLAS at Jefferson Lab. This baryon can decay to a lower-mass baryon (called the Sigma particle) through the emission of a high-energy photon, a process that is calculable using QCD and the well-known electromagnetic force.  This particle decay has been poorly measured in the past, and the research supported by this NSF grant made it possible to measure this decay with an accuracy of about 10%.  The results support the idea that there is symmetry between d-quarks and s-quarks that is the same for all electromagnetic decays, called U-spin symmetry (a symmetry similar to isospin, or I-spin, which is useful to describe the strong nuclear force).  The bottom line is that these results support the predictions of QCD and electromagnetic theory, providing more evidence that this is the correct theory of particles made from quarks and gluons.\n\nAdditional investigations into production of mesons that include s-quarks have been carried out as part of this research project using new data from Jefferson Lab.  The results of these experiments cannot, for technical reasons, be directly compared with predictions from QCD, but the measurements can be compared with a theoretical model which is inspired by the QCD idea that quarks, when struck by high-energy electrons, can propagate freely in the nucleus for a short time, then recombine with anti-quarks to become mesons (a particle which can also be measured in the CLAS detector).  These results support earlier data from an experiment in Germany.  Both data sets agree with the theoretical model based on ideas from QCD.\n\nSeveral students received their PhD based on this research.  These students have gone on to more advanced careers in particle physics.  The support of the NSF is gratefully acknowledged for this project, which helps to train a high-technology workforce.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/19/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth H Hicks"
