 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vehicular sensing applications, such as the popular StreetView service by Google, offer tremendous opportunities for cost effectively monitoring urban and suburban environments. With participatory sensing, where individuals are able to contribute their own data, this potential grows even further, possibly to a point where StreetView type imagery could be recorded and distributed in near real-time, as opposed to collected once every few years.\r\n\r\nHowever, the aggregate bandwidth requirements of such an application by far surpass even the fastest cellular data services still on the drawing board. This project investigates alternative strategies for dealing with this coming data deluge, including in-network storage, distributed query processing, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication using extremely high-speed local wireless links. \r\n\r\nThe anticipated results of the project include:\r\n\r\n- network and link layer mechanisms for efficient, GPS-assisted, vehicle to vehicle communication and in-network storage,\r\n\r\n- experimental demonstration and evaluation of said mechanisms in urban environments, and\r\n\r\n- analysis and simulation of the storage and communication capacity of mobile vehicular sensor networks,\r\n\r\n- open-source releases of software artifacts produced.",
