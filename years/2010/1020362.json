 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will develop and study the impact of science simulations, referred to as sims, on middle school childrens' understanding of science and the scientific process. The project will investigate: 1) how characteristics of simulation design (e.g., interface design, visual representations, dynamic feedback, and the implicit scaffolding within the simulation) influence engagement and learning and how responses to these design features vary across grade-level and diverse populations; 2) how various models of instructional integration of a simulation affect how students interact with the simulation, what they learn, and their preparation for future learning; 3) how these interactions vary across grade-level and diverse populations; and 4) what critical instructional features, particularly in the type and level of scaffolding, are needed. \r\n\r\nWorking with teachers, the team will select 25 existing sims for study.  Teachers and students will be interviewed to test for usability, engagement, interpretation, and learning across content areas. The goal will be to identify successful design alternatives and to formulate generalized design guidelines.  In parallel, pull-out and classroom-based studies will investigate a variety of use models and their impact on learning. Ten new simulations will then be developed to test these guidelines. \r\n\r\nProducts will include the 35 sims with related support materials available for free from a website; new technologies to collect real-time data on student use of sims; and guidelines for the development of sims for this age population. The team will also publish research on how students learn from sims.",

The most common ways simulations are used in science instruction are as a teaching demonstration or a set of highly-structured, guided activities.  Basically, students are told the concepts and then they observe or practice.  However, our research has shown that helping students to observe and induce patterns over multiple sets of data is the most beneficial way for them to learn and transfer their understanding to new situations.  We believe this is very consistent to the kind of inductive efforts that scientists use much more often than pure hypothetico-deductive reasoning.\n\n        During this grant, we have examined a variety of ways to support student inquiry with sims.  Our research has found that:\n1. Children (and even engineering undergraduates) tend to treat a series of related problems individually.  Rather than seeking a general explanation for phenomena, they will tend to create a separate (ad hoc) explanation for each instance.  This yields shallow understanding and poor transfer to new problems.  However, asking students to come up with a general explanation that handles all the c..."
