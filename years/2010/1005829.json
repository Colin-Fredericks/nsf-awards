Weinstein\r\n\r\nThis grant supports travel to Brazil for US participants\r\n(primarily graduate students and postdocs) at the conference\r\n\"Poisson 2010,\" to be held in IMPA in Rio de Janeiro, July 26-30,\r\npreceded by a preparatory school of three days in length.  With\r\nroots in classical mechanics about 200 years ago and work of\r\nSophus Lie about a century ago, the subject of Poisson geometry\r\ncrystallized through work of Lichnerowicz and Kirillov in the\r\n1970's.  Its influence now extends to a wide variety of areas,\r\nincluding symplectic geometry and topology, deformation theory,\r\nrepresentation theory, algebraic geometry, integrable hamiltonian\r\nsystems, and field theory.  In recent years, Poisson geometry has\r\nfound new applications in string topology, the geometric\r\nLanglands program, and the geometry of complex surfaces.\r\nDevelopments in these and other timely subjets will be addressed\r\nin the school and conference.\r\n\r\nThe meeting, whose full title is \"Poisson Geometry in Mathematics\r\nand Physics,\" is the seventh in a biannual series which brings\r\ntogether mathematicians and mathematical physicists with common\r\ninterests in Poisson geometry and its applications.  This\r\ngeometry provides a very important bridge between mathematics and\r\nphysics and between classical and quantum physics.  Speakers at\r\nthe school and conference have been chosen not only for the\r\nimportance of their results but also for their ability to\r\ncommunicate them to a broad audience of mathematicians and\r\nphysicists.  Proceedings will be published in a manner which\r\nmakes them accessible at low (or no) cost to a wide readership,\r\nin order to stimulate further study and research in the rapidly\r\ngrowing area of Poisson geometry.  Detailed information about the\r\nconference, and about others in the biannual series, may be found\r\nat poissongeometry.org.",
