 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are numerous mathematical challenges surrounding the theory and practice of medical imaging. Images obtained with the various imaging modalities typically suffer from imperfections such as low resolution, low contrast, high noise level, modality-specific artifacts and geometric deformations. Furthermore, given the vast amount of data collected in these images, automated tools are needed that aid in analyzing the data.\r\n\r\nThese challenges are ripe for mathematical exploration. The PIs will spend the academic year 2010/11 at the Dartmouth Medical School and the  Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center immersed in the study and application of medical imaging under the guidance of Dr.John B. Weaver. In addition to Professor Weaver, there is an active and accomplished cohort of faculty with imaging expertise both at the Thayer School of Engineering  at Dartmouth and  in  the Radiology Department at the Medical School with whom the PIs will interact.   The PIs will focus mostly on the segmentation problem and the registration problem as applied to digital tomosynthesis, although they intend to gain knowledge in all areas of medical image analysis during their immersion year. The PIs plan to use this experience to open and sustain a new avenue of research in their research profiles.\r\n\r\nThe PIs will use this experience to broaden the curricular offerings available to Wesleyan students in future years.   They will offer a suite of classes at the advanced undergraduate/graduate level in areas such as the mathematics of imaging, data analysis, and medical imaging. They expect that this activity will lead to a significant evolution of course offerings in their department. With  ongoing research in medical imaging we would also hope to be able to attract some graduate students into this important field.",
