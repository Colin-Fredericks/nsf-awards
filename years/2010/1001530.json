 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, plant scientists who have focused their research on DNA repair and recombination, together with individuals with previous training and experience in repair and recombination who have begun to employ plant models, have created a dynamic and productive new discipline. The literature now includes over 1,000 papers. Research by the more than 80 laboratories in this field continues to expand our understanding of how plants deal with environmental and endogenous threats to their growth, development, and genomic stability, and to advance dramatically the long-standing goals of in planta homologous gene targeting and site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, the viability of many Arabidopsis mutants that lack critical and highly conserved DNA-repair and DNA-damage-response proteins (deficiencies which are lethal in mammals) have been exploited to obtain insights, of broad biological applicability, into general mechanisms of repair and damage-response pathways. Nevertheless, international conferences dealing with DNA repair and recombination continue to focus on bacterial, yeast and animal model systems, and although large plant meetings or congresses sometimes include a DNA repair and recombin\u00acation session, these fail to draw a critical mass of scientists from around the world. \r\nThis meeting will bring together an international group of senior and junior investigators, postdoctorals, and graduate students working in or interested in this area.  They will be exposed to cutting-edge science - both basic and applied - via talks from both established investigators and more junior scientists. Enrollment in the meeting by well-established investigators in the field is already excellent, and includes labs from the US, Canada, Europe, Israel, Japan, and Australia. By providing this critical mass of talented scientists with a broad range of interests in this field, we hope to promote lively and wide-ranging discussions that include all attendees, both in formal question periods and in more informal settings.  The high quality of the participants, combined with the intimate scale of the meeting, ensures that all interactions will be productive ones, and that major scientists will be accessible to emerging investigators. The focus of this proposal- which specifically funds registration and lodging for undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and Assistant Professors- is to promote and facilitate participation in this field by young US scientists, especially by those from traditionally underrepresented groups.",

The awards were designed to encourage participation by women and minorities, and to facilitate participation by awardees that might not otherwise have had the resources to attend (undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral investigators, and investigators at the Assistant Professor or equivalent rank).  The enrollment of these 13 additional participants helped to support the meeting as a whole, both intellectually and financially.\n\nThis international meeting, which takes place every 2 or 3 years, provides the sole venue for the exclusive discussion of topics related to the maintenance of the plant genome.  These include:\n\na) How plants protect their DNA from the mutagenic effects of environmentally-induced damage (due to UV light, chemical toxins, or oxygen radicals induced by environmental stress).\n\nb) How plant chromosomes recombine, during repair, during meiosis (to generate new varieties of crops) and during the genetic engineering process.\n\nc) How plants adjust the cell cycle and their pattern of development in order to promote growth in spite of the persistence of DNA damage.\n\nd) Methodologies for both general mutagenesis and precision engineering of plant DNA.\n\nAlthough NSF\u00c6s support was limited to researchers from the US or working in US labs, attendance at the meeting was international; 41 out of 100 participants was from the US, while the others were from Europe, Japan, and Israel.  While the majority of participants were from academia, 10% of attendees were from industry.
