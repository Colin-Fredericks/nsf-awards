 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enhancing Access to the Radio Spectrum (EARS) is a multi-disciplinary activity whose goal is to improve the efficiency with which the radio spectrum is utilized and to improve access to the radio spectrum in support of current and new technologies. Achieving these goals will, among other impacts, improve the availability of wireless broadband to Americans presently without broadband access, as called for in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Because the radio spectrum is a valuable but finite natural resource, improvements in spectrum efficiency will have significant economic impact to the nation and the world. This award funds the first step, which is an invitational workshop that will bring together some of the key researchers and policy makers involved in radio spectrum access. All relevant fields will be represented, including science, engineering, economics, and policy. The output of the workshop will include a vision for the future of radio spectrum access and use, and a prioritized list of research areas that can help achieve that vision.",
