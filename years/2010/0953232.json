 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project focuses on fundamental physics research at the interface of quantum field theory, general relativity and string theory. A main theme in this study is supersymmetry. Supersymmetry is one of the best motivated candidates for physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, and it has many important applications. The PI plans to use supersymmetry and other techniques to address open problems in three main directions of research:  (1) exploring quantum gravity with black holes and the gauge-gravity correspondence;  (2) investigating scattering amplitudes in gauge theory and gravity;  and (3) studying models of supersymmetry breaking and their phenomenological consequences.  The work is relevant because it addresses fundamental questions in physics and because understanding supersymmetry breaking could be central for the discovery of new elementary particles in collider experiments.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact component of the project involves the training of students, a women-in-physics program, and public lectures. An exchange program between the University of Michigan and the women's college Bryn Mawr will be initiated to encourage the involvement of women in physics research. It will involve research seminars at both institutions and possible new collaborations. The public lectures will be pedagogical lectures on the PI's research and they will be presented as part of the Saturday Morning Physics series hosted by the Department of Physics at the University of Michigan.",
