Imaging techniques typically require the use of contrast agents, which are used to improve the visibility of internal body structures. MRI contrast agents work by altering the relaxation time of protons in the nearby tissues and organs, thereby improving tissue discrimination. While these agents provide useful information to physicians, they can also be toxic to the patients.  \n\n \n\nStarting in 2000, a new pathology, known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, began emerging in medical literature.

Further research is necessary to understand the effects of adding gadolinium to PVA, especially to determine if PVA can mask the toxic affects of gadolinium while simultaneously act as a good MRI contrast agent.\n\n \n\nMerits of Collaboration in Research\n\nResearch in Taiwan was an interesting and exciting experience. One of the initial barriers was language. Though I am familiar with everyday Chinese phrases, I was very unfamiliar with technical terms used within the research environment. I was very glad to quickly discover that my labmates and advisor were so carin..."
