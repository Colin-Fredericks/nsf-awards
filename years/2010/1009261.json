It will attempt to answer basic questions about the jets and their central engines, by exploiting the information in the linear and circular polarization of the radio emission.  The observations will yield other fundamental information such as the mix of positrons and protons in the jet, and the jet's kinetic luminosity.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and working with local teachers and students in using the campus 24\" telescope.",
