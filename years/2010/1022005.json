 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-distance migrations of sea turtles involve some of the most extraordinary feats of navigation in the animal kingdom.  Newly hatched turtles follow complex migratory pathways that span entire ocean basins.  Older turtles regularly travel between feeding areas and nesting sites that can be more than a thousand miles apart.  This study uses behavioral experiments to investigate the mystery of how sea turtles guide themselves across vast expanses of seemingly featureless ocean.\r\n\r\nGrowing evidence indicates that a sea turtle's navigational prowess depends in part on a sophisticated ability to perceive the Earth's magnetic field.  Turtles are evidently able to detect the very slight differences in the Earth's magnetic field that exist in different geographic areas.  One set of experiments investigates how young turtles use these differences as navigational markers during their first migration.  Another set of experiments focuses on how older turtles learn the magnetic topography of the areas where they live and develop 'magnetic maps', which help them to navigate to specific destinations.    \r\nAn improved understanding of how sea turtles guide themselves during transoceanic migrations will benefit conservation efforts to save these jeopardized species - and other ocean migrants - from extinction.  In addition, the results of the work may provide insights into new guidance strategies that can be adapted to human navigation.  Finally, the work attracts the interest of many undergraduate and graduate students and thus provides an excellent mechanism for teaching principles of scientific research, as well as giving students direct, hands-on experience with species of special concern.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n      The ability of animals to guide themselves unerringly during long-distance migrations has inspired both awe and envy in humans, a species that has only recently, through global positioning technology, achieved a measure of parity with the skills of elite animal navigators.  Nowhere are the navigational abilities of animals more stunning than in the marine environment, where various species routinely traverse vast expanses of seemingly featureless sea.  This NSF-funded research focused on loggerhead sea turtles, one of nature\u00c6s most extraordinary long-distance navigators, and investigated how the turtles use Earth\u00c6s magnetic field to guide themselves along a migratory route that begins on the east coast of Florida, encircles the Sargasso Sea, and eventually leads back to the North American coast.\n\n       During their migration, young loggerhead turtles exploit Earth\u00c6s magnetic field as both a compass and a map.  Newly hatched turtles enter the sea with a \"magnetic map\" in which regional magnetic fields unique to different oceanic locations elicit changes in swimming direction.  Fields from at least eight widely separated locations along the migratory pathway elicit orientation responses.  Thus, it appears that when turtles encounter particular magnetic fields associated with specific oceanic regions, they alter their swimming direction to stay on the migratory route.\n\n     During navigation, turtles and other long-distance migrants can use magnetic cues as a surrogate for latitude.  Until recently it was not known how any animal perceives longitude.  To investigate whether turtles can extract longitudinal information from the geomagnetic field, hatchling loggerhead turtles were subjected to magnetic fields that exist at two locations with the same latitude, but on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean.  Turtles responded to the two fields by swimming in different directions that would, in each case, help them advance along their circular migratory route.  The results demonstrated for the first time that longitude can be encoded in the magnetic positioning system of a migratory animal.  Because turtles also assess north-south position magnetically, the findings imply that loggerhead turtles have a navigational system that exploits Earth's magnetic field as a kind of bicoordinate magnetic map from which both longitudinal and latitudinal information can be extracted.\n\n     It has long been assumed that young turtles swim too weakly to overcome the influence of ocean currents, but the response of turtles to regional magnetic fields suggests otherwise.  To investigate how swimming behavior might affect migratory trajectories at sea, a high-resolution ocean circulation model was used to simulate movements of young turtles under several different scenarios, including one in which virtual turtles drifted passively, and another in which they displayed brief periods of oriented swimming similar to the responses of actual turtles to regional magnetic fields in the laboratory.  Results indicated that even small amounts of oriented swimming at a few locations can profoundly affect migratory routes and endpoints.  Virtual turtles that engaged in directed swimming for a few hours per day were more likely than passive drifters to reach productive foraging grounds.  They were also more likely to remain within warm-water currents favorable for growth and avoid areas on the perimeter of the migratory route where predation risk and thermal conditions pose threats.  These findings imply that marine animals traditionally viewed as ineffective swimmers may, contrary to expectations, be able to exert strong effects on their migratory trajectories and open-sea distributions through simple navigation responses and minimal swimming.\n\n     When sea turtles are fully grown, adults navigate back to their area of origin to reproduce.  How this natal homing is accomplished has remained an enduring mystery of animal navigation.  One hypothesis is that tu..."
