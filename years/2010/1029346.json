 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanoelectromechanical uncooled infrared sensor using epitaxial graphene\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a highly sensitive uncooled Infrared (IR) sensor using polymer/epitaxial few layer graphene (FLG) composite film as a novel sensing element,  utilizing the extraordinary material properties of epitaxial FLG films on SiC. The approach is based on: (i) Designing polymer/FLG sensor through modeling and finite element simulations, (ii) Growing FLG films on doped 6H-SiC substrate, (iii) Fabrication and characterization of the polymer/FLG sensor layer, and (iv) Evaluation of the sensor for IR detection. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Success of the proposed research will lead to the development of a novel uncooled and inexpensive IR sensor that can far exceed the state-of-the-art performance of uncooled IR sensors, and rival those utilizing cryogenic cooling. The sensor would offer very high sensitivity along with very short response time, addressing the critical limitations of other uncooled IR sensors that suffer from high noise floor, high thermal time constant, and dependence on optical transduction. The highly sensitive deflection transduction method utilizing substrate gating, can also foster the development of next generation nanoelectromechanical devices based on suspended graphene. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project is expected to have broad technological impacts in the areas of defense, homeland security, astronomy, law enforcement, and environmental monitoring. For educational and outreach activities, the PIs would involve one undergraduate and one high school student every year in their research, ensuring one minority student participation. The PIs would also develop a graduate course, and disseminate research results through conference participation, and utilizing individual research group, and departmental websites.",
