 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve competency in students? use of programming and computational tools in engineering.  Hardware is being introduced into the mix of educational tools as a means to bridge the gap between syntax and programming strategies.  Based on three learning principles deemed critical for programming skills (student engagement, knowledge transfer, and self-directed learning), a set of programming toolkits and experiences is being vertically integrated through the curriculum and implemented at multiple universities.  The project provides an innovative solution to the classic difficulty associated with learning to program; the contrasting demands between knowledge of programming language (syntax) versus programming strategies (problem solving with programs).  The project involves diverse partnerships among four-year universities and community colleges to enable broad impacts for engineering students.",

The fundamental idea of the project is refine, transfer to other institutions, and assess a model that uses a microcontroller programming target as the base programming experience for engineering students.  It is proposed that this use of microcontroller hardware can provide a much better contextual environment for learning programming in engineering for students early in their engineering studies, and is a more universal platform for understanding the programming applications in engineering for all students. \n\nThis project was initiated in the college of engineering at Tennessee Tech (TTU) and is being implemented at four diverse Institutions:  Tennessee Tech, representing a mid-size technical school with large undergraduate engineering student enrollment, the University of Kentucky representing a large research institution, Alabama A&amp;M an institution serving large numbers of students traditionally under-represented in engineering, and Roane State Community College, a two year institution with a large percentage of students transferring to four year institutions to complete engineering degrees. \n\nThe primary objectives of this project were: 1) increased student engagement in the freshman year programming course, 2) enable students to demonstrate transfer of programming skills to subsequent courses, 3) increase student ownership of the learning process in programming and  4) show the model can be readily implemented by instructors at other institutions\n\nDuring the course of the project, the curriculum and tools (hardware and software) were designed, developed and assembled to implement the initial hands-on programming experience introductory programming classes across the partner institutions.  The project assessment and evaluation outcomes demonstrated that these introductory hands-on programming experiences enhanced student learning through student engagement and laid the groundwork for knowledge transfer to subsequent engineering courses.  The curricular linkages (specific hands-on programming activities developed and introduced through the curriculum) were shown to reinforce programming through new contextual implementations of programming (supporting major goal 2) while the later curricular linkages, particularly those falling in capstone design or technical electives support students taking ownership of the learning in programming (major goal 3).\n\nThe program has become institutionalized across the team universities, for example is now part of the required curriculum for Electrical and Computer Engineering Students at Tennessee Tech. \n\nMembers of the Hands-on programming project team participated in the pilot program of the I Corps &ndash;L (learning) program initiated by NSF.  The team was part of the Washington DC cohort.  The team entered the program with a plan to expand the project dissemination through a traditional channel of bundling the project materials and providing these through a sales mechanism to STEM faculty.  During the course of the project, the team gained direct experience about the potential impact of the project and how the project outcomes can be extended to best impact student learning.  One of the many findings was that that this project provides a bridge to link the out of class-room activities of students (often called tinkering, making or hacking) to the in-class learning of engineering principles, primarily associated with programming to solve engineering problems.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen Canfield"
