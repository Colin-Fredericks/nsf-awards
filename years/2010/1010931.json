The ecological implications of simultaneous eutrophication and overfishing\r\n\r\nOverfishing and human-derived nutrient pollution are among the most pressing issues facing coastal environments globally.  Both these stressors affect the supply of growth-limiting nutrients (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) for algae and seagrasses, the base of most marine ecosystems.  Human inputs increase the supply of nutrients, which are largely sewage-derived, while overfishing has been shown to reduce nutrient supply because fish provide substantial inputs of nutrients via excretion.  These contrasting inputs present the paradox that human-derived nutrients may supplant fish-derived nutrients.  However, human-derived nutrients are high in P relative to fish-derived nutrients, which may be altering the baseline at which nutrients are supplied and in turn changing the diversity and growth rates of algae and seagrass species.  Overfishing and nutrient enrichment will be simulated independently and simultaneously on experimental patch-reef ecosystems in the Bahamas.  The implications for changes in diversity, growth and nutrient limitation of algae and seagrass species will be determined .  The experimental reef system will be used as a field trip site and experimental results will be used in outreach efforts to local high school students. \r\nSubtropical and tropical marine ecosystems have evolved to function under extremely low nutrient conditions, making them particularly susceptible to even minor alterations in nutrient dynamics. The enormous services provided by these ecosystems appear to critically hinge on the amount and relative supply of N and P, yet understanding of the effects of simultaneous overfishing and eutrophication for these services is lacking, particularly in the Caribbean. Increased understanding of nutrient effects is critical to the management and conservation of marine ecosystems globally.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nShifting Baselines?  The ecological implications of simultaneous eutrophication and overfishing\n\nThe health of marine ecosystems depends on clean, unpolluted water with low amounts of available nutrients.  Historically, the plants and corals in these systems receive most of their nutrients from the regeneration of nutrients through excretion from animals.  Two essential nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), are particularly important for the growth of marine organisms, from seagrass to fish.  However, there is a delicate balance at which these nutrients need to be maintained, such that too much of one or the other can cause excess growth of plants and algae.  In addition, the proper relative supply of N and P  (the N:P ratio) is important to the growth needs of marine organisms.   Current issues that plague the health of marine ecosystems are 1) overfishing, which reduces the animal-generated nutrients that are essential to marine health and 2) eutrophication, in which coastal run-off of excess nutrients from human activities threatens marine health.  Confounding these problems, fish-generated nutrients and eutrophication differ in their N:P ratio.  Our experiments simulated overfishing and eutrophication to test the effects of different nutrient supplies and ratios on the growth of seagrasses and algae.\n\nWe constructed 16 artificial reefs using cinder blocks in a small embayment on Abaco Island, The Bahamas.  We simulated overfishing by filling in the holes of the blocks to reduce the potential habitat for fishes on eight of the reefs.  We then simulated eutrophication, by staking PVC pipes filled with chemical fertilizer around four reefs that were simulating overfishing and four that were not.  In doing so, we effectively simulated overfishing and eutrophication independently as well as simultaneously (our \u00e6fish x nutrient\u00c6 study).  This design allows us to specifically tease out the effect of all combinations of overfishing and eutrophication on seagrass and algae growth around the reefs.  Nutrient fertilizer was replaced every three months to ensure that a consistent amount of nutrients was being added to the reefs.  Fish surveys were conducted during each nutrient replacement event.  We additionally used a concurrent artificial reef experiment (a \u00e6fish only\u00c6 study) that included 20 reefs of varying sizes to couple efforts toward the end goal of understanding the role of fish nutrient supply for seagrass and algal growth.\n\nFindings from the fish only study demonstrated strong effects of fish-generated nutrient supply.  Specifically, seagrass growth, which promotes overall productivity of marine ecosystems, was enhanced by nearly 4 times and benthic algae growth by nearly 2.5 times with increased supply of fish-generated nutrients.  We found that there was a remarkable threshold at distances roughly two meters from the reefs at which seagrass growth was no longer affected by fish-generated nutrient supply.  Findings from the fish x nutrient study are not fully compiled due to the extension of the duration of study, but visual estimates suggest strongly divergent responses between treatments.  Specifically, in any simulation in which human nutrients are present, seagrasses tend to have much more algal growth on their blades, i.e., epiphytic algae, and in any treatment that has high nutrients, either from fish or human input, has relatively more dense seagrass.  In addition, evidence based on visual surveys suggests that fish feeding in seagrass beds keeps excess algae from accumulating which potentially provides more optimal conditions for seagrass growth and development.\n\nUnderstanding the relative effects of various nutrient sources has important implications for the management and conservation of coastal marine ecosystems globally. Data from our study suggests that healthy fish communities, in addition to providing important nutrients via their waste, may also be critical in maintaining seagrass productivity due t..."
