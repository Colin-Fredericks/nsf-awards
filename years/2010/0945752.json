 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to address electronics packaging constraints, the limiting element in system cost and performance for further advancements in commercial and defense electronics.  Traditional packaging approaches to address the needs in these markets, including FR4, liquid crystal polymers, and Low Temperature Co-Fired Ceramics, are running into fundamental material limits.  Market needs are pushing for smaller package volumes, higher density interconnects, in-package thermal management and ultimately optical waveguide capability.  This proposal will investigate the feasibility of using an innovative glass ceramic material as a packaging solution for these electronics applications.  This material is processed using first generation semiconductor equipment in a simple three- step process and the product can be formed into glass, ceramic, or regions of both glass and ceramic.  This Phase I study will focus on three tasks.  First, demonstrate the material can be used for high-pressure microfluidics (1500 psi) for enhanced thermal management.  Second, the glass ceramic will be fabricated to demonstrate 10\u00b5m, 50\u00b5m, 100\u00b5m high density copper interconnects at various pitches. Third, investigate the material's ability to be used as a waveguide medium by determining the maximum angle and minimum arc-length to produce an optical waveguide.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to target the technical limitations and cost constraints associated with state-of-the-art electronics packaging.  These constraints have garnered new recognition and importance to manufacturers.   Over the last decade, packaging was considered a second-order issue after integrated circuit development, but increasing costs and substrate material limitations have brought it to the forefront. This proposal will directly address these cost and material constraints. The current market for traditional electronics packaging exceeds $6B a year, but is facing not only performance, but environmental challenges.  The European Union, as part of their Reduction of Hazardous Substances directive, has highlighted the risks of halogen containing material, such as FR4 that is used in electronics packaging. This glass ceramic material contains zero halogenic elements and can be recycled.  While the primary market potential is significant, there are intriguing secondary markets for this material in optoelectronics, MEMS, medical, nanotechnology, and biological applications.",
