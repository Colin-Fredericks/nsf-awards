 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston) received funds from the Major Research Instrumentation Program to support acquisition of an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IR-MS) to support ecological, biogeochemical, and geochemical research.  The instrument is incorporated into the UMass Boston Environmental Analysis Laboratory (EAL) enabling broad transdisciplinary research such as (1) isotopic analysis of water, dissolved organic carbon, and carbonate materials, (2) measurement of  delta 13-C in dissolved organic carbon and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), (3) isotopic analysis of individual compounds (e.g. fatty acids and polyaromatic hydrocarbons), and (4) isotopic measurements in tissues, whole rocks and organic macerals from rocks.  Results from the research enabled by the new equipment will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings.  UMass Boston is the only public university in the greater Boston area and is the most diverse public 4-year institution in New England. The instrumentation significantly enhances research and training of underrepresented minority students through integration into environmental courses throughout the College of Sciences and Mathematics at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  In addition a significant number of our students gain additional depth in experience and expertise through independent research projects, and presentation of their findings at scientific meetings.",
