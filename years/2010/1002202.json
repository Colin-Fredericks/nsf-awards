 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nThis project will develop a new class of interband cascade lasers based on plasmon-waveguides.  The plasmon-waveguide lasers will be much less demanding in the growth of device structures and have significantly enhanced thermal dissipation compared to current interband cascade lasers that use superlattices as cladding layers.  This will result in efficient cw operation at a wide range of wavelengths and at higher temperatures.  The success of this research project will, not only realize efficient, plasmon-waveguide interband cascade lasers with low power consumption, it will advance the understanding of how plasmon-waveguides can significantly improve the device performance of interband diode lasers.  Efficient, plasmon-waveguide interband cascade lasers will greatly enhance the capabilities of mid-infrared laser instruments, which will benefit many useful applications, especially where mid-infrared systems must be operated with batteries and energy cost/availability is a concern.  \r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis project will generate new cutting-edge knowledge toward improved design and understanding of quantum semiconductor structures and devices.  The realization of energy-efficient plasmon-waveguide interband cascade lasers in the mid-infrared wavelength region will have significant impact on biomedical, industrial, earth science, space exploration, defense and homeland security applications.  This project will offer graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Oklahoma unique opportunities to pursue education, training and research in multidisciplinary topics (materials science, quantum engineering, photonics, and device fabrication).  This project will also enhance Oklahoma?s infrastructure for science and technology development and increase the opportunities of students from under-represented regions in science and engineering.  The lasers produced in this project will be eye-safe and used in education (even research) projects by selected K-12 schools. This project will promote the participation of faculty and students in statewide educational outreach activities.",
