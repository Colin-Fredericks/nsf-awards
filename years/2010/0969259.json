 "awd_abstract_narration": "An observation of neutrinoless double beta decay would have profound implications for fundamental nuclear and particle physics. It would confirm that neutrino mass is truly a non-standard model phenomenon, open a window on grand unification physics, and constrain the absolute scale of the neutrino mass spectrum. Conversely, if neutrinoless double beta decay can be shown not to occur in nature, lepton-number conservation would be promoted from an accidental symmetry to an exact symmetry, sterile neutrinos would be proven to exist, and we would rule out a wide variety of new physics models. \r\n\r\nThe EXO (Enriched Xenon Observatory) collaboration has completed the construction and underground installation of the world's largest double beta decay experiment, the EXO-200 detector. This experiment is the first to be mounted at the 100 kg scale, and it represents one of our best opportunities to observe neutrinoless double beta decay in the quasi-degenerate mass region in the next two to three years. This award will provide support to continue the University of Maryland's involvement in EXO-200. \r\n\r\nThis support has additional broader impacts outside the field of neutrino physics, primarily by training young researchers in the methods of experimental science, and by demonstrating experimental techniques and technologies which have applications in other areas of pure and applied science.",

EXO-200 is a collaboration of scientists from the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia which is dedicated to studying the properties of the neutrino, one of nature's fundamental particles. The neutrino is electrically neutral but it interacts via the weak nuclar force. It is possible that neutrinos carry a new type of charge unrelated to the electrical force which we call 'lepton number'. For many years it was thought that neutrinos are massless, however in the last 15 years it has become clear that they do, in fact, have a very small mass. The purpose of the EXO-200 experiment is to shed light on the mass and charge properties of the neutrino. It is one of many such experiments in the world, and currently it is the world's most sensitive experiment of its type. EXO-200 has determined that if neutrinos do not carry lepton number, then the absolute mass of the neutrino must be less than about 200 meV. This result was published in Physical Review Letters in 2012. EXO-200 continues to collect and analyze data, and additional results from the experiment are expected to be reported in the coming years. This award provided support for three graduate students and one faculty member to participate in EXO-200, including stipends and funds to travel to the experimental site near Carlsbad NM.
