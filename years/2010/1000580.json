 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this study is to develop an inexpensive, ecologically sound, high-performance, cementlike construction material ?geopolymeric hybrid composite through nanoengineering the fly ash particles. This new material consists of fly ash based geopolymer matrix and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). To avoid the difficulty of dispersing CNTs, CNTs will be directly grown on the surfaces of fly ash using a novel microwave irradiation method. The cost of CNTs produced by this method is estimated much lower than any other existing methods. A comprehensive testing plan using advanced analytical instruments will be carried out to exam the interaction between nanotubes and the geopolymeric matrix, the reaction kinetics, and the multi-functionality of the new material. This research will be conducted through the close collaboration between two major research universities in Alabama, the University of Alabama and Auburn University.  Auburn University will focus on the development of microwave irradiation method. The University of Alabama will manufacture and characterize the proposed new materials.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work, if succeeds, will generate significant social, economic and environmental benefits. This novel green material meets the requirements of sustainable construction materials with low carbon dioxide emission, long service-life and efficient energy consumption.  PIs also propose an aggressive educational plan designed to be complementary to the research activities with focus on recruiting a diverse group of traditionally underrepresented (female, minority and/or socio-economically disadvantaged) students to participate in the proposed activities in close collaboration with HBCUs in Alabama and ALEPSCoR. Results of the proposed research will be widely disseminated.",
