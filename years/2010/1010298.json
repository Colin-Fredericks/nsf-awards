 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores from various angles the deep and\r\nintricate connections between the topology and geometry\r\nof a space, the algebraic structure of its fundamental\r\ngroup, and the algebraic geometry of the associated\r\ncohomology jumping loci.  The study is done in a context\r\nwhich abstracts two of the crucial features that make\r\nthe dictionary between topology and algebra work so\r\nwell for complements of hyperplane arrangements:\r\nformality (which leads to the Tangent Cone Theorem,\r\nrelating the characteristic and resonance varieties), and\r\nquasi-projectivity (which insures that the characteristic\r\nvarieties consist of possibly translated subtori). Together,\r\nthese two properties put strong constraints on the geometry\r\nof the resonance varieties, leading to powerful obstructions\r\nto finitely presented groups being realizable as fundamental\r\ngroups of smooth, (quasi-) projective complex varieties.\r\nRecently, new connections have emerged, relating the cohomology\r\njumping loci of a space to the homological finiteness properties\r\nof its free abelian covers, and thereby to the structure of the\r\nDwyer-Fried and Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz invariants.\r\nGeneralizations of the classical jump loci---from rank one\r\nlocal systems to the non-abelian setting, and from cohomology\r\nrings to differential graded algebras---extend the scope of\r\nthe investigation, and broaden the range of its applicability.\r\n\r\nThe topological and group-theoretic methods utilized\r\nin this project shed new light on the combinatorial and\r\ngeometric structure of objects occurring in a variety\r\nof contexts, allowing for cross-pollination between\r\ndifferent fields, with ideas originating in a given area\r\nbeing fruitfully applied in new settings.  The theory of\r\ncohomology jumping loci impacts the study of a wide\r\narray of spaces and groups, including toric complexes\r\nand moment-angle complexes; right-angled Artin and\r\nCoxeter groups; real and complex quasi-toric manifolds;\r\nKaehler and quasi-Kaehler manifolds; Milnor fibrations\r\nof hyperplane arrangements; as well as configuration\r\nspaces and compactifications of moduli spaces.\r\nThe study of these objects, with their multiple\r\nconnections to the theory of singularities, graph\r\ntheory, and low-dimensional topology, provides a\r\nrich interplay between algebra, topology, and\r\ncombinatorics, yielding applications to areas\r\nranging from topological robotics to theoretical\r\ncomputer science. The investigation is being conducted\r\ntogether with several collaborators, as well as graduate\r\nand undergraduate students.  Participation in intensive\r\nresearch periods and workshops is meant to introduce a\r\nnew generation of students and young researchers to a\r\nvery active, interdisciplinary area of study.",
