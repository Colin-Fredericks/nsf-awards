Project topics include energy exchanges between\r\nrandom waves and vortices in the ocean, the role of wave-induced\r\nvortex structures for particle dispersal in the deep ocean, the\r\ndesign and dynamics of small-scale engineering devices to model\r\nthe acoustic mixing of immersed particles, and the peculiar fluid\r\ndynamics that attends the quantum-mechanical interactions between\r\nwaves and point vortices in rotating superfluids.  A common theme\r\nof these problems is that they involve huge separations of scale\r\nbetween different dynamical components of the flows.  Such\r\nseparations present mathematical difficulties and make\r\nstraightforward numerical simulations impractical. \r\n\r\n     The investigator takes up several problems that involve\r\nanalysis of the interactions between waves and vortices in fluid\r\nflows: ocean fluid dynamics relevant to climate dynamics,\r\nsmall-scale fluid engineering applied to acoustic mixing, and\r\nrotating superfluids in condensed matter physics.  The ocean is a\r\nvast environment in which a multitude of dynamical components\r\nsuch as waves and currents interact, and these interactions\r\neventually determine the present ocean state and also its future\r\ndevelopment.  Our ability to predict ocean dynamics hinges\r\ndelicately on our ability to understand and to model these\r\ninteractions, because a direct computer simulation far exceeds\r\nour computational resources and will do so for decades to come. \r\nThis is so because different dynamical components of the flows\r\noccur at vastly different scales of length or time.  The\r\ninvestigator mathematically and computationally studies the\r\ninteractions between waves and vortices, using modern\r\nmathematical theory to simplify and thereby to reduce the\r\ncomplexity of the interactions that must be modelled on a\r\ncomputer.  Similar scale-separated interactions among dynamical\r\ncomponents of flows are studied in other complex systems of\r\ntechnological relevance, such as non-invasive particle mixing\r\ntechniques using wave engineering, and the detailed study of\r\nsuperfluid behaviour that has recently become possible using\r\nbreakthroughs in laboratory technology.",

Similar interactions are in fact taking place in the atmosphere and ocean, and those interactions are well known to be significant for the long term dynamics of these systems.  However, in many cases of practical interest the waves that are involved in these interactions are too small in scale to be resolved by direct numerical simulations.  In other words, the effects due to these waves need to be put in \"by hand\" in such models, combining theory and empirical data to get the best results.  \n\nIt is in the theoretical study of such wave-vortex interactions that the present project made various contributions.  For example, one important practical question is whether unresolved small scale waves can contribute to mixing and stirring in the deep ocean, say more than a mile deep in the water column.  The ocean is dark and slow there, and very little is known by direct observation or simulation.  Our study showed for the first time how internal gravity waves, which owe their restoring mechanism to a combination of the Earth rotation and the stable density stratification of the ocean, can lead to the irreversible diffusion of particles in the horizontal at such depth.    \n\nOther results of our project  concern the peculiar fluid mechanical behaviour of both waves and vortices in superfluid helium and the potential for very fast internal waves in the atmosphere  to signal the formation and propgation of tsunamis at sea level by an observable oscillation in the ionosphere, which is at 100km altitude,  within an hour or so of the tsunami generation.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Oliver Buhler"
