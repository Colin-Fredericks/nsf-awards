 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past two decades, string theory has been one of the most intensely investigated areas of theoretical high-energy physics.  This is true chiefly because string theory offers what is currently the most successful method of unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces (strong, weak, and electromagnetic).  Results from string theory have also spilled over into many other branches of physics, leading to improved understanding of gauge theories, condensed-matter physics, and heavy-ion physics.  String theory has also led to powerful new insights in mathematics.  In this project, Professor Blanco-Pillado aims to apply string theory to cosmology.  Specifically, he proposes to study the cosmological implications of a certain class of string models (so-called ``flux compactifications''), paying particular attention to the effects of the complex structure moduli part of the four-dimensional potential.\r\n\r\nThis project will also have significant broader impacts.  Beyond the interdisciplinary reach of the proposed research --- connecting high-energy physics and cosmology through the paradigm of string theory --- this project will also involve the training of a graduate student to conduct research in this cutting-edge field of study.",

We studied some consequences of the case where the eternally-inflating vacuum in which our bubble universe nucleates has one fewer large spatial dimension -- it being compactified in that vacuum.  We found potentially-observable signatures in the spectrum of inflationary perturbations that lead to the observed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations.\n\n On the other hand, recent cosmological observations seem to indicate that the universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion in the early stages of cosmological evolution, the so-called inflationary period. There is, however, no consensus at the moment on the particular underlying fundamental theory that gives rise to the microphysics of inflation. It is therefore interesting to ask whether there is a way to embed inflation in String Theory. I am particularly interested in models..."
