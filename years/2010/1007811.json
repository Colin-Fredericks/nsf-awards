First, we can think of the\r\naction of the mapping class group on Teichmueller space as an analogue\r\nof the action of a lattice on a Lie group. This analogy is the\r\nmotivation of some of the proposed problems, namely the rigidity and\r\nthe counting problems.  The other theme is to understand the relation\r\nbetween different metrics on Teichmueller space. There are several\r\ndistinct metrics of interest on Teichmueller space and many questions\r\nare answered for one metric but not for another. We propose the study\r\nof the behavior of geodesics in the Lipschitz metric on Teichmueller\r\nspace, which has the feature that the Lipschitz metric can act as a\r\nbridge between the Teichmueller metric and the Lipschitz metric in\r\nOuter space, the model space for outer automorphisms of a free group.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical structures studied in this research program provide\r\ncoordinates that determine completely a family of two-dimensional\r\ngeometries.  The oldest questions and constructions in these directions\r\nare more than 150 years old but remain vital because of their central\r\nrole in mathematics and their use in analyzing shape-dependent features\r\nof physical systems, including brain anatomy identified in MRI images.\r\nOne of the newer lines of investigation compensates for the longstanding\r\ndifficulty of imposing a truly satisfactory geometry or metric on\r\nTeichmueller spaces by considering several geometries simultaneously,\r\naiming to take advantage of the good features of each.  This project\r\naims to pursue this investigation to improve fundamental mathematical\r\nunderstanding of these important spaces.",
