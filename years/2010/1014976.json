This project develops new fields of 3D quantitative microscopy in two important contrast modes that bridge a gap between clinical diagnosis and medical research. In addition, the technology of 3D image processing from quantitative CT imaging for disease diagnosis is being applied to microscopy in a unique collaboration.\r\n\r\nTextbooks of cell biology depict a cell as flat with two-dimensional features. If disease diagnosis is 3D and more quantitative and sensitive to disease onset, then these textbooks will likely change to more accurately represent the cell anatomy. Teaching students on cellular structures and functions may be significantly changed due to advancements of true 3D microscopy.  Providing cytologists and molecular biologists with quantification tools will result in earlier diagnosis of lethal diseases like lung cancer and improved understanding of the disease mechanisms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project was to advance an already existing prototype 3D optical microscope for high-magnification 3D imaging of cells and their nuclei for the purpose of detecting cancer earlier and with more accuracy than using conventional optical microscopy that does not image in 3D.  The name of the new 3D optical microscope and technique is Optical Projection Tomographic Microscopy which was invented at the University of Washington, Seattle. \n\nThere were two approaches for achieving these general project goals.  The first was to create a computer model of the 3D optical microscope, while imaging an example cell.  The purpose for this first step was to use the computer model to rapidly test improvements in the design and performance of the 3D optical microscope.  The second approach was to experimentally calibrate the photometric absorption of light passing through the cell while also imaging the DNA distribution in the nucleus and overall nuclear features such as volume.  The purpose for this second step was to quantify the amount of DNA that was contained in the cell and if there were abnormal DNA amounts, which is an indication of cancer.  Other features such as nuclear shape and size in 3D were determined from semi-automated algorithms developed in collaboration with Professor Anthony Reeves at Cornell University.  These more physical or dimensional features like nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio using volume measurements are also considered biomarkers of disease progression, such as cancer.  To test these new experimental procedures, small populations of cells grown from culture and cells with known DNA amounts were imaged in 3D, analyzed, and compared to flow cytometry, the gold standard for determining disease in large numbers of cells.  However, unlike flow cytometry, this new 3D optical microscope can make a cancer diagnosis from only one cell or a few cells, which is not possible using flow cytometry that is routinely used in clinical practice.\n\nThe computational (computer modeling) and experimental results were successful and both were published in journal and conference proceedings.  In addition to graduating multiple students with undergraduate and graduate research experience, the impact of such results are described below.\n\nThe computational modeling and experimental validation and feature  testing impacts the general field of optical engineering, imaging, and especially  optical microscopy when applied to making a clinical diagnosis of  disease, such as cancer.  The computational model was developed for 3D optical microscopy in transmission mode which is  used for creating images based on absorption (including fluorescence) and  scattering.  The impact from this project is a demonstration of the  power and utility that results from accurate modeling of the entire 3D  image formation process, which was used to improve the design of 3D  imaging microscope.  Once a computer model is validated, then making  changes to the computer model parameters is quite rapid and predictive  rather than making hardware and software changes to the  instrumentation.  Thus, computer modeling of 3D optical instrumentation  can more rapidly and more cost effectively guide biomedical instrument  development, and also be used to debug and explain new unanticipated  results observed experimentally by biologist and clinicians.\n\nThe  experimental impact of accurately measuring physical dimensions and  photometric parameters of the nucleus being investigated is the ability  to make more predictive decisions about the disease state of the cell.   For example the DNA index measures whether there is normal or abnormal amounts of DNA in a cell, which is a strong diagnostic biomarker for  cancer.  Another example is the more accurate and precise determination  of nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (N/C) which has only one true answer  from 3D images but has wide variability when only 2D images are acquired  and analyzed - which is the standard procedure today.  ..."
