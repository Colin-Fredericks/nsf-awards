 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and his graduate students will investigate problems in the geometry of Banach spaces and the geometry of metric spaces. The problems to be considered fall into several subcategories; namely, commutators of operators on a Banach space, non linear factorization of linear operators, non linear classification of Banach spaces, discrete metric geometry, approximation properties, and miscellaneous problems. Sample problems are: 1. If a Banach space has a Pelczynski decomposition and the space of bounded linear operators on the space has a unique maximal ideal, must every bounded linear operator that is not a commutator be the sum of a non zero scalar plus an operator in the maximal ideal? 2. Must a Lipschitz complemented subspace of a separable Banach space be linearly complemented? 3. Estimate the smallest dimension k such that every n point subset of the space of integrable functions embeds, with distortion at most D, into the k dimensional space normed by the sum of the absolute values of the coordinates.  (Here k will depend on both n, the number of points in the subset, and D, the allowable distortion).\r\n\r\nThe topics treated in this project make contact with many areas of analysis and areas outside of analysis, including operator theory, group theory, geometric analysis, and theoretical computer science. One of the graduate students is involved in developing the conceptual framework for understandings mappings of large scale, high dimensional data sets into the normed vector spaces that are widely used in science and engineering. This work and other aspects of the discrete metric geometry part of the project can be used in the design of algorithms. Moreover, positive results on dimension reduction will have applications in compressed sensing. The questions on the factorization of non linear operators are connected to recurring problems in geometric analysis, while the linear finite dimensional investigation belong as much to convex geometry as to analysis.  Aspects of the non linear classification problems may be as important for geometric group theory as for geometric functional analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Outcomes Report, NSF DMS-1001321\nThis project was devoted to understanding better the geometry of Banach spaces and metric spaces (which always can be considered as \"living in\" appropriately chosen Banach spaces).  These spaces form the universe in which virtually all mathematical approximation is conducted.  Formally, a Banach space is a vector space of either finite or infinite dimension upon which a norm is defined. The norm measures the size of vectors, and the distance between two vectors is simply the size of the difference of the vectors. There are many different norms on even the simplest non trivial vector space, the two dimensional plane, and the proper choice of norm depends upon the specifics of the theoretical or real world problem that is under consideration. \nBounded linear operators on Banach spaces arise naturally in many contexts within mathematics, engineering, and the physical sciences.  A bounded linear operator is a function T that assigns to an input x in some Banach space X an output vector Tx that lives in a (possibly different) Banach space Y.  \"Linear\" means that T preserves the linear structure; i.e., T(ax + by) = aTx + bTy for all vectors x, y in X and all scalars (i.e., numbers) a and b.  \"Bounded\" means that the length of Tx is controlled by some constant times the length of x.  When T and S are bounded linear operators that both map one fixed X back into itself, it is natural to consider the composition linear operator TS, defined by (TX)x= T(Sx).  An annoying phenomenon is that this operation does not commute; i.e., (TS)x does not necessarily equal (ST)x.  In fact, this non commutativity is at the heart of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  The commutator [T, S] = TS - ST describes the non commutativity of T and S: [T, S] = 0 if and only if T and S do commute.  A natural problem is to describe all operators L on X which are commutators; i.e., how do you tell that an operator L on a Banach space X can be written as L = [T, S] for some other operators T, S?  A major part of the project was devoted to solving this problem for certain important classical spaces X that are widely used.  \nIn work that is loosely related to the above, the PI and collaborators introduced quantitative notions into commutator theory when the Banach space is a Euclidean finite dimensional space.  \nA second major thrust of the the project was to understand the structure of Banach spaces that have very good approximation properties.  One wants to understand infinite dimensional spaces and operators on them via finite dimensional approximations.  In some spaces, most notably Hilbert spaces, good approximations are available. The PI and his collaborator solved a 30+ year old problem by showing that there are spaces other than Hilbert spaces that have good coordinate systems (technically, symmetric bases) such that the spaces and all of their subspaces have good approximation properties.  \nThe PI and one of his recent former students solved another old problem by classifying the spaces that embed into spaces that have another kind of good coordinatization (an unconditional basis).  This means that one can check whether a space X lives inside a larger space Y with an unconditional basis just by verifying whether X itself satisfies a certain easily checkable property.  \nThe PI and another student investigated cluster value problems for function spaces defined on the unit ball of Banach spaces.  Among their results was a reduction of certain problems for the case of general Banach spaces to the case of some spaces that have much simpler structure (an unconditional decomposition into finite dimensional spaces).  \nThree PhD students of the PI were involved in the research.  Two have graduated and the third will receive her PhD in August, 2014. Two of the students are Hispanic. The two graduated students currently have appointments in American academic institutions and one of them currently is an investigator on his own indivi..."
