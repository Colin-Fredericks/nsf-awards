 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to understand processes associated with tropospheric ozone variability across the northern tropical Atlantic Ocean between West Africa and the Caribbean during the summer of 2010. In particular, ozonesonde measurements will be made at Sao Vicente, Cape Verde; Dakar, Senegal and Barbados. Weekly ozonesonde launches and two intensive operations periods (IOPs) are planned with IOP1 occurring in June and IOP2 occurring during August/September. The focus of IOP1 is on ozone depletion associated with the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) and the enhancement of ozone in the boundary layer in association with a soil nitrogen oxides pulse from early rain events after the dry season in sub-Saharan Africa. The focus of IOP2 is on ozone enhancement associated with lightning-produced nitrogen oxides from African Easterly Waves (AEWs) and boundary layer ozone depletion associated with surface deposition. The measurements will take advantage of additional data from three hurricane research field campaigns during August/September, and a focused aerosol, microphysics, precipitation field campaign at Barbados. Surface ozone, dust measurements and other measurements (ceilometers, lidar, surface nitrogen oxides, radar) at Cape Verde and Barbados are also expected to augment data derived from this project. Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-CHEM) model forecasts for dust and AEWs will be produced on a daily basis during the campaign to help target ozonesonde launches.\r\n\r\nThis program will provide opportunities for professional development for up to ten underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in the atmospheric sciences and related physical sciences. Students will be divided up into teams and will be responsible for ozonesonde preparation, forecast discussions, and ozonesonde/radiosonde launches and will participate in the daily briefings via Skype at the three locations. Students will be taught ozonesonde preparation and ozonesonde/radiosonde launch procedures. One graduate student at Howard University will be supported along with a postdoctoral fellow. Research opportunities through collaboration for faculty and students will occur with the Caribbean Institute for Hydrology and Meteorology in Barbados and continued collaboration is expected with the Laboratory for Atmospheric-Oceanic Physics - Simeon Fongang at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, Senegal. Outreach activities will be sought with institutions on Sao Vicente Island, Cape Verde. This research represents an opportunity to combine atmospheric chemistry, aerosol science and tropical meteorology, exposing students to the possible synergy that exists amongst these sub-disciplines. The basic research will build capacity in Senegal for long-term aerosol and surface ozone measurements that have applications not only to atmospheric chemistry and climate forcing but also to respiratory disease and public health.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTropospheric ozone variability in the lower/middle/upper layers over the Northern Tropical Atlanitc Ocean is largely unknown because of limited measurements.  Unlike the Southern Tropical Atlantic Ocean, there are no permanent stations and biomass burning is limited to the Northern Hemisphere winter season.  Consequently, natural sources of tropospheric ozone production or destruction must drive ozone variability.  The sources include biogenic sources from soils of Africa, and LNOX production from lightning.  The sinks are primarily deposition, Halogen destruction over the marine boundary layer and heterogenous chemical reactions from Saharan dust leading to the loss of nitrogen. Furthermore, when ozone is produced at altitudes above the marine boundary layer its lifetime is extended (30-50 days) and it can be transported over long distances; hence, the postive radiative forcing of ozone as a greenhouse gas is increased.  \n\nMeasurements taken from 2010-2012 identified the sources of tropospheric variability across the Atlantic at Dakar, Senegal; Sao Vicente, Cape Verde; and  Barbados.   Our finding show that Saharan dust strongly influences ozone mixing ratios in the lower to middle troposphere, while lightning from Africa enhances ozone mixing ratios in the middle and upper troposphere.  Our results also suggest that tropical cyclones can either reduce or increase ozone mixing ratios, depending on the relative distance to the disturbance.  For example, we found enhanced ozone mixing ratios ahead of  Hurricanes Danielle and Igor and there was lightning associated with these systems.  Hurricane Earl while having the largest number of lightning locations also vertically transported large quantities of moisture and ozone poor air from the marine boundary layer leading to low but well mixed ozone mixing ratios from the lower through upper troposphere at Barbados.   Tropical Storm Fiona also showed enhancement in ozone mixing ratios along with high quantities of lightning found from ground based lightning networks.   \n\nThe mechanism proposed to explain the observed increase in ozone mixing ratios is the production of LNOX near the tropical cyclone which is carried downstream ahead of the tropical disturbance.  During the horizontal transported of LNOX, the air undergoes adiabatic sinking outside of the tropical disturbance.  We have found significant reductions of relative humidity associated with elevated layers of ozone mixing ratios and warming in the middle and lower troposphere which is consistent with adiabatic warming and dehydration of the air mass originating from the tropical disturbance.  Future tropical cyclone research missions which have the ability to measure ozone mixing ratios through insitu or Lidar measurements will confirm and improve on the proposed mechanism that we have found as it relates tropical cyclone-ozone connections.  Future field campaigns which link dust concentrations, size distributions and chemical/biological characterizations will help in determining how Saharan dust acts as a source/sink of tropospheric ozone.  Future measurements will lead to improvements in global and regional chemical modeling efforts.\n\nThis work also provided important research opportunities and work force development for undergraduate,graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  A significant portion of the participants were from traditionally underrepresented groups.  The research field experiences were meaningful and fruitful for the students that were involved. A large percentage of the students have gone on for professional degrees, and this grant funded 2 PhD students who graduated from Howard University during the spring of 2014 and 2015.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory Jenkins"
