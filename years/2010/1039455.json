SU faculty conduct research in the fields of developmental biology, genetics, gene expression and DNA structure and function. Topics of study include yeast metabolism, forensics, muscle development, stem cell differentiation, DNA repair mechanisms, and other topics.  The capillary DNA sequencer helps faculty to significantly speed progress in their work by reducing reliance on outside service providers.  Students directly benefit from having the sequencer because they gain experience in the application of research techniques in classes and independent projects. The results of the research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.",
