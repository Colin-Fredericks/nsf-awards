 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops, from the ground up, a new theoretical framework for analyzing and designing algorithms for dynamic ad-hoc wireless networks. This proposal embraces network dynamics as an opportunity to be exploited, not an adversity to be overcome. \r\n\r\nThe approach is based on four inter-related thrusts:\r\n1. Incremental Topology Learning: Tracking changes in the network much more efficiently than re-learning entire topology, using sparse \"error graph\" representations.\r\n2. Topology and Traffic Shaping: Controlling the \"effective\" wireless network topology so that (i) at any instant of time it appears to be highly disconnected to scheduling algorithms, but retains global connectivity over time; and (ii) modifying traffic statistics to ensure statistical spatial correlation decay.\r\n3. Warm-starting Distributed Algorithms: Message-passing algorithms that can warm-start the optimization based on local knowledge of past solutions.\r\n4. Proteus - A Mobile Robot Testbed: This project validates its approach via implementation on a mobile robot testbed called Proteus, which is used to optimize algorithms in a practical setting.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Industry is involved in this research from the start, via the WNCG Affiliates program at UT.  The research will be disseminated via publications in top-tier venues, industry interactions, and specially organized workshops. Both graduate students and undergraduate students, via a REU program at UT (with emphasis on recruiting women and minorities), get exposure to both real-world wireless networks (via the testbed), and  cutting edge theory.",
