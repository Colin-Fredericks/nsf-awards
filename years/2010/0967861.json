Consequently, CdTe-based PV systems have reached grid parity in many locations.  However, in order for this cost-effective PV technology to become a significant producer of electricity for the future, the solar energy conversion efficiency of the device must be advanced beyond the current level of 16%.  Furthermore, material utilization must be improved in order to reduce tellurium loading, which is a limited resource.  This research will focus on improving the fundamental understanding of polycrystalline CdTe thin films as the basis to improve the efficiency of CdTe solar cells.\r\n\r\nHistorically, CdTe thin film solar cells have been fabricated using empirical optimization of simple deposition technologies and heat treatments.  A key device characteristic, the doping level in the absorber material, has never been intentionally controlled or tuned. Doping levels in CdTe solar cells are the result of several impurities introduced at various processing steps during the solar cell fabrication process. This research will focus on the deposition of polycrystalline CdTe films by an atmospheric pressure vapor transport process that allows for control of the deposition conditions.  This process will controllably dope the thin films, and therefore provides a means to determine the p-type doping levels required to advance the PV efficiency towards the practical limit of 20%.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is innovative because it will use a vapor elemental deposition technique to control the doping and defect formation process.  The research is potentially transformative because it identifies the fundamental breakthroughs needed to make CdTe solar cells with efficiency superior to silicon PV but with lower cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nImproving the efficiencies of CdTe solar cells will lead to lower manufacturing costs and allow cleanly-generated power to penetrate electricity markets around the world, including many poor and underdeveloped nations. \r\n\r\nThe proposed education activities will train students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in the fast growing field of photovoltaics, which currently has a significant shortage of engineers.  Existing REU programs will be used to drive the education and outreach activities.  Specifically, all REU students, in addition to their research activities, will also serve as Ambassadors for Solar PV, where they will conduct an annual Solar Energy Workshop which hosts local elementary school students for a half day and gets them involved in hands-on solar energy activities. The REU students will also assist with the development of a series of modules that will be used in the Electronic Materials and Semiconductor Device courses. These modules will serve as the lab component for these courses, and are intended to expose all undergraduate students in electrical engineering at University of South Florida to photovoltaics concepts.  Research on II-VI compound semiconductor PV devices will be integrated into required courses of the electrical engineering curriculum that will reach 150 students per year.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project investigated the potential of a deposition process - Elemental Vapor Transport (EVT) &ndash; to control the formation of point defects and doping in II-VI compounds, specifically CdTe.  CdTe is being used for the manufacture of the lowest cost flat panel photovoltaic (PV) modules, and controlling the creation of point defects and doping would enable the technology to achieve higher efficiencies and therefore lower manufacturing costs.\n\nThe EVT deposition apparatus was designed and constructed in house (see photo - Fig. 1).  During this project it was shown that the amount of vapors (to achieve either Cd-rich or Te-rich conditions) used during the deposition of thin films has a significant effect on the formation of point defects.  This is demonstrated in Fig. 2 that shows the results from photoluminescence (PL) measurements that show progressively changes in the radiative transitions of CdTe films; the films were deposited at different Cd/Te vapor ratios (with no intentional dopants added).  It was also shown that the conductivity type of CdTe films can be intrinsically controlled &ndash; i.e. the films can be made n- or p-type by carrying out the deposition under Cd- or Te-rich conditions respectively.  Another important finding was that the amount of post-deposition Cu that can be introduced in CdTe as a p-type dopant (CuCd), depends on the presence of Cd-vacancies in the films, which can be varied depending on the Cd/Te vapor ratio.  The effect of the Cd/Te ratio on a post-deposition heat-treatment that introduces chlorine (Cl) into the films was also investigated; Figure 3 shows how the Cd/Te vapor ratio and post-deposition annealing temperature affect the net doping in the films (the annealing process is carried out in the presence of CdCl2 which causes Cl to diffuse into the CdTe films).  This underscores the role of native defects (in this case Cd vacancies) and their interaction with Cl to form complexes (such as the known [VCd-Cl]).  Similar results were obtained when in-situ antimony (Sb) doping was introduced.  The Sb doping efficiency increased under Cd-rich conditions, which are required to create Te-vacancies to be occupied by Sb (SbTe).  Figure 4 shows the net p-doping in CdTe films doped with Sb as a function of the Cd/Te vapor ratio.  It should be noted that the doping levels achieved in EVT-deposited CdTe:Sb films are higher than what is typical of state-of-the-art CdTe films used for the manufacture of solar cells, a condition required in order to increase the voltage of the cells and therefore their efficiency.  In conclusion the EVT process clearly demonstrated that point defects and ultimately the net doping in CdTe films can be influenced by the concentration of Cd and Te vapors during the growth.  This was demonstrated for in-situ as well as post-deposition doping.\n\nThe project produced one journal and three refereed conference papers (and several presentations at workshops) and it contributed to the education of both graduate and undergraduate students.  A Hall Effect manual was created to be used in an undergraduate Electronic Materials course.  Two students supported by this projectg received their MSEE, and two more are scheduled to earn their PhDEE degrees within 18 months of completion of this project.  Eight undergraduate (UG) students also participated in the project (4 male/4 female); the UG students contributed substantially to the design and construction of the apparatus during year one (see photo); their work included modeling the gas flow of the reactor.  Three of the UG students based their senior capstone senior design project in Chemical Engineering on the EVT process and the manufacture of low cost solar cells.  One of the UG students (5th from the left in the attached photo) received a NASA Fellowship to continue her work on PV materials while pursuing a graduate degree in chemical engineering.
