 "awd_abstract_narration": "The period between 1.78 and 1.63 billion years ago (Ga) was a time of important southward growth of the North American continent.  The rate of growth within this 150-million-year period far exceeds Phanerozoic (542 million years ago to the present) crustal growth rates. As a result of recent work in southern Wyoming and northern Colorado, in a region known as SW Laurentia, the PIs have identified a deformational, magmatic, and thermal event at 1.62-1.58 Ga, which is surprising because the region was thought to be tectonically quiescent.  The researchers will combine detailed kinematic histories of shear zones in northern and central Colorado, with precise, texturally-linked dates on deformation, and well-dated metamorphic pressure-temperature paths to evaluate two end-member hypotheses where the enigmatic tectonic 1.6 Ga event may represent either (1) intracratonic deformation of the newly accreted continental crust with stresses transmitted far inboard of the active plate margin or (2) deformation associated with delayed subduction of a long-lived remnant ocean basin. The 1.6 Ga tectonism may reflect the closing of this basin and the final accretion at the southern edge of the North American continent.  \r\n\r\nThe recognition of 1.62 to 1.58 Ga deformation, magmatism, and metamorphism as much as 1200 km away from the continent-ocean plate boundary has important implications on several levels. First, the event may have Phanerozoic analogues in the Laramide (80 million years ago) orogeny or the modern Tibetan Plateau. If correct, this hypothesis would suggest rapid stabilization of, and efficient stress transfer within, newly accreted crust of this age. The present midcrustal level of exposure of rocks affected by the 1.6 Ga event affords an opportunity to investigate the crustal stress transfer in the strongest part of the crust. There are also implications for modern earthquake hazards well away from active plate boundaries. Alternatively, if the event reflects closure of a small ocean basin, then the crustal growth process was not a simple north to south progression and indeed was not completed in some of the northernmost regions until after 1.6 Ga. This might also explain some of the anomalous features on recent deep seismic surveys of the region. In either case, results from this study are likely to result in substantial revision of tectonic models for Paleoproterozoic crustal growth, assembly, and stabilization in SW Laurentia.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The principal goal of the project was to test competing models for the Precambrian tectonic evolution of basement rocks exposed in Colorado and Wyoming and thereby assess whether continental growth mechanisms were similar to those of the present day, or significantly different.  The project determined the deformational histories of high-grade shear zones, which have been interpreted to represent accretion zones between different blocks of volcanic and plutonic continental crust.  The project focused specifically on the period from 1680 to 1580 million years ago, a period that represents the transformation of the new crust from thin, island arc terranes that formed by subduction and volcanism, into thick, stable continental crust. Competing models for the deformation recorded in this 100 million year-long window, are 1) thrust systems deep within stable continents, such as the present-day Tibetan plateau in Asia, and the ~70-50 million year-old Laramide orogeny of western US that formed the Rocky Mountains, and 2) delayed subduction of a 200 km long ocean basin, which would indicate protracted, episodic accretion over 150 million years. \nThe results led to a hybrid model for the evolution of crust with elements of each end-member model.  Thrust faults propagated from 1680 to 1600 million years ago and got progressively younger from the island arc terranes in the south to the existing continental margin in the north.  This result demonstrates that relatively young crust, 150 million years-old, was capable of transmitting stress far inboard, 1000 km or more and fits the Tibetan plateau and Laramide orogeny analogues.  But delayed subduction of a north-dipping oceanic slab, shortening within the western portion of the basement crust and dextral motion on a 1680 million year-old, N-S trending, strike-slip, transform fault were also established by the project research.  These results support the delayed subduction model for evolution of the Colorado and Wyoming lithosphere. \nPrevious models have extended the growth mechanisms that are expressed in the Rocky Mountain region to a 1000 km wide, E-W swath of new continent stretching from Arizona to Michigan that formed between 1780 to 1650 million years ago.  Most of this basement crust is buried beneath younger rocks in the mid-continent, but it is likely that delayed subduction and propagating thrust systems may have been aspects of the evolution of that basement crust as well.\n\nIn addition to these mechanistic results from the project, the research also determined complete kinematic histories of four high-grade shear zones, which will be useful data for any future studies of the basement evolution.  The project funded three Masters theses, and supported two undergraduate research assistants.  Results have been presented at several national conventions, and published in one journal article, with two additional ones in preparation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/08/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin R Chamberlain"
