 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project revolves around finding solutions to equations over discrete groups.  This is equivalent to understanding sets of homomorphisms between a pair of discrete groups (the domain representing the equations and the target the group of interest).  The first half of this project is motivated by the theory of S-bundles, where S is a compact orientable surface.  Surface bundles arise throughout pure mathematics.  If B is a manifold (or other reasonable space), then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of isomorphism classes \n(oriented) of S-bundles over B and the set of (conjugacy classes of) homomorphisms from the fundamental group of B to the mapping class group of S.  The PI intends to develop a general structure theory for this set when the fundamental group of B is finitely  generated (which will always happen when B is compact, for example).  In the second half of this project (joint work with H, Wilton), we study homomorphisms to free (and more generally torsion-free hyperbolic) groups.  Broadly speaking, this is the class of `negatively-curved' groups.  This study is motivated by the first-order logic of these groups.  It is quite remarkable that the geometry of negative curvature has profound implications for first-order logic.  We intend to study these first-order theories from an algorithmic point of view, and find general decision processes which determine if a logical sentence is true or false. \n \n \nGroups form a natural language for studying symmetries of mathematical objects.  As such, they arise throughout mathematics, and their study is informed by many branches of mathematics.  There are very few basic properties of a `symmetry', the most important of which is that it doesn't lose any information about the space, so it can be undone.  In this project, we treat the groups as objects of intrinsic interest, although the questions that we ask take their motivation from topology, geometry, logic and computer science as well as from within group theory.  Broadly speaking, we take a collection of equations over a group G, and try to understand the set of all solutions to these equations.  In the first half of the project, the group G is the mapping class group of a surface, which captures much of the symmetry of a surface (a space which looks like the plane in small sets).  Studying equations over the mapping class group is of fundamental interest in geometry and topology, through the study of surface bundles (a space which nearby any point decomposes into a pair of smaller sets, one of which is a surface).  The study of equations over the mapping class group gives a general theory parametrizing surface bundles.  The second half of this project studies equations over groups from the point of view of logic, and looks for general algorithms which decide if logical sentences are true of false. \n \nThis project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Foundations Program. \n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn joint work with Ian Agol (UC Berkeley) and Jason Manning (Cornell University), the PI proved key technical results about 'Virtually Special Cube Complexes'.  In particular, this provided a key result needed for Agol's solution of the Virtual Haken Conjecture and Virtual Fibering Conjecture in 3-dimensional topology.\n\nA 3-dimensional manifold is a mathematical space that locally looks like the familiar 3-dimensional space in which we live, though its global features may be very complicated.  Agol's result shows that for any hyperbolic 3-manifold (the largest, most interesting and in many ways least understood class of 3-manifolds), after a finite amount of 'unwrapping', there are nice 2-dimensional sub-objects ('surfaces').  Further, one can understand these 3-manifolds by cutting along the surfaces, and decomposing into simpler pieces.\n\nStrikingly, the proofs of these conjectures involve replacing a smooth 3-dimensional object by an object built out of high-dimensional analogues of cubes.  These 'cube complexes' have provided powerful new tools for studying questions in pure mathematics and have had striking applications.  Agol's proof of these conjectures was rewarded with a 2016 Breakthrough Prize, and many other laudations.\n\nThe work of the PI with Agol and Manning on virtually special cube complexes have provided some of the most important technical tools in this area, and we continue to further this area with more general results in hopes of many further applications.\n\nA major international conference on this subect was organized in 2013 at the University of Illinois at Chicago, which brought together the world experts in this area.  This was preceeded by a workshop for graduate students, which allowed more than 60 graduate students to learn about this important and exciting new work from some of the best researchers in the field, and then stay for the conference to learn about other new developments.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel P Groves"
