 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe PI?s request funding to acquire an up-to-date liquid chromatograph ? mass spectrometer (LC/MS). Specifically, we request a triple quadrupole LC/MS system with electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources, thus allowing characterization of a wide range of soluble molecules, including extracted lipids that are not volatile enough to be GC-amenable. The acquisition of this instrument will allow characterization of molecules of widely varying structures, while keeping maintenance requirements at a level supportable with our current infrastructure and technical support staff. Ongoing and future projects include analysis of lipids for development and application of paleoenvironmental proxies, studies of water column particulate and dissolved organic matter, studies of intact polar lipids, and further development of black carbon measurements.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:     \r\n\r\nThe acquisition of the LC/MS triple quad system will open up new avenues of research into compounds that are not amenable for GC/MS analyses. The significance of the research could be far-reaching with respect to environmental concerns over black carbon. Teaching undergraduate and graduate research is a real strength of both PI's. The PI's demonstrated priority emphasis on hands-on experience, including research experiences for graduates and undergraduates in three different courses. The attitude that instrumentation should not be used as a 'black box' but rather as a hands-on learning opportunity pervades the text, and this is an important plus for this proposal. This aspect meets one of the principal NSF strategies for fostering the integration of research and education.",
