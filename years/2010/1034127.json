 "awd_abstract_narration": "Duke University has been awarded a grant to complete the current remodeling and expansion of facilities at the Las Cruces Biological Station that will enhance education and research opportunities for students and scientists.  Improvements will: 1) remodel and expand the current laboratory and increase long-term storage space; 2) complete the station-wide upgrade of cyberinfrastructure by overhauling IT in the laboratory; 3) remodel a former residential property to house additional researchers and construct a fourth researcher cabin to complement the series of three cabins built with funds from the 2007 NSF-FSML; and 4) remodel the herbarium to adequately house current specimens and allow for the future growth of collections.  These upgrades would considerably improve facilities provided to visiting researchers and students, and fully reposition the station to account for the large increase in researcher visitation, and the surge in the number and length of stay of courses. \r\n\r\nLas Cruces was acquired in 1973 by the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS), a US-based nonprofit consortium of 60 universities and research institutions from the United States, Latin America, South Africa, and Australia that is dedicated to providing leadership in education, research, and the responsible use of natural resources in the tropics.  Over the years Las Cruces has established itself as a key mid-elevational field station focused on applied fields of research, and in particular forest fragmentation and its impacts on the conservation of flora and fauna and restoration ecology.  The station protects 325 ha of mostly primary forest with exceptionally high plant diversity (~2000 species) and numerous endemic species.  The improvements in this project will allow the Station to continue to serve as a leading institution for international education and research in tropical biology.  Futher information on Las Cruces may be obtained from the OTS web site at http://www.ots.ac.cr/.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award resulted in major infrastructure improvements to the Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica.  As a result of this grant the field station, which is owned and operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS), increased its laboratory footprint by ~25%.  The new 36 m2 wing has been sectioned into cubicles for use as office space by researchers, and separates the lab into an office or computer work area, and a larger workspace that will continue to be used for processing field samples and other lab-related activities.  Architectural plans made use of the steeply sloped terrain to incorporate a similar-sized storage room below.  The resulting space has more than doubled research and lab storage capacity, which was always in high demand.  The construction of the storage room allowed us to convert former ambient storage spaces to cold storage rooms.\n\nMore detailed improvements in the laboratory included the complete overhaul of electrical fixtures to low-consumption LED lighting (replacing traditional phosphorescent units); replacing old and damaged chairs with new rugged units that have a hard plastic molded seat and back support frame; replacing all laboratory table tops (the old plywood units were frayed and bowed, or even grooved in places) with new solid wood boards, and constructing several lab work benches specifically geared for researcher use with built-in spaces to store equipment and other researcher needs such as books and documents.  In addition, the entire floor of the laboratory, which had a poured concrete slab finish, has been tiled with a resistant and waterproof porcelain tile.  Finally, several important lab equipment items, including a new precision scale, dissecting microscopes, and focal lights for viewing specimens were acquired, and these new additions will greatly expand laboratory usability. \n\nThe grant also funded construction of additional researcher housing, a new 3-person research cabin and the remodeling of an old abandoned residential home for researcher use.  The inclusion of both has greatly eased reservation congestion during the peak field seasons and allowed for additional research projects to take place at the station.\n\nThe grant provided funds for installing wireless internet access in the new and remodeled research housing.  In addition, the IT infrastructure was replaced in the laboratory, which included new fiber-optic cable and ethernet cables in the new annex.  These overhauls completed the upgrading of the entire IT network at the station &ndash; a process that was done in stages over the past 5 years.\n\nFinally, funding was provided to make improvements to the Las Cruces herbarium (www.ots.ac.cr/herbarium).  An open loft was built into the current herbarium space that increased the physical housing capacity of the herbarium by 50%.  The herbarium was also fully insulated to decrease energy consumption. A large order of herbarium cabinets, as well as a professional-grade plant dryer, was also made.  The addition of these cabinets increased specimen storage capacity by ~200%, and the new dryer has decreased energy consumption considerably. \n\n \n\nWith the addition of the two cabins, researcher-housing capacity at Las Cruces has increased from 27 beds in 7 cabins to 36 beds distributed among 9 cabins.  This improvement has considerably eased researcher congestion (mostly US-based researchers use the station) during the peak summer field season months, and has also permitted station-based research courses such as the NSF-sponsored NAPIRE (Native American and Pacific Islander Research Experience) program to house mentors adequately without creating friction with station researchers.  The course will expand in upcoming years (from 17 to 20 student participants) so the expansion of researcher housing at the station is quite timely.\n\nThe expansion of the laboratory was much overdue and has dramatically altered how researchers and students make use of the space, and..."
