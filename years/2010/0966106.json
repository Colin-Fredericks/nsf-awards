The project is designed to attract high-quality students into the physics majors and to relieve them of the financial burden of tuition so that they can focus on academic success during their college career. The project includes interventions at self-identified critical points on physics degree paths: the first year at EMU, the first course in the major, and the progression to upper-level courses. The project improves and augments existing strategies in the EMU Admissions and Financial Aid Offices to recruit physics majors, including women and racial/ethnic minorities. The project also increases the educational opportunities for incoming freshmen and future physics majors.",

Over the five years of this program, a total of 70 unique students participated as either scholarship recipients, or as members of the two recruitment courses.  Of these 70 students, 55 (71%) have declared majors in STEM programs.  Of these, 36 are still declared STEM majors or have graduated from a STEM program, bringing our STEM retention rate to 65%.  Of the 70 students, 40 (57%) declared majors in Physics programs and 22 of these students remain or have graduated.  Our retention rate in Physics programs is 55%.\n\nWe have maintained the curriculum changes that are intended to support physics majors in their freshman year and have enhanced our already vibrant Society of Physics Students to continue the support throughout the students? tenure in the program.   We have seen an increase in the percentage of women majors (from 19% of enrolled physics students to 23.5%) and an increase in the percentage of students of color (18%-21%) over the course of the grant.  We expect the early intervention with courses work and the increased support throughout the program will continue to increase the success of underrepresented populations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick L Koehn"
