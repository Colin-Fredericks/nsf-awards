 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professor Theodore Betley of Harvard University on iron-mediated, catalytic carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond functionalization.  Professor Betley's group synthesizes electrophilic complexes featuring transiently-formed metal-ligand multiple bonds.  These metal catalysts contain hard donor, weak-field dipyrromethane and tris(pyrrolyl)ethane ligand scaffolds that were selected for their ability to confer a wide range of steric and electronic environments to the first row-transition metal ion.  Catalytic C-H bond amination reactions are being explored to determine the scope, activity, and mechanisms of the reaction.\r\n\r\nThis award examines the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds as a way of converting inexpensive chemical feedstocks (hydrocarbons) to valuable functional molecules with minimal waste generation.  Importantly, Professor Betley and his group are using non-toxic and earth-abundant elements, such as iron, to perform these important transformations.  The targeted products are useful in many fields, ranging from pharmaceutical production to value-added commodity chemicals for buildings and automobiles.  \r\n\r\nThis research effort is well-integrated into the classroom.  Professor Betley organizes the Experience the Elements Firsthand, an interactive demonstration for students at the K-12 level from Boston's local grade schools and high schools.  In this program, the students are invited to participate in a series of experiments and observe chemical phenomena in the laboratory.  Professor Betley also co-directs an academic outreach program aimed at attracting traditionally underrepresented minority students in the chemical sciences and is active in Hawaii's federally-funded Upward-Bound program to promote interest in the sciences in first-generation students.",
