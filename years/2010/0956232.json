 "awd_abstract_narration": "The requested funds support the International Conference on Plant Vascular Biology (PVB2010) to be held July 24-28, 2010 on the campus of The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, which is co-chaired by Biao Ding (The Ohio State University) and David Hannapel (Iowa State University). PVB broadly includes studies on the formation, structure and function of transport systems in plants, under conditions of normal plant growth and development as well as of plant interactions with pathogens. The transport systems cover the xylem, phloem, plasmodesmata and vascular cell membranes. The PVB concept emphasizes the integrative nature of the transport systems and approaches to investigate them. PVB2010 will bring together researchers from around the world to share the latest research findings, develop collaborations and identify new directions of research. These will be achieved through formal oral and poster presentations, informal discussions during various breakouts and social interactions. The scientific exchanges will promote further studies to understand the mechanisms that regulate plant growth and development, adaptation to the environment as well as biomass production. Such understanding will be crucial for developing technologies to improve food, medicine and energy production for the benefits of mankind in long terms. The conference strongly supports participation of underrepresented groups such as minorities and women.",
