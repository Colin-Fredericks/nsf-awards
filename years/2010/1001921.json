 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support activities during a planned \"Emphasis Year in Dynamical Systems\" at Northwestern University during the 2010-11 academic year. The emphasis year, funded in part by the Northwestern Department of Mathematics Department, will feature both long- and short-term visiting scholars, postdoctoral positions in dynamical systems, and the annual Midwest Dynamical Systems Conference.\r\n\r\nThe semester's programs are specifically organized around the research areas of ergodic theory, discrete group actions, Hamiltonian dynamics, and smooth and geometric dynamics, with an organizing theme of \"Trends in Dynamics for the Coming Decade.\" This theme will guide the events of the year and will be the title and focus of a concluding major conference to be held in Spring 2011. The funding will be used to support both visitors to the department and participants in the conference, increasing collaboration within and across disciplines. Much of the funding will be directed to young mathematicians, particularly postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and junior faculty, who do not have their own sources of support.",
