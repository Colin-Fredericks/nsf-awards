 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in sensor technologies and expansion of wired and\r\nwireless communication protocols enable us to continuously collect\r\ninformation about the physical world, resulting in a rich set of novel\r\nservices.  The ability to infer relevant patterns from these event\r\nstreams in real-time and at various levels of abstractions to make\r\nnear instantaneous decisions is crucial for a wide range of mission\r\ncritical applications ranging from real-time crisis management to\r\nsecurity.  This project designs, implements, and evaluates a novel\r\ncomplex event processing methodology, henceforth called Complex Event\r\nAnalytics (CEA).  CEA integrates the capabilities of pattern matching\r\nfrom complex event processing with the power of multi-level analysis\r\nfrom static OLAP engines to provide multi-dimensional sequential\r\npattern analysis over high-speed event streams.  The CEA Model\r\ncombines CEP and OLAP techniques for efficient multi-dimensional event\r\npattern analysis at different abstraction levels. Based on\r\ninterrelationships in both concept and pattern refinement among\r\nqueries, sequence queries are composed into an integrated event\r\npattern hierarchy.  OLAP like operations enable analysts to navigate\r\nfrom one E-cuboid to another in this event analytics space.  CEA\r\noptimization strategies, including rewriting rules, physical\r\noperators, and cost-based search algorithms, achieve scalable event\r\nprocessing.  CEA offers high-performance analytics by maximal shared\r\nprocessing of event pattern queries.  Experimental studies compare the\r\nCEA solution to the state-of-the-art, including traditional stream\r\nquery systems and customized event engines.  Intellectual merit lies\r\nin the design, development and evaluation of a novel Complex Event\r\nAnalytics technology for real-time event stream analysis, -- a perfect\r\nmiddle ground offering both the sophisticated power of pattern\r\nmatching found in modern event processing systems and the capability\r\nof online analytic techniques at multiple levels of abstraction of\r\nOLAP engines.  CEA impacts society by facilitating a broad range of\r\nstream-centric applications ranging from monitoring of hygiene\r\ncompliance to prevent the spread of infectuous diseases in medical\r\nsettings to business intelligence processing, and by integrating\r\nproject activities with education.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at the URL:\r\nhttp://davis.wpi.edu/dsrg/PROJECTS/CEA",
