 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supporting development of an integrated research/education network among ecologists at primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), with the goal of enhancing the involvement of undergraduates in large-scale ecological and environmental science research. Towards this goal, the network is 1) developing collaborative research projects at regional to continental scales, with special attention to the constraints of scientists with significant teaching responsibilities; 2) designing those projects to maximize student engagement in authentic science while maintaining a goal of generating publication-quality, transformative data; 3) creating a continental-scale ecology course module that will be team-taught by scientist-educators distributed across different PUIs, using data from collaborative projects as a centerpiece; 4) enhancing the role of PUI scientists and their students in existing and emerging ecological research networks, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON); and 5) creating an online database of future and existing data sets collected from the network of PUIs. The project aims to include any and all researchers at PUIs that perform long-term ecological research with undergraduates, and that have the potential to incorporate the network's research/education experiences into their curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research/education network is based in its potential to engage the considerable intellectual and labor capital at PUI institutions to advance continental-scale ecology, and to produce workable models for how PUIs can contribute to continental science and develop vital and sustainable research programs through collaboration. Consistent with the underlying premise that collaborative research is a highly effective teaching tool, the network is providing guidelines for creating rich ecological learning experiences based on this approach.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this network are inherent in giving undergraduate students at PUIs greater access to authentic, collaborative, large-scale research projects. By involving students in all phases of these studies through both traditional teaching labs and independent research, this network aims to further their ability to think across scales and disciplines, enhance their sense of connections among sites, and broaden their understanding of how ecological drivers vary over space and time. Students are experiencing scientific collaboration first-hand through interactions with peers and faculty with diverse expertise at a range of PUIs, as they work in teams to address ecological questions. Additionally, the network is offering workshops aimed at broadening participation of underrepresented groups in ecological research with undergraduates, is encouraging PUI ecologists to engage in existing ecological research networks, and is making its activities, datasets and assessment results publically available via a website, workshops, and presentations at annual meetings.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported jointly by the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Division of Undergraduate Education.",

EREN&rsquo;s mission is to create and test models for collaborative ecological research that generate high-quality, publishable data involving undergraduate students and faculty across a broad geographic network of research sites.&nbsp; During our funding cycle, our specific goals were to (1) develop a broad coalition of scientific collaborators from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) to share expertise and contribute data to a range of large-scale ecological experiments, with students as key partners in this research, (2) develop teaching modules based on the concepts and data from our collaborative research, (3) provide resources, professional development and cross-training opportunities for ecologists at PUIs and serve as a vehicle through which PUI ecologists could link with other existing and emerging networks, and (4) develop a web presence for the network and a web-based database for sharing and comparing data collected in our collaborative projects. &nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of student learning, we hoped that engagement in EREN would teach students to think across ecological scales, recognize the influence of local and regional environmental context on ecological processes, and realize the value of collaboration in STEM fields, all through participation in authentic, multi-site research projects. &nbsp;Created by an 18 person faculty team from 14 undergraduate institutions in 2010, EREN has grown to 351 members representing over 200 institutions from diverse countries, including Australia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Columbia, Canada, Mexico, and the Bahamas.</p>\n<p class=\"Style-1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Style-1\"><strong>EREN Mechanics:</strong> EREN works by inviting faculty in the network to propose research projects that are scientifically interesting, collaborative across sites and institutions, appropriate for undergraduate participation, and feasible with limited research resources.&nbsp;

Each project team works together to develop and test the research protocols, seek funding to support the project, share and analyze data, and publish the work in appropriate, preferably peer-reviewed, venues.&nbsp; The team also works on appropriate ways to incorporate the research into undergraduate learning experiences.&nbsp; EREN provides in-person and online support from like-minded colleagues engaged in the same activities at the same kinds of institutions, engages experts on collaborative science to provide advice, and provides a website to act as a hub for EREN activities.</p>\n<p class=\"Style-1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Style-1\"><strong>Intellectual Merit Outcomes: </strong>Grants from the RCN-UBE program do not fund particular research supplies or researcher salaries &ndash; instead they fund the means for scientists and educators to communicate and create new ideas within the network.&nbsp; With its grant funds, EREN provided support for five annual meetings where project ideas, research protocols, pedagogical strategies, and data were discussed.&nbsp; During its grant period, EREN generated ten new collaborative research projects, ranging from studies focused on turtle population dynamics to decomposition rates of invasive plants to bird-window collision patterns to acorn production in oaks in forests across the eastern United States.&nbsp; A long-term experiment that measured tree growth in a network of over 60 permanent forest plots is one of the most popular projects.&nbsp; The EREN group produced two peer-reviewed publications on the EREN concept and two peer-reviewed papers on stream temperature dynamics, one letter to the editor and one opinion piece, and has submitted six grant proposals to NSF that include EREN as a partner organization.&nbsp;
