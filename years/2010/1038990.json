 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because the state of Florida has over 1,350 miles of salt-water coastline, the state represents a significant, untapped opportunity for the Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE) network to expand its geographic and programmatic reach. Our proposed center, COSEE Florida: Water as Habitat, will build statewide connections with Florida's ocean research community. This project will provide professional development opportunities for scientists to improve their ability to communicate the value and importance of their science to nonscientific audiences and achieve a better understanding of their role in supporting STEM education.\r\n \r\nFounding partners for COSEE Florida are the Indian River State College, the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce, the Ocean Research & Conservation Association, and the Florida Institute of Technology.  Our content theme \"Water as Habitat\" is engaging and appealing to students and the public and will allow us to place naturally charismatic marine organisms and ecosystems within a systems framework linking physical, chemical and geological ocean processes to biodiversity, marine ecology, climate change, threats to human health, and stewardship actions. COSEE Florida will advance ocean science literacy through the implementation of three strategic initiatives: \r\n\r\n1.\tProfessional Development Workshop Series for Scientists: Ocean scientists will participate in workshops to improve their effectiveness in communicating their research to non-scientific audiences. COSEE staff will also provide assistance to scientists who wish to develop quality outreach programs to broaden the impact of their research. Six workshops will be conducted around the state each year. \r\n\r\n2.\tA new Ocean Science Concentration for Pre-Service Educators: Ocean science focused educational content will be added to the Bachelor of Science STEM Education degree for middle school science at Indian River State College in Ft. Pierce, Florida. Students will participate in a suite of courses, research opportunities and high quality practicum situations. The program will be disseminated to additional State College campuses in year 5. \r\n\r\n3.\tCOSEE Florida Ocean Science Learning Network: This initiative is the linchpin that brings scientists, educators and the public together to communicate and collaborate. Water As Habitat events will feature ocean-based interactive presentations, educator workshops, and opportunities for continued participant engagement at regional nodes throughout the state. On-line communication tools will be developed to facilitate post-event collaborations and resource sharing. At least five regional Learning Community nodes will be established around the state. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur work will engage a spectrum of people and organizations from across Florida. Ocean researchers, higher education faculty, informal education institutions, educators and the general public will participate in a wide range of activities. Through our initiatives we will (1) involve up to 90 Florida ocean scientists in effective outreach and education each year, (2) expand the skills and strengthen the ocean science content of at least 200 pre-service undergraduates, 100 in-service teachers and 100 informal educators over a 5 year period, (3) improve the ocean literacy of over 3000 Florida residents and tourists and (4) learn from and contribute to the work of other Centers in the National COSEE Network. \r\n\r\nThe ocean science content of our programs will draw on current research findings from Florida's leading ocean scientists (Intellectual Merit) and significantly expand public awareness of the significance of their work (Broader Impacts). Scientists will also develop a deeper understanding of the challenges facing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education today (Intellectual Merit) and contribute to improving the quality of teaching and learning in Florida through the integration of cutting edge research into K-16 education (Broader Impacts).",

Almost all participating scientists reported that the overall quality of Water as Habitat events were Very Good or Excellent and that they were a good use of their time by providing opportunities to practice explaining science to diverse audiences. Outreach efforts were further broadened by COSEE Florida supporting and participating in large-scale events organized and hosted by other organizations. The Indian River Lagoon Science Festival, a week-long celebration of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics culminating in a one-day expo-style event, was developed under COSEE Florida and now has the momentum to continue into the future.&nbsp;A variety of lecture programs that were developed will also continue with other sources of support, including a popular &ldquo;Marine Science in the Morning&rdquo; Lecture series at the St. Lucie County Aquarium.</p>\n<p>A primary outcome of COSEE Florida was that 427 ocean scientists were able to disseminate their work outside their academic spheres, develop and practice their presentation skills, and establish new partnerships for continued engagement in broader outreach.
