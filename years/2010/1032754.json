 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Northeast Ethics Education Partnership (NEEP) between Brown University, Providence, RI and the SUNY College of Environment, Science and Forestry School, Syracuse, NY, is a new initiative for developing regional research ethics/cultural competence training for environmental science, studies and engineering graduate students in Central New York and at Brown University. In this partnership, the research team is conducting faculty and student mentoring workshops on research ethics training combined with cultural competence/relativity training. Three summer workshops are planned for graduate students at SUNY-ESF and for four other universities in the central NY region. The team also will conduct Train-the-Trainer workshops at three national society meetings in environmental scsience and studies to share resources with participating faculty and graduate students for research ethics/cultural competence training. The NEEP is developing a website with research ethics/cultural competence training materials and curriculum modules with case study references, ethical guidelines and applied ethical advice. On-line training opportunities also will be available.",

These courses are anticipated to be offered through several strategies in the future.\n\n\nSince 2010, NEEP provided intensive training for 11 Brown graduate students for Ethics, Culture and Community-Based Research. 40 other Brown graduate students attended ethics workshops sponsored by the Superfund Research Program in 2011 and 2012.  Currently Brown has Canvas course training materials on Ethics, Culture and Community-based Research that can be  accessed campus-wide by many students and NEEP set up a new Canvas site for \"Ethics for Engineers\" for the Brown University School of Engineering for use by faculty and graduate students.\n\nAt the partnering universities, eleven graduate students  worked as research assistants and conducted bibliographic research, developed training PowerPoint shows, organized course outreach, set up Blackboard sites, gave oral presentations and conducted evaluation research. \n\nNational  and International Course Outreach/Training Resources Dissemination \n\n\nSince 2010, NEEP faculty presented train-the-trainer, workshops and oral presentations at these  eleven national/international conference venues: International Symposium for Society and Resource Management, Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences, Environmental Health, Society of Risk Analysis, Office of Research Integrity, Society for Conservation Biology, NAE PIRE Sustainable Cities Collaborators Workshop, and American Sociology Association - Environment Section,  Community-Campus Partnerships for Health and the SUNY Biotech Annual Symposium. \n\nOur workshops were attended by 120 or more participant faculty and graduate students; an important achievement for both training and visibility to graduate student ethics and cultural competence  training for many academic departments in environmental studies/sciences around the US and internationally.\n\nTraining Materials Development\n\nNEEP has developed  course curricula and training slide resources for website dissemination for faculty, IRB professionals and graduate students. Most popular are 32 PowerPoint training shows on human subjects protections, group protections, cultural competence, ethical theories, environmental ethics, community-based research, human rights histories of cultural/racial groups, local ecolgical knowledge, traditional ecological knowledge, environmental justice and more.
