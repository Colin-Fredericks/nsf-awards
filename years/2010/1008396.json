Both studies involve a\r\nsimilar dynamical core, namely, the rotating Boussinesq equations\r\nwith strong stratification.  Previous theoretical progress toward\r\nunderstanding ocean spectra has been made by considering exact\r\nthree-wave resonances under the weak turbulence paradigm.  Here\r\nthe investigator studies new partial-differential equation models\r\nincluding all three-wave interactions, thus capturing more\r\ncomplete physics.  Effects of rotation, stratification and\r\nhydrostatic balance are deduced analytically through explicitly\r\nderived, nonlinear coupling coefficients.  Numerical simulations\r\ncharacterize energy spectra and generation of shear.  Adding\r\nsimplified cloud dynamics (condensation and evaporation of water)\r\nto the Boussinesq core allows for investigation of the hurricane\r\nembryo.  The latter project involves numerical implementation and\r\nexploration of a minimal, active moisture model including fast\r\nwaves, extending recent work using imposed heat sources to\r\nincorporate moist processes within the context of balanced models\r\n(excluding fast waves). \r\n\r\n     Inertia-gravity waves result from the earth's rotation and\r\ndensity stratification of the atmosphere and oceans.  The effects\r\nof inertia-gravity waves are varied, for example, waves can\r\nself-organize to form large-scale coherent structures widely\r\nobserved in nature, such as cyclones and/or anticyclones,\r\neast-west jets, and horizontal shear layers.  Yet there are\r\ncritically important flows for which the dynamical role of\r\ninertia-gravity waves is yet to be described by a fully\r\nself-consistent mathematical theory.  The project addresses two\r\nsuch fundamental application problems using a combination of\r\nanalytical and numerical calculations: (i) the scale distribution\r\nof wave energy in the oceans, and (ii) tropical cyclogenesis\r\n(also known as the hurricane embryo problem).  In the oceans,\r\ntidal and wind forcing generate internal gravity-wave breaking,\r\nultimately establishing the balance between small-scale mixing\r\nand global circulation.  For the problem of tropical\r\ncyclogenesis, previous mathematical models have filtered out the\r\nfast waves, and there is much to learn about the role of fast\r\nwaves for the emergence and stability of low-altitude cyclonic\r\nvertical vorticity, leading ultimately to the formation of a\r\nhurricane.  The topics involve ocean mixing and ocean-atmosphere\r\ninteractions, which are important factors in climate.",
