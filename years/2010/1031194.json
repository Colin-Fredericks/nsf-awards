Each year, four Berkeley science and engineering graduate and undergraduate students will have the opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research with Indian counterparts on a significant environmental problem affecting hundreds of millions of urban residents that are without access to safe water.    This research focuses on the benefits of converting from intermittent to continuous piped water supply to urban households in the twin cities of Hubli and Dharwad, India.    \r\n\r\nIn Indian cities, piped water is supplied intermittently, leaving pipes vulnerable to contamination and forcing households to store water.  Intermittent supply poses a health threat from increased levels of illnesses caused by poor water quality and limited quantity, as well as an economic burden from the costs of illness and coping.  Providing water continuously has the potential to solve many of these problems; however, little information is available on the actual costs/benefits associated with conversion.  The overall research goal is to fully characterize the water quality benefits of conversion from intermittent to continuous delivery of piped water in Hubli-Dharwad, which is one of the first cities in South Asia to implement such a conversion.   \r\n\r\nIRES students will conduct rigorous interdisciplinary research using culture-based and molecular tools to detect microorganisms, sensors to measure physicochemical water quality characteristics, and household surveys.  In the field, students will gain first-hand knowledge of the challenges of providing safe water as well as the broader context and conditions in one low-income city that is like many others around the world.  The proposed research will fill critical knowledge gaps about the potential benefits of converting from intermittent to continuous water supply in piped systems, will identify the mechanism that cause contamination in these systems, including the role that household behaviors play in water contamination, and will develop low-cost, innovative methods to monitor water quality using sensor networks.    \r\n \r\nThe project will give motivated students the opportunity to engage in meaningful research for the direct benefit of society.  They will develop networks with peers and mentors from the foreign counterpart institutions, and with local populations that will benefit directly from this research.    The IRES opportunity will improve students abilities and knowledge in science and engineering while teaching the skills and understanding to enable them to both collaborate and compete in an increasingly globalized world.",

As a result, intermittent supply can pose a health threat from increased levels of waterborne illnesses and create an additional economic burden in coping costs such as collection, storage and treatment of water.\n\nThe project provided unique research experiences for 9 graduate students and 3 undergraduate students from U.C.

These experiences are invaluable because there is an urgent need for research that can contribute to improving access to safe and affordable drinking water throughout the developing world.  However, conducting research in these contexts is much more difficult because there is much less infrastructure to support research (e.g., laboratories, supplies) and the water supply systems, the institutions that manage them, and household behaviors, are much more complex.  Few existing data are available to describe these systems, and many of the assumptions that are made to characterize water supplies in industrialized countries are inappropriate in developing countries.  The majority of the students who participated in the IRES program have continued (either through their graduate studies or postdocs) to conduct research in developing countries.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this work is that we have provided the first detailed, quantitative evidence about how and when water becomes contaminated in intermittent distribution systems in two different urban contexts &ndash; India and Panama.   Through collaboration between researchers in environmental engineering, public health, economics, and urban planning, we have documented how the observed contamination as well as household factors impact child health and what the economic impacts are on households.  \n\n The broader impacts of our work are that based on our research findings, we are making concrete recommendations for how to reduce contamination in intermittent supplies and how to improve programs that aim to make water supplies continuous so that they are more effective at improving child health while still being affordable to the lowest income households.  We are also making recommendations to utilities to improve their ability to monitor water quality using novel sensor platforms.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kara L Nelson"
