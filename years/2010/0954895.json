 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the PI in his development of the HAWC (High Altitude Water Cherenkov detector) data systems and online data processing, and his leading role in the analysis of HAWC data.  This analysis will include searching for VHE (very high energy) emission from GRBs (gamma ray bursters) and developing a multiparticle analysis of AGN (active galactic nuclei) emission by combining HAWC observations with IceCube, Fermi, Swift, and RXTE data.  HAWC will have a sensitivity 10 -15 times greater than previous instruments exploring VHE cosmic rays. The source of these cosmic rays remains unclear but possible candidates for these are AGNs and GRBs. HAWC is modular in design and data taking will begin when the first modules are commissioned.  The PI will also use what is learned by HAWC to tailor a search for neutrinos with the IceCube array.  \r\n\r\nHAWC is planned to be built in Sierra Negra Mexico, which will lead to strong international collaborations between scientists from the US, Mexico, and other countries.  In addition to mentoring graduate students and postdocs, the PI will enhance Penn State's Upward Bound Math and Science Program for students from urban Pennsylvania schools who attend a summer program at the university.  \r\n\r\nThis award is supported by the Physics Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering of the National Science Foundation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver a century ago, we discovered that the Earth is constantly bombarded with ultrarelativistic particles known as cosmic rays, emitted by some astrophysical objects outside the solar system.  Today, there are several theories of where the highest energy cosmic rays may originate, but no solid answers.  The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma ray observatory was built to study the very high energy Universe, partly to observe the time-varying behavior of suspected cosmic ray sources at energies inaccessible to any other astronomical instrument.  Particular targets of this project were gamma ray bursts, incredibly energetic astrophysical explosions believed to be triggered by the collapse of massive stars at the end of their life and/or by merging neutron stars and black holes.\n\nThis project had three specific objectives: to contribute to the construction of the HAWC Observatory; to use initial data from HAWC to begin searching for very high energy gamma ray emission from extragalactic objects such as gamma ray bursts; and to contribute to the development of human resources in scientific and technical areas.  \n\nThe Penn State research group supported by this project designed and built the software systems that trigger, analyze, and archive data from the HAWC instrument immediately after it is recorded.  Prompt data analysis is essential to fulfill one of HAWC's goals: the rapid notification of other astronomical instruments regarding interesting astrophysical events such as gamma ray bursts, so that multiwavelength observations of these events can be made.  The system developed as part of this project is operating successfully at a data rate many times higher than originally foreseen.\n\nAlthough the HAWC Observatory was only completed and commissioned after the end of this project, data recorded by the partially-built detector were used to search for very high energy gamma rays from several gamma ray bursts which occurred during the construction phase, and from lower but still quite high energy emission was detected by other instruments, notably NASA's Fermi satellite observatory.  Although no higher-energy emission was detected from these bursts, this analysis demonstrated that even with only a fraction of the full detector operational, HAWC would be able to detect emission at levels typical of observations of gamma ray bursts by other instruments.  With the full detector now operating, observations of future bursts are quite promising.\n\nFinally, this project allowed several undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in building and operating the detector and analyzing HAWC data.  Nearly all of these young researchers have continued to pursue careers in scientific and engineering disciplines in academia and industry.  In addition, a dozen high school students from socioeconomically challenged school districts in Pennsylvania, selected because they are the first from their families to be college-bound, had the opportunity to make fundamental measurements of cosmic rays in a realistic laboratory setting with support under this project.
