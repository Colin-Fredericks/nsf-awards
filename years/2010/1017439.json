 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fault-tolerance is now a primary design constraint for all major microprocessors; however, perfect fault-tolerance is not a requirement for most designs. Instead, designs strive to maximize performance subject to an acceptable failure rate constraint. Therefore, vendors typically set a failure rate (FIT) target for each design and validate that the design meets this target with extensive pre-silicon and post-silicon analysis.  One method to quantify fault masking is to use vulnerability factors. A system consists of multiple independent components that interact through well-defined interfaces. Therefore, fault masking can be quantified within a single component by focusing on its interfaces.   This abstraction is called the \"vulnerability stack\", and is the major focus of this project.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability stack can have immediate tangible benefits to the Computer Architecture community. First, by enabling independent vulnerability assessment of each system component, the vulnerability stack allows a designer to assess (and potentially improve) the fault-tolerance of a particular component (e.g., a user program). This enables a much broader segment of the Computer Architecture and Software Engineering communities to participate in the vulnerability assessment and remediation process; currently, these activities are typically performed by architects equipped with a microarchitectural model.  A second benefit of the vulnerability stack is a substantial reduction in the overall effort required for vulnerability assessment. A third benefit of the vulnerability stack is its application to runtime vulnerability estimation techniques. These are of interest because they allow a system to dynamically tune redundancy features to match the current vulnerability environment; this can improve performance during periods of low vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis project will impact undergraduate and graduate education by introducing vulnerability concepts in the Computer Architecture curriculum at Northeastern University and deliver a tutorial at a major Computer Architecture conference.  The project will also include participation by under-represented groups.",
