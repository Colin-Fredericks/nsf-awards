Issues related to the design, analysis and implementation of parallel systems and solutions are of interest. These include design and analysis of parallel architectures and algorithms, and application development on parallel machines. TCPP sponsors professional meetings, brings out publications, sets guidelines for educational programs and coordinates academia, funding agency, and industry activities in the above areas.\r\nThis proposal applies for NSF support to allow 60 more US-based student travel awards to be split evenly among IPDPS-10 student authors, PhD forum presenter at IPDPS10, and the other TCPP sponsored conferences.",
