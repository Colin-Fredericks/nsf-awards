The proposal develops three courses, five experimental modules for each of the courses, and web-based courseware for wider distribution of the materials.\r\n\r\nThe proposal investigates methodologies and tool sets for nanoscale design and integrates them into a novel engineering curriculum. It advances nanoelectronics education and provides students with the ability to perform futuristic nanodesigns. The free exchange of courseware and simulation-based education enables low-cost learning of nanotechnology compared to a traditional experimental approach. The proposal promotes discovery in nanoelectronics and nanotechnology due to advanced simulation, experiments, and design. The proposal replaces experimental-based highly-expensive nanotechnology education with simulation-based low-cost nanotechnology education.\r\n\r\nThis nanotechnology educational program contributes to building a workforce in the nanotechnology industries. The project-centered nanoelectronics courses provide a unique learning opportunity for faculty and students in computer science and engineering.",
