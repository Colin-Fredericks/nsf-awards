 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to create the Virtual Heart, an interactive, hierarchical finite element simulation tool to explore the structure-function relationship in healthy and diseased hearts. The human heart is a fascinating organ that pumps more than 6000 liters of blood through our body every day. Beating more than a billion times during an average lifetime, it provides a steady supply of oxygen and nutrition to all our tissues and organs. Not surprisingly, cardiac dysfunction may have devastating physiological consequences. Our goal is to establish experiments, models, and simulation tools to characterize the electro-active response of cardiac tissue. The Virtual Heart will provide substantial contributions including enhanced insight into excitation-contraction coupling on the cellular level, continuum models for electro-active materials on the organ level, and multi-scale approaches to link both scales. Our project will establish an entirely new way of thinking in cardiovascular medicine, inspired by predictive, patient-specific, simulation-based interventional planning. \r\n\r\nHeart disease is the primary cause of death in industrialized nations, claiming more than 16 million lives worldwide each year. Despite tremendous scientific improvements, cardiovascular disease remains one of the most common, costly, disabling, and deadly medical conditions, generating and annual health care cost in excess of $430 billion. Providing new technologies to understand cardiac disease, this project will have direct social, economical, and educational impact. Socially, it will enhance medical care, lower mortality, and improve life and longevity. Economically, it may optimize medical treatment to significantly reduce health care costs. Educationally, through a planned museum exhibit, we will increase public awareness of risk factors that promote cardiac disease.",

While numerous attempts exist to study either the electrical or the mechanical response of its individual cells or chambers, the integrative electro-mechanical response of the whole heart remains poorly understood. In this CAREER project, we have established novel experiments, models, and simulation tools to better understand the living heart. We have created the Virtual Heart, an interactive, hierarchical finite element simulation tool to explore the structure-function relationship in healthy and diseased hearts. The Virtual Heart is designed around the first unified, entirely finite-element based, fully coupled algorithm for excitation-contraction coupling. Using the Virtual Heart, we have provided substantial insight into excitation-contraction coupling on the cellular level, new continuum models for electro-active materials on the organ level, and novel multi-scale approaches to seamlessly integrate both scales. These results are truly transformative: This CAREER project has established an entirely new way of thinking in cardiovascular medicine, inspired by predictive, patient-specific, simulation-based interventional planning. Our Virtual Heart algorithms have been adopted by the Living Heart project, a translational research initiative to revolutionize cardiovascular science through realistic simulation. The Living Heart project unites leading cardiovascular researchers, medical device manufacturers, practicing cardiologists, and regulatory agencies on a shared mission to develop and validate personalized digital human heart models and establish a unified foundation for in silico cardiovascular medicine. These efforts illustrate the broad social, economical, and educational impact of this CAREER project. Socially, this project has the potential to impacts medical care, lowers mortality, and improves life and longevity. It allows us to better understand heart failure and probe different treatment scenarios in silico before testing them in vivo. Economically, this project has generated virtual test beds to optimize medical treatment on a personalized basis and reduce health care costs. It facilitates device design and treatment planning in cardiac diseases such as arrhythmias, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, stenosis, regurgitation, or prolapse. Educationally, this project creates public awareness of risk factors that promote cardiac disease. It has generated teaching modules for K-12 education and training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. As a special outreach component of this project, we have created a 5-times life size human heart Lego model from magnetic resonance images.
