 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThe goal of this CAREER project is to understand how biological systems read and transform chemical signals into a diverse range of biological outputs.  Improved descriptions of ligand-responses have implications from facilitating a general understanding of biological control to the design of regulatory systems with pre-defined activities, both of which have wide-spread uses in biomedical, engineering, environmental and biotechnological applications.  How do ligand-responsive functions recognize the correct ligand structures, discriminate against incorrect ones and transform binding events into controlled responses?  To better understand the functional roles of ligand interactions in regulatory systems, this project focuses on BmrR, a small molecule-sensing gene regulator whose activity is stimulated by a number of chemically diverse small-molecules.  In the described work, biochemical, biophysical and X-ray crystallographic approaches are employed to dissect and examine ligand-directed effects at the binding, functional and structural levels.  The aim is to combine functional, thermodynamic and structural studies into a more integrative analysis of ligand recognition and ligand-dependent control of protein conformation.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe broader impacts involve better connecting underrepresented minorities with the biological and physical science communities through mechanisms that target students at the elementary, high school and undergraduate levels.  At the elementary and high school levels, these plans include continued involvement in Baltimore-based programs in which students and teachers in the area participate in science-based discussions, demonstrations and hands-on activities.  The integrated research and educational plans focus on increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in basic science research and providing training opportunities for elementary, high school and graduate students.",

This project aimed to gain a better understanding of how such proteins sense and ultimately, expel multiple, unrelated compounds from intracellular environments.  We focused largely on BmrR, a broadly specific, ligand-controlled transcriptional regulator that regulates resistance to a wide variety of cytotoxic small molecules in Bacillus subtilis (Figure 1).  Specific goals of the project included elucidating broadly selective ligand recognition and its connection to downstream signaling.  Another goal was to explore the evolution and features of polyspecificity through studies of distantly-related, structural homologs of BmrR.  We used a battery of methods to better understand how multiple, diverse ligands interact with BmrR and turn the promiscuous switch ON and OFF, including structural, biochemical, biophysical and bioinformatics approaches.  Central to all the studies described below were diverse ligand sets that enabled extensive interrogations of the binding interactions and ligand-directed downstream effects (Figure 1).  The result of our studies is unprecedented views of both ligand recognition and allosteric signaling in a polyspecific system.\n\n \n\nTo illuminate molecular details of polyspecific recognition, we solved a series of X-ray structures of BmrR bound to multiple, unrelated ligands.  Doing so has illuminated the details of polyspecific ligand recognition in BmrR, including a set of recognition determinants that do not resemble those found in ligand-specific systems (Figures 2).  This study was the first ever to identify well-defined determinants in a polyspecific, small-molecule binding system.  Importantly, analyses of other unrelated, broadly specific systems display suggest similar features that appear to have gone unrecognized to date (Figure 3).  Molecular docking and solution-binding studies using a larger, more diverse ligand set highlighted the importance and utility of analyzing many examples of binding in BmrR.  The development of a quantitative, in vitro transcription method and use of a ligand probe set of more than 80 compounds featuring cations, zwitterions, uncharged compounds and anions enabled a medium-throughput approach to investigate the ligand determinants and molecular characteristics of allosteric control in BmrR.  Our results show that even at the allosteric level, BmrR is quite promiscuous with regard to molecular shape and structure.  This result disagrees with conventional views that equate allosteric control with high selectivity and sensitivity.  We observe a dominant role for ligand charge that is distinct from that observed at the level of signal recognition.  Importantly, comparison of selectivity in BmrR with the distribution of differentially charged ligands in bacterial cellular environments suggests that ligand charge and hydrophobicity may be major factors in discriminating xenobiotics from native biological compounds and metabolites (Figure 4).  Determination of the ligand activation profiles shows low-to-moderate cooperativity in ligand activation of BmrR as well as unconventional coupling between ligand binding and allosteric control. This is in contrast to what is observed for selectively, metal-binding MerR proteins that are characterized as ultrasensitive systems.  Finally, our studies of BmrR have prompted investigations of single-domain ligand-binding proteins of the GyrI superfamily.  Bioinformatics and structural results suggest recognition properties similar to those observed for BmrR and potential small molecule resistance functions for the small proteins (Figure 5).  Structural studies suggest a novel regulation mechanism for the single domain protein involving protein-protein interactions with small DNA-binding proteins.\n\n \n\nThe major aim of my broader impact efforts was to increase scientific interests and make careers in science more tangible to those who have been virtually (URMs) excluded from the greater scientific communities, especially from academics.
