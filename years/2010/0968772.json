 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Greenberg intends to study a diverse set of problems related to\r\nSelmer groups, elliptic curves,  and Iwasawa theory. Selmer groups have \r\ntraditionally been an important tool for studying the Mordell-Weil group of \r\nan elliptic curve over a number field.  They have also played an important \r\nrole in proving special cases of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture \r\nwhich provides a relationship between arithmetic properties of an elliptic \r\ncurve E and the behavior of the Hasse-Weil L-function for E.  In recent years, \r\nit has become clear that certain natural generalizations of the Selmer group \r\nshould provide similar conjectural relationships to the behavior of much more \r\ngeneral kinds of L-functions. Iwasawa theory provides a framework for studying \r\nthese conjectures. In its essence, the idea is to study Selmer groups associated \r\nto a family of representations of the absolute Galois group of a number field. \r\nThe formulation of these conjectures in a general setting leads to some \r\nfundamental problems. One problem is to find a simple way to measure how \r\nlarge the Selmer groups are.  Their size should be measured by an element in \r\na certain ring. But it is difficult to find a way to define that element. One of the \r\nobjectives of this project is to tackle that question in two contrasting settings. \r\nIn one setting,  the ring is rather easy to describe, but is non-commutative. In \r\nthe other setting,  the ring is commutative, but we know very little about its \r\nactually structure.  Another objective of this project is to better understand the \r\nbehavior of certain quantities which indirectly reflect the structure of Selmer \r\ngroups, especially in the non-commutative setting. These quantities are certain \r\n``multiplicities.''  There are typically an infinite number of these quantities. \r\nProfessor Greenberg  hopes to show how to determine all of these quantities \r\nfrom just a finite number of them.  \r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental questions in the theory of numbers is the study\r\nof solutions of an algebraic equation. The difficulty of this question\r\ndepends on the degree of the equation and the number of variables. It\r\nhas been understood since antiquity how to study this question when the\r\ndegree is one or two and the number of variables is also one or two.\r\nHowever, the question becomes much more subtle when one considers\r\nequations of degree three, even if the number of variables is just two.\r\nA fundamental conjecture concerning this question was formulated in the\r\n1960s by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. Although considerable progress has\r\nbeen made since then, the conjecture remains unresolved. Such equations\r\ndefine a class of curves known as \"elliptic curves.\" The study of their\r\nproperties has proved to be of importance in cryptography - designing codes\r\nfor the secure transmission of information. Professor Greenberg intends to\r\ncontinue his study of \"Selmer groups\" which have been a traditional tool in\r\nunderstanding the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves and in studying\r\nthe conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. The ultimate goal is to\r\nachieve a deeper understanding of the solutions to the algebraic equations\r\nthat define an elliptic curve, and to develop a more general point of view\r\nconcerning conjectures analogous to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.\r\n",
