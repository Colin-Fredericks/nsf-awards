 "awd_abstract_narration": "PSERC is proposing a Phase III support (third five-year period) for the Center, including support for center personnel, evaluation and research.  The proposed Center is a multi-university Center comprised of the following universities: Arizona State University (lead), Cornell University, Texas A & M, Howard University, Washington State University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Iowa S ate University, Wichita State University, Georgia Tech, the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, the University of California-Berkeley, and Colorado School of Mines.\r\n \r\nThe proposal from PSERC seeks funding for a Phase III (3rd five-year period) led by Arizona State University (ASU). PSERC had its origin as a multi-university IUCRC in 1996, and was created with the vision that collaboration amongst a large group of academic, industrial, and governmental institutions can develop solutions to the complex problems in electric energy. PSERC (currently comprised of 12 universities) will conduct research organized under three primary research stem areas: markets stem, system stem, and transmission and distribution technologies stem. PSERC leverages the expertise of some 40 multidisciplinary researchers. The PI and all of the other site directors are very well-qualified and have access to appropriate and adequate resources.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work addresses important improvements and advancements in the transmission and delivery of electricity. PSERC has been a leader in in developing several key concepts with regard to the development of electricity markets. PSERC researchers also developed one of the first large scale visualization tools for the electric power industry, and this effort has resulted in the creation of a company that has commercially developed the tool. Over the past six years, PSERC member companies have employed an average of 80 graduate and undergraduate students per year from PSERC universities. In the area of diversity, one of the PSERC member universities is Howard University, a historically black university. PSERC will continue to seek women and minorities through students and faculty at member universities as well as on an individual basis as research associates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis IUCRC grant that provides administrative and operational support of PSERC (Power Systems Engineering Research Center).  The projects supported by PSERC industry members have led several discoveries and innovations.\n\nThe research demonstrates different ways that portfolios of renewable sources of energy, storage, and controllable load can be used to (i) increase the financial viability of storage technologies and electric vehicles, (ii) make the grid more robust to wind variability, and (iii) reduce the amount of cost of the conventional generation capacity needed to maintain financial adequacy.  In particular, stochastic programming techniques are developed for committing system reserves with large amounts of renewable resources.  The coupling of wind and flexible is exploited for the smart charging of electric vehicles.\n\nThe research develops new techniques for multi-operation period optimal power flow that captures the sequential and statistical nature of load cycles, storage operations, and dynamic load shifts.  Significant enhancements of the SuperOPF framework are made to include large scale unit commitment problems.  Regulatory options are proposed for electricity markets for ramping services and load aggregation.  A new concept of distribution system operator is introduced and analyzed to orchestrate controllable loads in minimizing the overall operation cost.\n\nThe research also investigates impacts of data quality on real-time locational marginal prices.  It is shown that bad data and topology errors can result in significant perturbation of locational prices. Cyber-attacks on sensors can also influence real-time prices of electricity and potentially affect real-time system operations. Mechanisms to authenticate data are developed to ensure that intrusions and malicious data attacks are detectable. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/12/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lang Tong"
