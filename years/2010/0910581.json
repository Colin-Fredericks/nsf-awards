 "awd_abstract_narration": "While hardware resources for computation and data storage are now abundant,\r\neconomic factors prevent specialized hardware security mechanisms from being\r\nintegrated into commodity parts. System owners are caught between the need to exploit\r\ncheap, fast, commodity microprocessors and the need to ensure that critical security\r\nproperties hold.\r\n\r\nThis research will explore a novel way to augment commodity hardware after fabrication\r\nto enhance secure operation. The basic approach is to add a separate silicon layer,\r\nhousing select security features, onto an existing integrated circuit. This 3-D Integration\r\ndecouples the function and economics of security policy enforcement from the\r\nunderlying computing hardware. As a result, security enhancements are manufacturing\r\noptions applicable only to those systems that require them, which resolves the\r\neconomic quandary. We plan to identify a minimal and realizable set of circuit-level\r\nsecurity capabilities enabled by this approach, which can be judiciously controlled by\r\nthe software layers. This will significantly assist in reducing both the software complexity\r\noften associated with security mechanisms and system vulnerabilities.\r\nThis research introduces a fundamentally new method to incorporate security\r\nmechanisms into hardware and has the potential to significantly shift the economics of\r\ntrustworthy systems. A broader impact will result through collaborative and educational\r\nactivities. Graduate and undergraduate student research associates will transfer\r\nknowledge to future teachers, researchers and Information Assurance professionals;\r\nand project publications will provide direct technical transfer to the embedded-systems\r\nand hardware-design communities.",
