 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the Principal Investigator will employ methods from \r\nstable homotopy theory to provide insight into the surprising relationship \r\nbetween p-local group theory, modular representation theory and stable \r\nhomotopy theory.  Specifically, the PI will first give a much simplified \r\ndescription of the p-local finite group model for the homotopy theory of \r\nfusion systems.  This shows that a p-local finite group on a finite \r\np-group is equivalent to map from the classifying space into a p-complete, \r\nnilpotent space with a stable retract satisfying Frobenius reciprocity up \r\nto homotopy.  In recent work, joint with Radu Stancu, the PI has shown \r\nthat saturated fusion systems on a finite p-group are in bijective \r\ncorrespondence with stable idempotents of the classifying space that \r\nsatisfy Frobenius reciprocity.  The PI will extend this result to a \r\nbijection between p-local finite groups and idempotents that satisfy \r\nFrobenius reciprocity up to structured homotopies.  The crucial question \r\nin the field is on the existence and uniqueness of classifying spaces for \r\nsaturated fusion systems (in the form of p-local finite groups).  Using \r\nresults from this project, the question can be approached by refining the \r\ncurrent construction of classifying spectra from being a construction up \r\nto homotopy to producing structured classifying spectra, and steps will be \r\ntaken in this direction.\r\n\r\nGroups are fundamental objects in mathematics used to keep track of the \r\nsymmetries of an object (e.g. a set or a space).  A group is said to act \r\non an object if that object exhibits the symmetries encoded by the group. \r\nAmong such objects the classifying space of a group is of special \r\nimportance, as its homotopical properties contain information about all \r\npossible actions of the group on topological spaces.  A finite group can \r\nbe characterized as the fundamental group of its classifying space --the \r\nset of paths in the space beginning and ending in a fixed point where two \r\npaths are identified if one can be continuously deformed into the other. \r\nFor a given prime p, the p-local structure of a group can be thought of as \r\nthe system of symmetries of the group that can be detected by actions on \r\nsets whose cardinality is a power of p.  This notion is made precise by \r\nfusion systems as introduced by Puig and developed by Broto-Levi-Oliver. \r\nAs conjectured by Martino-Priddy, and proved by Oliver, p-localizing the \r\nclassifying space mirrors this construction in topology.  More generally \r\none can consider abstract fusion systems that do not necessarily come from \r\ngroups and p-local finite groups are a model for the corresponding \r\nclassifying space suggested by Broto-Levi-Oliver.  In this project the PI \r\nwill elucidate this correspondence by providing a simpler model for \r\nclassifying spaces of abstract fusion systems and take important steps \r\ntoward proving the existence of classifying spaces for arbitrary fusion \r\nsystems which is a fundamental question in the field.",
