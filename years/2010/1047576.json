 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supporting the HI-TEC national conference and a special forum on technology education within the conference (http://www.highimpact-tec.org/). The forum focuses on the identification of critical issues and the challenges of technology education. Importantly this highly interactive forum is designed to provide necessary feedback to the NSF and other stakeholders to help shape initiatives in response to identified national and global challenges. The forum is expected to engage up to 100 participants from the ranks of community college educators, technicians, and industry personnel in a frank discussion designed to highlight challenges and priorities faced by modern technology education. \r\nBoth interactive tools to poll and engage the audience and facilitated focus groups are being used to identify practical knowledge, information, and experiences as well as identify guidelines and priorities for advanced technological education. A final report containing recommendations is being published. \r\n\r\nThis event significantly broadens the impact of the ATE program by engaging new constituencies in STEM and workforce education. One specific objective of this project is bringing students to the conference to broaden their experience. This conference, more than any other single event, is a highlight and showcase for the Foundation's long-standing efforts and initiatives to support technician education at community colleges.",
