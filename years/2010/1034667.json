 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) formal governance and informal social networks will impact recovery and rebuilding efforts in Haiti. We focus on South Florida, home to an estimated 263,000 Haitians, many of whom have family in Haiti; and a region that is already serving as a receiving area for severely injured earthquake survivors, and for school-aged displacees with relatives in this region. Three issues are critically important for purposes of urgent data collection: (i) understanding the role of the Haitian American community in relief, recovery and rebuilding efforts; (ii) documenting the trends and profiles of displacee influx to South Florida; and (iii) collecting and analyzing policies and plans that have been created in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level in response to this potential (or perceived) displacee influx. Interviews with key stakeholders including  members of Haitian-American community groups, non-profit organizations, city and county  (Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach) governments, school administrators and counselors, hospital administrators, and immigration officials and advocates, will service as the primary research method. We will also conduct secondary data analysis of preexisting plans and policies and their modifications, along with any new policies created. \r\n\r\nThe value of this research extends beyond South Florida. Potential contributions are local, regional, national and international in scope, with beneficiaries that span multiple disciplines involved with social network ties and related analyses, school planning, emergency management, homeland security, disaster planning, evacuation, sheltering, healthcare, infrastructure planning and housing reconstruction. Not only will this research seek to fill knowledge gaps outlined above, but it can eventually inform collaborative management and policy in receiving areas, where governmental institutions will need to evolve to meet needs of displacees, including international disaster migrants.",
