The project is working to ensure that these two pathways have detailed, carefully-researched sustainability plans for their post-grant periods.  Notable features of the project are a work plan that involves deep interaction as the plan is developed between the Ithaka S+R group and the two pathway projects, an evaluation plan that builds measureable sustainability goals, and recommendations that are specifically tailored to the needs and situations of the two pathways projects.  Plans and practices developed over the course of this project are being shared with all Pathway projects to inform these additional projects' sustainability efforts.",

Project leaders must constantly make choices, sometimes among competing mission priorities.  It is critical that accountability and authority be concentrated with those who are most motivated and capable of leading such initiatives successfully.
