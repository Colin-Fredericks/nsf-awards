 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are an\r\nessential ingredient in many areas of Sciences and Engineering. Often\r\nin the applications of PDEs, one has to deal with additional\r\ndifficulties caused by the singularities in the geometry, the\r\ncoefficients, or the boundary conditions. The main goals of this\r\nproposal are to obtain more efficient numerical methods for equations\r\nwith singular solutions and to develop user friendly implementations.\r\nThe PI and his collaborators will design improved meshes that provide\r\noptimal rates of convergence for the Finite Element Method in three\r\ndimensions for elliptic equations on polyhedral domains with\r\nnon-smooth interfaces. These equations form one of the basic\r\ningredients in many other applications. The results will be extended\r\nto quasi-linear elliptic equations and to evolution equations. For\r\nsome of these equations, spaces with higher smoothness or other additional\r\nproperties are sometimes needed, and the Generalized Finite Element\r\nMethod will be used for these purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal will contribute to the formation of graduate and\r\nundergraduate students by advising and mentoring them and by\r\nintegrating them in research projects. The PI also plans to continue\r\nto run an Interdisciplinary Seminar featuring outside speakers,\r\nincluding non-mathematicians. The proposed research will lead to the\r\ndesign and testing of new and improved numerical methods for Partial\r\nDifferential Equations (PDEs) of interest in Sciences and\r\nEngineering. The resulting numerical methods will be presented and\r\nimplemented in a way that makes them accessible to\r\nnon-mathematicians. It will also contribute to applying mathematical\r\nresults in practice by interaction with researchers from other fields,\r\nincluding the private sector. It will also contribute to the creation\r\nof specialists able to use advanced theoretical tools to handle\r\npractical problems. He will also introduce numerical methods and the\r\nuse of computers in more traditional undergraduate courses. The PI\r\nalso plans to popularize mathematical questions that arise from\r\npractice among mathematicians. The theoretical results and the\r\nresulting numerical methods will have applications in Mathematical\r\nPhysics, Quantum Chemistry, Biology, Finance (Risk Management and\r\npricing of Financial Derivatives, or Options), and other areas.",
