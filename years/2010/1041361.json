This technique is unique in that it is a non-invasive, in situ method that is robust, accurate, and can provide reliable early-time data in liquid/polymer systems.\r\nAdditionally, time-resolved FTIR-ATR spectroscopy provides molecular-level contrast between diffusant(s) (e.g., water, drug surrogates) and the polymer as the entire mid-infrared spectrum of both are measured in situ as a function of time. This allows for the exploration of molecular changes in the diffusant/polymer system (e.g., multicomponent diffusion, polymer relaxation), and the ability to quantify molecular interactions between diffusants and polymer. Using this technique is an unexplored area for transport in polymers used in biomedical devices. The outcomes of this research project will provide a fundamental understanding of molecular level transport mechanisms and provide a new body of knowledge in biomedical device science.",
