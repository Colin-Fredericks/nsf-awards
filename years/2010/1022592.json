 "awd_abstract_narration": "United Tribes Native Technicians for the Environment (UT.NT4E) is an NSF-TCUP Initiation grant project that proposes to offer a foundation Environmental Technology AAS degree program along with short-term certification programs using embedded technology and research within coursework. United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) leverages the support of existing regional partnerships and grant programs to provide a cohesive academic STEM program with intensive student support while strengthening UTTC?s STEM faculty knowledge and teaching practices. The project addresses residential expertise needs in the areas of environment, land, natural resources and energy development along with addressing national goals for math, science, and technology skills development among Native American people.\r\nUT.NT4E proposes to educate the whole person employing intensive student support for STEM students.\r\nAndragogical practices will encompass state-of-the-art math, science, and technology instruction and adult learning concepts. Intensive and long-term staff development assures UTTC STEM faculty has access to adult learning principles, content knowledge and teaching practices as well as advanced degree/certification support. UT.NT4E faculty will work hand in hand with STEM students and general education instructors to provide enhanced STEM courses at UTTC. Peer teaching and mentoring are fundamental to this project. Emphasis on research affords the students ample opportunity to actively study issues important to them. The staff development and student support system ensures that UT.NT4E students successfully complete the Environmental Technology or other STEM degrees to either matriculate into a four-year degree programs or to enter the workforce highly-qualified to perform technician skills.\r\nThe UT.NT4E program is evaluated using a multi-dimensional evaluation plan Based on the Phillip?s Model which uses data collected from eight categories to answer key questions regarding the overall accomplishments of the program and suggested strategies for improvements. The categories are student count, student satisfaction, student learning, American Indian Contemporary and Traditional values, experiential learning/internships, Impact on Indian Country, Return on Investment and Intangibles.\r\nUTTC is supported by five federally-recognized Tribes based in North Dakota and has a national reputation for excellence in education by Tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). UT.NT4E utilizes an advisory board composed of TCU administrators, faculty, regional environmental experts, and community members to assist in decision-making processes.\r\nBroad Impacts: This project will increase the numbe",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTribal Nations are facing a myriad of challenges to natural resources and environmental health, yet Native Americans remain underrepresented in STEM fields.  The United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) Native Technicians for the Environment Project has increased STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) educational and research capacity of the college.  The project established several new STEM academic programs, provided professional development training, expanded a comprehensive student support network, and enhanced faculty development opportunities. \n\nThe project resulted in the development of the college?s first Bachelors of Science degree in a STEM field.  The new BS Environmental Science &amp; Research degree (initiated in fall 2016) recognizes that challenges facing the world today are bigger than just one field of Science and that by studying the connections between fields, we can begin to make a more sustainable society.  The programs encourage student retention and degree completion through a comprehensive student support network.  A focus on undergraduate research is integrated in the curriculum, as students complete a full research project during a series of research-intensive courses.  The project also restructured Associate-level STEM degrees to better meet the needs of employers, communities, and students.   Co-curricular training programs focus on developing research skills in emerging fields and communicating science to peers and the general public. \n\nThe project has grown partnerships and research collaborations with natural resource agencies and research universities, improving communication, joint training opportunities, and access to graduate programs for Native American students.  The project recognized three main areas of professional development for faculty members&ndash; research skills, teaching and assessment, and academic preparation.  Advances in each of these areas improve the foundation for student success. \n\nOur programs are assisting Native American students in gaining the knowledge necessary to become environmental technicians and scientists so that they can pursue careers or further education and make important contributions to the nation.  These programs improve the STEM pipeline for underrepresented groups while improving economic and scientific capacity for the region and local tribal communities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/23/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeremy E Guinn"
