 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of a mixture of experienced and young US researchers in a US-Latin American workshop on quantum gravity co-organized by the Jorge Pullin of Louisiana State University and the Latin American Quantum Gravity Network. It will take place in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on July 28-31, 2010. The workshop will be held in conjunction with the Fifth Quantum Gravity in the Southern Cone workshop in Buenos Aires, and a preceding school on quantum gravity will take place in La Plata, Argentina, the week before. Thus, U.S. attendees will be able to participate in those events as well.\r\nThis meeting will allow graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty to interact and to share information about current research on the application of the rules of quantum mechanics, which describe the microscopic world, to the gravitational field. The personal interactions are expected to stimulate relationships and collaborative research activities that will enhance the careers of the participants. Among the objectives of study in this field is to understand what happened shortly after the Big Bang process that created the universe and what takes place inside black holes. \r\nThe award is co-funded by the Physics Division in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
