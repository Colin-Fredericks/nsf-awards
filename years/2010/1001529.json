 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal deals with many of the central questions in Fourier analysis and how they manifest themselves on domains or more generally, Riemannian manifolds with boundary. In the context of the Fourier transform on Euclidean space or the flat torus, topics such as restriction theorems, Strichartz estimates (space-time integrability estimates for wave and Schroedinger equations), and local smoothing inequalities have been subjects of great interest for quite some time. However, many questions remain on how these theories should play out on a bounded or exterior domain. Here it may be appropriate to think of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, and replace restriction theorems for the torus with integrability estimates on clusters of eigenfunctions. In this regard, the PI intends to explore estimates on the restriction of these clusters to curves in the domain. In the case of Strichartz estimates, the PI and his collaborators are using a parametrix-based approach to obtain results for general domains.  Further improvement is expected in certain contexts by making use of a relatively new family of local smoothing estimates.\r\n\r\nFourier analysis continues to be a significant factor in the development of both mathematical and physical theories. In particular, it strengthens our understanding of the partial differential equations that arise in mathematical physics. The research pursued here expects  to have several applications to the study of wave phenomena and the equations which model it. These investigations should yield insight on how the presence of a hard boundary surface influences the development of waves, a subject of great scientific interest.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research pursued here provides the mathematical foundation for the  study of light and sound waves and hence should be of broad interest in  the study of wave propagation, both from mathematical and physical  perspectives.  Indeed, Fourier analysis continues to play a significant  role in deepening our understanding of the equations which model wave  behavior.  In particular, these investigations yield further insight as  to how the presence of a hard boundary surface influences the  development of waves.  For example, if one listens to the symphony in an  auditorium, the sounds heard are affected by the manner in which the  acoustic waves reflect off the walls.  In this sense, it can be  important to understand how the shape of the hall influences its  acoustics.  While this is of course a classical problem, there is more  to be understood in terms of how these interactions influence  dispersive  properties.  Moreover, this line of work is important in the  analysis of closely related nonlinear equations arising from fiber  optics and water waves, where there is much to be done in understanding  and limiting the various types of instabilities which can occur.  Other  lines of research pursued here have close connections to discplines such  as quantum mechanics and quantum chaos, where it is interesting to consider concentration phenomenon of vibrational modes.\n\nThe funded research has also assisted the PI in mentoring graduate and undergraduate students.  During the course of the project, the PI succesfully advised two female graduate students in their thesis work (one Ph.D. student and one Master's student) and one male undergraduate honors thesis.  All three of these students worked on projects inspired by and closely related to the research performed by the PI.  It is also signficant that the PI developed and taught a new graduate topics course during this period that filled in gaps in the graduate curriculum at the University of New Mexico.\n\nThe PI has also been active in both organizing and participating in conferences and parallel sessions at regional meetings of the American Mathematical Society.  Some of these have occurred at the University of New Mexico, which is important for exposing the students and faculty to current mathematical research and also brings added attention the research activity occuring at this institution.  NSF funding has thus been pivotal in disseminating the PI's research and building relationships which have facilitated the success of these events.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew D Blair"
