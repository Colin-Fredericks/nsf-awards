 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an efficacy study through which the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, the Denver Botanic Gardens, and three of Denver's urban school districts join efforts to determine if partnerships among formal and informal organizations demonstrate an appropriate infrastructure for improving science literacy among urban middle school science students. The Metropolitan Denver Urban Advantage (UA Denver) program is used for this purpose. This program consists of three design elements: (a) student-driven investigations, (b) STEM-related content, and (c) alignment of schools and informal science education institutions; and six major components: (a) professional development for teachers, (b) classroom materials and resources, (c) access to science-rich organizations, (d) outreach to families, (e) capacity building and sustainability, and (e) program assessment and student learning. Three research questions guide the study: (1) How does the participation in the program affect students' science knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward science relative to comparison groups of students?  (2) How does the participation in the program affect teachers' science knowledge, skills, and abilities relative to comparison groups of teachers? and (3) How do families' participation in the program affect their engagement in and support for their children's science learning and aspirations relative to comparison families?\r\n\r\nThe study's guiding hypothesis is that the UA Denver program should improve science literacy in urban middle school students measured by (a) students' increased understanding of science, as reflected in their science investigations or \"exit projects\"; (b) teachers' increased understanding of science and their ability to support students in their exit projects, as documented by classroom observations, observations of professional development activities, and surveys; and (c) school groups' and families' increased visits to participating science-based institutions, through surveys. The study employs an experimental research design. Schools are randomly assigned to either intervention or comparison groups and classrooms will be the units of analysis. Power analysis recommended a sample of 18 intervention and 18 comparison middle schools, with approximately 72 seventh grade science teachers, over 5,000 students, and 12,000 individual parents in order to detect differences among intervention and comparison groups. To answer the three research questions, data gathering strategies include: (a) students' standardized test scores from the Colorado Student Assessment Program, (b) students' pre-post science learning assessment using the Northwest Evaluation Association's Measures for Academic Progress (science), (c) students' pre-post science aspirations and goals using the Modified Attitude Toward Science Inventory, (d) teachers' fidelity of implementation using the Teaching Science as Inquiry instrument, and (e) classroom interactions using the Science Teacher Inquiry Rubric, and the Reformed Teaching Observation protocol. To interpret the main three levels of data (students, nested in teachers, nested within schools), hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), including HLM6 application, are utilized. An advisory board, including experts in research methodologies, science, informal science education, assessment, and measurement oversees the progress of the study and provides guidance to the research team. An external evaluator assesses both formative and summative aspects of the evaluation component of the scope of work.\r\n\r\nThe key outcome of the study is a research-informed and field-tested intervention implemented under specific conditions for enhancing middle school science learning and teaching, and supported by partnerships between formal and informal organizations.",

Scores for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years were similar between nonUA and UA schools, even after adjustment for school demographics. It may be that these analyses were not sensitive enough to detect differences, if they did exist, as some schools classified as UA included students who were not in a UA classroom.\n\nUA students expressed greater likelihood of participating in science-related events and activities in the summer and following school year compared to nonUA students.\n\nAmong UA students, greater exposure to UA was correlated with positive outcomes. These outcomes included confidence in ability to perform science investigation-related activities, positive attitude toward science, and pride in the work done in their science class.\n\nGreater exposure to UA was correlated with greater family support for their student pursuing science.\n\nTeachers participating in UA had a more positive attitude toward ISEIs, seeing them as places where science is happening and as good resources for their students? science learning, compared to nonUA teachers. \n\nUA students and their families had greater engagement with the partner ISEIs. Compared to nonUA students, UA students reported a greater number of visits to the ISEIs in 7th grade, taking more field trips, and making visits with family or friends. Visits to the ISEIs were a major component of the UA program, and it was encouraging to see that UA students did report greater frequency of interactions with the ISEIs. UA families reported a greater number of visits to the partner ISEIs than did nonUA families. UA parents were more likely to agree that 7th grade science had a positive impact on their relationship with the partner ISEIs than nonUA parents.\n\nSome outcomes examined did not show any significant differences between UA and nonUA populations nor change over the course of the year. UA teachers did not report a higher frequency of interaction with other teachers nor a greater sense that they were part of a learning community; UA students did not report a significantly higher perception of their ability to do various science investigation-related activities, attitude towards science, considering themselves a scientist, being proud of the work done in science class, completing a science project of which they were proud, and attitude toward the partner ISEIs; UA families did not report greater extents to which they engage in science-related activities, support their student in science, attitude toward partner ISEIs, and perception of impact of 7th grade science on family support for student in science.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis unique partnership between informal science institutions and urban school districts demonstrates a new infrastructure for supporting science teaching and learning. UA Denver?s efforts to improve student science literacy is being achieved by tapping into the resources and expertise of the informal science institutions while simultaneously leveraging the school districts? support systems for curricular integration and student success.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nancy E Walsh"
