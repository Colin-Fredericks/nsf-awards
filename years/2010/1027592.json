It will bring together leaders of diverse national ecology and environmental education organizations and scientific societies, as well as organizations of teachers, technology experts, and the business sector, to disseminate best practices that will advance Environmental Literacy for a Sustainable World, reduce duplication of efforts, and coordinate strategies to build capacity and pathways of support for green careers for the next generation. In this effort, strategies to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities and women into the ecological and environmental agenda are of critical priority. By bringing the best in science, educational practice, and technology development to one event, the Summit aims to accelerate the transformation of teaching and learning among K-20+ audiences in both formal and informal settings in response to the urgent and complex environmental challenges faced today.",

The conference brought together a  diverse set of speakers on the topic to fragmented but interrelated communities that are looking for common direction\nand coordination in purpose. Two keynote speakers and twenty-seven panelists on six panels included educators, scientists, media, technology experts, health professionals, architects and planners, community and religious representatives.\n\nFive themes launched the conversations during the Summit:\n\n1) Learning about Complexity and Change: Foundations for Environmental Literacy\n\n2) Turning the Tide: Building a Green Society through Learning and Doing\n\n3) Seeing our World Inside and Out: Harnessing Technology for Environmental Literacy\n\n4) Best Practices for Effective Teaching and Learning\n\n5) Environmental Literacy for All\n\nThe major outcome of the Summit was the arrival at a common purpose in engaging diverse disciplines, sectors and audiences towards achieving an environmentally literate society, captured in the Decadal Action Plan for Environmental Literacy. The Action Plan identified 12 action items on which all communities interested in the health of society and ecosystems can focus their efforts.\n\nIn addressing complexity and change, there was clear recognition that a framework of environmental literacy integrating both the science content and social dimensions was paramount.  As a result, scientists, as well as social  and behavioral experts and practitioners have come together to map out a process for creating an integrated framework for environmental literacy building upon the existing earth system science literacy frameworks.\n\nThe Summit affirmed the Green Schools Movement and supported the effort to work with the US Department of Education (DOE) on a comprehensive framework for Green Schools that included the greening of facilities as well as curriculum and extra-curricular activities.  This effort has already seen results in the Green Ribbon Schools program launched by DOE which lays out clear comprehensive criteria.\n\nThe Action Plan also called for positioning Green Schools as the hubs of their communities within an overall strategy to turn the tide toward the building of sustainable communities. Schools have a special role to play in engaging the community and in promoting both learning and doing. Nurturing community leaders was regarded as high priority for sustainability.\n\nParticipatory technology and simulated games are uniquely set up to reach millions of the digital generation whether through Citizen Science, personalized health monitoring or video games.

The Summit sounded the call to develop new processes for mutually beneficial partnerships that are focused on high priority societal needs such as jobs, crime, health, education, equal opportunity, and social justice. This is a critical step if environmental literacy is to go beyond a self-selected few to include many underrepresented audiences.\n\nIn coming together at the Summit, participants provided input to an Action Plan that strives to, over the course of 10 years, radically alter the trajectory of 1) how environmental literacy will be perceived, ..."
