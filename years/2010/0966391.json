 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides annual scholarships of $10,000 to academically talented, financially needy students pursuing a Master's of Science degree in a newly created concentration in Biomedical Statistical Informatics, or to underrepresented students in financial distress who are seeking general admission to the bioinformatics and medical informatics (BMI) graduate program. The scholarships are renewable for a second year. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of the project lies in the enhanced experience for graduate students in the first years of their studies, allowing more time and more support to master the crucial skills which are essential for research in the informatics field. The project also initiates a statistics track; an area that has been in demand because of recent developments. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is that it reduces attrition and provides more opportunities for underrepresented and financially disadvantaged students. San Diego State University (SDSU) ranks eighth in the nation and fourth in California for bachelor's degrees awarded to Hispanics. The BMI program has no Hispanic students. A portion of the funds from this project is used as scholarships specifically for Hispanic students in order to increase the Hispanic student population within the major.",

The program is relatively new, accepting eight students as its first cohort in Fall 2008.</p>\n<p>The NSF award (0966391) titled &ldquo;Bioinformatics Statistical Informatics Track&rdquo; provided funding for graduate students in the program for up to four semesters, and up to $5,000 per semester. The funding was provided to the students from 2011 through 2016. Although, the final numbers, especially those related to tracking graduates&rsquo; career requires further study, the impact of the funding on the program, its cohort complexion, and its graduate&rsquo;s success is clearly notable.</p>\n<p>The enrollment of the program has grown over the six years of the funding from ten to over 50 graduate students, making the program the third largest graduate program, and the second largest master&rsquo;s program in the College of Sciences. Figure 1 displays the steady increase of applicants through the years of the funding with the exception of 2013 where a state-wide decline in number of applicants in all computing fields was observed. Although we do not have exact figures from the university registrar&rsquo;s office for 2015 and 2016, the two years also show the continuation of the steady increase.</p>\n<p>The quality of the incoming students has also notably increased due to this funding (please see the Figure 2). Average total GRE score (Q + V) has increased from 306 to 327 when this score was fairly steady between the years prior to the funding from 2008 to 2010. Average GPA score displays a similar trend going from 3.15 to 3.41. This average was fairly steady around 3.05 prior to 2011.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although more detailed analysis required, Figure 3 shows a steady increase in nonresident student counts at the program between 2012 and 2014 indicating that the program is gaining national recognition. We believe that this trend has continued since then.</p>\n<p>Although, graduate tracking is incomplete and requires a detailed investigation, students have done increasingly well in terms of after graduation placement, better than most other programs at SDSU and similar programs nationally. Figure 4 shows graduates&rsquo; placement after graduation. The majority have been placed in local industry. The horizontal access represents the year the student was admitted into the program. Typically, graduation date is between two to three years after this date. The data for 2012 is incomplete, but those for prior rates are accurate. While further data needs to be gathered for the more recent years, the placement seem to be favoring industry as the recognition for the graduates of the program increases. This is an indication that the program is meeting the needs of the industry and contributing to economic growth.</p>\n<p>Overall, the program has had a significant impact in improving the quality of the program and attracting high caliber students to the program.
