 "awd_abstract_narration": "RNA viruses have high rates of mutation and so typically have high genetic variation and high capacity to evolve rapidly in response to host defenses. The evolutionary genetics of RNA viruses are important because the group includes significant pathogens of many plants and animals, including humans, domestic animals, and crop plants. This project will study populations of the Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus, an RNA virus that is an important pathogen of squashes, melons, and cucumbers, and will determine the influence of mode of transmission from host to host and growth within a host on the evolutionary genetics of the virus using modern gene sequencing technologies. \r\n\r\n\tThis project will document genetic diversity of an important crop pathogen and will illuminate the general question of how the dynamics of population growth within hosts and during transmission from one host to another influence genetic diversity of populations of an RNA virus. Results will inform management strategies for a group of pathogens that cause extensive agricultural losses. The project also provides research-based training opportunities for undergraduates.",

Consequently, infected leaves of plants can harbor millions of viruses that are genetically variable. The combination of massive population size and abundant genetic diversity are thought to allow viruses to adapt swiftly to changing environments, evade host resistance mechanisms and emerge as diseases in new host species. The amount and extent of diversity within a viral population are thought to be strongly influenced by how the virus is transmitted between hosts (i.e. transmitted by an insect, through seeds, or mechanically). However, the population size and diversity of viruses is also constricted at three points during the viral lifecycle: as the virus is transmitted from plant to plant by the insect vector, as the virus moves from cell-to-cell and leaf-to-leaf throughout the plant, and as the virus enters the seed to be transmitted to the next generation. However the relationship between these constrictions and genetic diversity of the virus is not well characterized. Therefore to gain a deeper understanding of how transmission affects viral genetic diversity we performed Illumina sequencing of an RNA virus, zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), in one of its host species (wild squash). With this next generation sequencing technique it is possible to<br />sequence every position of the viral genome thousands of times, enabling the<br />full extent of viral genetic diversity within a single leaf to be uncovered.

In total, we sampled the ZYMV viral population from 25 leaves. We found that mutations persist during aphid transmission suggesting that the transmission event does not restrict viral genetic diversity as much as had been previously supposed. Similarly mutations were found to persist within individual hosts which suggests that the movement of the virus within the plant is not as hindered as was previously thought. We also found mutations that increased in frequency in the populations that were transmitted by insects yet remained at low levels in the populations that were mechanically transmitted suggesting that mutations found in the aphid vectored populations might be advantageous to the virus in the field. That is, natural selection seems to be favoring some mutations. As a result of this study we now posses a deeper understanding of how transmission shapes the genetic diversity of viral populations that, in turn, can be used to develop strategies to prevent the spread of this economically important crop pathogen of cucumbers, melons, and squash.
