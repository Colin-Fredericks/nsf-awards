An important goal is to\r\neffectively merge the various approaches, and develop new ways of\r\nthinking about multi-scale problems. To this end, this project focuses\r\non investigating five interdisciplinary problems, using ideas from\r\nfunctional analysis, geometry, topology, matched asymptotics and\r\nscaling arguments, in conjunction with numerical simulations. These\r\nproblems are (1) Generalized crumpling: Combining functional analytic\r\nmethods with geometric/topological ideas to study singularities and\r\nmicrostructure; (2) Blowup in Parabolic PDEs: Applying Morse theory to\r\nthe dynamics of blowup solutions; (3) Dynamics of microstructure:\r\nStudying global bifurcations involving the change of microstructure in\r\na model system; (4) Pattern formation and non-equilibrium phase\r\ntransitions: Investigating multiple scale behaviors in nonlinear\r\nsystems in the presence of noise; and (5) Topological transitions in\r\nfluid interfaces: Using tools from PDE to investigate topological\r\ntransitions in 2 fluid systems.\r\n\r\nMany real world systems are interesting precisely because they exhibit\r\ndifferent behaviors on different scales. This is certainly true for\r\nliving organisms, geological and geophysical systems, technologically\r\nimportant composite materials and even social structures and\r\nhierarchies. Thus researchers across many disciplines grapple with the\r\nfollowing two questions, which are the essence of multiple scale\r\nanalysis: (1) How does the large scale (macroscopic) behavior emerge\r\nout of the collective behavior of the small scale (microscopic)\r\nunits?, and (2) What are the rules governing the large scale behavior,\r\nand how does this influence the behavior of the small scale units? The\r\nresearch component of this project studies these questions in a\r\nmathematical setting through problems that arise in material science\r\nand in physics. The overall goal is to meld together a variety of\r\ntechniques to develop tools that can successfully handle complex\r\nreal-world multiple scale problems. This is combined with an\r\nintegrated approach to pedagogy, that features a strong involvement in\r\nundergraduate and graduate research, development of research\r\nopportunities for groups that are under-represented in mathematics and\r\nthe physical sciences, curriculum development both at the graduate and\r\nthe undergraduate level, and development of materials for scientific\r\noutreach to the general public.\r\n\r\nDate: December 17, 2001\r\n",
