 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Conference proposal for support of an ACS Symposium on \"Advances in\r\nPolymer Brushes\" to be held as part of the national ACS Meeting in August 2005.\r\n\r\nThis is a very active area of research, which is closely tied in to nanoscience. Brushes\r\n(i.e. closely spaced polymer molecules tethered on surfaces) are of great interest for\r\napplications in microfluidics, tailoring of surface properties, and even as \"chemical\r\ngates\". The PI is one of the world's leaders in that area, and the list of invited speakers\r\nis really a \"who's who\" of top practitioners in the field.\r\n\r\nThis list of speakers also has very good diversity in terms of people, institutions, topical\r\nareas, and international presence. US participants will undoubtedly benefit greatly from\r\nthis Symposium. Funds are requested specifically to defray costs of participants in the\r\nearly stages of their careers or new to the field of polymer brushes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Polymers Program is convinced that this would be a very beneficial\r\nopportunity in terms of both intellectual merit and broader impacts. We recommend\r\nfunding the $3000 requested.",
