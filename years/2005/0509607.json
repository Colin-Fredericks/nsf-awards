 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators are organizing the Midwest Algebra, Geometry and\r\ntheir Interactions Conference (MAGIC05) at the University of Notre Dame\r\nduring the period October 8-11, 2005. The meeting will highlight and showcase the recent work done in the areas of Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra but it will also focus on their applications in and interactions with neighboring fields. Particular attention will be paid to bringing together groups, namely geometers, algebraists and applied mathematicians, who normally do not interact in conferences, and in this way generate new collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe conference will be organized in a series of plenary lectures and\r\nsome shorter talks organized in parallel sessions. Among the topics\r\nthat will be discussed by top experts at the conference, at a level\r\naccessible to an audience of graduate studens, we list: algebraic\r\ncombinatorics, cryptography and coding theory, liaison theory, Hilbert\r\nfunctions, Hilbert schemes, homological methods, numerical methods,\r\nRees algebras, resolutions of singularities, singularity theory,\r\ntight closure, and vector bundles.\r\n\r\nWe will strive to provide an opportunity for graduate students and researchers in postdoctoral positions to be exposed to the best recent work in these areas, and to become acquainted with the top experts as well as with their peers.\r\n\r\nWe remark that in order to promote Mathematics among the diverse population of Notre Dame students as well as among the non-academic community, the conference will be enhanced by a public lecture on the importance and ubiquity of Mathematics in everyday life. The lecture will be delivered by Professor Bernd Sturmfels.\r\n",
