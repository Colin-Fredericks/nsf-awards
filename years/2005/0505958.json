 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the completion of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence in 2000,\r\nArabidopsis researchers established the Multinational Coordinated Arabidopsis thaliana Functional Genomics Project. The goal of the Project is to identify the function of all Arabidopsis genes by the year 2010. The Project is coordinated by the MASC (the Multinational Arabidopsis Steering Committee). Members of the MASC are volunteer scientists representing various nations with active Arabidopsis functional research activities. The MASC is responsible for coordinating Arabidopsis functional genomics research activities taking place throughout the world and for ensuring a high level of international cooperation. \r\n\r\nSince 2002 a fulltime coordinator has been employed to assist the MASC accomplish its goals and objectives. This award provides support for continuing the coordinator position for two additional years. The Chair of the North American Arabidopsis Steering Committee is responsible for providing oversight and supervision to the coordinator on behalf of the MASC. The specific duties of the coordinator include:\r\n(1) Serve as the executive secretary for the Multinational Arabidopsis Steering\r\nCommittee (2) Together with TAIR (the Arabidopsis Information Resource), maintain,\r\nexpand and update the web site to inform the research community about various large-scale genomic activities (e.g., full length cDNA projects, knockout mutants, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, systems biology approaches, etc.), (3) Help organize the annual Arabidopsis research conference, especially in increasing participation of students and young scientists from groups traditionally under-represented and under-served at the annual conference, (4) Serve as production editor for the annual progress report and other documents that the MASC produces, (5) Participate in the outreach and education activities conducted by TAIR, and (6) Act as a contact point between the MASC, and the research community.\r\n\r\nThe Multinational Coordinated Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Project has been a model of international research collaboration, characterized by open sharing of information, data and research materials. The MASC has played a key role in the success of the Project. This award is expected to contribute to the continued success of the Project, which will be ultimately measured by the community reaching the goal of identifying the function of all Arabidopsis genes by the year 2010.   \r\n",
