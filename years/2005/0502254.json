 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study several questions\r\nin representation theory, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics which are related to \r\nnilpotent orbits in Lie algebras.\r\nMore specifically, \r\nthe investigator will continue his work on ideals in the poset of positive roots\r\nand their connection to representation theory and the theory of cluster algebras.\r\nHe will also continue to study the Lusztig-Vogan bijection and to seek out its explicit computation.  \r\nHe will try to complete the \r\ndetermination of which nilpotent orbits in the exceptional Lie algebras \r\nhave normal closure and prove results (in all Lie algebras) \r\nabout the structure of\r\nfunctions on covers of nilpotent orbits that rely on similar techniques.\r\n\r\nRepresentation theory is a branch of modern algebra that is concerned\r\nwith understanding symmetries.  \r\nA central idea is that complicated algebraic or geometric structures can be\r\nrepresented by a certain set of matrices (arrays of numbers),\r\n which are easier to understand than the original structure.  For example, the\r\nsymmetries of the square can be represented (in one possible way) \r\nby a certain set of eight two-by-two matrices.  \r\nThis view of representation theory has many applications in \r\nchemistry and physics.  The investigator's work will contribute to\r\nunderstanding the representation theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups, which \r\nare essential to understanding the symmetry of objects which arise in mathematics.\r\n\r\n",
