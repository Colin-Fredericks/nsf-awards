 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional cellular wireless networks have limited capacity because of the scarcity of available spectrum and inefficient spectrum reuse.  To overcome these limitations new regulatory policies are being considered to allow segments of spectrum to be dynamically shared.  This project uses dynamically allocated spectrum to form multi-hop relay networks consisting of mobile nodes that forward data to base stations on behalf of each other to increase network capacity.  In this work we address two challenges: (1) rapid dynamic network formation and (2) verifying and accounting for which part of the spectrum is used by which nodes.  The first problem is important because it is likely that many (tens or hundreds) of nodes may attempt to join a relay network, resulting in high overhead and network formation latency.  The second problem is important for motivating users to participate and compensating service providers for sharing spectrum.  Algorithms for scheduling and network formation are being designed and evaluated in this work.  These algorithms provide low latency and overhead, and include provisions for verifying which nodes participate in the relay network.  The presence of base stations is also leveraged to quickly disseminate information to assist in relay network formation.",
