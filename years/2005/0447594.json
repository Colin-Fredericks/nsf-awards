Unfortunately numerous accounts of failures cite the root cause as problems related to the incorrect implementation of non-functional qualities such as safety, security, or reliability.  The objective of this research is to develop a new technique known as Goal-Centric Traceability (GCT) that will provide effective support for managing systemic qualities. GCT is designed to prevent systemwide non-functional qualities from being adversely impacted during the change process and to ensure the long-term quality of the system.  The work will involve developing dynamic traceability techniques between functional and non-functional requirements using probabilistic and constraint-based methods. Heuristics and supporting methods will be defined for identifying the transitive impact of a change upon systemic goals and for automating the re-evaluation of existing assessment models such as performance simulations and executable scenarios.  A standard interface for interfacing GCT with popular architectural assessment tools will be developed. The work has potential for significant impact as it addresses a complex yet practical problem commonly experienced in industry.\r\n",
