 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Glial Biology: Functional Interactions Among Glia & Neurons Gordon Conference will be held March 13-18, 2005, Ventura, California. This GRC conference will focus on the multidisciplinary complexity of glial biology in terms of glial-neuron and glia-glia interactions. This conference will bring together a limited number (maximum of 135) of leading investigators plus students and postdoctoral fellows working on glial biology and cell-cell interactions from a variety of perspectives. Informal interactions in the tradition of the Gordon Research Conferences will emphasize incisive discussions among senior and junior conferees with the overall goal of broadening the direct knowledge and collaborative interactions of specialized researchers working in emerging, cutting-edge areas of glial-glial and neuronal-glial interactions. \r\n\r\nThere are three major objectives of this conference; the first two are related to its intellectual merit, whereas the third addresses its anticipated broad impact on neuroscience research and science education. (1) Initiation of a continuing interactive dialogue among scientists in different fields of glial biology, glia-neuron, and glia-glia interactions by providing a long-term forum for presentation and discussion of cutting-edge work in selected fields to a diverse group of leading researchers. (2) Suggest new integrative approaches to solve timely problems, identify controversial issues that need new approaches to be resolved, and foster collaborative projects in multi-disciplinary research. (3) Bring to the attention of the neuroscience community the importance of the glial cells and their interactions with other cell types in normal brain functions, and in modeling interactions of these cell types in functional systems of neuronal activity. Regular, incisive discussions of cutting-edge research in glial biology involving glial-glial and glial-neuronal interactions will impact on both research and education by enhancing knowledge and by broadening the direct interactions of researchers in this field. Because many sub-fields are currently sequestered in larger meetings of national societies, this Gordon Conference can be expected to help construct a new network among researchers who currently do not regularly (if at all) communicate and serve to enhance their infrastructure.\r\n\r\n",
