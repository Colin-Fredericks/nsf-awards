The research aims to increase spectrum utilization significantly for both military and commercial applications. Students develop software defined radio frequency transmitters and receivers, develop and integrated test bed, and conduct research using the test bed. The project involves collaboration between the host institution and Jackson State University, with half the students and one mentor coming from Jackson State. Undergraduate students participate in a ten-week summer research program at the host institution.  The project includes mentorship by experienced computer science faculty members, weekly presentations and seminars, laboratory visits and other professional development opportunities.\r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The projects are in major current research areas that are of interest to the community at large and that have clear practical applications. The research related to dynamic spectrum access techniques may significantly improve the spectrum utilization for future wireless networks.\r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups. The project develops strong collaborative ties between the host institution and Jackson State University that will enable the students to continue their research and professional growth after the summer experience.  Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning. \r\n",
