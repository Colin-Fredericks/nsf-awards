 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for: \r\nModel-Based Simulation of Wind Turbine Inflow Turbulence and Design Loads: An Integrative Plan\r\nfor Research and Learning, CMS  0449128\r\n\r\nPI: Lance Manuel, University of Texas, Austin\r\n\r\nAn understanding of the spatial structure of the three-dimensional inflow wind velocity field is important\r\nfor the safe design of wind turbines. Current attempts at characterizing this inflow turbulence in design\r\nguidelines are overly conservative and have not been developed following field studies of turbine\r\nperformance and simultaneous recording of associated wind conditions (because such tests are expensive).\r\nAlso, today's guidelines recommend design loads based on inflow coherence spectral models that have\r\nbeen shown to be inconsistent with measurements, especially for spatial separations on the order of rotor\r\ndiameters and smaller. Moreover, the design guidelines do not employ turbine aerodynamic and structural\r\ndynamic response simulations of sufficiently long durations to match the desired return periods (on the\r\norder of 20 years) typical for ultimate and fatigue limit states. Clearly, there is a need for more field test\r\nprograms and efficient modeling procedures to accurately describe the inflow and turbine response so as to\r\narrive at more accurate design loads.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed career development plan addresses each of the issues raised. First, it offers a novel untried\r\napproach to characterizing the inflow turbulence random field by extracting spatially preferred \"modes\"\r\nthat describe the inflow using empirical orthogonal decomposition of wind velocity statistics and spectra\r\nderived directly from newly available field measurements. Second, it offers an efficient procedure to make\r\nmore realistic the possibility of carrying out long-duration aerodynamic simulations for turbine response\r\nwhile utilizing the decomposition of the inflow structure. Finally, it proposes a framework, based on\r\nstructural reliability and response surface concepts, for deriving design loads by combining inflow\r\ncharacterization with turbine response statistics conditional on inflow.\r\nThe proposed plan blends the use of extensive field data with simulation studies in addressing an\r\nimportant problem that could lead to more economical wind turbine designs and sustain the continued\r\nharvesting of wind as a renewable energy source.\r\nTo summarize, at the heart of the proposed research plan are, in order, the following tasks:\r\n(i) development of efficient modeling techniques for characterizing the random spatial structure of\r\nwind inflow using field data - this will yield principal orthogonal preferred spatial \"modes\" that\r\noptimally describe the wind field;\r\n(ii) characterizing turbine response for the preferred spatial turbulence modes identified in (i) using\r\nturbine aerodynamic simulations; and\r\n(iii) establishing a probabilistic (structural reliability-based) framework that integrates (i) and (ii) to\r\npermit derivation of design ultimate and fatigue loads using simulations long enough to\r\nrealistically reflect return periods on the order of 20 years.\r\nResearch, education, and outreach activities that relate to this plan are outlined in this proposal.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nAn important point that needs to be made is that despite the tremendous growth in wind energy in the U.S.,\r\nour nation is seriously short of trained engineers in this field and routinely has to seek technical/consulting\r\nassistance from Western Europe. This needs to change, and this career development plan will present some\r\nideas the PI has to provide such training opportunities to our undergraduate and graduate students including\r\ninternship opportunities that will be facilitated by this plan, K-12 involvement, and curriculum\r\nenhancements that the PI has planned. This research study will, it is expected, offer a learning experience\r\nas well for individuals of various backgrounds: graduate and undergraduate research assistants, middle/high\r\nstudents and teachers, and university students in the PI's undergraduate engineering statistics course and in\r\na planned graduate wind engineering course. Details related to these activities are outlined in this proposal.\r\nTwo significant entities that have expressed their support for the success of this plan include\r\n(a) Sandia National Laboratories, who will provide the field data for the efforts outlined and will also\r\nprovide summer research internship positions to five undergraduate minority students; and\r\n(b) the PI's institution's Equal Opportunity in Engineering (EOE) program, who will facilitate the\r\ninvolvement of an underrepresented/minority student in this research.\r\nLetters of commitment from both these organizations are included in the \"Supplementary Documents\"\r\nsection of this proposal outlining their support.\r\n",
