These measures of\r\ndependence take the form of signal divided by noise. They are used to\r\nselect the subset of covariates to include in the model, and to choose\r\ntuning parameters. The signal measures the strength of the dependence of Y\r\non a set of covariates. The noise is a standard error, that is, an\r\nestimate of the standard deviation of the estimated signal. It will be\r\nsmall when too many variables are included in the model and when the\r\ntuning parameter sacrifices precision for smaller bias. Choosing variables\r\nand tuning parameters that minimize signal to noise leads to procedures\r\nthat converge at the traditional root-n rate. The investigators use\r\nasymptotic and Monte Carlo methods to investigate the properties of such\r\nprocedures. They also relate them to traditional model and tuning\r\nparameter selection procedures and compare traditional procedures with the\r\nsignal to noise approach.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last few years have seen the establishment of large databases'\r\ncontaining a large number of variables that are to be related and\r\ncompared. A good example is the data produced by the human genome project\r\nwhere a great number of genes need to be considered as possible\r\ncontributers to a certain disease. Dealing with a large number of\r\nvariables is difficult because many of them will contribute variability\r\n(noise) that may drown out potential interesting relationships (signals).\r\nThe investigators approach this problem by using general flexible model\r\nequations to represent important relationships between variables. Then\r\nvariables and aspects of the equations are selected to minimize the ratio\r\nof signal to noise. This procedure automatically weeds out the variables\r\nthat contribute mostly noise and selects an equation that emphasizes the\r\nsignals present in the data.\r\n",
