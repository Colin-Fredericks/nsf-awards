 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to develop high efficiency, stable solar cells on plastic substrates using nanocrystalline Si and its alloy materials. The approach is to use a novel device design to increase the performance of solar cells. The nanocrystalline Si and its alloy materials will be deposited using a low ion energy plasma process with controlled hydrogen dilution which can result in films with larger grain size and better photovoltaic devices. The novel device design will allow for more light collection by combining amorphous and crystalline devices in one cell structure. Graded interfaces will be used to optimize device performance. A systematic study of material properties as a function of plasma parameters, grain size and hydrogen dilution will be undertaken so as to optimize device performance. Significant research interaction with a company, Iowa Thin Film Technologies, is planned so as to be able to utilize the expertise of the company in depositing solar cells on plastic substrates and in optical enhancement technology.\r\n\r\nThe project will result in a significant enhancement of the technology for producing low cost solar cells on plastic substrates. Increasing the performance and stability of the solar cell will likely result in lowering the cost of solar energy conversion and in reducing global warming.  The educational impact of the project is also significant, with a strong involvement of both undergraduate and graduate students in the project, including mentoring of minority students. \r\n",
