The grant, originally written as a five year program (2005-2010) was extended an additional year, officially closing in July 2011.\n\nTMCC is a tribal college that is one of nine tribal institutions that provides Native American college students an opportunity to earn a Bachelor\u00c6s degree in education while remaining on their home reservation.  High school science\nteachers are in critical shortage in ND and nationally.  In some instances, students on reservations have completed their entire high school science education via correspondence.  The Native Ways of Knowing project has been successful in training and placing science teachers on three ND reservations (Ft. Berthold, Ft. Totten, and Turtle Mountain).  Further, the future for secondary science teacher education looks promising for TMCC as there are students who are in student teaching (n=5) and in coursework (n=3) after the closing of the grant.\n\nThe development of the Native Ways project required purposeful engagement with local secondary school administrators and faculty in order to assure that the needs of the community were being addressed in the training of secondary science teachers.  Consequently, research into the integration\nof a culturally responsive philosophy of instruction was carried out and\nimplemented in the NWOK curriculum.   Graduates from the NWOK program are highly qualified to teach four subject areas:  Chemistry, Physics,\nBiology, and Earth Science.  The license conferred by the North Dakota Standards and Practices Board covers grades 7-12 in these core disciplines.\n\nThroughout the history of the NWOK grant students were encouraged and supported in undergraduate research opportunities that spanned the following subject areas:  Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates\n(REU) in neuroscience-research at the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks; Water Quality Management inquiry at Wolf Creek, MT, in cooperation with Ft. Peck Community College; Radon research (testing homes on the Turtle Mountain Reservation) funded by NASA; Turtle Mountain Reservation  leech survey and study of leech abnormal eye patterns under the direction of TMCC biologist Dr. Deborah Hunter; NASA Summer REU in Geospatial Technology and Climate Change; Genetics and Pre-eclampsia study\nfunded by NIH IDeA Network of Biomedical Research directed by Dr. Lyle Best.  While not a complete list, these examples describe the diversity of research opportunities offered to Native American students at Turtle Mountain Community College.\n\nIn each of these research labs, secondary science students have been introduced to the realm of scientific inquiry and discovery through the active mentorship of an experienced science researcher.  Relevant data describing the impact of student research upon ultimate student success in degree attainment at TMCC are as follows:  17 students participated in undergraduate research projects while supported by NWOK.  Of those 17 students, 11 have gone on to graduate with their Bachelor\u00c6s degree in secondary science teacher education (one degree conferred posthumously), four more will receive their BS degree in December 2011.  These data translate to an 88% completion rate for students involved in undergraduate research.\n\nThere are 11 mainstream institutions of higher education within the North Dakota University System.  North Dakota is also home to five tribal\ncolleges (Turtle Mountain Community College, Ft. Berthold Community College, Candeska Cikana Community College, United Tribes Technical College, and Sitting Bull College).  During the tenure of this grant TMCC has graduated more secondary science composite degree earners than\nany other institution of higher education in North Dakota (n=10).  In many cases graduates of the Native Wa..."
