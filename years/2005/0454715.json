 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will develop, test, refine and evaluate an intelligent, interactive, multimedia system.  This intelligent tutoring system will provide high school biology students a virtual, hands-on, multimedia learning environment.  Specifically, this project is designed to:  1) Develop an innovative curricular approach for scientific literacy in biology that is driven by national standards. The curriculum is based on the three pillars of scientific understanding to increase student learning regarding:  (a) knowledge acquisition of content, concepts and principles relevant to genetics, forensic science and the biology of evolution; (b) relevant scientific process skills and knowledge; and (c) knowledge of nature and methods of science.  2) Develop an intelligent tutoring system that has the capacity to (a) create authentic multimedia scenarios for self-directed, hands-on learning, (b) monitor a student's performance and modify pedagogical strategies based on a dynamic assessment of the learner and (c) provide adaptability to bridge interactions between teacher and learner understandings.  3) Create an exportable Project Development Model that includes design and development processes, stakeholder inputs, formative assessments and feedback loops.   4) Disseminate achievement of the above goals to science and educational communities.",
