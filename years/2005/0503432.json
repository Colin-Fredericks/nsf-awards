 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nGriesemer\r\n\r\nThe focus is on two projects. Both of them concern the effect\r\nof quantized low-energy (infrared) radiation on the dynamics of\r\natoms and molecules. The first project studies the behavior of\r\natoms and molecules that are initially in their ground state and\r\nsubject to an external electromagnetic field. Then, in a time\r\ninterval of length T this external field is slowly changed in a\r\ngiven and fixed manner; slowly meaning that T is very large on the\r\ntime scale of the atom or molecule. The goal is to understand why,\r\nin an experiment, the system would stay close to its instantaneous\r\nground state at all times. The main mathematical problem in\r\nproving this within non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics is to\r\nshow that the ground state eigenvector and its energy are smooth\r\nfunctions of the external field configuration, even though the\r\nground state energy is embedded in the continuous spectrum. To\r\nanalyze this problem the renormalization group analysis of Bach,\r\nFroehlich, and Sigal is simplified and adjusted to the problem at\r\nhand. The second project concerns the phenomenon of relaxation to\r\nthe ground state of excited atoms and molecules. Under the\r\nassumption of an infrared cutoff this problem has recently been\r\ncompletely analyzed by the PI and his collaborators. The goal now\r\nis to remove the un-physical assumption of an IR cutoff and to\r\nshow that no infrared problem occurs, that is, that only finitely\r\nmany photons are emitted.\r\n\r\nThis is a project devoted to the mathematical analysis of\r\ndynamical aspects of light (photons) interacting with atoms and\r\nmolecules. It is motivated by fundamental mathematical and\r\nphysical problems, the physics problems stemming from every day\r\nphenomena and from low energy laboratory experiments (neon lamp,\r\nquantum chemistry, laser light etc). More specifically, the\r\nproposed research contributes to a rigorous mathematical\r\nunderstanding of basic physical phenomena, such as the existence\r\nof ''adiabatic limits'' and the relaxation to the ground state of\r\nexcited atoms and molecules. The existence of adiabatic limits is\r\nof fundamental importance for our understanding of chemistry,\r\nsince much of theoretical chemistry assumes good accuracy of an\r\napproximative theory, called Born-Oppenheimer approximation, whose\r\njustification requires existence an adiabatic limit. The\r\nrelaxation to the ground state of an excited atom is an example\r\nwhere dissipation of energy in an open quantum system can be\r\nderived from first principles. It is also one of the main effects\r\nresponsible for the production of all visible light. This project\r\nwill deepen our understanding of the physics of atoms and\r\nmolecules and produce new mathematical tools that will likely find\r\napplications elsewhere.",
