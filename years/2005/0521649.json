 "awd_abstract_narration": "0521649\r\nRocca\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop a new generation of compact coherent Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray light sources that will generate higher powers and reach shorter wavelengths than previously possible.  Two different type of sources with complementary characteristics will be developed based on the techniques of amplified spontaneous emission in a highly ionized plasma column  and high harmonic generation. The goals include the generation of high average power coherent light in the 100 eV photon energy region that is of interest for technology, and in the  300-400 eV region of the spectrum that is of great interest for biological science. The proposed instrument development will also attempt extending high harmonic sources to the kilo-electron volt (l<1 nm) spectral region. These sources will make it possible to implement EUV science and industrial metrology on a tabletop, with spatially-coherent light previously available only by using undulators at large synchrotron facilities. The increased capabilities of the new sources is expected open up a variety of new areas of investigation in surface, chemical and material dynamics studies, biological studies, dense plasma diagnostics, EUV non-linear optics, and the development of a new of metrology tools and  nanoprobes for industry.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed EUV source development project will have important broad impacts on science and technology, on workforce development and diversity efforts. First, it will provide >50 graduate, undergraduate, post-doctoral students, and faculty enhanced opportunities to work at the frontiers of science and engineering, -developing and applying forefront EUV sources in a broad range of disciplines (including engineering, physics, biology and materials science). Second, it will train students in two areas of technology that are important for industry in the 21st century - high power lasers and EUV sources. Third, it will enhance workforce diversity through active collaborations with minority and women-serving institutions, including Spelman College and Morehouse College. This development project will also accelerate applications of EUV light in science and technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. \r\n\r\n",
