 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of the investigator is the study of\r\nalgebraic structures--a ring, an ideal or even a module--as they\r\nundergo smoothing processes. These transformations   enable them to\r\nsupport new constructions,  including analytic ones. In the case\r\nof algebras,  divisors acquire a group structure,  cohomology tends to slim down, and  \r\nit is an essential step in the desingularization of singular\r\nvarieties. There is an inherent  interest  in those processes that add to the\r\nstructure the solutions of collections of equations of integral\r\ndependence. Finding these equations, determining the\r\nproperties  of the assemblage of solutions and understanding the\r\ncomplexity costs of these tasks, is a central  region of \r\n research for commutative algebra.  Bringing into this mix the  numerical \r\n controls provided by  multiplicity theory--broadly seen as the\r\n assignment of measures of size to an structure--make for a technically challenging and \r\npotentially very rewarding activity smack right where the field interacts\r\nmostly intensively with algebraic geometry and computational algebra. \r\nThe investigator  introduces   an approach to the study of theoretical aspects of\r\n certain classes of algebraic structures from the perspective\r\n of complexity. As applications, the investigator  seeks to predict how\r\n delicate techniques  associated to smoothing processes will perform\r\n when  applied to the solution of several problems of interest,\r\nand thereby suggest which mix of methods offer higher performance.\r\n They will  also be employed  to derive ordinary complexity counts for several\r\nof these problems without previously known classical counts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommutative algebra is foremost the study of sytems of polynomial \r\nequations, and of its generalizations. It has elucidated several\r\nstructures that occur among such systems, particularly those tagged as\r\nof Cohen-Macaulay type. These encode incredible theoretical efficiencies in the\r\nderivation/prediction of its properties and offer superb computational\r\neconomies. Often the full natural set of equations is not known at\r\nthe outset so that methods and processes must be developed to find  and analyze it.\r\nThis proposal is focused on one central process, that of smoothing transformation. \r\n It will  develop methods, grounded on the Cohen-Macaulay case, to predict properties of\r\nthe `closure', devise algorithms to find it and examine the limits of\r\nthe behavior of arbitrary [even unknown] algorithms.\r\nThe methods and results used in these developments will be used for\r\ninteraction  where the subject meets algebraic geometry, combinatorics, geometric modelling,  number theory and robotics.",
