 "awd_abstract_narration": "0510830\r\nIntellectual Merit: Extensive sediment transport research has been accomplished primarily in\r\nsteady flow, although significant amounts of sediment movement occur in unsteady flow.\r\nDespite some early attempts, sediment transport in unsteady flow remains an open research\r\nquestion in hydrologic sciences, mainly due to the inherent mathematical complexities in the\r\nfully coupled flow and sediment equations, and the technical difficulties encountered in\r\nexperimental measurements. Availability of a more sophisticated mathematical approach (Tsai\r\n2002, 2003, 2005 and Tsai and Yen 2001, 2003; Tsai and Kuai 2004 a,b; Kuai et al. 2004)\r\nsuggests that it is time to revisit the problem of sediment transport in unsteady flow. Success of\r\nthis pilot study would pave the way for a new approach to investigating the coupling of water\r\nand sediment movement and to experimenting with transport of sediment in highly unsteady\r\nflows such as dam-break induced floods.\r\nResearch Hypotheses and Scientific Objectives: The major objectives of this basic research are\r\nto quantify the time-varying changes in water- and bed-surface elevation and sediment\r\nconcentration associated with the passage of a dam-break induced flood and to examine the\r\nvalidity of the quasi-steady uniform flow assumption in unsteady sediment transport modeling.\r\nThe basic hypotheses guiding the proposed research are that time dependence of inflow\r\nhydrograph affects sediment transport so that standard steady flow formulas will not provide\r\naccurate estimates of sediment discharge, and that when analyzing the hydraulic response of a\r\nbed to rapidly changing inflow hydrographs, the time scale of interest concerning bed elevation\r\nmay no longer be long compared to that of the flow so that only fully coupled models of flow\r\nand sediment equations would properly characterize the phenomena. The work proposed here is\r\nconsidered the first phase of our unsteady sediment transport research. Specifically, this research\r\naims to address the following issues: (1) For the simulation of a catastrophic flood induced by\r\nthe breach of a dam in a natural river, can the decoupled and steady uniform flow modeling\r\napproach still yield satisfactory results? (2) Is the time scale of interest concerning bed elevation\r\nchange still long compared to that of the flow in rapidly changing flows such as dam-break\r\ninduced floods? (3) How can the phase difference among sediment concentration, friction factor,\r\nflow velocity and depth, as evidenced in laboratory and field observations, be quantified and\r\ninterpreted? The proposed research intends to provide an improved physical framework to study\r\nsediment transport and morphological evolution in natural rivers in response to a highly unsteady\r\nflow such as dam-break induced floods. The main research tasks involve model development,\r\ncalibration, verification and comparison, collection and compilation of existing laboratory and\r\nfield data, and evaluation of critical flow and sediment parameters involved in this\r\nmorphological process.\r\nBroader Impacts: The most significant and broadest impacts of this project are twofold. First,\r\nresearch outcomes will provide useful information for policy decision-making by federal and\r\nstate agencies, such as evaluation of transport capacities of rivers and streams, estimation of\r\nenvironmental impacts of riverbed and bank erosion and deposition, and assistance in the\r\nevaluation of design alternatives. Potential applications of the research results include design of\r\ndams and reservoirs, floodplain analysis and management, and estimation of possible maximum\r\nscour during large flood events. Secondly, this proposed project would also have significant\r\neducational impact on both undergraduate and graduate levels. Findings of this fundamental\r\nresearch will be integrated into the teaching of science, math and engineering to benefit a broader\r\nstudent community.\r\n",
