 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER proposal is a timely response to school districts' urgent need for guidance in both analyzing the vast quantities of student test data they are currently receiving and developing effective strategies for using those data to promote better student performance and overall school improvement.  The proposed products include both print and web-based resources for practitioners and would be based on the PI's research-based studies over the past three years of how districts use data in decision-making.  Written for a practitioner audience, the monograph would focus on using data to guide school improvement plans with particular attention to addressing achievement gaps, meeting the needs of special populations and connecting classroom-based assessments to high stakes test data.  The monograph would include protocols and several case studies developed by the PI through her NSF-funded \"Using Data Project\" (ESI-0221415), and would ultimately be published through the NSF Foundations series.\r\n\r\n",
