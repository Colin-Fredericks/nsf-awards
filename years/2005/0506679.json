 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed work is to understand the reactivity of iron (Fe) oxide nanoparticles in\r\nair, water, and soil environments. Fe oxide particles in the nanometer size range (< 100 nm) are\r\nubiquitous in nature and their occurrence ranges from ultra-fine mineral dust in the atmosphere to\r\nnanocrystalline precipitates in the hydrosphere. Research into the reactivity of nanoparticle Fe oxides has\r\nbeen primarily aimed at understanding the bonding characteristics of atoms adsorbed at the surface. It is\r\nnow recognized, however, that the behavior of Fe in the environment is strongly influenced by bacterially\r\ndriven redox reactions, as well as the local chemistry and nature of mineral surfaces in rocks and soils,\r\nand by the presence of water. Therefore, detailed investigations of the redox chemistry of Fe oxide\r\nnanoparticles under conditions analogous to nature are critical to understanding the role of these tiny\r\nparticles in the cycling of Fe in the environment.\r\nThe proposed research will use advanced spectroscopic and analytical techniques, in conjunction\r\nwith selective isotope labeling, to investigate redox processes occurring at the surface of Fe oxide\r\nnanoparticles in the presence of water. Of particular interest is the bacterially driven interaction between\r\naqueous Fe, and mineral and cell surfaces, as well as redox reactions occurring during (i) Fe isotope\r\nexchange, (ii) transport of atmospheric Fe mineral dust, (iii) pollutant reduction, and (iv) microbial Fe\r\noxidation. The experiments will use well characterized Fe oxide nanoparticles in batch and column\r\nreactors designed to mimic natural conditions by varying biogeochemical conditions, including microbe,\r\nmineral, and water composition, as well as flow conditions.\r\nIntellectual Merit. Despite the key role of Fe(III)-Fe(II) reactions in environmental and industrial\r\napplications, heterogeneous redox reactions occurring on nanoscale Fe oxides have been largely unexplored.\r\nThis is due, in large part, to the analytical and spatial complexities of studying heterogeneous reactions of Fe\r\nin the presence of water. The proposed methodology overcomes this obstacle by using an innovative\r\ncombination of 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy and high precision aqueous isotope ratio measurements to\r\nsimultaneously measure isotope specific oxidation states and concentrations of Fe at the Fe oxide-water\r\ninterface. This approach, in tandem with X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron\r\nmicroscopy (TEM), will provide new information on how and where redox reactions occur on Fe oxide\r\nnanoparticles. The synergistic blend of expertise in Fe geochemistry, microbial Fe respiration, and\r\natmospheric Fe mineral dust brought together with the proposed NIRT provides an unparalleled opportunity\r\nto study redox reactions involving Fe oxide nanoparticles during multiple components of the Fe\r\nbiogeochemical cycle. Observing reactivity . particle size trends for four diverse, but related reactions\r\nprovide a powerful mechanism to identify new phenomena that are unique to oxide particles within the\r\nnanometer size range.\r\nBroader Impacts. An innovative combination of spectroscopic and isotopic techniques, in addition\r\nto comprehensive mineral characterization methods, will result in an improved understanding of the behavior\r\nof Fe oxide nanoparticles in air, water, and soil. Our findings will directly impact newly developing theories\r\non global carbon cycling (via microbial Fe respiration and atmospheric deposition of Fe in the ocean), as well\r\nas challenge our current understanding of important environmental and industrial processes including\r\ndegradation of soil, sediment, and water quality, the evolution of earth.s geologic/magnetic record (via Fe\r\nisotope biosignatures), accelerated rates of corrosion, and condensation processes (which may have led to the\r\norigin of life on earth and biological activity on Mars). The exploratory, interdisciplinary nature of the\r\nproposed activity will provide excellent training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.\r\nStudents, as well as participating scientists, will gain expertise in a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic\r\ntools through three hands-on Nanoscale Processes in the Environment Summer Workshops. During the\r\nworkshop, students will collect, analyze, and interpret data from their own samples. Bimonthly .Fe Oxides in\r\nthe Environment. student forums will also be established at each university. The overall goal is to expose\r\nstudents to new ideas and to provide a forum for the interdisciplinary discussion of students. ideas throughout\r\nthe year. Finally, a new initiative, .Geology and Art., will be launched through the Geology Museum at\r\nU.W. Madison to educate the public about Fe nanoparticles. This NIRT addresses the NSE research and\r\neducation theme .Nanoscale Processes in the Environment..",
