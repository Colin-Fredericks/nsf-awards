 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11) Intellectual Merit:  Adding undergraduate observational research studies throughout the astronomy curriculum improves both student learning and interest.  A previous project has developed a web-based robotic observatory (URSA), now in use by 500 undergraduate students per year, mostly in introductory classes.  Advanced students need improved observational capabilities for their more difficult projects.  Because of the limited angular resolution and bright sky background of the URSA telescope, which is situated in the middle of Fayetteville, AR, a much larger and more capable webscope has been fully funded and is now being commissioned at a dark-sky site in New Mexico (the NFO WebScope).  Other educational partners in this venture are the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, the Arkansas School for Mathematics & Sciences, and the NF/ Observatory in New Mexico.  \r\n\r\nThis project builds on experience from the prior URSA project to create a simple NFO user interface and adapt and implement effective educational materials for the new advanced curriculum.  The telescope is also being used for student-faculty research projects.  Students in the revised upper level classes are expected to show improved learning and enthusiasm for astronomy.  These improvements are being measured by pre- and post-testing with concept tests, formative evaluations of attitudes and opinions, Purdue course evaluation forms, class grades, and exit interviews by the Department Chairperson. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The results of this study are made available to others through several avenues, including presentations at conferences, publications in professional research and educational journals, and a web site.  In addition, annual summer Astronomy Research Experience for Teachers workshops are being organized to introduce in-service middle-school and high-school science teachers to the advantages of teaching with robotic astronomy.  These teachers and their students are then given access to the webscopes and training in their use.  Other astronomers have expressed interest in the first results of this work, and the lessons learned from these implementation experiences may benefit the teaching of astronomy at all undergraduate levels.",
