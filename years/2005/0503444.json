Moore\r\n\r\nThe Boise Extravaganza in Set Theory is an annual three day\r\nconference at Boise State University devoted to set theory and\r\nrelated areas of mathematics such as algebra, analysis,\r\ncombinatorics, logic, and topology.  It has occurred continuously\r\nsince the first conference in 1992.  This proposal is a request\r\nfor travel and lodging support for the invited speakers and\r\nparticipants who attend the conference (particularly students and\r\njunior researchers).  The main goals of the conference are as\r\nfollows: (1) Provide the Western US with an annual conference in\r\nset theory; (2) Provide an organized low-cost event accessible to\r\ngraduate students and young researchers; (3) Provide an\r\nopportunity for interaction between the leaders in the field and\r\nset theorists early in their careers; (4) Provide a forum for\r\ninteractions between set theory and related areas of mathematics;\r\n(5) Represent the many different sub-disciplines within set\r\ntheory; (6) Encourage participation by women and minorities when\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n",
