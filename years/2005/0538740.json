The center is focusing on leading-edge research in homeland security and emergency response.  The project addresses a number of open issues pertaining to search and rescue robot teams working in \"destroyed structures\".  Whether destruction is due to a natural phenomenon such as an earthquake or a terrorist attack, a similar environment results, with structural properties such as flat walls and floors positioned at skewed angles, obstacles where there are usually are none, and doorways taking on a new definition as anything large enough to squeeze through.  The goal is to exploit robot communication in such a way that multiple behaviors augment rather than detract from each other.",
