The objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms of thermoelectric energy conversion in Bi and BiSb alloy nanowires and to advance the experimental techniques for characterizing these nanowires.  These nanowires are good candidates for direct conversion between thermal and electrical energy.  The proposed approach is to systematically study thermoelectric transport and energy conversion in a large number of Bi and BiSb alloy nanowires using an integrated platform that combines transmission electron microscope and scanning tunneling microscope probe with fast thermoelectric property measurements.  This platform enables the correlation of transport properties with the detailed microstructure and local electronic structure of the nanowire.  Theoretical models for concurrent electron and phonon transport in nanowires will be developed concurrently to the experimental studies.  \r\nThe proposed research focuses on exploiting the benefits of nanotechnology for environmentally-friendly solid-state energy conversion (waste heat recovery, refrigerant-free air-conditioning and refrigeration), an area that is of great national and international significance.  Currently, the applications of these solid-state energy conversion devices are limited because materials are not efficient enough.  Fundamental understandings gained through the proposed project can lead to new ways to synthesize efficient solid-state energy conversion materials.  The project integrates education and research through several initiatives:  a book on nanostructured thermoelectrics is being co-authored by several team members and new research results will be incorporated into the book, undergraduate and high school students will be recruited to participate in research particularly targeting women and minority students, research results will also be incorporated into the MIT open course-ware program through courses offered, and an annual open house to local K-12 students will be held.  The interdisciplinary educational and outreach programs contribute directly to the students training and increased public understanding of nanotechnology and its bearing on future energy needs worldwide.  \r\n",
