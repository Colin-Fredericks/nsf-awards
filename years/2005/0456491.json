 "awd_abstract_narration": "7th International Conference on Mathematical and Numerical Aspects of Waves.\r\n\r\nThe investigators propose to organize the next International Conference on Mathematical and Numerical Aspects of Waves on June 20-24, 2005 at Brown University. This conference, which is co-organized in collaboration with INRIA, France, will be held in the United States for the 4th time (out of 7). The conference themes will include forward and inverse scattering, fast computational techniques, numerical analysis, absorbing layers and approximate boundary conditions, analytic and semi-analytic techniques for wave problems, domain decomposition, guided waves, random media etc. The scientific committee consists of 37 leading researchers, representing diverse themes. There are 8 confirmed keynote speakers, four of whom are from USA, and two are women. A round-table discussion, consisting of a mix of invited speakers and leading researchers, will be organized. The objective is to discuss and report to NSF the open issues and future algorithmic and application trends in mathematical and numerical aspects of waves.\r\n\r\nThe development of computational and mathematical tools for the solution of problems dominated by waves continues to be important in numerous areas of applications, e.g., medican imaging, sensor and radar applications, detection of hidden objects and numerous other areas of relevance to national security and technology development. As the leading conference in this very important research topic it is expected to attract most leading researchers, thus providing an excellent opportunity for students and young researchers to meet senior people and get a unique view at the state-of-the-art of the ongoing research activities. Several activities during the conference is planned to encourage networking and development of contacts between young people and more seasoned researchers as a way of helping in the the education of the new cadre of applied mathematicians and engineers in computational and mathematical techniques for solving wave problems.",
