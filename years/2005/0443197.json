It will be organized by the Principal\r\nInvestigator and three mathematicians from Japan.\r\n\r\nHodge theory has emerged in the past twenty years or so as a\r\nrecognized field of mathematics.  It will be the main focus of the\r\nconference.  Each aspect of Hodge theory has interface with one or\r\nmore of the following diverse areas of mathematics: algebraic and\r\ncomplex geometry, automorphic forms, differential geometry, functional\r\nanalysis, homological algebra, mathematical physics, and number theory.\r\n\r\nLogarithmic geometry is a somewhat recent notion that treats, in a\r\nunified way, certain notions of \"going to infinity\" in a space.  It\r\nhas been used successfully by Kato and Usui to attach a boundary to\r\nthe classifying spaces for Hodge structures, a problem that had been\r\naround for some thirty years.  It seems to be the right time to draw\r\nmore attention to the increasing role of logarithmic geometry in\r\nHodge-theoretical situations.  That is intended, however, without\r\nconstricting the scope of the conference.\r\n",
