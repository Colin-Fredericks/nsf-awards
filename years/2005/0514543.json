 "awd_abstract_narration": "A-1\r\nThe domain Archaea is one of the three domains of life, and organisms in this domain\r\nare distinct from organisms in either the domain Bacteria (eubacteria) or the domain\r\nEucarya (eukaryotes). Although archaeal organisms represent approximately one third\r\nof life's evolutionary diversity and display many interesting and practical properties and\r\nactivities, Archaea are much less characterized than are organisms from the other two\r\ndomains. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Archaea grew out of a GRC on\r\nmethanogenesis, which was held every three years from 1984-1993. The first GRC on\r\nArchaea was held in 1996, and at the second meeting held in 1999, the participants\r\nvoted unanimously to make it a reoccurring meeting. The 2001 meeting had an\r\ninterdisciplinary program, stressing genomics, unusual metabolism, transcription and its\r\nregulation. A similar theme with added sessions (ecodiversity, extremophilic proteins,\r\nfunctional genomics) was pursued in 2003. The 2005 conference will emphasize\r\nemerging topics including systems biology, proteomics and biotechnology. These\r\nchanges expand on the number of impacted NSF programs and include PIs funded in\r\nMCB, DEB, and BES. Specific programs are itemized in the suggested reviewers\r\nsections. The conference has a diverse and gender-balanced slate of speakers and\r\nsession leaders. NSF support for this conference will allow more participants including\r\nstudents and postdocs to attend the GRC, facilitating interaction between junior and\r\nestablished American and international scientists.",
