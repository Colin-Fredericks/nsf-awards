 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence and diversification of complex phenotypes is a problem so central to comparative biology that it can reasonably be said to predate Darwin. One of the most exciting avenues in contemporary biology is the synthesis of mechanistic and evolutionary approaches, the integration of evolutionary theory and field study with knowledge of the detailed processes that underlie complex traits. This approach has been tremendously successful in understanding the diversification of body plans, and is poised to make comparable contributions in the realm of animal behavior. The evolution of rodent mating systems is a particularly fruitful avenue for synthesizing the contributions of ultimate and proximate factors to the emergence of complex behavioral phenotypes. Thus, a workshop is proposed to assess the status of research in rodent mating systems, and to outline a strategy for catalyzing a synthesis of the relevant fields. The workshop will bring together a diverse array of 15 researchers by discipline, as well as by gender, minority status, and professional stage. The specific aims of the workshop are to: (1) summarize existing knowledge in ecology, behavior, and neurobiology of rodent mating systems; (2) examine the technical and conceptual hurdles within disciplines; (3) examine the empirical data and social infrastructure needed to effectively accomplish a synthesis; and (4) disseminate the workshop in two publications directed at diverse audiences.  By design, the workshop is both broad and concrete, with the inclusion of junior researchers postdoctoral associates and assistant professors), it will share expertise from scientists less entrenched in their respective disciplines, and will also foster their involvement in collaborative research. Many leading researchers in the field are women reflected in the gender composition of the participants (8 of 15 invitees), and one woman is a minority. Broadening participation also means the inclusion of respected researchers who are at small schools. The resulting group of invitees is diverse in every dimension except research excellence, all participants have solid records. The workshop promises not only to critically assess the integrative study of behavior, but includes leading teacher/scholars in the development and communication of such efforts.",
