 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Sensors and Sensor Networks (NSF 05-526) project is to initiate a knowledge base for the strategic design and tactical operation of surveillance sensor systems that help assure robust security in ports and waterways, especially to deal with unauthorized, small vessels that can gain easy access to sensitive \"targets.\"  Strategic design entails prescribing the types of sensors, the number of each type and the location of each sensor; tactical operations require detecting anomalous vessel behavior and analyzing system fault tolerance.  The approach to strategic design involves formulating mathematical models, devising specialized algorithms to solve large-scale instances, and testing algorithms computationally.  The approach to detecting anomalous behavior entails devising a generalized Bayesian framework and a multivariate statistical monitoring procedure to determine \"normal\" behavior using historical data to infer an intruder's intentions from position and velocity.  The approach to fault tolerance analysis involves graph theory and combinatorial mathematics.\r\n\r\nIf successful, society will benefit from the enhanced homeland security provided by improved surveillance systems in the Houston ship channel and in ports and waterways throughout the country as well as in sensitive facilities like industrial plants, nuclear power plants, office buildings, and national monuments.  The project will promote multidisciplinary teaching and training by training participating students and providing computer programs for teaching and research.  It will contribute to the infrastructure for research and education by motivating students to pursue careers in relevant areas and by engaging teachers from minority-serving high schools.  It will promote learning as results are taught in various universities.  Participants will be actively recruited from under-represented groups to promote their socioeconomic welfare.  The plan for dissemination will make results widely available, contributing to training analysts, engineers, and security authorities by presenting at professional conferences, publishing in refereed journals, and teaching at university-level courses.",
