 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to support the Second Purdue Minisymposium on\r\nFinancial Mathematics, to be held on April 15-16, 2005. A first edition\r\nwas held at Purdue University on April 3, 2003, gathering 40 participants.\r\nThe planned format for this short conference includes: one afternoon one\r\nmorning, with expected attendance 60 to 80 participants; three main\r\ninvited one-hour talks, full travel reimbursement for these senior\r\nspeakers, 6 invited 25-minute talks, with partial travel reimbursement for\r\n3 junior speakers; modest funds for coffee breaks, and one conference\r\ndinner for invited speakers; partial travel reimbursement for 7 Ph.D.\r\nstudents or postdoctoral scholars (people who obtained their Ph.D. no more\r\nthan 3 years ago), and the possibility to present their work in a poster\r\nsession.  The three main speakers will be important researchers in\r\nquantitative finance, known for their world-class work in both theoretical\r\nfinancial mathematics and applied quantitative finance. The P.I.'s\r\nscientific motivation for the conference includes exposing the\r\nparticipants to an array of cutting-edge research topics in financial\r\nmathematics, including stochastic volatility in option pricing, American\r\noptions, stochastic control and portfolio optimization under partial\r\ninformation, interacting particle methods in finance, Monte-Carlo\r\nfinancial simulation techniques.\r\n\r\nThe proposed conference on Financial Mathematics at Purdue University will\r\nprovide evidence to the participants that the interaction between Finance\r\nand Mathematics is bidirectional: beyond receiving answers to its applied\r\nquestions, Finance provides great problems for probability theory,\r\nstatistical science, and applied mathematics, motivates the development of\r\nnew tools of intrinsic mathematical interest, and helps mold and improve\r\nthe image and the purpose of Mathematics with the general non-scientific\r\npublic. The conference will create an opportunity for the education of\r\ngraduate students and beginning researchers with an interest in\r\nquantitative finance, by bringing local Purdue students in contact with\r\nlike-minded peers from other academic institutions, by providing role\r\nmodels -- the main speakers, and by inspiring and uncovering possible new\r\nresearch topics. The P.I. will encourage underrepresented minorities to\r\nparticipate in the conference, and will target such groups for financial\r\nsupport by selecting invited speakers and supported graduate and\r\npostdoctoral participants appropriately.\r\n",
