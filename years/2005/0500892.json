 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nBasor \r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is to investigate the asymptotics of \r\ndeterminants of perturbations of convolution operators. Our goal will \r\nbe to extend the classical  limit theorems to these operators, both for \r\nscalar and matrix-valued symbols, and for both smooth and singular \r\nsymbols. For many of these operators, the constant term is the most \r\ndifficult piece of the asymptotic expansion to describe. For \r\nmatrix-valued symbols there are only a few cases where the constants \r\ncan be explicitly described. In particular, we will investigate the \r\nasymptotics in the case of a perturbation of a Toeplitz determinant by \r\na Hankel operator with possibly different symbol. Other classes of \r\noperators of interest are Wiener-Hopf plus Hankel operators and  Bessel \r\noperators. Classical operator methods will be used to study these \r\nproblems as well as newer developments. For example, using the \r\nBorodinGeronimo-Geronimo-Case identity to bridge between smooth and \r\nsingular symbols has been highly successful.\r\n\r\nThere is increasing interest in finding asymptotic expansions of \r\ndeterminants of convolution type operators because they have \r\nconnections to many problems in mathematical physics, including the \r\nIsing model (a model of a two-dimensional (or very thin) magnets), the \r\nclassical dimer model, the entanglement problem in spin chain model, \r\nrandom growth models, and to the general area of random matrix theory. \r\nIn these physical problems one is often interested in the complicated, \r\nunpredictable behavior of the models. Often a quantity that describes \r\nsome statistical property of a system can be reformulated as a \r\ndeterminant approximation problem. The physical systems give \r\npredictions as to the right form of the approximation and show that \r\nmany of the answers should be quite universal. The universality is \r\nespecially important since it shows that many complicated systems and \r\nmodels are actually quite similar. Hence the idea is not simply to \r\nprove theorems and then find applications for the theorems, but to use \r\nthe ideas of mathematical physics to give predictions of the \r\nmathematics and then conversely, to use the mathematics to tell us \r\nsomething about physical systems.\r\n",
