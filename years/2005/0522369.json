 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting a bilateral NSF/NSFC Workshop on \"Determining Green Chemistry Science Drivers and Implementation Challenges,\" organized by Dr. Robin D. Rogers of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa. The Workshop will focus on the science drivers and implementation challenges of green chemistry in countries as complex as the US and China. The Workshop will attempt to identify the fundamental areas of inquiry and research needs required to bring the promise of Green Chemistry to fruition. This will include such questions as Why is green chemistry necessary?; What are the global and international challenges that require green chemistry approaches?; How can a diverse workforce be developed for this field?; How can new green technologies be implemented?; How can green chemistry progress be measured?; and How can environmental advantages of a green technology be assessed? Workshop participants will take part in writing the conference report prior to departure.  Dr. Shengming Ma (Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences) will serve as the Chinese organizer.  The Workshop is scheduled to extend from May 27, 2005 through May 31, 2005 in Beijing.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop program will feature scientific, social, and cultural exchange, with the aim of building long-term bridges for productive international collaboration and knowledge exchange. The workshop is expected to provide a forum for the exchange of research ideas, accomplishments and common problems among the group of chemists.  The setting and the proposed schedule are designed to encourage formal and informal discussion that will allow participants to become well acquainted with one another. Assessment of the workshop will be conducted by formal survey of all participants and by continued email exchange. Outcomes of the Workshop will include a proceedings (3-4 pages per participant), email lists exchange, follow up collaborations, and a conference report in the journal Green Chemistry. It is also anticipated that an overview paper of the Workshop would be submitted for publication in a journal such as Green Chemistry or Environmental Science & Technology.",
