 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops and analyzes mathematical models,\r\nand carries out computational simulations, of the aggregation of\r\nnano particles suspended in a thin liquid layer on a patterned\r\nsubstrate.  The problem arises in multiscale technological\r\nprocesses such as directed self-assembly of nano particles, for\r\ninstance in the fast production of multiple-channel nano-sensors. \r\nCollaborations with experimentalists help guide the modeling. \r\n\r\n     For the last three decades, the development of\r\nmicroelectronic devices has been governed by Moore's law, which\r\npostulates that the complexity of chips doubles every two years. \r\nThis doubling is possible because the size of the features on the\r\nchips becomes smaller and smaller.  Present chips have features\r\nabout 40 nanometers wide.  (A human hair is about 80,000\r\nnanometers wide.)  However, known technologies for mass production\r\nof chips are near their limits.  Directed self-assembly of nano\r\nparticles may be an alternative technology, offering advantages\r\nof speed, cost, and efficiency, and the ability to deal with very\r\nlarge numbers of particles at nano scales.  Moreover, unlike\r\npresent technologies, it also allows the formation of devices\r\nbased on biological molecules, and incorporation of biological\r\nmolecules into non-biological devices.  The realm of applications\r\nof such devices is almost limitless, from electronics and computer\r\nchips to medical applications.  The investigator develops\r\nmathematical models and computational simulations to study how\r\nnano particles suspended in a thin fluid aggregate and how\r\naggregation is affected by patterns in the substrate of the fluid. \r\nThis addresses fundamental questions in the directed self-assembly\r\nof nano particles.  The project is supported by the Applied\r\nMathematics program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences and\r\nthe Metals Research program of the Divison of Materials Research.",
