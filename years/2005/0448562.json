Towards that end, this project is investigating (1) formal models based on timed automata for canonical sets of primitive system software mechanisms, (2) algebraic representations of how automata for primitive mechanisms can be composed to form more complex mechanisms that are prevalent in current system software practice, and (3) type systems and other techniques for efficient guidance and checking of system software composition and configuration.  This approach allows system developers to leverage application-specific constraints on the timing and ordering of system events, to guide composition of new mechanisms and customization of previously composed mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe project makes it easier for a wide audience of designers, developers and testers to specify, implement and verify correct behavior of software systems.  The software and educational materials developed under this project are to be released on-line and open-source.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
