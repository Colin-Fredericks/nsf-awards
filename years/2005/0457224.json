Wooldridge, Ford Motor Company\r\n\r\nProject Abstract\r\n\r\nAdvanced combustion strategies have considerable potential to dramatically improve combustion efficiencies while simultaneously reducing pollutant emissions.  Realization of this potential requires parallel advances in interrogation and sensing methods to provide feedback on the projected conditions within the combustion chamber and to provide metrics for assessing successful technologies.  This project focuses on development and application of a laser-based sensing method for interrogation of combustion systems where the high temperatures, pressures and rapid transients present considerable challenges for conventional experimental approaches.  Specifically, this work will use distributed feedback diode lasers as emission sources for absorption spectroscopy to measure species important in internal combustion (IC) engines.  Novel frequency modulation and wavelength multiplexing will be used to improve temporal resolution and detection limits.  The diagnostic will be developed and applied to a optical engine facility, where a partnership with Ford Motor Company will ensure rapid dissemination of the methods to industrial research and development facilities.  Difficulties associated with engine measurements will be addressed in the course of this work using the characteristics of the resonant and off-resonant absorption features. \r\n\r\nMeasurements proposed in this work include absolute quantitative in-cylinder species concentrations with good temporal resolution continuously acquired throughout an engine cycle, without cycle-to-cycle averaging.  The collection of data such as these is a vital next step in IC engine research and development.  Direct outcomes of the proposed research include important advancements in solid-state lasers and absorption spectroscopy along with a new valuable tool for combustion studies that can be applied to a broad range of systems.  Increased understanding of the physical and chemical mechanisms important in advanced IC engine combustion systems will significantly aid in the development of advanced engine technologies.  The broader impacts therefore include the potential to design and produce IC engines with better fuel economy while simultaneously decreasing pollutant emissions.  This project is co-funded by the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program and the Combustion and Plasma Systems program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
