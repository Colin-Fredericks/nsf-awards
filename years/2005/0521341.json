HRXRD has only recently become available commercially. It will enable the PIs to routinely use sophisticated technologies such as grazing incidence x-ray diffractometry, reflectometry and in-plane diffraction. These technologies will be used to characterize thin films and coatings for possible application in products ranging from cutting tools to electronic devices. In the immediate future, the equipment will be used to enhance the results of six ongoing research projects funded by NSF or industry. These projects range from the development of hard tribological coatings such as titanium carbonate for cutting tools through to semiconductor films for microelectronic and MEMS systems.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: Broader impacts will involve training, education, diversity initiatives, and outreach to industry. Because HRXRD is relatively new, training of students to work with it will fill a significant vacuum in the US technology labor supply. At least 54 undergraduate and graduate students per year enrolled in four laboratory courses will learn about the theory and applications of HRXRD. The use of this equipment will be linked to the NSF-funded EMC2 and MEET Scholar programs at RIT to increase the participation of female and minority students. Partnerships will be established with small or start-up companies in or near Rochester. \r\n",
