 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a geography curriculum using visualization to overcome students' fear of quantitative methods.  It presents numerical concepts in a concrete, visual format rather than a more abstract equation-based format that is difficult for many students to comprehend.  The project emphasizes graphic representation and student-based learning.  By focusing on graphically-based examples and illustrations in lectures, and requiring heavy use of graphics in student exercises, students can gain a firm conceptual understanding of quantitative procedures.   Student-based learning is fostered by using an open-classroom environment equipped with high-end-graphics computers and software to facilitate students' engagement and interactions.  The project is developing a two-term quantitative methods course sequence.  The first course focuses on fundamental numeric data concepts (scales of measurement, sampling, probability), descriptive statistical methodologies, and principles of sound graphic design, construction, and communication.  The second course deals entirely with inferential statistical analysis techniques.   The curricular materials are being developed at Portland State University (PSU), a large, diverse urban campus. The proposed research has potentially broad impacts outside of PSU, and we will achieve national dissemination through paper presentations, published articles, workshops, and web-based distribution. \r\n",
