The objective of the Coastal Ocean Circulation GRC is to bring together scientists with common interests for a week of intense discussion stimulated by invited lectures on research at the forefront of coastal physical oceanography and related interdisciplinary areas.   \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This Gordon Research Conference is a valuable means of disseminating information and ideas in a way that cannot be achieved through the usual channels of communication, such as publications or presentations at large scientific meetings.  The conference provides a forum for the development and evaluation of new disciplinary and interdisciplinary research directions and an ideal environment for collaborations between different scientific communities within coastal oceanography.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The conference directly addresses NSF's goal to foster the integration of research and education. This conference is an effective way to educate young scientists in the different topic areas at the frontiers of coastal physical oceanography and provides a unique opportunity for young scientists to meet and interact with leading researchers in the field.\r\n",
