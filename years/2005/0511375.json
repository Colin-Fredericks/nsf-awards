 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discipline: Biological Sciences (61)\r\n\r\nThe University of Tennessee at Chattanooga is updating its biology offerings through development of an integrative, collaborative and inquiry-based course of study in Molecular Biology.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: To answer the growing need for biologists skilled in the areas of molecular and cell biology, genetics, biotechnology, molecular medicine and bioinformatics generated by increased interest by industry and academia in human and non-human genome studies and to address current and future needs in the education of undergraduates in biology, current course offerings in Genetics and Molecular Biology (MB) are being enhanced and modernized.  Practices being introduced in course design include hands-on exposure to advanced and widely applicable benchtop techniques in biotechnology and the use of scientific and literature databases and molecular biology analysis software. Specific components being introduced reflect adaptation of investigative laboratory curriculum materials originally developed by the Genome Consortium for Active Teaching (GCAT) at Davidson College for their advanced molecular biology course and include: (1) incorporation of laboratory exercises utilizing the green fluorescent protein, and (2) acquisition of basic and advanced biotechnological instrumentation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This expansion of the curriculum extends faculty development and student growth through interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary interactions as well as impacts individual student research projects.  The revised molecular biology course has wide application by including experiences in the genetic manipulation and molecular characterization of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems and incorporating technologies intended to facilitate student/faculty research and development in general biology, genetics, microbiology, cell biology, biochemistry and bioinformatics.  The changes instituted involve faculty from both the departments of Computer Science and Chemistry in the development of cross-disciplinary courses, such as Bioinformatics, within the Biology Department and incorporation of molecular biology techniques and analyses into courses and accepted courses for the major within the other departments. Emphasis is being placed on investigative learning exercises that include a progression of scientific experiences with opportunities for data analysis, interpretation, written expression and oral presentation of results.\r\n\r\n",
