 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Urban Educators Program at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is using Noyce Scholarships to achieve two primary goals: (1) doubling the total number of students who obtain secondary certification in science and/or mathematics, from 25 to 50, and (2) supporting at least six ethnic minority candidates completing math and science teaching certification programs. Both of these goals are being met through targeted recruitment of students within the IUPUI School of Science and surrounding universities, as well as recruitment of STEM professionals into the one-year Transition to Teaching (T2T) post baccalaureate teacher certification program. Noyce Scholarships are providing a strong financial and professional incentive for well-prepared applicants. Successful Noyce scholars are being placed in high-need schools in the Indianapolis Public School district.  Professional support for Noyce Scholars enrolled in the T2T program is being provided through a co-teaching model, which pairs two T2T students closely with a successful teacher in the Indianapolis Public School system.  In addition, STEM and Education faculty members mentor Noyce scholars during the first two years of teaching.  The intellectual merit of the IUPUI Noyce Program is found in the integration of educational research with the recruitment, education, and professional development of secondary school science teachers.  The program is having broad impacts by providing qualified science and math teachers to high-need secondary schools, and by disseminating the successes of the program to other teacher preparation programs by means of peer-reviewed publications, conferences, and presentations to the local and national community.",
