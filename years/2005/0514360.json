 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award furnishes travel support for participants in the Conference on Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics, held in May 2005 at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.  Topics of the conference include mathematical biology, fluid dynamics, nonlinear waves, optics, and applied probability and statistics.  Significant funding is allocated to support participation of students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. \r\n\r\nThe conference will bring together established researchers, junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate and undergraduate students to discuss the use of mathematical modeling to treat difficult problems in the biomedical and health sciences, in the physical and social sciences, and in engineering and technology.  \r\n\r\nThis meeting provides an opportunity for interaction between leading experts and junior researchers in important related areas of applied and computational mathematics.  The conference will provide a valuable opportunity for postdocs and students to broaden their understanding and to learn about open problems in these areas.\r\n\r\nConference web page:\r\nhttp://math.njit.edu/Events/FACM05/\r\n\r\n",
