 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fifth International Workshop on Objective Bayesian Methodology will\r\nbe held in Branson, Missouri, June 4-8, 2005.\r\nObjective Bayesian methodology is, for the most part, oriented towards\r\nthe development of prior distributions that can be used automatically,\r\ni.e. that do not require subjective input other than the specific\r\nprobabilistic model chosen to describe the data. There are three quite\r\ndistinct statistical domains in which this development has taken place:\r\nparametric estimation, model selection, and prediction,\r\nObjective Bayesian methodology is of increasing importance today since\r\napplication of Bayesian analysis is rapidly growing among nonspecialists,\r\nmost of whom seek automatic or objective Bayesian procedures.\r\nThis workshop will emphasize prediction, practical applications\r\nsuch as spatial-temporal models, multiple comparisons and goodness-of-fit.\r\nBayesian methods usually are heavily depend on prior distributions.\r\nAlthough a prior distribution is an important component in the Bayesian\r\nparadigm, it is known that even in the absence of any relevant prior\r\ninformation, the Bayes method can produce reliable inference to many\r\nchallenging problems by employing appropriate objective (noninformative)\r\nBayesian analysis. The principal objectives are to facilitate the\r\nexchange of recent research developments in objective Bayesian\r\nmethodology, to provide opportunities for new researchers, and to\r\nestablish new collaborations that will channel efforts into pending\r\nproblems and open new directions for investigation. An important\r\nconsequence of this meeting will be to further crystallize objective prior\r\nmethodology as an established area for statistical research.\r\n\r\nStatisticians have traditionally embraced one of two main approaches,\r\nclassical or \"frequentist\" methods and Bayesian methods. In recent years,\r\nadvances in computing technology and breakthroughs in statistical theory\r\nhave made Beyesian methods increasingly attractive, especially for \r\ndifficult problems with many variables in fields such as meteorology, \r\nepidemiology, natural resources, etc. With this increased emphasis on \r\nBayesian statistics, it has become increasingly important to bridge the \r\ndifferences between the two schools of statistical thinking.  Objective \r\nBayesians are dedicated to resolving these differences.  The planned \r\nworkshop will bring together 80-100 participants including leaders in the \r\nfield of objective Bayesian statistics from around the world together with \r\nyoung researchers and students in a setting especially conducive to \r\ncooperation and exchange of ideas.\r\n\r\n",
