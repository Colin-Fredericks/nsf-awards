A simple\r\nmethodology is being developed that requires a minimum of frequentist or\r\nBayesian modelling assumptions, and provides for both the efficient\r\nselection of the non-null cases, and the estimation \r\nof effect sizes. In classical terminology, both size and power are assessed.\r\nThis methodology depends on false discovery rate calculations, \r\nimplemented via empirical Bayes techniques. A typical result might report\r\n\"there are 200 of the 10,000 genes that can be clearly identified as\r\ndifferentially expressed between the two groups of subjects, but there are\r\nalso about 800 other non-null genes that this experiment was not powerful\r\nenough to detect.\"\r\n\r\nClassical 20th Century statistical theory was fashioned to handle small\r\nproblems, dozens or maybe hundreds of data points, with one or maybe a few\r\nunknown parameters. 21st Century scientific technology now provides massive\r\ndata sets, with millions of individual measurements and thousands of\r\nparameters to consider all at once. Microarrays are the prime example, but\r\nsimilar problems arise from a variety of devices: proteomic chips, time of\r\nflight spectroscopy, flow cytometry, and fMRI scanners. The goal of this\r\nresearch is an efficient, computationally efficient methodology for analyzing\r\nmassive simultaneous testing problems, without the need for extensive\r\nmodelling assumptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTE CARLO METHODS IN PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS (Persi Diaconis)\r\n\r\nThe main focus of this investigation is on rates of convergence of Monte Carlo\r\nand Markov chain algorithms for statistical computation. One aspect is \r\nphase transitions ( cut-off phenomena), extending Diaconis' recent solution of\r\nthe Peres conjecture (joint with Saloff-Coste). The work\r\nincludes creating new algorithms using computational tools such as Grobner\r\nbases and combinatorial characterizations such as Tuttes f-factors. This also\r\ncontributes to Bayesian methodology studying prior distributions for Markov\r\nchains, non-parametrics and\r\ncomputational tools. A final focus is the development of group theoretic\r\ncharacter theories in non-standard situations such as\r\nunipotent groups and Hecke algebras.\r\n\r\nProbability models underlie many areas of modern scientific study, but they\r\nraise puzzling and important questions concerning the connection of the\r\nmodel with real world phenomena. Diaconis studies\r\nfoundational topics such as `what does it mean to say coin flips are\r\nrandom'? This recently led to the discovery (joint with Susan Holmes and\r\nRichard Montgomery) that in fact, natural human coin flips show a small but\r\nsignificant bias (about 51% come up the same as the previous flip).\r\nCareful looks at the assumptions, justification and\r\nvalidity of `randomness' apply to widely-used simulation methods (how long\r\nshould an algorithm be run until its job is done?). Weather forcasting\r\nand air pollution are just two of the areas that require the dependability\r\nof such simulations.\r\n",
