 "awd_abstract_narration": "The reliability of the electric power system depends directly upon the condition of the underlying systems and equipment. The goal of this research is to create a theoretical foundation for maximizing availability of repairable equipment, such as, circuit breakers and transformers. Recent technology improvements in monitoring, diagnostics, communications, and controls allow for the reduced probability of service interruption and more effective maintenance practices. Still, there is a definite need to quantify the availability of equipment, optimize allocation of maintenance resources, eliminate unnecessary maintenance tasks, and improve system performance. Intellectual merit: This project will develop analytical models to evaluate the impact of maintenance on substation reliability indices by considering the criticality of equipment in a given substation. Models and algorithms based on Semi-Markov Decision Processes will be developed. These models incorporate penalties/rewards associated with different levels of maintenance activities suggested by programs such as Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) so that optimum maintenance policies and their associated costs can be determined. Broader Impact: The proposed research will contribute to the quantification of the health of electric power system infrastructure, specifically substations, since safety, reliability, quality, and costs are directly affected by the condition of systems and equipment. This project will also contribute to general knowledge in data analysis, modeling of aging processes, and development of other models representing monitoring, inspection, and maintenance activities. Such models are suitable for repairable equipment used in industries, such as, aviation, transportation, and power. Students will benefit from being exposed to practical problems of maintenance not typically encountered in the classroom.",
