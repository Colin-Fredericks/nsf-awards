Los Angeles, California, October 16-21, 2005. More\r\nspecifically, the funds requested ($3,955.00) will be utilized for partial support of the\r\ntravel expenses for up to five deserving graduate/undergraduate students and registration\r\nwaiver for only 3 invited speakers out of 25 confirmed invited speakers.\r\nThis symposium will address the fundamental science and recent technologies of\r\nadvanced gate stacks for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and\r\nmemory applications in sub-65 nm feature size integrated circuits, including: (1)\r\nSubstrates: Higher mobility semiconductors such as strained Si, Si(110) and (111), SiGe,\r\nGe and III-V compounds, GeOI, GaAs-on-insulator, and SOI. (2) High k Gate Dielectric\r\nMaterials and Processing: Trends in high k gate dielectric technologies for 65 nm and\r\nbeyond, novel high k materials, advanced oxynitrides for 65 nm and beyond, high k gate\r\ndielectric growth techniques, high k gate dielectric deposition methods, advanced\r\nprecursors for CVD. (3) Gate Electrode Materials and Processing: Trends in gate\r\nelectrode technologies for 65 nm and beyond; poly-Si, silicided, and metal gate\r\nelectrodes, band-edge and midgap work-function materials, gate electrode deposition\r\nmethods. (4) High K Gate Dielectric Interfaces: Silicon/High-K and High-K/Gate-\r\nElectrode Interfaces Oxygen Diffusion and Mechanisms of Interface Layer Formation\r\nInterface Preparation, Passivation, Engineering, and Control. (5) Advanced Gate Stack\r\nReliability: Identification of Main Reliability Problems in Low Voltage Application and\r\nNew Reliability Models Bias Temperature Instability Metallic Cross-Contamination\r\nAcross Layers Mechanisms of Electron Mobility Degradation Thermal Stability of New\r\nMaterials. (6) High K Gate Dielectric Characterization and Methodologies: Advanced\r\nPhysical, Chemical, and Electrical Characterization of Gate Stacks Accurate\r\nDetermination of Dielectric Capacitance Trap Parameter Extraction Non-Contact\r\nElectrical Characterization Work-function Extraction Methodologies Determination of\r\nTunneling Electron/Hole Mass. (7) DRAM and Non-Volatile Memory Materials: Trends\r\nin High K DRAM Capacitor Technologies Electrode/Dielectric Chemical Interactions\r\nThermal Stability of Structures Non-Volatile and Novel Memory Applications.\r\n\r\n",
