 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for: \r\n\r\nUS-Poland Workshop on Analytical Models and New Concepts in Concrete and Masonry Structures, CMS 0529707\r\n\r\nPI: Andrzej S. Nowak, University of Nebraska-Lincoln \r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: \r\nThe objective of the proposed Workshop is to review the recent advancements in concrete\r\nmaterials and their applications for civil infrastructure systems in Poland and the United\r\nStates, identify the most suitable topics for collaboration, and prepare proposals for\r\njoint US-Polish research projects. The Workshop will focus on materials properties, forms\r\nof deterioration and their effects on structural performance, and quantitative analysis of\r\nmaterials. The major areas to be covered include: (1) advanced materials\r\n(high-strength/high-performance concrete, composites, fiber-reinforced concrete, smart\r\nmaterials), (2) forms of deterioration for reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete\r\nstructures, (3) diagnostic procedures (tests, performance monitors, nondestructive\r\ntechniques, signal processing, integrated sensor systems, acoustic and optical\r\ntechniques), (4) materials and techniques for repair and rehabilitation of concrete\r\nstructures (reinforced and prestressed concrete, new composite materials). Accordingly,\r\nthe Workshop will attempt to review state of the art summary of main topics as viewed on\r\none hand in the U.S. and, on the other hand, in Poland, identify the research needs, in\r\nparticular, topics for cooperative projects, and derive some recommendations that reflect\r\nthe needs in manpower, technology transfer and education for the near future. The local\r\norganizers will also organize special meetings, lab tours and visits to the construction\r\nsites. The results will be presented in the report.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: \r\nThe results of the Workshop, including papers prepared and presented by the US and Polish\r\nparticipants will be available on the Workshop webpage. The results will also be presented\r\nat technical conferences (ASCE, ACI, IABSE).\r\n\r\n",
