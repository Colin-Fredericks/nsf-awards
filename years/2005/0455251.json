 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9802113  Ratcliffe    The California State Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU AMP) proposes to continue its  successful comprehensive, state-wide effort to increase significantly the number of minority students  who receive a baccalaureate degree in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET).  By  the end of the new grant period (2003-2004), the CSU AMP, through its enhanced efforts in Phase  II, will again double the number of SMET degrees awarded to minority students, a figure that is  quadruple the benchmark established in Phase I (750).    In Phase I, we successfully focused on the critical transition points from high school-to-college and  lower-division to upper-division status.  In Phase II, we will enhance our program by increasing our  attention on community colleges.  Our specific objective is to dramatically improve SMET advising at  the community college level by developing CSU/Community College advising teams and by developing  and implementing strategies for  institutionalizing the advising approaches developed by these teams.   Twenty-four community colleges-with a total enrollment of more than 400,000 students-have been  identified as active participants in this activity.  In addition, we will create a large number of paid  academic year research opportunities to provide junior- and senior-year students on-campus  experiences that are directly related to their SMET goals.    An important goal of Phase II is state-wide institutional reform.  The CSU will join with the  University of California AMP program (CAMP), to take a leadership role in developing intersegmental  committees composed of faculty and administrators from the University of California, California State  University, and California Community College systems.  Examples of issues that these committees  will address are:  SMET advising, electronic transcript transfer from community colleges to CSUs  and UCs, and mechanisms for sharing effective teaching strategies.    The CSU AMP statewide Governi ng Board is composed of key leaders in K-12 education, higher  education, and the private sector.  It is chaired by the Chancellor of the CSU and oversees general  projects operation and provides direction and assistance in broadening support for the Alliance among  academic, industrial, and governmental sectors.    The Chancellor of the CSU committed $800,000 per year in support of student stipends associated  with the summerbridge, academic year workshop, and research opportunity components of Phase II.   This commitment combined with  the commitment of the 22 participating CSU and 25 Community  College of $2 million/year, represents a 3-to-1 match of our requested support from the NSF.",
