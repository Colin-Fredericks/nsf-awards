 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is the development of a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing system capable of providing high resolution data for small ecosystems sites used in long term ecological studies.  The intent is to provide remote sensing systems with reduced production cost, reduced operating cost, reduced response time, and increased resolution in comparison with currently available sensing systems for such applications.  The work draws on the expertise of a multidisciplinary team of researchers in agronomy, engineering, and geography.\r\n\r\nThe UAV system will be developed by making modifications to a large hobby airframe and equipping it with an autopilot.   It will be a fixed-wing aircraft with electric propulsion and weigh less than 15 lbs with payload.  It will be designed so that it may be reproduced easily. The system will have flight times of over 30 minutes with interchangeable batteries for successive flights and could be operated by an experienced RC pilot with an assistant.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the UAV system will be quantified in its ability to provide data that can be processed to required spatial accuracies using commonly available software tools for remotely sensed data.  A significant part of the effort in the development of the system will be in tailoring of the control system of the UAV to perform targeted missions of acquiring remote sensing data without expensive and heavy attitude stabilization platforms for the remote sensing payload.  \r\n\r\nThe significance of this project is that it will not only provide many local environmental researchers with a new remote sensing instrument but also provide the knowledge necessary to produce low-cost UAVs that satisfy the requirements of many civilian applications.  The initial use of the remote sensing is to provide high resolution data at frequent intervals for long term ecological research in the Konza Prairie and Rannells Flint Hills Prairie Preserve near Manhattan, KS.    The knowledge gained from this work will potentially lead to the use of this \"personal computer\" version of a remote sensing platform in other areas.\r\n\r\nOther potential applications within the College of Agriculture at KSU alone include:  mapping invasive weed species in crops; mapping pathogens and insect damage; mapping hail and wind damage in crops; mapping crop damage due to herbicide drift; mapping crop yield for use in precision agriculture applications; mapping animal feeding operations and waste runoff; mapping animal distributions feedlots and pastures; mapping vegetation in golf courses and sports fields; and examination of landfills and other contaminated sites. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
