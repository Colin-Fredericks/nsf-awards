 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project concerns Ultrapure Water (UPW), the lifeblood of the semiconductor industry. The proposed instrument seeks to satisfy the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) requirements on two counts: 1. full flow inspections, 2. detection of sub-100nm liquid-borne particles. A typical semiconductor fab uses about 3 million gallons of UPW every day. To control operating costs and ensure sustainable growth, ITRS specifies that 70% of the UPW used in 2005 be recycled or reused (90% by 2010). As a UPW quality monitor fast enough to truly be an in-line, real-time particle detector of an entire DI water stream at the ultimate (50 nm and below) level of particulate purity, the Acoustic Coaxing Induced Microcavitation (ACIM) Particle Scout will enable these ITRS objectives for recycling UPW. \r\n\r\nThe proposed ACIM Particle Scout is designed to meet important financial (operating costs) and quality (sub-100nm precision) needs of the Semiconductor industry. Beyond the IC manufacturing industry the Particle Scout will find applications in all UPW-intensive enterprises: nuclear reactors and other power generators, the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology, space exploration, and processing of advanced high purity chemicals. This concept will enable and enhance environmental initiatives for the recycling of UPW. \r\n",
