 "awd_abstract_narration": "Number theory has seen many significant advances in the past few years. \r\nResults from arithmetic geometry and the theories of modular forms and \r\nGalois representations have yielded a proof Fermat's Last Theorem and \r\nfundamental advances towards the $p$-adic Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer \r\nConjecture (BSD), to name two. The research proposed in this project aims to \r\ncontinue this progress. The PI's propose to investigate many aspects of the \r\nconnections between automorphic forms, Galois representations, and \r\nvalues of their $L$-functions, with the particular aim of making advances \r\ntowards BSD, Bloch-Kato conjectures, and the Iwasawa Theory of automorphic \r\nGalois representations, as well as answering fundamental questions about the \r\nGalois representations associated to automorphic forms. Their project \r\nfocuses on $p$-adic methods in the theory of automorphic forms and \r\nGalois representations. By combining their various expertise, they propose to \r\nconsider a number of specific problems that fall under the following \r\nheadings: $p$-adic Eisenstein measures and their specializations, \r\nIwasawa's $\\mu$-invariants, Non-vanishing modulo $p$ of $L$-values, \r\nEisenstein ideals for unitary groups, Geometric construction of $p$-adic \r\nautomorphic forms, $p$-adic construction of Euler systems, Endoscopic \r\ncongruences, Galois representations and Shimura varieties. \r\n\r\nThis project will enhance our knowledge of the deep links between \r\nautomorphic forms, Galois representations, and their $L$-functions - a \r\ncentral focus of number theory - as well as have significant \r\nconsequences for our understanding of mathematics in general. Two workshops, a final \r\nconference, and graduate and post-doctoral advising will have an \r\nimportant impact on the formation of new researchers in the field and on \r\nthe promotion of new collaborations. \r\n",
