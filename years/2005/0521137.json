 "awd_abstract_narration": "0521137\r\nHolsen\r\nAirborne particulate matter (PM) can cause adverse health effects, plays a significant role in climate change, impacts smog formation, and decreases visibility. In addition, deposition of\r\npollutants associated with PM is a significant input to many ecosystems. For these reasons there is an urgent need for techniques that can measure PM and PM-associated pollutants at short enough time scales that sources of these particles can be characterized and mechanistic models of their chemistry and fate developed. Since these properties are dependent on particle size, the new technique should also be able to separate the PM by size before they are characterized. An additional requirement of these instruments is that they separate particles from the gas stream before collection to avoid sampling artifacts.\r\n\r\nAn instrument that meets this challenging combination of requirements for near real-time measurement of size-segregated PM without sampling artifacts will be a central outcome of this research. This unique instrument could be used to measure any compound associated with PM that can be converted to the gas phase at temperatures < 850C (for example Hg, organic and elemental carbon, pesticides and numerous other organic compounds) and then detected with a real-time detector (for example cold vapor atomic fluorescence for Hg, or a mass spectrophotometer for pesticides). The instrument will be designed so that different carrier gases can be used to accommodate these different analytical techniques. As a part of this project, we will also develop innovative techniques to evaluate particle samplers in an aerosol wind tunnel.\r\nThese techniques will become increasingly important as new particle samplers are developed in response to the growing interest in PM. The proposed development project will be of relevance to the NSF MRI Program by addressing the limitations in current in-situ, size-classified aerosol measurement capabilities and allowing for the development of state-of-the-art instrument for real-time particle characterization.\r\n",
