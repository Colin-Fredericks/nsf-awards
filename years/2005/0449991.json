 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Lingjun Li of the University of Wisconsin at Madison is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry CAREER Program in the Chemistry Division to develop an array of novel mass spectrometry-based strategies, specifically, in situ peptide analysis directly from the stomatogastric nervous system and neurhemal organs of crustaceans, like the crab and the lobster, using ultra-high resolution matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS).   In addition, Professor Li will employ multidimensional separation schemes coupled to both MALDI-FTMS and electrospray ionization (ESI)- tandem mass spectrometry for de novo peptide sequencing, and use database homology searching to allow the discovery of a large number of novel neuropeptides.  The goal is to increase understanding of neuropeptidergic signaling.  Professor Li also plans to persue the development of in vivo monitoring of peptide differential display in response to varied physiological conditions.  Collectively, the analytical tools developed through this research and the discovery of a large number of novel neuropeptides should have tremendous impact in both the analytical chemistry and the neuroscience research communities.  The PI recruits entry-level college students, and involves regional high school teachers in research to allow for better communication of the cutting-edge research to the greater public community.  \r\n\r\nA large number of peptides are responsible for signaling in the brain and the nervous system. Knowledge of the neuropeptide profile at the cellular and network level is critical for a better understanding of peptidergic signaling in neuronal circuitry.  This research has a high potential impact on brain science.\r\n\r\n",
