 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to improve our understanding of the energetics \r\nof convection in Earth's mantle and its relation to the evolution of \r\nthe Earth system, including the atmosphere, the ocean, and the core. \r\nThe central theme is the global balance between potential energy \r\nrelease (energy source) and viscous dissipation (energy sink), and in \r\nparticular, energy dissipation associated with the intense \r\ndeformation of stiff lithosphere at subduction zones --- probably the \r\nmost peculiar aspect of plate-tectonic convection. The following two \r\nquestions form the backbone of the proposed research. How does the \r\nmantle actually flow by solid-state creep? Mantle rheology is not \r\nonly controlled by temperature, pressure, and stress, but also \r\naffected by volatile contents, phase transformations, and grain size \r\nevolution. And how can we test various theoretical predictions by \r\nobservations? The PI will study a series of key geodynamical problems \r\nthrough numerical modeling, theoretical analysis, and a compilation \r\nof relevant geological observations. The entire research plan is \r\ncomposed of the following seven sub-themes: (1) the ambient state of \r\nstress in oceanic lithosphere, (2) the energetics of slab rollback, \r\n(3) the onset of convection with internal heating, (4) scaling laws \r\nfor stagnant-lid convection with mantle melting, (5) the initiation \r\nof plate tectonics, (6) the history of ocean volume and global water \r\ncycle, and (7) the nature of core-mantle interaction. Collectively, \r\nthey constitute a major step toward a better understanding of the \r\nlong-term behavior of Earth, by tackling unresolved first-order \r\nissues all together. Moreover, each of them is designed to address a \r\nstand-alone, basic physics problem with potential applications beyond \r\nthe scope of this proposal, reaching out to earthquake seismology, \r\nregional tectonics, planetary sciences, Precambrian geology, igneous \r\npetrology, plume dynamics, and geomagnetism. This proposal includes \r\nthe education of one female Ph.D. student in theoretical geodynamics. \r\nThe PI will also assimilate research results into three existing \r\nundergraduate/graduate courses he regularly teaches at Yale. In \r\naddition, a new 200-level undergraduate course will be developed on \r\nthe physics of Earth's evolution, with hands-on experience in \r\nscientific computing. The PI will also conduct community outreach \r\nthrough the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, to assist K-12 \r\nteachers in developing public school curricula, by showing how \r\ngeophysical topics can be used as friendly examples in science \r\nclasses.\r\n",
