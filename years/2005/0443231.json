Systemic Research is currently engaged in a 24 month grant (9/15/02 - 8/30/04), \"Development and Implementation of a Self-Evaluation and Assessment System for NSF's Tribal Colleges and Universities Program\" (HRD-0223659) to design, develop, and implement TCUP Self Evaluation Template (TSET) and TCUP Performance Indicator Report (TPIR).  TPIR presents both TCUP individual institution's and overall performance reports.\r\n\r\nWithin the context of TCUP goals and relevant GPRA requirements, Systemic\r\nResearch proposes to continue the implementation of a TCUP indicator monitoring system, TSET, and relevant reports for program accountability. Each year Systemic Research will develop and deliver a customized annual TSET instrument to each TCUP site, host a TSET workshop, compile collected TSET data to produce TPIR, and administer the TSET web management system. In the first and second year the project team will conduct three site visits to gather additional information to publish case stories. Other activities will include hosting TCUP advisory panel meetings, presentations at NSF PI/PD meetings, and participating in the relevant national conferences. Systemic Research will provide technical assistance to all TSET grantees, and disseminate outcome reports to TCUP sites, NSF, and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\n",
