 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed program of research focuses on the mathematics prospective elementary teachers have opportunities to learn during their undergraduate education and what they actually learn as a result of their mathematics courses. Although research has identified the problem of teacher knowledge as a significant contributing factor in the generally inadequate quality of K-6 mathematics education, more is known about what teachers do not know than about what they know or have had opportunities to learn. This study will look across institutions and states to examine what prospective teachers are being taught and what they are actually learning. \r\n\r\nThe project will investigate both opportunities to learn and learning from undergraduate mathematics courses through a set of multi-method, multilevel case studies. The work will include an analysis of textbooks written for undergraduate mathematics courses for prospective elementary teachers; an examination of textbook topical coverage and how that correlates with states' mathematics student learning standards; surveys of mathematics departments and instructors of those courses in selected states; case studies of selected courses at institutions within the states; and pre- and post-assessments of student (preservice teacher) learning in those courses. The focal mathematical domains will be multiplication, fractions, and reasoning and proof. \r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to understanding whether prospective elementary teachers are exposed to content that they need for successful teaching, and whether they are learning that content.  The findings will include whether, and to what extent, instructors are teaching content that contributes to mathematical knowledge for teaching. This is new research in areas about which little is known, with important implications for teacher education.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposer's education plan includes teaching undergraduate mathematics courses for elementary teachers at Michigan State University using two approaches currently supported by the Mathematics Department and using that teaching as a site for studying opportunity to learn and teacher knowledge. She will revise a course to introduce PhD students to theoretical and practical issues in assessing teacher knowledge and opportunities to learn. \r\n \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Mathematical Education of Elementary Teachers (MEET) project explored what mathematics is taught, and how it is taught, to future elementary teachers in undergraduate mathematics courses required for certification.  The MEET project spanned the years 2006 &ndash; 2012.  We collected data from 57 institutions in 4 states; 75 instructors of mathematics classes for future elementary teachers; and over 2000 students.  Pre and post tests from students showed significant learning of relevant mathematics, an average effect size of over 0.7 (very large for educational research).   Outcomes were measured using an instrument developed and validated at the University of Michigan.  Analysis (manuscript in preparation) showed that using any one of the textbooks written specifically for a mathematics class for future elementary teachers was the strongest correlate of student learning in these classes, stronger than prior knowledge of the student or qualifications of the instructor.  Another strong correlate was the teaching method: students did better in classes with less lecturing and more direct engagement with math problems.\n\nThe project provided solid evidence that mathematics courses can be key leverage points for improving the mathematical knowledge of elementary teachers. Teacher knowledge can be increased through adequate teacher preparation courses. A surprising result was that the teaching method matters: the most successful courses were those in which instructors reported more \"student-centered\" methods directly engaging students with mathematics rather than having them listen to instructor explanations of mathematics (manuscript in preparation, 2013).\n\nThe results of this project suggest that certifying institutions could improve outcomes for future elementary teachers by providing mathematics courses specifically designed for that population, using textbooks that include content elementary teachers need, and using instructional methods that do more than reteach the content the same way it was taught to the future teachers when they were children.
