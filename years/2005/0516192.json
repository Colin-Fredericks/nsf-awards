 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing and implementing two innovative Information Security degree programs - a Bachelor of Science in Information Security and Assurance (ISA) at Kennesaw State University (KSU), and a concentration in Information Security in the Bachelor of Business Administration in Computer Information Systems degree at Savannah State University (SSU). As a primary focus, these programs are being designed and marketed to increase the participation of women and minorities in information assurance. In addition, a professional development program is being implemented based, in part, on the programs offered through the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS) at Purdue University.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. The two new programs are being developed and implemented according to established curriculum development methods and based on the curricular models of several Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education. \r\n\r\nBroader impact. This project is increasing the production of quality information assurance professionals. By leveraging the resources of KSU's CyberTech program, a three-year program designed to recruit underrepresented high school students into math and science degree programs, the PIs are increasing the representation of these groups in the IA programs and ultimately in the IA field. In addition, the professional development program for KSU and SSU faculty is supporting the continued development of these programs and is laying the groundwork for the regional development of similar academic programs throughout the Southeast at two- and four-year institutions. \r\n\r\n",
