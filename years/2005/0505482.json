 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns the application of Algebraic Topology to the \r\nclassification of high dimensional manifolds. The PI and collaborators have \r\nrecently shown that every finite loop space is homotopy equivalent to a \r\ncompact, smooth manifold, solving a 40 year old problem posed by Browder, \r\nmotivating Surgery Theory. This still leaves open the question whether all \r\nfinite H-spaces have this property.\r\nThe conjectures of Borel, Novikov, Baum-Connes and Farrell-Jones assert that \r\nthe assembly maps in K- and L-theory are either monomorphisms or \r\nisomorphisms. All these assembly maps can be expressed in terms of controlled \r\nalgebra, an area the PIU intends to continue working on, to obtain results \r\nfor larger classes of groups.\r\n\r\nA manifold is a geometrical object which locally is like euclidean space, but \r\nmay be curved globally such as a sphere. These spaces arise both in \r\nmathematics and in Physics. Manifolds have been studied by topologists for \r\nover a hundred years as they hold the key to understanding the nature of \r\nspace. The PI proposes to extend vurrent algebraic classification methods to \r\nachieve a deeper geometric understanding. Of particular significance is \r\ncontrolled algebraic methods, which capture the essence of both algebra and \r\ntopology\r\n",
