Understanding the\r\ndistribution and properties of these stars is important for understanding Galactic chemical evolution,\r\nas well as for constraining the dynamics of supernova explosions and for illuminating the formation\r\nand life-cycles of various type of exotic compact binary systems.\r\nThe most direct constraints on the neutron star distribution come from measurements of parallaxes\r\nand proper motions. In most cases, these measurements can be made only for the subclass of\r\nneutron stars that are luminous at radio wavelengths: the radio pulsars. Even then, the closest radio\r\npulsars are a hundred times the distance of the closest stars, and the effects of parallax and proper\r\nmotion are correspondingly smaller. Only about 1% of pulsars have measured parallaxes and only\r\nabout 10% of pulsars have even crudely measured proper motions.\r\nHere, Thorsett and Dewey will continue their highly successful interferometry program, using the\r\nVery Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array to make very precise astrometric\r\nmeasurements of a large sample of pulsars and address several important questions. The\r\ninvestigation will, over the next three years, measure the birth velocity distribution of neutron stars\r\nwith sufficient accuracy to constrain both the high and low velocity tails (needed to understand\r\nsupernova asymmetries and retention of neutron stars in globular clusters, respectively), and will\r\nimprove understanding of local pulsar distances and the local pulsar birthrate. This plan is based\r\nprimarily on observations that are either underway or already approved.\r\nThe investigations will include student training and support, with project data forming the basis of a\r\nPh.D. thesis. The student and the principle investigators will also maintain formal connections and\r\nparticipate in activities with the Exploratorium science museum and the COSMOS summer\r\nprogram. Co-investigator Dewey is also Education and Public Outreach Director for the UCSC\r\nbranch of Calspace, providing further outreach opportunities.\r\nExternal science investigations will also be enabled by both web and traditional publication of the\r\ndata gathered here. These include identification of the primary target lists for The Gamma-ray Large\r\nArea Space Telescope and other satellite missions, and interpretation of multiwavelength pulsar\r\nemission data. Comparison of the local pulsar birthrate to the massive star birthrate, constrains the\r\nproperties of the progenitors of Type II supernovae. Pulsar velocity measurements not only\r\nconstrain models of their birth events, and are important input parameters to population synthesis\r\nstudies of binary systems. The observations made to identify calibration sources for the Very Long\r\nBaseline Array surveys comprise a large survey sample of 21-cm snapshots of extragalactic sources.",
