 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Biotechnology/Bioinformatics Teacher Discovery!\" project responds to the call for community colleges to recognize and capitalize on their untapped influence on science teacher preparation.  To identify, encourage and support prospective science teachers, this project collaborates with nearby science teacher preparation programs.  Teacher candidates take part in biotechnology workshops jointly with in-service teachers, and have options for biotechnology field experiences in area science classrooms.  Both teacher groups gain science content knowledge and experience with biological technologies as well as web-based technologies.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit.  The proposed project tackles major contemporary challenges: 1) the call for science teachers to gain up-to-date science content and laboratory experiences, founded on inquiry and science standards, and 2) the need to augment the science teacher pipeline.  The technology-intensive content is the broad new wave of science: genomics, biotechnology, bioinformatics, integrative biology, and bioethics.  Both teacher groups learn how their students can use Internet access and public databases to address biology questions.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts.  With the two university teacher preparation programs within commuting distance, this project provides a model for other community colleges in the state and beyond.  The Oklahoma City Public Schools sites in this project offer alternative education and are rich in underrepresented groups: 36% African Americans, 6% Native Americans, and 27% Hispanics.  \"Biotechnology/Bioinformatics Teacher Discovery!\" exposes teacher candidates to diversity and recruits minority students into science teaching.  The project makes a significant contribution to the science-learning infrastructure of a school district challenged by poverty, ethnic diversity, and meager science facilities.",
