 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are proposing a conference centered on the theme of evaluating future\r\ndirections in the development of 3-dimensional geometry and topology.\r\nThe purpose of the conference is to review significant recent developments\r\nin the theory of 3-manifolds and to discuss how they will affect the course\r\nof future research.  The conference will be held at the University of\r\nMichigan at Ann Arbor. The planned dates for the conference are May 6 \r\nto May 9, 2005.\r\nWe expect 50 to 80 participants, about one third of whom will  be \r\ngraduate students.Some talks will be tailored specifically for graduate students.\r\n\r\nSeveral important recent developments that are likely to influence the\r\nfuture of 3-dimensional geometry and topology.\r\n1.  The work of Grisha Pereleman on the evolution of a metric on a \r\n3-dimensional manifold under the Ricci flow is still being absorbed and reviewed by the mathematical community. It is clear however that it has the potential to radically \r\nchange the directions and techniques used in the study of 3-dimensional topology and related fields. The aim for this conference is not to focus on the details of Pereleman's methods but rather on their implications.  What other problems are amenable to study by Ricci flow techniques?  Which \r\nof the traditional theorems and results of 3-manifold theory become subsumed in \r\ngeometrization? What questions become important if Pereleman's geometrization results hold \r\nup. What are the implications to related areas such as geometric group theory and the \r\ndifferential geometry of surfaces in 3-manifolds? Will the entire field of 3-manifolds \r\nbecome less important with this major problem solved, or will  go on to have even greater importance?\r\n2. What are the likely future developments in  Geometric Group Theory, and in\r\nTopological  Methods in Group Theory, areas largely based on ideas  from 3-manifold\r\ntheory.  Stallings first, and more recently Rips and Sela  have shown that 3-manifolds\r\nare prototypes in many ways for general finitely presented groups.\r\n3. Ozsvath and Szabo have developed a theory of holomorphic curves associated\r\nto Heegaard decompositions of closed 3-manifolds, leading to what they call\r\n\"Heegaard Floer homology\". What impact will this have in understanding 3-manifolds\r\nand to other areas? Related to this  is the work of Khovanov  and Rasmussen defining\r\nand applying a Jones polynomial homology.\r\n4. Four dimensional techniques such as gauge theory and related topics have had\r\nsome applications to problems in 3-manifolds. Thus Kronheimer and Mrowka\r\ngive a proof of Property P   (also implied by geometrization). What further\r\nimpact on 3-manifold theory are such techniques likely to have?\r\n5. Many invariants of knots and 3-manifolds have been developed over \r\nthe last two decades, including knot polynomials, finite type invariants etc. How useful \r\nare these in understanding 3-manifolds? What ties do they have to geometric properties of \r\nmanifolds such as hyperbolic volume?\r\n6. Are there significant emerging opportunities to apply the methods of 3-manifold\r\ntheory to areas such as Computational Geometry  and Cosmology  as well as fields\r\nsuch as Computer Aided Design and Computational Complexity. What ties are developing between the theory of 3-manifolds and such disciplines?",
