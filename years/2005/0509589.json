 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical description: We will develop mathematical models and\r\ncomputational tools to analyze optical resonance phenomena in\r\nnanostructured materials. The proposed research will focus on resonant\r\ninteraction of optical fields with metallic nanoparticles and on\r\nnegative refractive index phenomena in optical materials with double\r\nresonance (electric and magnetic field).  We will study nonlinear\r\ncoupling of material and light excitations and their applications.\r\nTraditional resonant optics which is limited to exploiting resonance\r\nof electric fields with atomic systems revolutionized science and\r\ntechnology by introducing lasers. Current development in nanomaterial\r\nfabrication makes it possible to add an additional resonant\r\ninteraction, that of a magnetic field with the embedded nanostructure.\r\nThis brings exotic properties such as negative refractive index into\r\nthe optical domain. It is important to study the properties of such\r\nmaterials using consistently derived equations that describe the\r\ndoubly resonant interaction.  This is considerably more challenging\r\nthan simply including negative values for permittivity and\r\npermeability. We will develop a description of the optical double\r\nresonance phenomena starting from first principles and analyze its\r\nphysical consequences including negative refractive index. We will\r\nalso analyze the classical phenomena of nonlinear optics in doubly\r\nresonant materials.  Our pilot research with ultra-short pulses has\r\nalready shown that for very simple nanomaterials, optical control\r\nusing phase, including trapping of light is feasible.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: This project will make important contributions to \r\nbasic science.  It can lead to applications in materials science and\r\nto high performance computing.  One of the principle targets of the\r\nwork is negative refractive index material.  These materials could be\r\nof great practical value.  Optimization of the design of such\r\nmaterials will be a central result of our research and requires a\r\nfundamental understanding of the nature of the interaction of light\r\nand such nano-structures.  One of the more important applications for\r\nnegative refractive index materials is superlenses.  Such a lens\r\npermits much improved focusing of light compared to current\r\ncapabilities. This would allow production of electronic components\r\nusing photolithography with much higher densities and finer features\r\nleading to greatly increased computation power and lower cost. In\r\naddition, other types of nano-optical materials can lead to novel\r\noptical logic devices and short term memory buffers. Designer optical\r\nmaterials are very close to realization; their full potential will\r\nonly be realized if the fundamental physical and mathematical models\r\nare understood.\r\n",
