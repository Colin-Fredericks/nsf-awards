 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to understand the evolutionary physiology of reproductive strategies in Southern Ocean marine invertebrates. The fauna of the Southern Ocean has evolved under stable, cold temperatures for approximately 14 million years. These conditions have led to the evolution of unusual physiological and biochemical characteristics, many of which may reflect adaptations to relatively low oxygen availability and high larval oxygen demands. The goal of the proposed projects is to understand latitudinal variation in the function of invertebrate egg masses in relation to oxygen availability and temperature. This relationship is critical to larval survival in the low-temperature, high-oxygen conditions found at high latitudes. In particular, the investigators will: (1) use first principles to model the diffusion of oxygen into egg and embryo masses of Antarctic organisms at environmentally relevant temperatures; (2) test model assumptions by measuring the temperature-dependence of embryonic metabolism and oxygen diffusivity through natural and artificial gels; (3) test model predictions by using oxygen microelectrodes to measure oxygen gradients in both artificial and natural egg masses, and by measuring developmental rates of embryos at different positions in masses; and (4) compare the structure and function of egg masses from the Southern Ocean to those from temperate waters.  These components of the study constitute an integrated examination of the evolutionary physiology of egg mass structure and function. Studies of masses endemic to polar conditions will increase the understanding of egg mass evolution across equator-to-pole gradients in temperature and across gradients in oxygen partial pressure. The proposal will support graduate students and will involve several undergraduates in research. The PIs will also design and implement units on polar biology for undergraduate classes at their respective institutions. These educational units will focus on the PIs' photographs, video footage, experiments, and data from this project. The PIs will use web-linked video and instructional technologies to design and co-teach a new class on polar ecological physiology, will work with local grade school institutions to involve high school students in research, and will develop high school course modules about polar biology.",
