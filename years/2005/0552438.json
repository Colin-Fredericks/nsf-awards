 "awd_abstract_narration": "0552438  Seal  Supply of safe drinking water following disasters is essential for life support of the affected population. Recently, hurricane Katrina left New Orleans Louisiana, Biloxi Mississippi and several other Gulf Coast Cities without drinking water. There is a need to develop methods that can be easily mobilized and will consistently produce safe and aesthetically acceptable drinking water. Although there are several processes that are used to produce drinking water, membrane process are capable of universally removing more physical, biological and chemical contaminants that any other process, but are highly susceptible to fouling, which would render them useless for emergency drinking water supply. This proposal will address the integration of fouling control based on nanoparticles into a mobile integrated membrane system that would greatly diminish or eliminate fouling and thereby provide a reliable and mobile means of consistently supplying safe and aesthetically acceptable drinking water for emergency response. \r\n\r\n",
