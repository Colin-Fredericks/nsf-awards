 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0504367\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Charles P. Boyer and Krzysztof Galicki\r\n\r\nProfessors Boyer and Galicki propose to investigate several\r\nprojects in geometry and topology. The objective of all the\r\nprojects is to study fundamental questions in Riemannian Geometry\r\nwith two main focal points: Contact Geometry of orbifold bundles\r\nover Calabi-Yau and Fano varieties and the existence of some\r\nspecial (i.e., Einstein, positive Ricci curvature, transversely\r\nCalabi-Yau) metrics on such spaces.  The questions and problems\r\nproposed here are deeply rooted in the principal investigators'\r\nearlier work which exploited a fundamental relationship between\r\ncontact geometry of Sasakian-Einstein spaces and two kinds of\r\nKaehler geometry, namely Q-factorial Fano varieties with\r\nKaehler-Einstein orbifold metrics with positive scalar curvature,\r\nand Calabi-Yau manifolds with their Kaehler Ricci-flat\r\nmetrics. Most recently the principal investigators and J. Kollar\r\nhave solved an open problem in Riemannian geometry. We have\r\nproved the existence of Einstein metrics on exotic spheres in a\r\npaper to appear in the Annals of Mathematics.  Furthermore, we\r\nhave shown that odd dimensional homotopy spheres that bound\r\nparallelizable manifolds admit an enormous number of Einstein\r\nmetrics. In fact, the number of deformation classes as well as\r\nthe number of moduli of Sasakian-Einstein metrics grow double\r\nexponentially with dimension.  The techniques used by the\r\nprincipal investigators borrow from several different fields; the\r\nalgebraic geometry of Mori theory and intersection theory, the\r\nanalysis of the Calabi Conjecture, and finally the classical\r\ndifferential topology of links of isolated hypersurface\r\nsingularities. These methods can be extended much further and in\r\nvarious directions.  More generally the principal investigators\r\nwant to address several classification problems concerning\r\ncompact Sasakian-Einstein manifolds in dimensions 5 and 7.  These\r\ntwo dimensions are important for two separate reasons.  In view\r\nof earlier work higher dimensional examples can be constructed\r\nusing the join construction. At the same time these two odd\r\ndimensions appear to play special role in Superstring Theory. In\r\nthe context of recent developements in String and M-Theory the\r\nprincipal investigators also propose to investigate some related\r\nproblems concerning self-dual Einstein metrics in dimension 4.\r\n\r\nMathematics is the foundation upon which our modern technology is\r\nbuilt, and much of its understanding and development must preceed\r\ntechnological progress.  Nevertheless, our research into a\r\nparticular type of geometry is closely linked to some important\r\nproblems in modern Theoretical Physics and should provide an\r\nimportant mathematical basis for their understanding. For\r\nexample, the mathematical models that we are studying are\r\ncurrently being used in supersymmetric string theory which is a\r\nmodel for the unification of gravity with the other fundamental\r\nforces of nature. This also has applications to the Physics of\r\nblack holes.\r\n",
