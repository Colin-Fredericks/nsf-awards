 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of great achievements of 20th century science was the determination of the structures of thousands of soluble proteins and several membrane proteins. As we move into the 21st century, scientists realize that some of the most important states of proteins are the aggregated states, including amyloid and prion states. Protein aggregates frequently contain one type of covalent protein molecule. The nature of the self-complementary bonding that leads to aggregation is the topic of this research. Designing, creating, controlling, and destroying protein aggregates is the long-term goal of this research. The tools of X-ray diffraction and biochemistry will be used to characterize natural and designed protein aggregates, all of which self-assemble through protein self-complementarity. Domain-swapping, a particular type of protein self-complementarity will be a special focus of the work. In domain swapping, one domain breaks its non-covalent bonds with the core of the molecule, and into its place is swapped the identical domain from the other monomer, forming a tightly associated, long-lived dimer. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The wider impact of the project includes the introduction of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to the concepts and experimental tools for studying protein design and the characterization of protein aggregates. Understanding self-complementarity of proteins has implications for protein design, materials science, medicine, evolution, and cell biology.",
