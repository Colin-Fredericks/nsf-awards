Student winners are invited to attend and present their research at the AMSE's annual design technical meetings, the IDETC; each student receives up to $1,000 to support their travel to the conference and participation. ASME DED has been a cosponsor of this essay contest, providing an opportunity for students to present posters relating to their work and awards for winners. We are committed to providing opportunities for all students, regardless of their university, advisor, gender, ethnic background or disability to have the opportunity of earning their way to IDETC so that they may learn about and participate in current design research. NSF has sponsored this contest since 1998.",
