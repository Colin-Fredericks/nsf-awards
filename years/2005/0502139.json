The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a twenty-two-month research fellowship by Dr. Sarah E. Tully to work with Dr. Pauline M. Rudd at Oxford University in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nMost successful vaccines utilize the power of neutralizing antibodies to elicit their effects. Development of such a vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been hampered due to the ability of envelope protein carbohydrates to protect the peptide backbone from antibody recognition. Recently, human antibody 2G12, an antibody that neutralizes a broad range of HIV-1 isolates, was found to recognize a cluster of carbohydrate moieties on the envelope protein. Generation of a library of glycoproteins similar to the 2G12 antibody would enable the development of different antibodies for HIV-1 vaccine formulations. To create such a library, the PI and her host are developing a convergent synthetic approach for the production of N-linked glycoproteins. Their methodology will have broad-based utility such that glycans, derived from chemical synthesis or from purified glycoprotein hydrolysates, can be attached without protecting groups to a synthetic peptide sequence in water with establishment of the correct b-aspartyl amide linkage present in N-linked glycoproteins. They will then explore the utility of their synthetic approach by constructing a glycoprotein library expressing two mannose-rich glycan structures in spatially-resolved loci as a model for the epitope of 2G12 and as an antigen for the generation of anibodies with similar activity.\r\n\r\nDr. Rudd's laboratory has established numerous international research collaborations with some of the best laboratories in glycobiology.\r\n",
