The design of these emergent, software-intensive single chip heterogeneous multiprocessor (SCHM)  computer systems precludes the possibility of seat-of-the-pants analysis or specify-and-synthesize methodologies. No science of design has been developed for mixed hardware/software single chip multiprocessing systems.  Strategic computer system organization - requires a creative proces that can not be automateds,and thus this designer creativity must be facilitated at the system level.  The full vision of this research is to develop the science needed to enable future design systems to break away from the specify-and-synthesize mind set of current CAD tools to become a characterize-and-invent paradigm that still has ties into the current lower level integrated circuit design methodology flows. Another major theme behind our research is that computer system designers start from trend analyses, looking for future cross-over points between anticipated changes in the major features of applications sets and the physical capabilities of the major architectural features of the systems that carry them out. From these, design strategies are invented which can become basic organizing themes for entire classes of programmable systems.\r\n\r\n",
