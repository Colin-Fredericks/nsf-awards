 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental challenge for many mobile computing applications is data\r\nmanagement. Data should be available anywhere at anytime.  However,\r\nthis task is particularly difficult to support with respect to\r\nmanaging a user's personal data (e.g., data files, email, and cached\r\nweb pages) across a collection of personal devices (e.g., a laptop,\r\nPDA, and mobile phone).  Two properties of the mobile environment make\r\ndata management particularly challenging: network disconnection and\r\ndevice resource constraints, particularly energy constraints.  The\r\ngoal of this work is to provide maximal availability and consistency\r\nof personal data as well as maximal aggregate device lifetime for a\r\ncollection of personal devices.  To accomplish this goal, the project\r\ndevelops a set of cooperative prefetching algorithms that enable\r\ndevices to retrieve relevant data when connected to the information\r\nsource.  Further, the algorithms efficiently distribute the energy\r\nburden of performing prefetching across the collection of devices.\r\nThe evaluation investigates the performance of the algorithms in an\r\nimplementation running on a collection of laptop computers and iPAQs.\r\nTwo primary metrics are considered: the aggregate lifetime of the\r\ndevices and the hit rate of user requests for data.  The overarching\r\nimpacts of this work will be improved usability of mobile devices and\r\napplications and maximization of mobile device lifetime.  Further, the\r\nstudent participants in this project are undergraduate women from\r\nMount Holyoke College, one of the nation's finest all-women\r\nundergraduate institutions.  Therefore, the project will also serve to\r\nimprove the overall participation of women in systems research.\r\n",
