A key ingredient is to make use of the considerable skills and talents of faculty and staff presently in science and the arts departments, and also utilizes the infrastructure of public performance and meeting spaces at colleges and universities, as well as the off-campus facilities and talent within their local environments. This allows this project to become national in scope.\r\nThis project also brings together the creativity of the performing arts with the project management tools of science, in order to insure that progress towards the goals are understandable as well as measurable.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report\n\nScience as Performance: A Proactive Strategy to Communicate and Educate through Theater, Music and Dance is a program created by Principal Investigator Brian Schwartz, Professor of Physics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (CUNY).\n\nFor the past 10 years Professor Schwartz has produced the series Science &amp; the Arts at the Graduate Center to communicate to the general public and students joy and relevance of science through the medium of the arts.  (See: http://web.gc.cuny.edu/sciart )  Each semester approximately 6 science-related performances are presented to the public at no cost.  Over the years we have offered a wide range of events from a full day symposium on the science, history and art of the play Copenhagen on the event of the opening of the play in New York to Science to a Samba Beat with Nobel Laureate chemist Roald Hoffman and the band Samba New York! to readings of plays about Einstein to Ferocious Beauty: Dance and Genetics with choreographer Liz Lerman to The Best Mind Since Einstein with discussants Freeman Dyson and Arthur Giron to Crocheting the Hyperbolic Plane with mathematicians and knitters to an original, multi-media concert of the Big Bang to a 10-day symposia in partnership with the Metropolitan Opera for the preview of the John Adams opera Doctor Atomic. Information about these events and many, many others are available on the website indicated above.\n\nUsing this series as a model, Science as Performance has partnered with colleges, universities and community colleges around the country to help those institutions present &ndash; at very modest costs - science events to community audiences of all ages, ethnicities and levels of previous science education.\n\nFour years of rigorous evaluation activities have confirmed the intellectual merit of the grant activities, as well as, the success of the model.  The overwhelmingly enthusiastic responses of the audiences who attend each performance confirm that the performing arts are able to make science accessible, relevant and exciting to new and diverse groups of individuals in ways that provide both serious scientific content and significant artistic and entertainment values.\n\nA broader impact of this program has been to expand the role of an informed citizenry in our society.  Given that so many crucial societal issues: health care, global climate change, national defense, poverty and energy have major scientific components, it is essential for public policy-making in a democracy to nurture the development of informed and engaged citizens.  In addition, we have shown that by introducing science in new and creative ways we can encourage scientific literacy and even lead increasing numbers of students to consider scientific careers.\n\nThe grant culminated with a 3-day international conference held at the Graduate Center last year highlighting the very latest developments in the field of science and the arts. Visit the conference website at http://www.sciartconference2010.com  for videos of the talks and performances. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian B Schwartz"
