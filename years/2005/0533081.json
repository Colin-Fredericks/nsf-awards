 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will test the hypothesis that a new or emerging viral disease in the cause of egg failures and significant mortality in fledgling common tern (Sterna hirundo) and arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) populations in the coastal northeastern United States. Additional goals include the attainment of basic information concerning the nature of the virus, its pathogenesis, and the optimal laboratory methods for its diagnosis. This project will lead to a better understanding of the circumstances that favor the emergence of new viral diseases in avian species, how the lifestyles of these species affect disease maintenance and spread, and the impact of a new disease on a small fragmented and managed avian population. Avian viral diseases have become of increasing concern, especially with the spread of avian flu. The proposed research could become a model system for the study of disease ecology in avian viruses. The populations being studied are endangered and this work will be crucial for population management. \r\n",
