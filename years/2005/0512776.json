 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is developing both an instrument and a procedure that are specifically designed to allow students to assess their individual and team effectiveness using a web-based peer evaluation process.  The process is being designed to  correct for rater-bias (e.g., halo, leniency, severity) automatically. With this instrument, engineering faculty can determine: (1) how successful a teaming experience actually is for participating students, (2) the impact of team training methods on the teaming experience, (3) what team formation strategies best promote course learning objectives, and (4) the types of intervention strategies that will improve overall team functionality. Indicators of effective teams are being based on peer evaluations for each team member, as provided by other team members. Vignettes are being used to investigate the accuracy of students' ratings of team members, and to correct for rater bias, as compared to expert judgments, in actual peer ratings. Students' perceptions of functionality are being operationalized in terms of a self-report instrument requiring students to indicate the degree their team is working together across a range of domains, including interdependency, learning, potency, and goal-setting.  In evaluating their project, the investigators are comparing the attitudes of students who have used the instrument to those of earlier students who did not.  They also are cross-validating effectiveness prediction with an instructor's observations of team effectiveness and with the students' course grades.  In addition an Assessment Review Panel meets semi-annually to monitor progress and identify problems.  The approach is being tested at three other institutions.  The investigators plan to present and publish their work in both engineering education and general higher education research venues.",
