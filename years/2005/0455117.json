 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stereochemical composition exerts strong and sometimes surprising effects on the \r\ndynamic and static properties of polymers, as illustrated by the dependence of the miscibility of a \r\npolypropylene melt on the stereochemical composition of the chains. This subtle effect has been \r\ncaptured and explained by the PI in prior simulations performed with support from NSF. The PI \r\nand Co-PI will now address the influence of stereochemical composition in two other important \r\nareas: The nanoscale objects spontaneously formed by dendronized polymers with a backbone \r\nthat raises tacticity as an issue, and the detailed analysis of melt dynamics when the molecular \r\nweight and monomer unit are held constant, and stereochemical composition is the only variable. \r\nThe proposed simulations of dendronized polymers, using a new bridging method developed by \r\nthe PI, will identify procedures that control the stabilities of nanoscale objects, search for new \r\nobjects not yet realized (but potentially realizable) in the laboratory, and determine the approach \r\nthat should be taken if bends are required at specific positions in nanoscale rods. In the dynamic \r\nstudy, the Co-PI will examine polypropylene melts by various nmr techniques that provide the \r\ntranslational diffusion coefficient and also characterize the local mobility. This information will \r\nbe used by the PI for a critical test of the fundamental basis for the dynamic Monte Carlo method \r\nin the study of polymer dynamics. This critical test avoids using the molecular weight as a \r\nvariable, and instead focuses on the changes in mobility with alterations in the stereochemical \r\ncomposition of polypropylene chains. This part of the project will benefit from collaboration \r\nwith Prof. Theodorou (National Technical University, Athens), who will provide mobility data \r\nfrom classical Molecular Dynamics simulations of the same systems that are studied by dynamic \r\nMonte Carlo methods by the PI and nmr by the Co-PI. The intellectual merit of this research is \r\nthe development of new methods for understanding and predicting the structures of sophisticated \r\ndendronized polymers that promise to be important in newly emerging nanotechnologies, and \r\nproviding a critical assessment for a popular simulation technique, dynamic Monte Carlo, that is \r\nsomewhat controversial because it purports to provide dynamic information without explicitly \r\ntaking account of the momenta of the components of the system. \r\n \r\nThe project has several broader impacts. It contributes to fundamental knowledge by a \r\ncritical assessment of the basis for the dynamic Monte Carlo method and by creating a new \r\napproach to the development and control of nanoscale objects based on polymers. The insights \r\ngained from the project are used by the PI and Co-PI in their formal and informal instruction of \r\nyoung scientists (undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, visiting scientists) in the \r\nclassroom and in their research groups. The PI also uses this knowledge in continuing education \r\nof professionals in industry, through his direction of the ACS short course on Molecular \r\nModeling of Polymers. His students and postdocs assist in this short course, thereby gaining \r\nvaluable insights from the industrial participants, and assisting in the education of the \r\nparticipants by sharing their learning experience in the use of simulations to understand and \r\npredict the properties of polymers. The PI will endeavor to expand on his successful record of \r\nassisting in the placement of underrepresented groups in the professorial ranks by employing \r\noutstanding young scientists from such groups in the project.",
