SSCN will bring together leading researchers in the field to assess the current\r\nstate of research and areas for future research and application. Participation is open and\r\nthe Symposium has been announced in important conference and in relevant electronic\r\nmedia.\r\nSSCN draws upon many disciplines, including system theory, control theory, computer and\r\ncommunication networks, signal processing, information and coding theory, networking and\r\nprotocols, economic and gaming analysis, distributed algorithms, and wireless\r\ncommunications. A total of approximately 250 attendees are expected to participate in\r\nthis conference.\r\nA budget of $10,000 is requested to support this conference. The funds will be used to\r\npartially pay for travel expenses for some of the attendees who do not have other\r\nresources to support their participation in this very unique meeting.",
