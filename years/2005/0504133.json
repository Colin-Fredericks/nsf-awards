 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary   \r\nIn 2005 R/V Atlantis will continue her primary mission as support ship for Alvin and vehicles from the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF) while also carrying out general oceanographic research.  The ATLANTIS has a 271 day schedule this year, and 233 of these days are in support of NSF funded research programs.  This is a five year cooperative agreement, and funding for each year of the agreement will be negotiated and is dependent on the number of days at sea in support of NSF-funded research.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe ship support requested in this proposal is required for the fieldwork of 14 NSF research projects. These programs have been rigorously evaluated for scientific and intellectual merit as an integral part of the NSF award process. The highly competitive nature of the award granting process ensures a very high level of intellectual merit. The knowledge gained and the discoveries made by the research programs on Atlantis will enhance our understanding of the oceans and address a broad range of important scientific questions.  Researchers will be provided with the equipment, and skilled shipboard personnel, required to safely and productively pursue their scientific endeavors at sea.  The Atlantis serves as the platform for these research programs.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts Statement \r\nThe sea-going research programs supported in 2005 and subsequent years will be important in understanding the formation and structure of ocean crust created at fast spreading ridges, determining gene flow, species diversity, and biogeography of hydrothermal vent communities at several widely separated locations, and test new mooring technology to telemeter data from networks of seafloor sensors to shore in near-real-time. These intellectual endeavors will continue to broaden our understanding of the oceans, spur new questions, and confirm scientific theory for years to come.\r\n\r\nAn oceanographic expedition is in many respects an extension of the classroom. Cruise legs are staffed by a diverse mix of senior and junior scientists, post-doctoral investigators, engineers, technicians and graduate and undergraduate students. These cruises are extraordinary educational experiences that expose all of these participants to new ideas, teach fundamental scientific principles, and raise questions that stimulate new thinking about how the oceans work. Over the past several years an increased awareness of our responsibility to bring science into the classroom, and to the general public, has resulted in the development of new avenues to share scientific findings. The cruise web site concept has been very effective in reaching the classroom with real-time images, data and two-way communication between scientists and students in schools around the world. This extends the sea-going experience from the handful of participants on a single leg to thousands of students, as well as to the general public. Several cruises are planning to use this tool to present their data through web-based approaches either at their home institution or through web sites maintained by community organizations (e.g. RIDGE2000). The WHOI web site (http://www.whoi.edu) has pioneered efforts to present the results of sea-going projects to the general public (e.g. the Dive and Discover web site: http://science.whoi.edu/DiveDiscover), and we are continuing to develop new ways of using the WHOI web site to convey the excitement and importance of seagoing research to a larger audience. \r\n\r\n",

R/V Atlantis averaged approximately 12 voyages per year with an average of 267 days of operation during this period.  R/V Atlantis contributed many special advances in oceanographic explorations of the world\u00c6s oceans between 2005 and 2012.  \nUnique contributions to science where made from R/V Atlantis during this Cooperative Agreement Grant.  R/V Atlantis is the only ship in the world modified to support the deep diving human occupied submersible Alvin.  This system, R/V Atlantis and Alvin, has proven to be an important national asset contributing to science by executing voyages for up to 10 Principal Investigators (PIs) per year through 2010 when Alvin was delivered to Woods Hole for overhaul.  The capabilities of this system are further enhanced when an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), such as Sentry, is added to the mix.   PIs such as Dr. Valentine have demonstrated the powerfulness of this combination of assets in his study of microbial geochemistry of natural marine gas seeps in the Catalina Channel.  Dr. Sinton has demonstrated the same powerfulness of capability by teaming R/V Atlantis with Alvin and Sentry in studying the Galapagos Spreading Center in 2010.  The power of the R/V Atlantis and Alvin team was demonstrated in late 2009 when R/V Atlantis was scheduled to deploy on an expedition from Mexico right before Christmas with a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV).  The ROV did not arrive to the proper port.  On any other Research Vessel, this would have marked the cancellation of the voyage.  Instead, the voyage was executed on schedule by having R/V Atlantis deploy Alvin for the expedition to the East Pacific Rise.  \nDuring Alvin\u00c6s overhaul, R/V Atlantis positively contributed to science by executing successful Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) expeditions in 2012.  R/V Atlantis also demonstrated the exceptional performance of its 1 by 1 EM-122 deep sea surveying multi-beam system for an important continental shelf expedition for the US NOAA agency and the Canadian Hydrographic Survey agency.  The ability of R/V Atlantis to deploy ROVs such as Jason and ROPOS, with Alvin stored in its onboard hangar, were demonstrated throughout this Cooperative Agreement period.  \nThe research findings that are published from the cruises will advance understanding of the world\u00c6s oceans and this ecosystem.  Real-time images and live conversations were broadcasted from these voyages into classrooms of the USA.  Knowledge gained and the discoveries made by the research programs supported by R/V Atlantis enhanced the understanding of the oceans and addressed a broad range of important questions in all the scientific disciplines.  These broader impacts were achieved through the operational support funding provided from this grant.  These intellectual endeavors broaden the understanding of the oceans, spur new questions, and confirm scientific theory, benefiting society at large.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Albert F Suchy"
