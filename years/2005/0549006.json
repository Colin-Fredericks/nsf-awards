 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nOne important problem in peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay distributed systems is\r\nto enforce the trust of the data stored in the system, and protect the\r\nsecurity and privacy of the peers. However, current research addresses\r\nthis problem in two directions with independent efforts: privacy and\r\nsecurity. In the privacy direction, researchers focus on proposing\r\nanonymity protocols to hide peers' identities and on how to prevent the\r\nattackers from revealing peers' identities. In the security direction, one\r\nmajor research focus is to detect the identities of peers who are\r\nsuspicious to disturb normal operations in P2P systems intentionally or\r\nunintentionally. If a peer can absolutely hide his/her identity, the\r\nanonymity protocol can be possibly abused to threat the Internet security.\r\nIncreasing peers' privacy means increasing the difficulties to ensure\r\nsecurity. In this project, the PI conducts research to understand and\r\nprovide solutions on balancing the tradeoffs between privacy and security\r\nin P2P systems. Specifically, (1) the PI develops anonymity communication\r\nprotocols to provide privacy protection for P2P users with security\r\ninsurance; (2) taking overlay distributed denial-of-service and file\r\nintegrity as case studies for security issues, the PI develops technical\r\nsecurity solutions without conflict with privacy requirements; (3) the\r\nresearch investigates a wide range of security issues by developing\r\nsecurity solutions to balance tradeoffs of privacy and security. This\r\nproject is integrated to a Microsoft sponsored undergraduate course\r\ndevelopment, where important topics of networking security and privacy,\r\ndesign of decentralized P2P systems are being studied.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n",
