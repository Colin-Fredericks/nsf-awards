 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kansas will acquire instrumentation for time correlated single photon counting. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: a) characterization of three-dimensional DNA-dendrimers and aptamers for sensitive fluorescence detection; b) characterization of protein dynamics and interactions and fast orientational dynamics and distributions of structures in short-chain peptides; c) fast photophysical and photochemical events involved in reagent release in new, water-soluble caged-release compounds; and d) dynamics and unfolding in cytochromes with dissociated hemes.  \r\n\r\nMeasuring time resolved fluorescence affords researchers direct insight into the local environment and dynamics around a probe.  Techniques developed to monitor time resolved fluorescence have been broadly applied to established fields such as photobiology as well as newly emerging areas in materials chemistry.  The new instrument will also significantly enhance training of students at both the undergraduate  and graduate levels at the University of Kansas.  A large  group of undergraduate  and  graduate students will have the opportunity to learn and  apply  advanced fluorescence methods in coursework and research.   Undergraduate participation will occur through (i) a new experiment in the physical chemistry laboratory  course (ii) an independent project component of the advanced undergraduate analytical and physical chemistry laboratory courses; (iii) undergraduate research carried out by undergraduate chemistry majors at Kansas or by students in an active Research Experience for Undergraduates (NSF REU) program, which has been successful at involving underrepresented groups.  Graduate students in Chemistry and in Molecular Biosciences enrolled in advanced courses will be given hands-on training in advanced fluorescence measurements on this instrument.   \r\n",
