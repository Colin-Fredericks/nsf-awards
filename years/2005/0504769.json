This research focuses on the search for new compounds and the investigation of existing novel compounds.  A unique device for measuring the thermal expansion will be employed that has a relative resolution 10,000 times better than existing techniques.  These high-resolution data will reveal information about the structural and magnetic transitions that will expand our fundamental understanding of novel solids.  Improvement of the thermal expansion device will be pursued over the project's duration.  Magnetic, thermal, electrical transport and structural data will compliment the thermal expansion data and enable detailed theoretical analysis.  Sample preparation, including single crystal growth, is integrated into the work.  National and international collaborations widen the potential impact of the project by sharing samples, infrastructure, and expertise.  The research enhances cultural diversity and human resources in science by providing educational opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and Native American high school students.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nNovel condensed matter compounds which exhibit superconducting or magnetic behavior  will be studied in this research.  Thermal expansion, heat capacity, and magnetic measurements will allow extraction of the critical exponents associated with the thermodynamic phase transitions of some important magnetic compounds; this aspect involves close collaboration with a theorist and will lead to new analysis methods and improved understanding of critical phenomena in condensed matter systems.  Thermal expansion measurements will be conducted on MgB2 and NaxCoO2 to reveal information regarding anisotropic coupling of the lattice to the unusual superconducting ground states as well as general structural information, but with a relative resolution exceeding that of x-ray or neutron diffraction by four orders of magnitude.  Sample synthesis and single crystal growth projects are integrated into the work to search for new compounds with interesting magnetic and electrical properties. National and international collaborations widen the potential impact of the project by sharing samples, infrastructure, and expertise. The research enhances cultural diversity and human resources in science by providing educational opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and Native American high school students.",
