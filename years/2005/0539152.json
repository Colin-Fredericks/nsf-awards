 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will apply the Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS) methodology for assessment of fluid-thermal systems using combined experiment and simulation. Engineering applications involving fluid-thermal systems are characterized by complex three-dimensional flows with incomplete knowledge of boundary conditions in critical subsystems and limited access for experimental diagnostics. An example is the combustor in a turbofan engine wherein the thermal boundary conditions on the combustor can surface are not known a priori (i.e., the surface temperature distribution is not known) and access for optical diagnostics is severely limited. The DDDAS-based methodology synergizes experiment and simulation to achieve an assessment of the fluid-thermal system; in particular, to determine the surface temperature distribution to a reasonable level of accuracy.  The specific application is a turbulent jet injected normally into a subsonic or supersonic equilibrium turbulent boundary layer. By analogy to a combustor or furnace, the experimental diagnostics are assumed to be limited to optical measurements (specifically, diode laser absorbance at various wavelengths) within a restricted region (to simulate limited access in the actual configuration, e.g., combustor). Simulations will be performed using the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the k-e model of turbulence. Both non-reacting and reacting flows will be considered.\r\n\r\nThe proposed DDDAS-based methodology for assessment of fluid-thermal systems using experiment and simulation has potentially broader applications in engineering systems (e.g., chemical and biochemical engineering, civil engineering, etc).",
