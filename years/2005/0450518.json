 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a sub-micron x-ray tomography scanner  capable of providing in-vivo and high resolution images of specimens from mice to bacteria. In this era of molecular medicine, where disease and developmental disorders are being re-defined by  their  peculiar  molecular,  genetic  or  cellular  profiles,  there  exists  a  significant  disparity  between  the  type  of  information  gleaned  from  histological  methods  and  that  obtained  from conventional non-invasive imaging modalities.  With a resolution that is better than these imaging  modalities and more than ten times higher than that of current x-ray imaging systems, the proposed  device  will generate  images  of  development  and  disease  not  possible  by  current  methods.    The Phase II  research  will  concentrate  on  the  development  of  the  x-ray optical system, including beam conditioning, tomographic imaging capability, and the imaging x-ray lens, and will result in a table-top commercial prototype computerized tomographic imager with 400 nm resolution.  \r\n \r\nThe commercial application of this project will be in the area of medical research. When compared to existing in-vivo imaging technologies, the higher resolution of the proposed  x-ray  imager  will  translate  to  improved  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  morphologic changes  associated  with  growth  and  disease.  Researchers  will  be  able  to  use  this  tool  for  investigations of a number of medical conditions, including tumor angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis and arthritis.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
