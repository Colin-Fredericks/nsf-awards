 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-LAMP) is a statewide, comprehensive\r\nsystemic mentoring program aimed at rapidly increasing the number and quality of minority students earning baccalaureate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and actively promoting their transition to STEM graduate schools for the pursuit of terminal degrees (Ph.D.). The primary goals and objectives of LS-LAMP, Phase III, are, 1) to consolidate and to augment the achievements of Phases I and II and 2) to emphasize and to maximize the transition of minority BS degree holders in STEM disciplines to graduate STEM programs and from the latter to research careers, including the professoriate. Specifically, the annual, minority BS degree production is to reach 1120 graduate per year, by 2010, and 30% of these alumni will pursue graduate STEM degrees, with emphasis on the Ph.D.\r\nThe attainment of these objectives will be practically guaranteed by our rigorous implementation of a\r\ncomprehensive and coherent set of strategies or activities that leave little to chance. Systemic student mentoring is at the core of these activities and it includes research participation, guidance to graduate school, and subsequent follow-up. As shown in the narrative of this program, LS-LAMP and the Timbuktu Academy have placed the creation of educational value-added on a rigorous scientific basis. In particular, the 10-Strand Systemic Mentoring model implemented by LS-LAMP promotes the academic and social integration of students as recommended by the prevailing, quantitative, student retention models. Other major components of our approach for the successful implementation of LS-LAMP, Phase III, and for its institutionalization include strengthening intra- and inter-institutional collaborations, enhancing the teaching and research infrastructure of STEM units, securing a diversified funding base, and the accompanying transformation of campus cultures. The grantee and fiduciary agent for LS-LAMP is the Louisiana Board of Regents. Southern University and A&M College serves as the lead institution for LS-LAMP with the active input and advice of an array of collaborating public and private sector entities including the LS-LAMP Governing Board, chaired by the Commissioner of Higher Education, Dr. E. Joseph Savoie. LS-LAMP consists of eleven (11) Louisiana higher educational institutions and one research organization. These partners are Dillard University, Grambling State University, Louisiana State University, McNeese State University, Nunez Community College, Southern University and A&M College, Southern University at New Orleans, Southern University at Shreveport, Tulane University, the University of New Orleans, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium.\r\nThe principal investigators and project director of LS-LAMP are highly qualified. More importantly, the\r\nsupport they enjoy from the Louisiana Board of Regents and the eminently qualified and dedicated campus\r\ncoordinators on the campuses immensely add to the likelihood of an exemplary implementation of LS-LAMP. The Regents provided, as per an attached letter, a one-to-one match to the requested support from NSF. Campus and their presidents/chancellors have provided, in the past five years, an additional cash and in-kind support valued at $1Million per year. They are ready to continue to do so upon the funding of LS-LAMP, Phase III.  The intrinsic merit of LS-LAMP Phase III partly stems from the scientific basis of the systemic mentoring activities, past and future publications, educational objectives, the established capability of the investigators, and the extensive and up-to-date facilities available to it. The proven capability of the investigators campus coordinators practically guarantees the attainment of the objectives. The thorough evaluation woven into the fabric of the project activities further ensures its success. The cited literature clearly indicates that the continuation of LS-LAMP will result in significant increases in the number and quality of minority STEM BS degree graduates and in the numbers of these alumni who earn graduate STEM degrees and successfully transition to research careers, including the professoriate.\r\nThe broader impact of the project will partly be due to the significant impact on the national STEM\r\nworkforce pool and the proper implementation of a coherent set of dissemination activities. Our systemic mentoring model is expected to be replicated by other 4-year institutions across the country and elsewhere. The resulting reform-imbued enhancement of the teaching, mentoring, and research infrastructure of LS-LAMP partners and their ultimate institutionalization are expected to have impact far beyond minority education, STEM disciplines, and Louisiana.",
