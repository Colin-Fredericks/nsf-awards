 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2005. The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in US science. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Testing principles of sexual selection and paternity insurance in birds with exclusive male parental care.\"  To test general principles of sexual selection, this research consists of a comparative morphological, anatomical and behavioral studies of sperm competition in tinamous species with exclusive male parental care and different avian mating and social systems: from monogamy to promiscuity, and solitary to gregarious habits. \r\n\t\r\nThe training goals include learning new laboratory and field techniques to conduct this study; they will broaden the Fellow's professional horizons.  Her goal is to be a university professor and role model for underrepresented minorities.\r\n",
