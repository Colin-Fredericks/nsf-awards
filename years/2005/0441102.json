It includes: a jointly managed, hybrid \r\n circuit-switched and \r\n routed network designed in a ring topology encircling the northern \r\n hemisphere; and services to support increased S&E cooperation \r\nfor both \r\n general and highly advanced (in terms of network needs) user \r\n communities. \r\n In addition to supporting active scientific exchange with \r\n network services, \r\n the project will provide a production environment for advancing the \r\n state-of-the-art in collaborative and network technologies, including \r\n Grid-based applications development, end-to-end circuit provisioning, \r\n IPv4/IPv6 an d unicast/multicast services, advanced network \r\n monitoring, \r\n performance measurement and network security research. Supporting the \r\n increased growth in global S&E cooperation, GLORIAD is \r\n actively cooperating \r\n with the world's most advanced S&E networks and programs to create a \r\n rational, coherent strategy and architecture for the future of S&E \r\n networking.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
