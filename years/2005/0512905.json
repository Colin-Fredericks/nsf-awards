 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will demonstrate that innovative MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensor systems can be fabricated to enable on-chip parallel measurements of true viscosity values at various shear rates for liquids essential in food processing. Current instruments that measure the true viscosity are slow, expensive and are not portable. Hence for process control or quality control applications, portable sensors that are only capable of apparent viscosity measurements are often used. The proposed novel micro-scale sensor system will be portable and will enable simultaneous true viscosity value measurements at various shear rates, thereby increasing sensor response time and cost-effectiveness. This research will address key technical challenges in fabrication of the micron length scale sensor system. In Phase I, proof-of-concept of the innovative viscosity sensor will be demonstrated using standard viscoelastic liquids. \r\n\r\nIf successful the proposed innovative viscosity sensor system will allow rapid measurements of true viscosity values enabling efficient and accurate process control. The viscosity sensor system will be a next generation instrument offering more features in a compact size. This research effort will also increase scientific understanding of viscoelastic flows in micron-size channels that may inspire additional efforts and interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers. \r\n",
