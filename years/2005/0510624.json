Johnson; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThe objective of the program is to reveal, by means of computational observations at the atomic scale, how nanometer scale structures form during ion-bombardment processing of semiconductor surfaces. For many years this phenomenon has been observed experimentally, but the atomistic mechanisms driving this instability have never been well understood. This work has broad applications in nanomanufacturing and surface engineering for micro- and nanoelectronics.\r\n\r\nUsing molecular dynamics simulations, the effects of many different variables on the spontaneous formation of nano-ripples and nano-dots will be investigated. Factors such as incident ion energy, incident ion angle, initial surface features, and stress, will be considered. By building a large database of molecular dynamics results, it will be possible to inform both the empirical continuum models and the extensive experimental observations of the ion bombardment nanoscale surface instability. The program will make use of several close collaborations with experimental groups studying ion bombardment in order to maximize the impact of the results.\r\n\r\nBeyond the broad technical impact in nanotechnology and electronics, the program has a strong educational mission. The program will support two graduate students, and the PI will participate in developing an undergraduate course in nanomechanics. Also, the PI and co-PI will introduce this research area to undergraduates at the University of Illinois through partnership with an NSF site program on campus. These activities will help to attract the best undergraduate and graduate students into nanoscale science and engineering and specifically to nanomanufacturing and surface engineering for micro- and nanoelectronics.\r\n\r\n",
