 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe goal of this project is to enhance the education of students \r\nin the areas of geometry and topology at Stanford by providing them with \r\ninteractive forums in which to broaden their knowledge and by providing \r\nthem with the time, through financial support, to participate in those \r\nforums.  Stanford has a broad and active research group in geometry and \r\ntopology with researchers in geometric analysis, differential geometry \r\nand minimal surfaces, symplectic geometry and topology, low-dimensional \r\ntopology and hyperbolic geometry, geometric and algebraic topology, and \r\nalgebraic geometry.  Aside from the breadth of fields covered, the \r\nStanford research group in geometry and topology  is connected by a \r\nnetwork of overlapping interests and activities.  The purpose of this \r\nproject is to attract students into this group and to allow them to more \r\nfully benefit from the broad expertise it represents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn order to facilitate the interaction between students and \r\nfaculty representing these varied interests, specific seminars are \r\nplanned.  These will be run by senior faculty members and will involve \r\ngraduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and, in some cases, advanced \r\nundergraduates, who are interested in these fields.   Examples of such \r\nseminars include the following:\r\n1) Classics seminar:  Students will present, under the supervision of a \r\nfaculty member, various ``classical papers\" that transformed their \r\nrespective areas of mathematics.\r\n2) Progress seminar:  More advanced graduate students and postdoctoral \r\nresearchers will discuss their work in detail, as they are working on it.\r\n3) Physics for mathematicians seminar: Geometry/topology students will study \r\na relevant area of Physics under the joint supervision of the Mathematics \r\nand Physics faculty.\r\nThe proposal is designed to bring more US citizens/permanent \r\nresidents to the Stanford graduate program in mathematics.  Special \r\nattention will be given to attracting more women and minorities to the \r\nprogram. The activities proposed here should also increase the size and \r\nimprove the quality of the pool of Stanford undergraduates who go to \r\ngraduate programs at US universities; the majority of these students \r\nare US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n",
