The proposed meeting will bring together researchers to discuss a particular type of model: those based on a biologically accurate representation of the system \r\nin question.  This approach results in highly complex models which require state-of-the-art computers, computer software and analysis techniques.  The meeting will take place over three days.  The first \r\nday is devoted to tutorials in two tracks, beginner and advanced to discuss modeling techniques and applications.  The second and third days will consist of presentations of ongoing research results from \r\nmany different laboratories involved in the construction of realistic simulations.  Funds will primarily be used to support travel costs of graduate students to attend the meeting, which will take place in San Antonio, Texas.\r\n",
