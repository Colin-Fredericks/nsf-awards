 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed activity will continue the development of a relatively new\r\narea of mathematics in which algebraic topology is used to study moduli\r\nspaces of Riemann surfaces and related objects.  The main result so far in\r\nthis area is the solution, by Madsen and Weiss, of a generalization of a\r\nconjecture of Mumford.  This subject lies in the overlap between algebraic\r\ntopology and other branches of mathematics, with expected applications in\r\nalgebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and possibly theoretical physics.\r\nThe proposed activity will further investigate and develop the result of\r\nMadsen and Weiss.  Specifically, the proposed activity will define a\r\nd-dimensional cobordism category C^d and determine the homotopy type of\r\nits classifying space.  This will imply the result of Madsen and Weiss,\r\nbut is a much more general result, opening for many new possible\r\napplications.  At the same time, it will be conceptually simpler and\r\nallows for a much simpler proof.  This is one project of the proposal.  \r\nThe remaining four proposed projects are related.\r\n\r\nThe theorem of Madsen and Weiss is a very important theorem, that has\r\nalready recieved much interest.  It sheds a completely new light on the\r\nmoduli spaces M_g of Riemann surfaces of genus g and on the 2-dimensional\r\ncobordism category.  These objects has been studied and used for long\r\ntime, and in many different areas of mathematics.  On the other hand it is\r\nclear that the result is not definitive, for example it is restricted to\r\ndimension d=2.  The development of the proper generalization should be of\r\ngreat interest and importance for algebraic topology as well as for\r\nrelated fields.\r\n",
