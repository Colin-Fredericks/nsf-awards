In addition, the proposed methodology and practical tool\r\nwill help engineers and designers establish negotiation strategies for\r\nmitigating and resolving engineering conflicts in large-scale\r\ninfrastructure projects. Such a comprehensive negotiation methodology and\r\ntool is expected to provide benefits for the entire life cycle of the\r\nproject by reducing costs, avoiding delays, eliminating counterproductive\r\nnegotiation plans, and improving negotiation skills among engineers working\r\non large-scale infrastructure projects.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the project will develop an integrated research laboratory and\r\nclassroom alliance aimed at improving the understanding of negotiation and\r\ncollaboration in the domain of large-scale engineering systems.  This\r\neffort will place tomorrow's communication and collaboration technologies\r\nalong with the understanding of how to use it most effectively, into the\r\nhands of the next generation of professionals. This will be accomplished\r\nthrough a unique research-industry-education-research feedback loop created\r\nby the participation of five universities, two corporate entities, and one\r\npublic agency. The core of the research will be achieved through a formal\r\nanalysis cycle starting with information acquisition, formalization,\r\nsystematization, testing, refinement, and ending with information\r\ndissemination. In this program, practice, research and education are\r\nexpected to work in an integrated fashion to understand and master\r\nnegotiation strategies in large-scale infrastructure projects requiring\r\ncollaboration between global teams. \r\n\r\nThe proposed program provides excellent benefits both, from the research\r\nand educational perspectives in analyzing systematic negotiation strategies\r\nfor large-scale infrastructure projects.  From the research perspective,\r\nthe key intellectual contribution of this work is the acquisition,\r\nformalization, systematization, testing and dissemination of a partially\r\nformalized structure of the existing negotiation knowledge, where the\r\nfundamental questions about collaboration and negotiation could start to be\r\nanswered.  From the educational perspective, the proposed class will\r\nprovide a forum in which the impact of a negotiation methodology addressing\r\nthe issues of time and distance on project life cycle will be explored.\r\nFinally, the class will include the participation and guidance of seasoned\r\nindustry professionals in a controlled environment with real-world data. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
