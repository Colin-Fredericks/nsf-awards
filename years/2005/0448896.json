 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective is to develop and validate an electrokinetic lab-on-chip for\r\nrobust and rapid detection of low concentration bioparticle (eg. virus, bacteria, cells) in\r\nwater, food and clinical samples. The research tackles the long-standing bottleneck\r\nissues of sensitivity and selectivity for such detection. The approach is: 1) to differentiate\r\nbioparticles by their response to electrokinetic transport based on various charge/mass\r\nratio, 2) to rapidly enrich local particle concentration by expediting bioparticles' diffusion\r\nto sensors with convection, and 3) to quantify particle concentration by impedimetric\r\nmeasurement while incorporating electrokinetic signal amplification. The above\r\nfunctions are to be realized by asymmetric-polarization AC electro-osmosis, which is\r\nnewly discovered and at the forefront of electrokinetic microfluidic research. Such lab-on-\r\na-chip operates at small voltage with low power consumption, and its all electrical\r\nprocesses facilitate portability, parallelism and automation for on-site bioparticle\r\ndetection.\r\nBioparticle detection is of great significance because bioparticles often serve as\r\ncarrier/indicator of pathogens and/or toxins. As the world becomes increasingly\r\nconcerned with toxin/pathogenic contamination in food, water and environment from\r\ninfectious diseases and bioterrorism, and because the threat of pathogen/toxins to\r\nsocieties could be substantially mitigated with early detection, the demand for rapid\r\nbioparticle detection is expanding for both civilian and military applications. The PI\r\nproposes a novel electrokinetic lab-on-a-chip to detect bioparticles at low concentrations.\r\nThe research will not only lead to a practical detection chip but also afford students a\r\nunique opportunity to explore the state-of-art of interdisciplinary research in\r\nmicrosystem, bio/chemi/electronics and microfluidics.",
