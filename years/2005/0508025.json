The co-organizers are Professor Marc Fossorier at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu and Professor Ikuo Oka at the Osaka City University in Japan.  Information theory is a profoundly international field of study and many of its strongest contributors have come from the US and Japan.  It has become a field where the rich and ever evolving conceptual and mathematical structure is being constantly combined with the system constraints and application demands of today.  Many of the best-known researchers in the field are known for both their contributions to practice and to theory, and the two are usually closely related.  Japan's chapter of the Information Theory (IT) Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is by far its largest chapter.  The Board of Governors of the IEEE IT Society suggested that particular efforts should be made to develop collaborations between the US and Japan in this field.  Therefore, this workshop was suggested and Hawaii chosen because of its geographical location.  The purpose of the meeting is to promote scientific advancement, understanding, and the dissemination of research results in the fields of interest of the Societies that embraces \"theoretical and certain applied aspects of coding, communication and communication networks, complexity and cryptography, detection and estimation, learning, Shannon theory, and stochastic processes.\"  \r\n\r\nThe co-organizers have complementary scientific expertise in the field.  This enables them to evaluate and attract the best science and mathematician researchers to participate.   The seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve postdocs and graduate students as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Following the seminar the organizers plan to establish a workshop web page.  Conference proceedings will be published on this web site.        \r\n\r\n\r\n",
