The array of applications ranges from light pulse propagation in \r\noptical fibers and nonlinear waveguides to stabilization of \r\nspatio-temporal solitons, both for deterministic systems and systems \r\nwith a stochastic component. Depending on the particular application, \r\nthe relevant mathematical models are nonlinear partial \r\ndifferential equations, integral equations, or discrete equations. \r\nThe core mathematical issues are fundamental \r\nunderstanding of asymptotic theories, both analytically and \r\nnumerically, well posedness or blow up for the modeling equations, and \r\nthe search for solitary wave solutions via direct methods of calculus \r\nof variations. This project focuses on three major applications in \r\nnonlinear optics: systems with randomness, discrete systems, and \r\ngeneralized dispersion managed systems. Randomness arises \r\nubiquitously in nonlinear optics and an important goal of this project \r\nis to study noise models that are physically relevant and analyzable \r\nin a rigorous probabilistic sense. Such models have already yielded \r\nnew types of fundamental solitons and their study may help engineers \r\nto design optical devices whose performance is actually enhanced by \r\nsmall amounts of randomness. Discrete equations arise in many \r\nimportant contexts, including the study of nonlinear waveguides, \r\nall-optical switches, and Bose-Einstein condensates. Discrete models \r\nhave very different properties than those of their continuous \r\ncounterparts, and though regularity of solutions in the spatial \r\nvariable is no longer an issue, the lack of scaling invariances in \r\ngeneral makes their analysis more difficult. Thus discrete problems \r\ninvite the development of new analytical tools which ultimately will \r\nhelp explain experimental observations. Finally, the P.I. will study \r\ngeneralized dispersion managed systems. The technique of dispersion \r\nmanagement has been instrumental in enabling higher bit rate \r\ncommunications and has provided the impetus for many interesting \r\nmathematical investigations. The approximate models that arise have a \r\nnonlocal nonlinearity which presents interesting mathematical and \r\nnumerical challenges. Often the nonlocality in the modeling equation \r\nreflects a stabilizing effect in the original physical system, and an \r\nimportant recurring question is how to exploit the nonlocal structure \r\nin order to help explain the observed stabilization. The P.I. will \r\nexamine the application of dispersion management technology in \r\ncontexts other than fiber optic communications, such as the search for \r\nspatio-temporal solitons, where the P.I. expects to obtain new \r\ninformation on it's possible stabilizing effects. \r\n\r\nFundamental mathematical understanding of nonlinear optical \r\nsystems is central to the development of technologies that will be able to \r\nsupport the ever increasing demands of future Internet expansion. Fast, \r\nstable data transmission is critically important to a wide array of \r\nsectors of national interest, ranging from banking, the stock exchange, \r\nand insurance to health services, transportation, and homeland security. \r\nThe information gleaned through the proposed research will aid in the \r\ndesign and implementation of novel optical systems that will help meet the \r\ngrowing need for bandwidth. \r\n\r\n",
