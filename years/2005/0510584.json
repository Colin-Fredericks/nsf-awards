 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nTwo researchers, one from the Chemistry Department and the other from the English Department, are creating a comprehensive resource for increasing student success in first-year college chemistry. The system consists of two parts: an online diagnostic test of the fundamental reasoning skills needed to learn chemistry, and an online academic success course. This resource is being developed from materials adapted from previous NSF-supported programs.\r\nThe online resource uses a three-pronged approach to guide students' preparation for their chemistry class success by providing tools to help students master mathematical reasoning, effective study skills, and technical reading abilities. The resulting program provides a unique, effective, and efficient way for college chemistry programs to address student preparation issues without resorting to remediation.\r\nStudents identified by the diagnostic program as being at-risk are directed to take the online academic success course. The integrated activities of reading, writing, and working with basic chemistry fundamentals that students are completing in this project prepare students for the critical thinking necessary for successful completion of first-semester chemistry. Students are tracked as they complete this course providing the researchers with valuable data on parameters that positively affect student success in chemistry. Once effectiveness has been documented the system will be available for adoption by other introductory chemistry curricula nationwide. \r\n\r\n",
