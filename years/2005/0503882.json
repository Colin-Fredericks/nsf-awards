 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nOrganic conductors represent a class of carbon-based materials where \r\npressure and temperature may induce transformations from one kind of \r\nelectronic behavior to another.  A striking example is the transformation \r\nfrom magnetism into superconductivity which will be the focus of this \r\nproject.  Experiments are planned to measure a quantity called the magnetic \r\npenetration depth, whose behavior provides a window into the microscopic \r\nbehavior of electrons in the superconducting state.   This work will build \r\nupon novel techniques previously developed in this lab to measure the \r\npenetration depth.   How organic superconductivity differs from its \r\ncounterpart in ordinary metals and high temperature superconductors, how it \r\nevolves from magnetism and what ultimately causes it to occur will be the \r\nkey questions this project will try to answer.  Complex electronic \r\nmaterials of this type will undoubtedly play a role in future computational \r\nand micro mechanical devices.  Understanding the physical principles that \r\ngovern their behavior is critical in the same way that understanding the \r\nbehavior of silicon was to the computer revolution. This program will \r\nprovide training for both undergraduate and graduate students in low noise, \r\nhigh frequency electronic instrumentation, cryogenics, computer simulation \r\nand high pressure methods. It will also provide these students with the \r\nintellectual challenge of understanding the complex behavior of newly \r\nsynthesized materials and help forge links between physics, chemistry, \r\nelectrical engineering and material science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nOrganic conductors are synthetic metals composed of carbon-based \r\nmolecules.   By changing temperature and pressure they transform from \r\nmetals into insulators, magnets or superconductors.   Determining the \r\ngeneral principles that govern these electronic transformations is one of \r\nthe central unsolved problems in condensed matter physics.  This project \r\nwill focus on high frequency magnetic measurements in a class of organic \r\nmaterials for which high quality, single crystals are readily \r\navailable.   The experiments will utilize  electronic oscillator techniques \r\ndeveloped in this lab to measure the magnetic penetration length, a \r\nquantity fundamental to all superconductors.  By studying how the \r\npenetration depth changes in response to pressure, temperature, magnetic \r\nfield and chemical substitution, a window will be opened into the \r\nunderlying quantum state of the superconductor. The themes will be how \r\norganic superconductivity differs from its counterpart in conventional \r\nmetals and high temperature superconductors, how it evolves under pressure \r\nfrom the magnetic phase and ultimately what causes organic materials to \r\nbecome superconductors.   The program will provide training for both \r\nundergraduates and graduate students in  low noise, high frequency \r\nelectronic instrumentation, cryogenics, magnetic measurements and \r\nhigh-pressure techniques. It will also provide students with the \r\nintellectual challenge of understanding the complex behavior of newly \r\nsynthesized materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
