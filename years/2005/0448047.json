 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Vertically Integrated Program Analysis for Embedded Software\r\n\r\nIn recent years, a great deal of progress has been made towards tool\r\nsupport for developing embedded software.  Tools solve a variety of\r\ndifficult problems, for example by automating error-prone\r\nimplementation tasks, by eliminating redundant and inefficient\r\nconstructs, and by guaranteeing the absence of certain classes of\r\nerrors, such as race conditions or out-of-memory exceptions.  This\r\nNSF CAREER research is about Vertically Integrated Program Analysis and\r\nTransformation (VIPAT), a new way to look at embedded software tools:\r\nas a collection of building blocks that can be connected together in\r\ndifferent ways to support novel analyses and transformations.  The\r\nexisting tools become mechanisms that are controlled by a high-level\r\npolicy.  VIPAT is based on two main ideas.  First, the vertical\r\nintegration of tools that operate at various levels of abstraction,\r\nwhich permits high-level transformations to be precisely targeted at\r\nparts of a system whose low-level resource usage is worst.  Second, a\r\nclean separation between mechanism and policy, enabling effective\r\nreuse of existing tools in new situations.  This research is a step\r\ntowards a world where meaningful static guarantees about program\r\nbehavior can be made, and where software can be automatically\r\nspecialized to meet platform- and application-specific requirements\r\nsuch as time and energy constraints.  The high-level vision is\r\n\"fearless reuse\": developers should spend less time worrying about\r\nresource usage and potential failure modes of components that they\r\nreuse.",
