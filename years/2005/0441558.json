 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project proposes to develop a flexible networked high capacity security checkpoint system. The proposed system is designed to enable cost-effective high throughput x-ray screening of items carried by individuals into areas having high numbers of people passing through or congregating. It is widely felt that conventional security checkpoints, such as those in airports, are too bulky and slow for applications where there are large numbers of passengers such as railways. A primary need is to be able to screen persons and their carried items at significantly higher processing rates. Projected capacity of the proposed system is an order of magnitude greater than the capacity of current security checkpoints modeled on checkpoints in our nation's airports. Typical venues that could be served by the proposed system are mass transit systems, auditoriums, sports arenas, shopping malls, conference halls, and other venues having high concentrations of people vulnerable to terrorist attacks. The proposed technology would provide protection against terrorist attack to persons in such crowded areas by providing x-ray screening for weapons and explosives of briefcases, knapsacks, backpacks, packages, etc. carried into the area. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the proposed technology can be significant. Terrorist attacks on mass transit systems or other places having large crowds in the U.S. could have significant adverse effects upon our society and our economy. There are many venues in the U.S. where crowds gather. Many such as sports arenas, auditoriums, concert halls, and conference centers and are used intermittently. Others, such as mass transit, shopping malls, schools, universities, and office buildings have high traffic daily. For these venues the installation, maintenance, and manning of permanent fixed security checkpoints, such as those used at airports, is very expensive and in many cases not feasible. As protection of our national critical infrastructure becomes a higher priority in the face of increasing terrorist threats security for these high traffic areas must be effectively addressed. In these situations the ability to quickly set up and efficiently operate flexible, compact, and fast security checkpoints when needed can be a real benefit and make the difference for being able to provide an effective level of security. The proposed technology can be adapted to integrate with existing checkpoint screening systems and has a significant upgrade market for existing systems in addition to markets for new systems. \r\n",
