Smith, Utah State University\r\n\r\nThis grant is to develop an instrument that can acquire and rapidly process and store the very large samples generated by Time-Resolved Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (TRSPIV). Currently, there is a large gap between the time required to acquire such data and the time necessary to process it. Closing this gap by providing an order of magnitude increase in processing power will realize the potential of this powerful technique.  The new system is based on a Beowulf cluster supercomputer specifically designed to handle and process TRSPIV image data sets of 5.2 Giga Bytes or more.  The parallel processing will be completely transparent to the user and will require no knowledge of parallel processing, removing inhibitions about acquiring large samples and allowing the user to concentrate on the experiment.  This system will be used in several departments of the College of Engineering at Utah State University and at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL).  TRSPIV measurements will become accessible to a large segment of the fluid dynamics community.  For a modest increase in cost, it will become possible to process the very large samples that time-resolved SPIV generates.  Other measurements involving large samples, such as phase-locked measurements in periodic flows (e.g. flow control studies) will also benefit.  Experience has shown PIV to be very accessible measurement technique, making this system valuable in the productive undergraduate research program at Utah State. The PIs also plan to use the system for outreach activities with local high schools and under represented groups.\r\n",
