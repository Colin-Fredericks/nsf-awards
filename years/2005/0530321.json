The objective is to advance the application of Information Technology tools and adopt educational methods that promote the multi-disciplinary nature of civil engineering. The goal is to educate a new generation of civil engineers capable of adapting to the changes in the field and able to apply systems approaches for solving complex problems. The reformed CE program will be modeled around a common web-based large scale CE project that will be used as a platform from which each course will extract pertinent topics for small-scale design assignments. The primary tasks to be undertaken in this first phase of the reform process will involve: a) Plan the installation of a web-based computer platform for the application of IT driven tasks, b) Develop a common main project which will be used to synchronize the application of multi-disciplinary assignments in every CE course, and c) Develop an outcome assessment plan.\r\n\r\n",
