 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-day conference will provide a forum for in-depth dialogue on\r\ninnovative research in the area of Neural Control of Behavior.  The first\r\ntwo days will be devoted to a symposium that will be open to the scientific\r\ncommunity.  There will be four sessions: (1) Neurobiological Basis of Social\r\nBehavior; (2) Fear and Anxiety; (3) Sleeping and Dreaming; (4) The Aging\r\nBrain. The speakers represent a balance of species used (invertebrates to\r\nmammals), experimental approaches used (from molecular and cellular to\r\nbehavioral levels of analyses), gender, and career level.  The third day of\r\nthe meeting will be devoted to a workshop of speakers and invited conference\r\nparticipants, where they will explore ways in which information discussed\r\nduring the symposium can be used to take their respective research areas in\r\nnew directions.  This conference aims to: Bring together researchers who are\r\nasking similar questions, but are using different species and different\r\nexperimental approaches; Promote the use of simple systems for addressing\r\ncomplex biological problems; Promote interaction between junior scientists -\r\nwomen in particular - and established investigators and leaders in the\r\nfield; Provide a high-quality educational forum, in an intimate setting,\r\nthat is conducive for in-depth discussion and learning between trainees and\r\nmore senior researchers.  A Meet-the-Speaker luncheon is aimed specifically\r\nat trainees, giving them the unique opportunity to interact with\r\ninternationally recognized experts in an intimate setting.  A Poster Session\r\nalso gives trainees and more senior researchers the opportunity to highlight\r\nand discuss their own work. The speakers use modern, cutting-edge\r\ntechnologies for addressing problems in the area of Neural Control of\r\nBehavior.  By bringing together these researchers, and giving them a forum\r\nfor discussing their work, the message can be effectively spread that these\r\nmodern techniques are being used with great success in a wide variety of\r\nanimal systems.  This conference will provide an important interdisciplinary\r\ncommunications-mechanism for advancements in the neuroscience community.\r\n",
