 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and Department of Energy (DOE), will take place January 2-11, 2006 in San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina on the topic of nanoscience and biotechnology. Organized by Dr. Horacio D. Espinosa of Northwestern University together with Dr. Glaucio Paulino of the University of  Indiana, Urbana-Champaign, the institute will promote research and education on the latest advances in the field of nano and biotechnology through tutorials, lectures and extensive scientific discussions with junior researchers in Latin America. The PASI will consist of approximately eighteen lecturers, and forty participants from the American continent. PASI lecturers will consist of top researchers in the area of their respective fields, and will come from a variety of countries and institutions in the American continent. Key speakers will present comprehensive tutorials followed by specialized contributions, making a critical assessment of the current state of knowledge of the fields of nano and biotechnology. In order to foster content-specific interactions, the PASI will include Poster sessions for the presentation of research studies by junior researchers and student participants, together with a hands-on training laboratory. Participating students will be selected in an open competition by an International Organizing Committee.\r\n\r\nThis PASI aims to have a lasting impact by integrating North and South-American researchers around joint research programs in nanoscience and biotechnology. To assist with dissemination of the results of the PASI, a comprehensive web site will be created for the event that will include an overview of the PASI and its objectives, a Program Outline and other useful information for participants, such as tutorials and lectures.\r\n. \r\n",
