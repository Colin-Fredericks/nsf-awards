The project is doing this by developing problems that give students practice and feedback with programming fundamentals, which requires broadening the scope of WeBWorK to support a wider class of problem type. With this WeBWorK enhancement, the courses are: 1) engaging students in active online learning to augment traditional practices in all the core computer science courses; 2) supplying students with immediate and customized feedback on their progress with problem-solving tasks; 3) furnishing students with tailored and constructive support for any problem areas they encounter; and 4) providing instructors with the ability to continually monitor and assess student work.",
