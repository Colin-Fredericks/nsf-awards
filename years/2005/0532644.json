 "awd_abstract_narration": "Special Year in Mathematical Logic, University of Florida, 2006-2007\r\n\r\nThe special year in mathematical logic will be devoted to the\r\nexploration of various channels of communication between several\r\nfields of logic as well as the rest of the mathematical sciences.\r\nMathematical logic is entering a phase of increasingly intense\r\nconversation with other parts of mathematics.  In one workshop, we\r\nwill concentrate on the relationship between computability, effective\r\ndescriptive set theory and computable analysis on one hand and\r\nnumerical methods and analysis on the other, such as the study of\r\neffectively closed sets and effectivity of reals and real functions.\r\nPotential special topics will include algorithmic randomness, quantum\r\ncomputation, reverse mathematics.  The second workshop will relate the\r\ncurrent trends in definable forcing and determinacy with measure\r\ntheory, potential theory and dynamical systems, as well as with the\r\ngames used in biomathematics or economics.  Special topics include\r\nBorel equivalence relations and definable forcing.  The third workshop\r\nwill further explore the connections between singular cardinals and\r\ninner models.  Recent work on large cardinals and inner models has\r\nhelped to advance the frontier of set theory and its applications to\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\nThe special year will bring together leading scientists from many\r\nareas of mathematical logic, in an effort to advance our understanding\r\nof this fundamental discipline.  Just as mathematics is the language\r\nof science and provides the foundation of science, so logic is the\r\nlanguage of mathematics and provides the foundation of mathematics.\r\nThe subject of logic has its roots in classical philosophy and today\r\nhas branches in many disciplines, including mathematics and\r\nphilosophy, as well as computer science, linguistics, and law.  Logic\r\nis used in expert systems which, for example, help doctors diagnose\r\nillness with the aid of computers. Current research on hybrid\r\nalgorithms is using logic in the development of software which will\r\nmap out the flight plan of an airplane in real time. While the program\r\nis based in the mathematics department, other departments, including\r\nphilosophy and computer science, will also participate. The broader\r\nimpact of the project includes an emphasis on participation of\r\ngraduate students, junior researchers and women mathematicians. There\r\nwill also be a focus on participants from the Southeast region.  We\r\nwill publish proceedings of the work presented during the special\r\nyear.",
