 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geckos are the dominant group of nocturnal lizards and are important components of many ecosystems worldwide. They are an old (180 million years) and diverse (>1100 species in 108 genera) group and could serve as important models for understanding a broad range of evolutionary, ecological, physiological and behavioral questions if their interrelationships were known. In this study both molecular (DNA sequences) and morphological (e.g., skeletal anatomy) data, will be used to reconstruct relationships among all living genera and selected fossil geckos. The resulting information will be used to evaluate how earth history has influenced the diversification of geckos and to reconstruct the evolutionary events leading to the development of a highly specialized adhesive climbing mechanism within the group. \r\nThis project will be widely applicable for studies of ecology, biogeography, morphology and other disciplines. It will also promote interactions between an undergraduate university and major research institutions to provide opportunities for student training in biodiversity and field research.  Field work and collaborations with researchers in more than 20 countries will also strengthen international research ties. The resulting data will be made available through a series of web-based databases as well as traditional publications.  The information generated will be presented to a wider audience in book form and at symposia and to the general public through educational programs both in museums and on the web. \r\n",
