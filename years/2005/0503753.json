 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motivated by considerations in topology, geometry, arithmetic and\r\ngroup theory the proposal intends to study real, complex and\r\nquaternionic hyperbolic manifolds. This will involve the study of\r\ndiscrete groups, and their connections with other research active areas; for\r\nexample number theory, and the theory of expanding\r\ngraphs. We will also explore various interconnections between these\r\ngeometric objects. This has been fruitful in the past, \r\nsince previous work has shown how an understanding of higher dimensional\r\nhyperbolic manifolds can impact the topology of 3-dimensional manifolds.\r\n\r\nThe proposal seeks to further understand basic objects in modern\r\ngeometry and topology, namely manifolds that admit a hyperbolic metric\r\nof some type.  Many of the problems in the proposal are\r\ncross-disciplinary, and are amenable to study using a broad spectrum\r\nof mathematical technqiues; for example from number theory, geometry,\r\ntopology and group theory.\r\nBy their nature, progress and solutions to problems in the proposal\r\nwill have a broader impact. The problems suggested have applications\r\nin fields as diverse as number theory (class numbers) and cosmology\r\n(and its relation to the topology of 4-dimensional hyperbolic\r\nmanifolds) and computer science (expanding graphs). All of these have\r\nthe potential to be fertile grounds for the education of graduate\r\nstudents.\r\n",
