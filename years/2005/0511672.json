 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nThe College of Technology at the University of Houston is investigating the use of the Tablet PC as an instructional tool to facilitate the development of thinking and learning skills across the undergraduate Information Systems Technology program. Specific instructional activities lend themselves to critical thinking and problem-solving skill development. Mindmaps, a strategy introduced by Tony Buzan (1995), and other visual learning strategies, encourage learners to identify major concepts related to a topic, and then to create their own representation of how the concepts relate to one another. This project is extending previous work completed on the effectiveness of mind maps for improving critical thinking and problem solving skills by combining this visual learning technique with the use of Tablet PC's and pen-enabled mind mapping software. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The need exists to facilitate the development of learning and thinking skills throughout the undergraduate STEM curricula. UH is investigating the use of Tablet PCs as a mind tool that, when combined with the visual learning technique of mind mapping and mind mapping software tools, will improve learner outcomes in these critical areas. Since learning and thinking skills should be developed and reinforced in all courses, UH is creating a modular instructional design that can be adapted for use wherever the curriculum goals warrant it. \r\n\r\nProject objectives include: (1) adapting and integrating the use of visual learning techniques to enhance the development of thinking and learning skills of students in the undergraduate IST program; (2) adapting and integrating the use of computer technology, specifically Tablet PCs, as a mind tool to enhance the development of thinking and learning skills of students in the undergraduate IST program; (3) increasing faculty use of Tablet PC's and visual learning techniques through faculty development activities; and (4) developing an assessment protocol for capturing and analyzing data regarding learner outcomes relating to critical thinking, collaboration, and problem solving. \r\n\r\nBroader impact: Instructional modules and other project materials are being disseminated through a web site, publications, and presentations and conference exhibits. The instructional modules are providing guidance to faculty in all computing disciplines on the use of visual learning techniques that can be used to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. Since the UH main campus is classified as a minority serving institution, a diverse minority population will directly benefit from the success of this project. \r\n",
