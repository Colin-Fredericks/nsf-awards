 "awd_abstract_narration": "What forces cause biodiversity to increase or decrease over time? Why do some regions of the planet have greater numbers of species than others? These are some of the most important questions in environmental biology. This project will study the underlying processes responsible for both the production and maintenance of biodiversity on the island of New Guinea, one of the most diverse regions of the planet. The research will sample DNA from several amphibian and reptile species with diverse ecological and life-history patterns. Molecular genetic techniques will be used to test hypotheses about how past changes in climate and geological processes shape biological diversification.\r\n\r\nThe broad significance of this research is that it integrates research and education at both the national and international levels, acts synergistically to advance scientific knowledge, creates partnerships with seven national and international museums and universities, promotes conservation, and enhances scientific and educational opportunities for a broad spectrum of people. The research uses the results of two recent comprehensive conservation priority-setting workshops and innovative digital mapping and modeling methods to provide a much stronger scientific foundation for conservation planning than is currently available. This research will help to ensure that conservation efforts preserve both genetic and species diversity. Education will provide local scientific capacity-building and help foster better international relations in the Pacific Rim.\r\n",
