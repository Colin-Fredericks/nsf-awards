 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mems and nano devices such as micromechanisms that can swim, crawl, .y, autonomous\r\nmicromanufacturing plants, microrobotic arrays, and next generation data storage, retrieval\r\nand search devices, will all constitute of large arrays (perhaps millions or more) of dynamic\r\nelements operating in unison. In essence these arrays, due to their autonomous features,\r\nadaptability to varying environmental conditions, and their own complex dynamics, will\r\nqualify to be called arti.cial organisms. Empowering them with autonomous control features\r\nwill be a necessary task which will be quite di.erent from any of the control design problems\r\nencountered today. This proposal addresses the problem of designing controllers for such\r\nsystems. It is argued that pattern formation is the key to controlling these systems. In\r\ncontrast to simple electrical engineering circuitry, all organisms seem to be capable of (a)\r\nproducing a large number of di.erent patterns, and in addition (b) capable of fast and\r\ngraceful transition from one pattern to another. Control methodology sought after here will\r\nbe mindful of these requirements. The question of what are appropriate patterns has for the\r\nmost part been already addressed by biologists, physicists and mathematicians. However,\r\nthere are two associated control challenges; (a) embedding such an equation in the natural\r\ndynamics of a mems or a nano array, and (b) how to design a control system to ensure\r\nquick and graceful transition from one pattern to another. Both these aspects are almost\r\ncompletely unexplored, and will be the focus of this research project. Among our interests\r\nwill be (i) formulating and analyzing appropriate pole placement type problems, (ii) develop\r\ntheories to understand how to design switching control laws that will minimize transient\r\nexcursions, (iii) enumerate basic building blocks to create dynamic patterns, and .nding\r\nways to (nonlinearly) superimpose them in order to generate complex dynamic patterns,\r\n(iv) formulate and solve appropriate model matching problems that arise in embedding\r\npattern forming equations in microacuator/sensor arrays, and (v) asymptotically (at least\r\npractically asymptotically) stabilize dynamic patterns.\r\nIntellectual Merits Proposed research will lead to new classes of generic nonlinear control\r\nproblems, and hence will impact upon the theory of nonlinear control in general. As far as\r\nwe are aware, applicable mathematical theories discussed in the proposal have not previously\r\nbeen adapted to control theory. Seemingly these theories are at the very foundation necessary\r\nto understand how to control engineering actuator arrays of the future.\r\nBroader Impacts Micro- and nano- actuators are anticipated to play central roles in application\r\nareas such as microsurgery (mimic the hand movement of a surgeon in the micro\r\nscale), crawling, swimming and .ying robots performing tasks ranging from spying to drug\r\ndelivery inside veins, audio processing devices that mimic the cochlear, and computing devices\r\nthat mimic the brain functions. A concerted e.ort will be made to attract graduate\r\nand undergraduate students from under-represented groups, in particular from the large Hispanic\r\ncommunity in the surrounding areas, to participate in the proposed research. We have\r\nalready established a track record for supervising theses and dissertations of female students,\r\nand at least one female PhD student will receive partial funding from this grant. There is\r\na very high probability that the theory to be developed will .nd a receptive application oriented\r\nand experimental oriented audience, due to our ongoing collaborations with the mems\r\nresearch group at the Maddox Laboratory at Texas Tech and the Texas Instruments Inc.\r\nthrough an NSF GOALI grant.",
