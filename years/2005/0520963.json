 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Department of Chemistry at CUNY City College will acquire a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Research programs that will be supported by this instrument include a) metal catalysis and metal catalyzed synthesis of novel nucleoside entities, carcinogen-nucleoside adducts and studies on site-specifically modified DNA; b) selective vinyl and aryl fluorination, synthesis of specifically fluorinated hydrocarbons and their metabolites, studies of conformational and biological modulation by fluorine; c) fate of organic xenobiotics in the environment and elucidation of relevant reaction mechanisms; d) studies on ligand-protein interactions as well as synthetic drug-like molecules; e) structural studies of integral membrane proteins of medical relevance; and d) synthesis and studies of furanose-based novel ene-diyne antibiotic analogs. \r\n\r\nMass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an impact in a number of areas including environmental chemistry and synthetic chemistry. \r\n",
