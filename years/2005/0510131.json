 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  proposal aims  at developing  new and  effective  algorithms for\r\nperforming  dimensionality  reduction  tasks  by methods  which  blend\r\ntechniques  from numerical  linear algebra  and  approximation theory.\r\nCurrent  implementations of  LSI, and  other  dimensionality reduction\r\nmethods,  rely on  matrix decompositions  such as  the  Singular Value\r\nDecomposition (SVD).   SVD-based methods compute  explicitly the basis\r\nof the dominant singular vectors  and proceed with a projection of the\r\ndata on  this basis.  This has  the desirable effect  of filtering out\r\nnoise and  redundancy inherent to  the data, while retaining  its main\r\nstructural  features  (e.g., `semantic  contents'  in LSI).   However,\r\nSVD-based methods tend to be expensive, both in terms of computational\r\ncost and  storage, and  become impractical for  very large  data sets.\r\nThe premise of  this proposal is that there is no  need to compute the\r\n(partial)  SVD  in  order  to perform  dimensionality  reduction.  The\r\nprojection  of a  given  vector  onto the  space  associated with  the\r\nlargest singular  values can be accurately reproduced  by a polynomial\r\nfiltering   technique.   This   technique,   which  entails   repeated\r\nmultiplication  of  a vector  by  the  original  data matrix  and  its\r\ntranspose, offers  several advantages including  low computational and\r\nstorage  requirements.   In  addition, ``relevance  feedback'',  which\r\nenhances  significantly the  quality of  the  results of  LSI, can  be\r\neasily adapted  for polynomial  filtering.  Perhaps more  important is\r\nthe excellent flexibility of  polynomial filtering in enabling various\r\ndesired reduction features.  For example, an appropriate choice of the\r\nfilter will  yield an arbitrarily smooth transition  from the unwanted\r\ncomponents (small singular values)  to the wanted ones (large singular\r\nvalues) in contrast with the discontinuous cut-off which characterizes\r\nTruncated SVD (TSVD).  Also, some applications may require an accurate\r\nprojection  (high degree polynomial)  while for  others this  would be\r\nwasteful or even counter-productive.\r\n\r\nSociety  is  currently  facing   an  explosive  surge  of  exploitable\r\ninformation in  scientific, engineering, and  economical applications.\r\nThe rapidly  increasing sizes of  the data sets becoming  available is\r\nstarting to  render inadequate  many of the  algorithms used  in `data\r\nexploration' in spite of their merits when computational costs are set\r\naside.   The methods investigated  in this  research will  address the\r\nissue of  cost by  taking a new  approach which completely  avoids the\r\nbottleneck  of  the  classical  algorithms. If  fully  successful  the\r\nmethods to be developed  may significantly enhance the capabilities of\r\ncurrent  state-of-the-art methods  used  in key  areas of  information\r\ntechnology.   For example,  preliminary studies  have shown  that when\r\nprocessing a query  in a database, the proposed  methods can sometimes\r\noffer a  tenfold gain in  speed relative to standard  methods, without\r\nany loss  of accuracy.  The  investigating team will also  extend this\r\napproach  to the  problem of  face  recognition. The  method also  has\r\nexcellent  prospects in other  potential applications  including image\r\nprocessing, and medical tomography.\r\n",
