To improve our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve, Dr. Tran's research program focuses on two critical questions. First, what is the nature of the first galaxies in the universe? To understand how the galaxies we see today formed, Dr. Tran will combine observations at optical, near-infrared, and submillimeter wavelengths to study the properties of the first generation of galaxies (z = 5.7). Second, how did galaxies in rich clusters assemble their stars? By measuring the star-formation rates and metallicities of cluster galaxies at z > 0.5, Dr. Tran will determine in this key redshift regime how cluster galaxies build up their stellar masses. Dr. Tran's research program will place valuable constraints on current theoretical models and improve our overall picture of galaxy evolution.\r\n\r\nDr. Tran will also work with the Academy of the Pacific Rim, a public charter school in Boston for urban students of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. Dr. Tran will start a Project ASTRO site at the Academy, initiate a summer research experience program at the CfA for motivated high school students, and give public astronomy lectures at the Academy. Dr. Tran's objectives are both to bring the excitement of modern astronomy not only to the students but also to their families and to encourage students-especially girls-to consider a career in the sciences.\r\n",
