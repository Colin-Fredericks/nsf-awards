 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract CMS-0527906\r\nCellular solids is a class of light weight materials with unique properties such as high stiffness- and strength-to-weight ratios, excellent energy absorption characteristics and exceptional insulation and acoustic properties. Advances in foaming and other manufacturing processes enable foam manufacture to prescribed cell sizes and densities. For this technology to reach its full potential, the cell size, density and properties of the base material must also be related to the mechanical, thermal, acoustic, and flow properties. The compressive response of most foams is characterized by an elastic regime which terminates into a limit load followed by an extended load plateau. At the end of the load plateau the response hardens again. The load plateau is responsible for their excellent energy absorption. The aim of this project is to use experiment and analysis to develop models which relate the microstructure and the properties of the base material to all relevant mechanical properties of metallic open cell foams.\r\n",
