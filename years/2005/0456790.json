 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims at providing a better understanding of the non-perturbative interaction of matter with laser pulses for various systems. In each of the proposed projects, understanding of the nonlinear quantum dynamics will be advanced primarily with the aid of computer simulations to allow for spatial and temporal resolution. It is also an aim of the proposal to narrow the gap between theoretical studies and experimental work.\r\nThe first sequence of projects focuses on new phenomena that occur if the laser fields are sufficiently intense to either trigger or affect the creation of electron-positron pairs from vacuum. The studies will build on a computational solution technique that has been developed recently by the PIs to solve the quantum field theoretical equations with full spatial and temporal resolution. The second group of projects examines numerically the single and double ionization mechanisms for atoms and ions in various static electric, magnetic and laser fields from highly correlated relativistic states. The third sequence of projects explores theoretically as well as experimentally the propagation of laser fields through heterogeneous dielectric random media.\r\nThe Intense Laser Physics (ILP) research group consists of two PIs, two postdocs, and typically eight undergraduate students.\r\n",
