Although buildings, bridges, nuclear power plants and like structures might not avoid catastrophic failure in extreme events,  research  needs  to  be  carried  out  to  protect  critical  structures.  In  the case  of  existing  structures,  a  quick  and  effective  way  to  achieve  this  goal  is  to  use structural  protection  systems  such  as  composite  jackets.  Previous  applications  of composite materials to civil structures were mainly focused on structural rehabilitation under fatigue or seismic loading (i.e., low strain rate situations). Systematic studies on improving structural survivability using composite materials and other protective materials  under  impact  or  blast  loading  condition  (high  strain  rate  situations)  have received only preliminary attention. However, fundamental scientific groundwork is still significantly  lacking.    The  goal  of  this  proposal  is  to  explore  the  fundamentals  of dynamic failure mechanism and mechanics involved in improving structural survivability using  protective  systems,  before  these  systems  can  be  extensively  applied  to  critical structures.  This  objective  will  be  implemented  through  real-time,  small-scale  model \r\nexperiments of dynamic failure incorporating dynamic fracture mechanics analysis.  \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activities is the identification of an interdisciplinary area of fundamental and practical importance. Complicated dynamic failure mechanism and  mechanics  can  be  extensively  explored  through  carefully  designed  small-scale model  experiments  before  these  principles  are  applied  to  practical  large-scale structures.  The  proposed  activities  will  advance  knowledge  and  understanding  within the  field  of  dynamic  failure  mechanics  and  across  broader  fields  including  composite materials  and  structural  engineering.  Since  this  project  is  focused  on  a  highly  visible research  area  of  international  importance  to  the  general  population,  it  is  expected  to lead to an immediate impact on society.  \r\n",
