 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor W. E. Billups, of the Chemistry Department at William Marsh Rice University.  The research will extend the PI's investigations of strained reactive intermediates, single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), and fullerenes.  Highly strained organic molecules of current theoretical interest will be prepared.  Since these compounds will be unstable at room temperature, their structure will be determined by low temperature x-ray crystallography.  Although the extraordinary electronic and mechanical properties of SWNTs suggest important applications, progress has been limited due to the insolubility of these substances in organic solvents.  In order to circumvent this problem an efficient and scalable route to solublized SWNTs will be developed.  In addition, a series of fullerene investigations will be initiated.  Included will be studies of highly reduced fullerenes as vehicles for storage of dihydrogen, the isolation of large fullerenes that are formed during the synthesis of carbon nanotubes, and investigations of fullerenes found in meteorites.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing fundamental information on the chemistry of energetic molecules and advanced materials, these studies will provide important interdisciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate students.  The involvement of these students in international collaborations will be especially valuable.\r\n",
