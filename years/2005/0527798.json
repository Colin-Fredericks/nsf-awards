 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS) together with the American Statistical Association is holding a Summer Research Conference (SRC) in Statistics during June 5-8, 2005, on the Clemson University campus in Clemson, South Carolina. The conference objective is to bring together statistics researchers of all academic levels  in a relaxed and stimulating atmosphere. The program includes five technical sessions that focus on major research areas in statistics: Time Series, Spatial Statistics, Survival Analysis and Reliability Theory, Markov Chains, and Bootstrap and Computational Statistics. Two additional sessions deal with issues in Statistics education, one focusing on trends and directions, the other on emerging pedagogical tools and technologies. A poster session is open for graduate students and other attendees to present their research. The sessions of the conference are not concurrent. Those attending the conference will be exposed to a wide range of topics of general and specific interest and to a range of speakers (20) bringing different perspectives to the material.  \r\n\r\nThe research topic areas are broad, with applications of the methodologies in a spectrum of fields (such as medicine, education, business, etc.) The individual 90-minutes sessions, featuring a senior speaker and two junior ones, are structured to provide in-depth coverage of the topic, from an overview by the senior speaker to specific, current research problems of the junior researchers. Advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior researchers are encouraged to attend and present in the judged poster session. Support to offset travel expenses for students and junior researchers by NSF is gratefully acknowledged.",
