Nepf\r\nSpatial heterogeneity in water temperature, and thus density, will drive horizontal flows\r\nthat carry fluxes between chemically distinct regions of a surface water body. The spatial\r\ngradients in water temperature may arise from differences in water depth or differences in\r\nlight penetration. For example, a spatially uniform heat flux causes the temperature\r\nwithin a shallow region to rise and fall more rapidly than an adjacent deep region. It is\r\nnow well recognized that the resulting buoyancy-driven exchange between the littoral\r\nand pelagic zones plays an important role in setting lake-scale chemistry and ecology.\r\nThe presence of emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation is a common feature of\r\nthe littoral region, yet only a handful of studies have considered the impact of vegetation\r\non littoral-pelagic exchange. Because vegetation provides significant drag, it can modify\r\nthe thermally-driven exchange current. Indeed, a scale analysis presented in the proposal\r\nshows how vegetation can control the rates of exchange. In addition, by partially or fully\r\nshading regions of the water column, the presence of both emergent and submerged\r\nvegetation can produce temperature gradients that drive flow between the vegetated\r\nregion and the open water. Because a distinct bio-chemical environment often exists\r\nwithin the vegetated zone, these exchange flows provide an important hydrodynamic link\r\nbetween biologically and chemically distinct regions of surface water.\r\nTo fully evaluate the impact of these flows on lake-scale chemistry and ecology, one\r\nmust be able to predict their frequency, duration and spatial footprint. The proposed\r\nproject will provide this predictive ability. A series of laboratory experiments have been\r\ndesigned to observe the formation and magnitude of thermally-driven exchange flows\r\nbetween open water and water with vegetation of different morphology. The velocity\r\nfield will be measured using digital particle imaging velocimetry (DPIV). Both emergent\r\nand submerged vegetation canopies will be considered. Further, the depth of heat\r\npenetration will be varied using water colorant to block more deeply penetrating\r\nwavelengths.\r\nThe results of the proposed work will enable researchers and lake managers to make\r\nbetter evaluations of how changes in the littoral zone, e.g. due to land development, may\r\nimpact the hydrodynamic link between the littoral and pelagic regions, and thus may\r\nimpact the lake-scale nutrient budget and ecology.",
