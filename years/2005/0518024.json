 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will support two annual workshops for Digital Government program grantees and government partners and students. An attendance of 200 is expected. This year tutorials will be added. The grant will also support the continued administration, management, and content development of the web site www.digitalgovernment.org. The final product of the event will be a multimedia diskette with interviews and copies of all workshop-related materials. This is the fifth annual workshop. Among other values, the workshop presents a successful forum for local, state, national and international government staffers to interact with academic computer and information scientists for the purpose of identifying common interests and possible collaborative research proposals. Additionally, a welcome forum is created for dialog between technical digital government researchers and those from the social sciences with an interest in digital governance, e-voting, impact of IT on  government organizations and the citizenry's interaction with various levels of governance.",
