 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Charleston Southern University will acquire a 400 MHz Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on syntheses of novel pyrazolyl methane ligand systems, novel nucleoside transport inhibitors as well as studying the chemical exchange and fluxionality in transition metal coordination complexes.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas, especially synthetic chemistry. \r\n",
