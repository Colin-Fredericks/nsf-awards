 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ginzburg-Landau model serves as a basic paradigm for a\r\nbroad spectrum of subjects in pattern-forming systems in general\r\nand in superconductivity in particular.  The investigator studies\r\nseveral fundamental theoretical problems related to this model. \r\nSome of the specific problems that he examines lie at the heart of\r\nthe Ginzburg-Landau formalism.  These include the understanding of\r\ntime-dependent formulation and of thermal fluctuations, together\r\nwith the elucidation of the behavior of superconductors near the\r\nsample's boundary.  Other problems studied are related to\r\ntransport phenomena in thin wires with Joesphson junctions.  Such\r\nstructures are crucial in several basic superconducting devices. \r\nThe investigator suggests a research direction that leads to the\r\nintroduction of novel junctions.  Finally, he analyzes the\r\nexistence of stable patterns in different systems (including\r\nliquid crystals and superconductors with impurities) where the\r\nstability is not generated by an acting external force, but by the\r\ntopology of the sample. \r\n\r\n     One aspect of the project is to enhance the fundamental\r\nunderstanding of superconductivity.  A second aspect of this\r\nproject is to study transport in extremely narrow networks.  While\r\nthe main motivation is to consider such transport processes in\r\nsuperconductors, these types of problems are relevant to many\r\nareas.  For example, quantum wires are among the current leading\r\nmodels for quantum computers, microchannel chips are developing\r\ninto fast and efficient tools in chemical analysis, etc.  The work\r\nin this area will have an impact on certain directions in\r\nnanotechnology.  A major theme of the project is to exploit the\r\nsimilarity between the mathematical methods used in different\r\napplications, such as optics, liquid crystals, and\r\nsuperconductivity, in order to apply techniques developed in one\r\nof these areas to another one.",
