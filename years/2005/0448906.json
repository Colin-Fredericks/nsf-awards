 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in a variety of technologies and applications call for improved performance and\r\nreliability, while exacerbating the complexity and uncertainty of systems and their surroundings.\r\nAlthough classical control theory already allows for a high degree of machine automation, a\r\nrenewed interest in systems that display intelligent behavior is emerging across disciplines. The\r\nproposed research will develop a novel adaptive control approach that approximates the nonlinear\r\ncontrol law by a sigmoidal neural network, and optimizes its performance on line, subject to\r\nactual plant dynamics. By combining approximate dynamic programming and integral quadratic\r\nconstraints, it can be shown that the neural network controller is characterized by the same\r\nclosed-loop stability and robustness guarantees as classical H-infinity controllers. Ensuring that\r\nthese properties are preserved during adaptation will make the adaptive design viable for\r\napplications where safety is a leading concern, such as, reconfigurable aircraft control.\r\nAs part of the proposed research, the adaptive control approach will be demonstrated not only\r\nthrough numerical simulations, but also through experiments. The first testbed will consist of a\r\ncantilevered beam with piezoelectric devices used as disturbance and control sources. In the\r\nexperiments, the effectiveness of the adaptive controller for reducing the vibration of the first two\r\nnatural modes will be tested and compared to that of controllers with parameters held fixed.\r\nAfter considering this low-dimensional system, the approach will be implemented to design an\r\nadaptive flight controller based on the model of an experimental fly-by-wire Raytheon Bonanza\r\naircraft. The flight controller will be tested on a piloted simulator developed by an experienced\r\nresearch group at Wichita State University (WSU). Subsequently, the PI will work with the WSU\r\ngroup and Raytheon Aircraft Company on interfacing the control software with the on-board\r\nflight computer, and on testing it on the Bonanza through a set of experimental flights.\r\nResearch and education on control theory and practice will be integrated by designing a set of\r\nexperiments for undergraduate and TIP high-school students that employ the following testbeds: a\r\nvibrating cantilevered beam, an acoustic enclosure, and a flapping micro-aerial vehicle. The\r\nbroader impact of this project is the creation of initiatives that expose students from K12 through\r\ngraduate school to advanced control research and experiments being conducted in the aerospace\r\nindustry and at NASA. By leading undergraduates and TIP students through these experiments,\r\nthe PI's graduate students will become important role models for a diverse and gifted group of\r\nyoungsters.",
