 "awd_abstract_narration": "Webspinners (order Embioptera) are a curious group of insects found\r\nmainly in tropical forests.  Their biology is among the most poorly studied\r\nof any insect group even though webspinners are known to exhibit a range of\r\nunique biological phenomena.  They are the only insects that spin silk from\r\nglands in their front legs, and they do so as both immatures and adults.\r\nThey exhibit maternal care and often live in groups where they use silk to\r\nconstruct large and sometimes intricate galleries in which they live and\r\nrear their young.  The types of galleries and behaviors associated with silk\r\nspinning vary considerably throughout the group, and nothing is known about\r\nthe composition of silk proteins and the genetic basis for silk production.\r\nAlthough there are only about 400 species of webspinners known, estimates\r\nsuggest there may be more than 1500 new species already in collections but\r\nnot formally described and many more in Nature awaiting discovery.\r\nWebspinner classification is in a poor state never having been updated using\r\na modern, phylogenetic basis.  A collaborative research and training project\r\nbetween laboratories at three universities will assemble a group of\r\nresearchers with the expertise to investigate the phylogeny, behavioral\r\necology and classification of the Embioptera.  At Brigham Young University,\r\nphylogenetic analyses will be conducted using molecular and morphological\r\ndata and will form the basis of an improved natural classification of the\r\ngroup.  At Santa Clara University, biological aspects of the insects such as\r\ncolony construction, maternal care and habitat requirements will be examined\r\nwithin a phylogenetic context by tracing these features through the\r\nphylogeny.  Finally, at the University of California, Riverside, the genetic\r\nbasis for silk production will be examined by discovering the DNA sequences\r\nthat code for silk in several species, and the variation in these silk genes\r\nwill be investigated within the context of webspinner phylogeny.  Results\r\nwill be disseminated in scientific journals and through applications of\r\nmodern, digital technology including digital image galleries, digital\r\nreproductions of literature, digital matrix-based identification keys, etc.\r\nMuseum holdings of webspinners will be enhanced by curation and new material\r\nfrom fieldwork.\r\n\tThis collaborative project represents the first comprehensive\r\ninvestigation of the phylogeny and biology of webspinners ever done.  Since\r\nembiids occur in often fragile ecosystems, better knowledge of the group\r\nwill likely have important relevance to conservation of these habitats.\r\nAlso, this work will foster multidisciplinary collaboration between\r\nbiologists in disparate fields and facilitate the training of postdoctoral\r\nfellows and students in multidisciplinary research. The research will\r\ninvolve undergraduates extensively to give them a firm background in\r\nscience, including proper research methods and ethics. When the project\r\nobjectives are met, a historically little-known insect group will be more\r\naccessible to everyone through the published results, and a positive\r\nlong-term impact on the scientific community will occur because of the broad\r\ncross-disciplinary training of researchers at several academic levels.\r\n",
