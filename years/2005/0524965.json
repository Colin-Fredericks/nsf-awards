 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project increases by approximately one-third the total graduation numbers of students in STEM fields at a four-year institution that is the lead with three, two-year institutions in a consortium that has a total enrollment of 20,000 students. This program has three strategies: 1. The Community College Science Expansion Initiative increases enrollment of STEM students at Purchase College by offering joint matriculation at the three partner community colleges. Students receive a full range of programs (advising, peer mentors, research opportunities, internships, career counseling, scholarships) while they study at the community college and after they transfer. 2. Programs to Foster Innovative Pedagogy in Introductory STEM Courses help to reduce attrition among students who discontinue the study of STEM fields due to poor educational experiences. Instructors incorporate interactive teaching strategies that are structured around clearly stated measurable learning outcomes. Twice-yearly pedagogy workshops for faculty who teach introductory STEM courses at the four partner institutions provide the forum for developing collaborative learning exercises. 3. Programs to Improve Retention of Science Students include discipline-based freshman seminars, peer mentoring, faculty counseling, internships, career programs, and research opportunities to increase the retention of STEM students at the four-year college. Several corporate partners have committed to provide internships.",
