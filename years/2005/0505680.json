 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will investigate several problems concerning the spectra of random\r\nmatrices and random Schroedinger operators.  Foremost, the PI will\r\ncontinue his study of random matrices with no symmetry, establishing\r\nfluctuation results for linear spectral statistics, limit theorems for the\r\nspectral edge, and further investigating the connections between these\r\nensembles and roots of random polynomials. In the realm of Hermitian\r\nrandom matrices, the PI will employ the Riemann-Hilbert Problem method to\r\ninvestigate the behavior of the Janossy densities for large dimensional\r\n'Unitary Ensembles'.  The goal is to then use these results to establish\r\nthe speed of convergence of the largest eigenvalue distribution to its\r\nlimiting Tracy-Widom distribution.  Finally, the PI will generalize his\r\nrecent results on the distribution of the ground state eigenvalue of a\r\none-dimensional periodic Schroedinger operator with White Noise potential\r\nto a broader class of random potentials.\r\n\r\nThe random matrix models under study in this proposal have important\r\napplications to such disparate areas as multivariate statistics (principal\r\ncomponent analysis), theoretical physics (energy levels and resonances of\r\nquantum systems) and electrical engineering (signal processing and\r\nwireless communication).  Schroedinger operators with random potential on\r\nthe other hand have long been studied as fundmental models in disordered\r\nsolids.  The PI brings to bear a variety of techniques from Probability\r\nand Analysis to study the detailed behavior of basic classes of random\r\nmatrices and random Schroedinger operators in physically relevant limiting\r\nregimes.  An overall goal of this proposal is to uncover new\r\ncommonalities, or universal properties, of these models through asymptotic\r\nanalysis.\r\n",
