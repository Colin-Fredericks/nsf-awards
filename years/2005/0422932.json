 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovative approaches to developing novel inorganic-organic hybrid semiconductor nanostructured materials for solar cell applications are proposed. These hybrid composites are made of inorganic components of semiconductors with a variety of band gaps and suitable organic spacers. They possess numerous advantages over conventional semiconductors, including giant band-gap tunability, enhanced absorption capability, large carrier mobility, lightweight, excellent processability, flexibility, and structure diversity and tailorability, all of which are highly desirable for new-generation photovoltaic technologies. This project will emphasize materials synthesis, structure and property characterization and modification, and illustrate plausible device fabrication for this unique class of hybrid materials.  \r\n%%%\r\nThis research project aims to develop a unique class of hybrid nanostructured materials that are composed of II-VI and/or III-V semiconductors and suitable organic spacers.  Hybrid materials that combine the superior electronic, magnetic, optical properties and thermal stability of inorganic frameworks with the structural diversity, flexibility, high processability, and light-weight of organic molecules can enhance and strengthen the functionality and performance of these materials for various applications areas including new-generation photovoltaic technologies. The research project will provide outstanding opportunities for postdoc, graduate and undergraduate participants to develop the complex multidisciplinary skills needed to advance materials science.\r\n\r\n",
