The goal of this research program is to provide comprehensive measurements of the electronic, optoelectronic, mechanical, and thermal properties of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes of fully defined structure.  The experimental approach relies on the growth of freely suspended nanotubes across a slit in a silicon substrate. Optical characterization by Rayleigh and Raman spectroscopy will probe the electronic and vibrational properties, and the results will be correlated with direct structural characterization of the nanotubes. Evaporation of metallic pads onto the substrates will enable optoelectronic, thermal, and mechanical studies. The investigations will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with researchers in Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, and Physics; the team will be complemented by strong interactions with researchers at government laboratories and in industry.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will generate advances in the basic knowledge of the properties of carbon nanotubes. Studies of this model system enhance the scientific understanding of materials of reduced dimensionality.  The results are also importance for a wide range of potential applications, in the areas including electronics, optoelectronics, sensors, and structural materials. The educational impact of the program extends to interdisciplinary training of graduate students and postdocs, as well as to significant participation of undergraduates in the research program.  The educational impact is further enhanced by the integrated involvement of students and faculty at the City College of the City University of New York and Rowan University.\r\n\r\n",
