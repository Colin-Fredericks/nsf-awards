 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) seeks funding to support its newly formed Computer Science Teacher's Association (CSTA).  CSTA is addressing the enrollment crisis in CS: Despite the pressing need for students to learn foundational computer science skills, course enrollments are dropping at the secondary and post-secondary levels, and the number of young women and minority students studying computing is at an all-time low. CSTA is addressing this on a national scale, through collaboration with leaders from all levels of education, government, industry, and partnering non-profit organizations. CSTA has begun reframing computer science within K-12 education as a true science. It has launched national programs to conduct research, develop curriculum and certification standards, provide professional development opportunities, and create and disseminate new resources for teachers nationwide.\r\n\r\nTo support this organization in its nascent stages, CSTA is requesting funding for a portion of its\r\ninfrastructure, for research, and for the implementation of its goal to establish K-12 computer science as an essential academic discipline (as opposed to a technical application) and address the key issues that have hampered efforts to systematically address the needs of all students. By building a national multi-level community of educators and stakeholders who share resources, new research, and best practices, CSTA will revitalize K-12 computer science education, and promote CS as a career choice.\r\n",
