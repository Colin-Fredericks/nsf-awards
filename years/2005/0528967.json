 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA hybrid sensor/actuator network, which consists of a large number of static sensors and relatively\r\nsmall number of mobile robotic sensors, opens new frontiers in a variety of civilian and military\r\napplications and in some scientific disciplines. The combination of a wireless sensor network and\r\na multi-robot system reduces the cost but significantly enhances each other's capability. The static\r\nwireless sensor network provides collaborative sensing, communication, coordination and navigation\r\nto a multi-robot system and human operators. The mobile robots augment sensor networks'\r\ncapability by their mobility and advanced sensing, communication and computation capability.\r\nThe objective of this project is to address two challenging research issues in a hybrid sensor/\r\nactuator network: autonomous sensor/actuator coordination algorithms and self-configuring\r\ncommunication protocols. The specific goals of this research project include: (i) dynamic modeling\r\nand organization of hybrid sensor/actuator networks; (ii) sensor/actuator coordination algorithms to\r\nreallocate sensing, networking and computing resources to provide required coverage and specified\r\nsensing accuracy; (iii) self-configuring protocols to provide information for environmental sensing,\r\ncommunication, robot coordination and navigation; (iv) robot navigation algorithms in sensor\r\nnetworks; and (v) a perceptive reference frame for the analysis and design of the coordination\r\nalgorithms and communication protocols.\r\nThe PI will develop an effective education program in sensor networks and multi-robot systems\r\nat Michigan Technological University, with the objective to foster creative thinking and analytical\r\nskills. The PI will promote competition-motivated learning by the development of a senior level\r\none-year design course and an Enterprise program using the concept of networked systems of mobile\r\nrobots and sensors. The outreach activities to K-12 education include: (i) participating in two of the\r\nsummer youth programs, woman in engineering and explorations in engineering, which encourage\r\nwomen and underrepresented groups to pursue engineering careers; (ii) providing leadership in\r\nprofessional development for teachers, especially for teachers in local school districts.\r\nMajor Intellectual Merits and Broader Impact\r\nThe intellectual merit is the understanding of the control and self-organization of a complex hybrid\r\nsensor/actuator networks. The accomplishment of this project will have substantial intellectual merits\r\nin three areas: (i) multi-robot systems: understanding how to model a dynamic and distributed large\r\nscale system, as well as how to coordinate and navigate multiple mobile robots in sensor networks;\r\n(ii) sensor networks: understanding how to enhance sensing and communication using mobility,\r\nas well as how to cluster a sensor network for energy efficient routing and tracking; (iii) other\r\nfrontiers: application of the algorithms in safety control of Intelligent Transportation Systems, and\r\nresearch in ecosystems and environmental monitoring.\r\nThe broader impact of this project is a natural outcome of the innovative research and education\r\nprograms. The results of this research activity provide systemic design approaches for\r\nrapid deployment of hybrid sensor/actuator networks, which will impact research in environmental\r\nmonitoring and ecosystems, and find myriad applications such as battlefield surveillance. The\r\neducational plan will directly benefit the anticipated education activities in robotics and networks.\r\nThe educational plan will strengthen our educational objectives by enhancing the content of graduate\r\nand undergraduate classes, and by providing meaningful experiences to undergraduate researchers.\r\nEvery year, the outreach programs help hundreds of pre-college students, many of whom are women\r\nor minorities, to improve scientific understanding and interest in engineering and technology.\r\nA-1",
