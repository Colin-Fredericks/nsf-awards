 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0452679/0452706\r\n\r\nConvection in the Mediterranean Sea produces a warm salty water mass that flows over the Gibraltar sill into the Atlantic at mid-depth, forming one of the most pronounced property distributions tongue in the global ocean.  The impact of these overflow waters on the dynamics and properties of the North Atlantic basin is disproportionate to its relatively small volume flux. The high salinity contributes to the preconditioning of the surface waters in the Nordic Seas for deep convection, either directly via advection or indirectly via mixing.  Additionally, these waters establish the property fields in the eastern North Atlantic over a depth range that  considerably  exceeds  the  overflow  thickness, and of  the  entire mid-depth subtropical basin, influence the dynamics of the eastern basin.  \r\n \r\nThe variability of the Mediterranean overflow wagters has been largely ignored.  A recent study  has  shown  increases  in  the  temperature  and salinity over the past fifty years.  The two main questions of this study are: what is the spatial and temporal context for these changes, and what is the impact  of  these  changes  on  the  property  fields  and  dynamics  of  the  eastern  North  Atlantic  and on the basin as a whole?  To address these questions, data and modeling analyses are proposed to assess not only the consequence of Mediterranean overflow variability on the basin, but also the relative importance of other sources of variability.  While past studies have  focused on  the mesoscale  variability  created by Meddies, our focus will be on  interannual  and  decadal  time  scales\r\n \r\nOverall, the salinification of the Mediterranean overflow waters stands in sharp contrast to the observed freshening of high latitude surface waters and of the convective water masses emanating from the northern North Atlantic.  If high latitude waters continue to freshen, the bulk of the convective activity that sends heat to the deep ocean may fall to source waters at mid-latitudes, providing added impetus for the study of the Mediterranean overflow waters. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit:  This work will determine the source of long-term variability for a water mass that plays an important role for the properties of the eastern North Atlantic, and for  the  climate  of  the  global  ocean.    Additionally,  the  dynamic  response  of  a  basin  to  a temporally  varying  overflow  will  be  evaluated  to  establish  the  spatial  and  temporal  variability  of  the basin's property fields. \r\n  \r\nBroader  Impacts:    An  improved  understanding  of  the  fate of the overflow  will illuminate how changes in a marginal sea are transmitted through the open ocean, and will help improive the modeling of overflow waters throughout the global ocean.  Finally, this work will train a graduate student in modeling and data analyses. \r\n\r\n",
