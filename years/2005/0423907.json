 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF/CONACyT research project seeks to address issues in the area of micro assembly, which will benefit American manufacturing organizations in a variety of domains.  Micro devices, which possess different materials, or complex geometries, cannot utilize the widely available monolithic MEMS fabrication techniques. In such situations, assembly of micro devices becomes inevitable.  The overall objective of this research is to investigate the modeling of gripping forces for micro assembly applications.  In addition, the role of interactive forces coming into play during nano manipulation will also be studied. Educational modules targeting under graduate and graduate engineering students will also be created as part of this project.  Specifically, the objectives are to: (a) Develop a taxonomy for gripper system configuration and design  (b) Investigate the modeling of gripping forces and their effects on the geometry of components (b) Support educational activities through development of educational modules (targeting engineering students) as well as facilitate outreach efforts to school students in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe educational activities proposed will introduce the next generation of industrial and manufacturing engineering students to cutting edge concepts addressed in this project.  Sandia National Laboratories will be the industrial collaborator in this project; they will provide real world case studies and necessary knowledge, as well as play a role in validating the project findings.\r\nA focus in this project is the education of minority students at New Mexico State University (NMSU).  Outreach activities involving school students and teachers will be conducted as part of the Soaring Eagle initiative at NMSU.  This project will enhance the existing infrastructure at NMSU as well as highlight the usefulness of Internet2 for learning activities. Dissemination activities will include publishing papers in leading journals, through a project web site, as well as through paper presentations at conferences such as the annual American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE) conferences.\r\n",
