Roberts\r\nUniversity of Nevada Las Vegas\r\n\r\nMany behavioral life history transitions occur typically only once and during the adult stage of an organism as it moves into a new environment or changes a life history tactic. Such transitions are common in nature and include the age-related switch from nest/hive work to foraging in social insects such as the honey bee. Although the literature on expression of heat-shock or stress proteins (Hsps) is vast, one of the unanswered questions is how often and to what extent Hsps are expressed across the lifespan of a terrestrial animal in nature. The proposed research will provide important insight into how age, gene expression and functional capacity interact with behavior, particularly foraging, in a complex social species. It will provide the first measures of the cellular cost of a behavior and some of the first measures of actual stress encountered over the lifetime of a mobile terrestrial animal in its natural environment. This award will support the professional development of a postdoctoral researcher, and a new female scientist at the earliest stages of her career.\r\n",
