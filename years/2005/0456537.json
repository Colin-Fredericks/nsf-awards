 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to understand, model and explore new recyclable high temperature thermoplastic based materials containing several different carbon fillers to meet all the current and future specifications for bipolar plates in fuel cells. Fuel cells have been proposed as a clean alternative energy source, which can be used to power vehicles. A typical fuel cell contains hundreds of bipolar plates, which consist of a highly thermally and electrically conductive material. The following approach will be used. First, the synergistic effects (using statistical experimental design) of different carbon-based conductive fillers (carbon fiber, carbon black, synthetic and natural flake graphite) and filler-matrix adhesion on electrical and thermal conductivity of highly filled (up to 80 wt% filler) conductive resins will be determined. It is likely that by combining different carbon fillers and studying the effect of filler-matrix adhesion, a positive synergistic effect on thermal and electrical conductivity will be obtained. Second, bipolar plates will be fabricated and tested for a fuel cell stack at Dana Corporation (industrial partner). Third, better electrical and thermal conductivity models will be developed for highly filled conductive resins. Current conductivity models have only been developed for resins containing < 40 wt% filler, which is much lower than the 70 to 90 wt% filler used for bipolar plates. \r\n\r\nThis project will benefit society in several ways. First, accurate models for highly filled conductive resins will enable material design without extensive experimental work and testing.  Such models will benefit society by reducing new product development costs. Second, this proposed work will be incorporated into the K-12 (through summer youth programs), undergraduate, and graduate curriculum. This collaborative industrial and educational project will allow fuel cells to become an affordable, viable, and sustainable energy alternative for the 21st century.\r\n\r\n",
