 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will provide support for measurements of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) fluxes in an Arctic tundra ecosystem.  These measurements are to be made in conjunction with an existing NSF-funded project that is studying flows of nutrients and carbon at the Imnavait Creek watershed near the Toolik Field Station at Toolik Lake, Alaska.  The field campaign is to be conducted at the peak of the tundra ecosystem growing season (late July/early August) to enable direct measurements of the isoprene fluxes using equipment from the existing project.  These measurements will be supplemented with leaf level data to gain information about other BVOC emissions such as higher terpenes.  Arctic tundra ecosystems are undergoing significant changes due to high latitude warming, and BVOC measurements have the potential to be a sensitive indicator of these changes since emissions depend strongly on the state of the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses important issues regarding atmospheric processes in ecosystems that are very sensitive to climate change, and will thus benefit society.  This award supports an early career scientist for a timely research opportunity.",
