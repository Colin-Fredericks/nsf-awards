The Summit will serve as a forum for over 600 public and private sector leaders around the country to discuss recommendations and implementation of the National Innovation Initiative, a 14-month study that has embarked upon an ambitious program of activities to improve the nation's understanding of the interconnections between innovation, economic growth and competitiveness in a global economy. As the nature of innovation continues to change worldwide, the US now confronts new challenges to its global leadership and must prepare for the future.  By convening the country's key innovation leaders, the NII seeks to create a national innovation action agenda, identify critical innovation trends impacting US competitiveness, and raise awareness of the critical role of diverse stakeholders in improving the platform for innovation, all important to sustaining the nation's economic and technological vitality.",
