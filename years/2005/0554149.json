 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nHurricane Katrina Power & Telecommunication System Failure Modes\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nExisting communication systems in the NO area have been ineffective in support of emergency\r\npersonnel. These systems have failed as a result of electrical power outages, flooding, and wind\r\ndamage. Representative Cravin's interview on KPEL (9-2-05) illustrates a typical problem in the\r\nfield - there was a table full of radios from different agencies each on a different frequency, and\r\nthe personnel did not know which one to use to call someone. Electrical power grid outages\r\noccurred over a large area, but most significantly in critical locations such as hospitals, public\r\nworks departments, and cellular towers. Emergency power generators at such locations were less\r\nthan effective as a result of flooding, failure to start, and limited fuel supply. The\r\ntelecommunication and power systems are needed most when a disaster such as Hurricane\r\nKatrina occurs, but it is this very environment that caused the systems to fail.\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nWe propose to study the infrastructure and procedural failure modes that caused the New Orleans\r\narea emergency telecommunication network and power system to become ineffective and fail.\r\nWe plan to work with state agencies (State Police, Office of Emergency Preparedness -OEP),\r\nand appropriate public and private local agencies to assess the status and shortcomings of the\r\nexisting systems.",
