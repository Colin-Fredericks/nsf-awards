 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preparing prospective mathematics teachers for technology-equipped classrooms in the 21st century is a complex task. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (2000) and the Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences (CBMS, 2002) advocate the use of technology in learning K-16 mathematics. Given the changing nature of technology, it is important that prospective teachers (PSTs) develop a model of teaching and learning that goes beyond the specifics of a technology tool so that they are able to make informed decisions about the appropriate use of technology (CBMS, 2002). \r\n\tMany teacher preparation programs include a focus on the use of technology for teaching school mathematics. At North Carolina State University (NCSU), all middle and secondary mathematics education majors take a required Teaching Mathematics with Technology course. The goal of the full-scale project is to develop curriculum materials in the form of modules for this type of course. The modules provide opportunities for middle and secondary PSTs to develop: 1) deeper conceptual understanding of school mathematics topics 2) proficiency in using technology tools, 3) effective pedagogical techniques, and 4) abilities to analyze students' thinking when using technology tools to solve mathematical tasks. \r\nThe specific objective for this proof-of-concept project is to create one prototype module for Data Analysis and Probability. Although simulation and data analysis tools (e.g., graphing calculators, spreadsheets, Fathom, Probability Explorer) may be available, there is a need for high quality teacher education materials to help mathematics education faculty become comfortable with and incorporate materials for teaching PSTs how to teach probability and data analysis with technology. The development and testing of the module include drafting plans, discussions among advisory board members and PIs about plans, completing the draft module, field testing and evaluating at NCSU, revising materials, and disseminating revised materials online for further field testing at NCSU and several other institutions. Through the use of an advisory board and mathematics consultant, diverse universities and organizations in North Carolina are represented, including two universities with large teacher preparation programs, a private university, a technology-intensive secondary school, and an organization specializing in educational evaluation. \r\nBecause of the modular design and electronic format used, the materials have a broader impact across settings as they are used in a methods course focusing on the use of technology in the teaching of mathematics, as a unit within a mathematics methods course (for grades 6-8, 9-12, or 6-12), or as part of a professional development for inservice teachers. By preparing teachers to effectively use technology in mathematics, our broader impact also includes improving grade 6-12 students' mathematical and technological literacy. \r\n\r\n",
