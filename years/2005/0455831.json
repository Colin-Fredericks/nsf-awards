 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple ground and space-based diagnostics are used to probe the plasmasphere boundary from mid-latitudes.  The primary diagnostics include the Intercepted Signals for Ionospheric Science (ISIS) coherent software radio system, and an extant Global Positioning System (GPS) array, which are constructed and operated at no cost to this research.  In addition to the GPS total-electron-content (TEC) maps and passive multi-static radar imaging by ISIS, the Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) serves as a cross-calibration of ionospheric conditions, and TOPEX and JASON satellite are also used to augment the collected TEC database.  The ISIS array is here composed of an expanded Manatash Ridge Radar in Washington State, and a collection of coherent imaging Doppler receivers placed by the University of Texas at Austin in an area around the Millstone Hill radar.  University of Texas at Austin also contributes expertise with the Ionospheric Data Assimilation 3D (IDA3D) model.  The GPS array used is the Canadian GPS Network for Ionospheric Modeling (CANGIM), which is expanding from four to nine receivers during the early period of this research effort under the auspices of the University of Calgary.  These widely distributed ISIS and GPS arrays are a nascent example of the \"distributed array of small instruments\" or DASI, concept.  The purpose of this DASI is to examine the evolution of ionospheric structures with a large-scale (mid-latitude to auroral northern hemisphere latitudes) context and high spatial resolution.  Detailed statistical characterization of plasma transport, storm-time electric fields, and instability onset are planned.",
