 "awd_abstract_narration": "The enormous advances in methods to synthesize nanometer-sized Fe(III)-\r\nhydroxide clusters can answer questions about the Fe(III)-solid surfaces that have\r\npuzzled geochemists for decades. These questions include: (i) Which bridging hydroxyls\r\nexchange oxygen isotopes with bulk solution via what rate laws? (ii) Where do electronexchanges\r\nproceed? (iii) Can our computer models predict this chemistry? (iv) What\r\nlevel of accuracy, that is, expense, is needed?\r\nWe propose a set of projects involving molecular clusters that have many Fe(III)\r\nor Al(III) atoms linked together with sets of hydroxyl bridges. The family of\r\nhomologous molecules (Fe17, Fe19, Al13 and Al15) have a similar structural core but\r\nvarying numbers of Al(III) or Fe(III) metal centers. Clusters can be chosen that have, or\r\ndo not have, bound water molecules. The fact that Fe(III) and Al(III) clusters can be\r\nsynthesized that are structurally similar is an enormous experimental advantage. The\r\nAl13 and Al15 clusters are diamagnetic and allow NMR experiments, including 17O, 27Al,\r\n13C and 1H. Even the Fe(III) clusters allow probing via the methods of isotope-exchange\r\nand paramagnetic NMR.\r\nThe projects that we propose are to: (i) Determine the reactivity of different\r\noxygens in the clusters via isotope-exchange experiments; (ii) Evaluate the dynamics in\r\nthe 'adsorbed' organic ligand that makes the clusters stable in water, including the\r\nresidence times in the bound state; and particularly: (iii) Evaluate the tools needed to\r\npredict reactivities in Fe(III)-hydroxide solids and molecules. This last point can be\r\nrestated: 'What level of quantum sophistication is required to obtain a structure accurate\r\nto better than 0.05 A? Better than 0.01 A'? In previous studies, we found that a change in\r\nbond length of 0.03 A changes the adjacent hydroxide oxygen-isotope exchange rates by\r\na factor of i-103. 'How sophisticated must our methods of treating electron correlation\r\nbe?' 'What constitutes an adequate basis for wave-function representation?' and: 'What\r\nare the most promising types of computationally inexpensive methods that can yield\r\nhidden reaction pathways in systems that are sufficiently large to be geochemically\r\nrelevant?' How does one construct a useful reduced representation of electronic\r\nstructure? The molecules allow a fairly dense progression from small to large\r\n(monomers, dimers, tetramers, Al13, Al15, Fe17, and Fe19 clusters) and this series provides\r\na way to systematically extrapolate accurate calculations that are possible on small\r\nmolecules to more approximate methods needed for extended solids surfaces and\r\ngeochemistry.\r\nThe implications of this research extend well beyond Earth science. This research\r\nwill be used by many disciplines, including colloid chemistry, nanoscience, and medicine\r\n(metalloproteins such as ferritin resemble these clusters). Also, enrollment at UCD draws\r\ndisproportionately from the high population of new immigrants to the United States, so\r\nthese funds bring nontraditional but highly talented students into the Earth Sciences. We\r\ntrain a diverse group of students in the latest techniques of quantitative geochemistry and\r\nwe blur the distinction between Earth science and inorganic chemistry, which is\r\nimportant for the training of fearless young geochemists.",
