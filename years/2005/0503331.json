 "awd_abstract_narration": "Underrepresented minority (URM) students generally attend less selective STEM\r\ninstitutions, have disproportionately low io2 nd year continuation rateslu in STEM majors,\r\nand across all institutions regardless of selectivity or LSAMP participation achieve 6-year\r\ngraduations of <35% compared to >60% for non-minorities. In Phase I of the NE-\r\nLSAMP we have increased the enrollment, retention and graduation URM STEM\r\nstudents beyond that possible through the initiative of any single institution. As\r\nisselectivele institutions, our Phase II work combines proven interventions (mentoring,\r\nundergraduate research opportunities, etc) and interventions with high potential for\r\nsuccess (Supplemental Instruction in inbarrier courseslr, individual tracking) both to\r\nnormalize rates of URM persistence and graduation in STEM and to increase\r\nprofessional/graduate education placements of NE-LSAMP students.\r\nUsing our common commitment to LSAMP as a lynchpin, we have established\r\nworking relationships for project planning, information sharing, database management,\r\nand budgetary operations during Phase I . We document our substantial progress\r\ntoward achieving the stated Phase I enrollment and degree completion objectives.\r\nURM STEM majors increased by 12% in Year 3 and STEM bachelors degrees awarded\r\nto URM students increased by 50% that year. We are on a trajectory to significantly\r\nincrease each measure by the final year of Phase I funding.\r\nTo our ongoing Phase I objectives we now add specific Phase II objectives: to\r\nform an Alliance-wide community of LSAMP students through annual meetings and\r\ninter-campus activities; to provide irnear peerlr graduate student mentors for LSAMP\r\nstudents from NE-AGEP partners; to track individual LSAMP student persistence and\r\ngraduation and identify individual graduate STEM enrollment or professional STEM\r\nplacement. Alliance partners will track students in a database consistent with NSF\r\nreporting requirements including all data elements that are submitted to QRC (the\r\nLSAMP national reporting database). Along with students demographic and ethnic data,\r\nthe database will include sections for research accomplishments and post-baccalaureate\r\ncareer path whether academic or professional employment.\r\nThe NE-LSAMP will continue its successful Phase I activities. Additionally, in\r\nPhase II we will:\r\nImplement an Alliance-wide UROP program as an outcome of our iubest\r\npracticesli analysis at Advisory Board meetings. Faculty involvement with LSAMP\r\nstudents is a required component of the undergraduate research opportunities now present\r\nat each alliance campus and inter-campus interactions for UROP students will be added.\r\nPartner with the NE-AGEP as a resource for graduate student itnear peerlr role\r\nmodel mentors for our LSAMP students.\r\nConvene a iostudent leadershipls conference for all URM STEM students each\r\nspring to assist LSAMP students in career exploration and provide information about\r\napplying to and financing graduate education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Northeast LSAMP was the first Alliance established in the New England area.  In 2001 the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the University of Connecticut, the University of Rhode Island, Northeastern University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute joined forces to form the Northeast LSAMP.  The primary goal, consistent with LSAMP across the country, was to increase enrollment, retention and graduation rates of under-represented students in the science, technology, engineering and mathematic disciplines (STEM); the expectation was that forming this Alliance would contribute to the success of this goal beyond that possible through the initiative of any single institution.  The diversity of the 5 institutions that comprise this Alliance is reflected in the various LSAMP-supported activities on each campus.  Using our common commitment to LSAMP as a lynchpin, we have established working relationships for project planning, information sharing, database management, and budgetary operations as well as Alliance-wide activities.\n\n \n\nThe most successful strategies reported to recruit and retain a diverse student body include a comprehensive approach in which faculty, current students, and administrators work together to recruit, mentor and support minority students.  The Northeast LSAMP has combined proven interventions such as mentoring, undergraduate research opportunities, and interventions with a high potential for success such as Supplemental Instruction in barrier courses and cohort development to increase both the enrollment and graduation rates of students from under-represented populations in the STEM disciplines.   Northeast Alliance campuses can now offer these students bridge programs, offices of undergraduate research, and LSAMP scholar programs as well as access to tutoring and Supplemental Instruction.  We have piloted an international research program and have supported LSAMP students participating in others as well.  Alliance-wide events further enhance the networking by providing a common experience for students to learn from and about each other.  Confronted with the challenges of our various academic calendars and unique institutional demands, the Northeast LSAMP has persisted and generally offers no less than two Alliance-wide events annually.\n\n \n\nThe Northeast LSAMP has also worked to support and partner with many other programs on each geared to increase the talented workforce necessary for national economic development.   Examples of this support and collaboration, leading to enhanced student opportunities includes, but is certainly not limited to: Gk-12 programs; Broadening Participation in Computer Science; the Urban Alliance; the Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence in New England, and Geosciences Education.  Essentially the Northeast LSAMP is ready and willing to partner with any effort that will increase and enhance the opportunities for undergraduate scholars including those from underrepresented groups to persist to excellence in the STEM disciplines.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/12/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Cunningham"
