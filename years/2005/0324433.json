 "awd_abstract_narration": "Floor and Facility Vibration Mitigation Using Passive and Hybrid Nonlinear Energy Sinks, CMS proposal 0344433\r\nPI: L. A. Bergman, UIUC\r\nThe  proposal  explores  the  use  of  a  novel  nonlinear  energy  sink  (NES)  in  a  passive  or  hybrid  isolation  and control system in order to mitigate floor and facility vibrations. Recent investigations have verified that the presence of  an  essentially  nonlinear  oscillator weakly  coupled  to  a  linear  oscillator  can  induce  the  phenomenon  of  energy pumping from the linear to the nonlinear system. More specifically, transient vibrations in the directly excited linear system were shown, under certain conditions, to be transmitted out of the linear system and into the nonlinear one in a one-way, irreversible fashion. This energy pumping phenomenon was found to be robust and quite rapid, making it an excellent candidate for an efficient vibration mitigation system. The work proposed herein would investigate the application  of  this  nonlinear  energy  sink  concept  to  vibration  isolation  and  control  in  high-precision  technology \r\nsituations, studying various strategies for passive and/or hybrid vibration isolation, quantifying its performance, and exploring new approaches for improving energy transfer. New educational prospects in structural control would also be developed as part of this work, exposing more students to a vital new field of structural engineering research and design. Intellectual Merit:    Major thrusts are proposed as follows: To determine the practicality of NES for vibration isolation, a thorough investigation  of the theory of energy pumping and the design and analysis of nonlinear energy sinks is planned. To meet these needs, we will pursue extension of nonlinear energy sink theory, modeling and simulation of nonlinear energy sinks in high-precision technology applications, experimental verification of NES performance, and exploration of mechanisms for enhancing energy pumping. In  addition,  this  project  has  the  overall  goal  of  creating  new  educational  opportunities  in  the  field  of structural  dynamics  and  control.  This  will  be  accomplished  through  the  involvement  of  undergraduate students  in  research  (recruited  through  formal  and  informal  programs  at  each  PI.s  institution)  and  the creation of courses and course  materials for  graduate student classes.  Also, the needs of current professionals  will  be  addressed  via  greater  access  to  educational  material  through  distance  Learning, multimedia presentations, and other electronic communication technologies.  Broader Impacts:    The research and educational activities outlined in this proposal represent an examination of a fundamentally  new  approach  to  the  problem  of  isolating microvibrations  in  precision  Environments.  The  use  of resonance capture in coupled oscillator systems to induce energy pumping provides a simple means for transferring and eliminating unwanted vibrations that does not rely upon large actuator forces or complex control schemes. The proposed work will not only provide verification of the practicality of this approach to structural control, but it will also improve and extend our understanding of the underlying phenomena, permitting advances towards even more efficient systems. The existence of well-established facilities at each PI's institution will permit the construction of laboratory  and  numerical  simulations  in  active  working  environments,  supplying  sufficient  resources  for  the research activities. In addition, all of the institutions participating in this proposal have highly developed recruiting programs  and  instructional  support  centers,  helping  the  PIs  to  realize  their  proposed  educational  functions  in  a straightforward way. The  educational  components  of  the  proposed  work will  promote  teaching,  training,  and  learning  through  the efforts  to  recruit  undergraduate  students  as  researchers  and  to  create  research-based  materials  that  will  be incorporated  into  classroom  lectures.  In  addition,  learning  opportunities  for  graduate  students  will  be  generated through both the traditional research participation as well as the forming of new courses in structural control. The infrastructure  for  research  and  education  will  be  enhanced  through  the  development  of  educational  multimedia materials that will be used to promote continuing education in the field of structural control. This will also provide a means for broad dissemination of pertinent scientific and technological information to practitioners who are facing retrofitting and/or design of high-precision technology facilities.",
