It has been recognized recently that the flow field of karst\r\naquifers includes conduits, fractures, and intergranular porosity of the matrix and that full\r\ncharacterization of flow requires understanding flow in each component, coupling\r\nbetween the components, and how water recharges to the aquifer from the surface. Most\r\nwell-studied karst aquifers have low intergranular porosity where diffuse flow is confined\r\nto a network of fine fractures surrounding conduits. In contrast, this proposed work\r\ncenters on the Floridan aquifer, which retains high (up to ~20%) intergranular matrix\r\nporosity. Previous work on physical hydrogeology (discharge measurements,\r\ntemperature tracing of flow rates, observations of hydraulic head), suggests that water\r\nexchanged between conduits and the matrix of the Floridan aquifer is controlled by\r\nreversals in head gradients between the matrix and conduits as a result of high allogenic\r\ninput into the conduit system. The previous work has not quantified contributions from\r\ndiffuse recharge from the surface, the magnitude of exchange between the conduits and\r\nmatrix, the residence time of water that exchanges, or chemical modifications of the\r\naquifer through dissolution reactions. Consequently, this proposed project will determine\r\ncoupling between aquifer components and water sources by integrating new chemical\r\nmeasurements with previously used physical observational techniques.\r\nThe field area will be the Santa Fe Sink/Rise system in north-central Florida.\r\nObservations to be made will include major element and isotope compositions of water\r\nfrom nested new and existing wells and lysimeters (soil water samplers) for ground water\r\ncharacterization, from the River Sink, Rise, and karst windows for characterization of\r\nconduit water, and from precipitation for characterization of the input sources. The\r\nchemical measurements will provide flow velocities to be compared with head gradients\r\nbetween the conduits and the matrix and saturation states with respect to carbonate and\r\nsilicate minerals. The nested wells and data on chemical composition of precipitation\r\nwill allow characterization of vertical differences in water chemistry to determine\r\nmagnitudes of diffuse recharge from the surface. These data will be compared to other\r\nkarst aquifers with low intergranular porosity using available deterministic models such\r\nas chemograph separation. Comparisons will also be made to results of previous and ongoing\r\nstudies of other regions of the Floridan aquifer. Because of the higher\r\ntransmissivity of the highly porous Floridan aquifer, it is anticipated that the intergranular\r\nporosity component will play a large role in the overall flow field of the aquifer.\r\nBroader Impacts. This work should improve the understanding and\r\nmanagement of karst aquifers that have significant portions of their flow within matrix\r\nporosity. These aquifers commonly represent major water resources, but have previously\r\nbeen managed using conceptual models that consider either flow primarily through\r\nconduits or treat the system as an equivalent porous medium. In particular, these results\r\nwill be directly applicable to management of the Floridan aquifer and results will be\r\ndisseminated to critical water managers through Martin's participation in the Florida\r\nSprings Task Force. Human resources will be impacted through graduate and\r\nundergraduate education, both formally as a resource for currently taught courses and\r\nthrough graduate student theses. One second-year PhD student is currently working on\r\nthis topic as part of his dissertation, and two masters students and several undergraduates\r\nwill participate in the field, laboratory, and analytical work.",
