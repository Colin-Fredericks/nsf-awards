 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Condensed Matter Physics Gordon Conference focuses on issues at the border of hard and soft condensed matter physics. While the fields are traditionally separate, the underlying science of condensed matter respects no such boundaries. In fact, many of the most exciting topics reside at the border between these two disciplines. These include topics from the use of lithographic devices to probe soft and biological systems to the fundamental quantum properties of soft structures like vortices. This conference is needed to get these communities together to allow ideas and techniques to diffuse from one to the other. This will be particularly valuable for students and young researchers, who are rarely exposed to both sides of the condensed matter community. The NSF grant will be used primarily to pay for the registration fees of graduate students and postdocs who would otherwise be unable to attend. The interactive nature of the conference will allow these young researchers to network with the leaders in the fields of both hard and soft condensed matter physics. Particular emphasis will be placed on supporting females and minorities.",
