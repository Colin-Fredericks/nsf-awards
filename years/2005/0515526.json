 "awd_abstract_narration": "WGBH is producing a new PBS television show with accompanying Web and outreach activities for 9- to 12-year-olds, to inspire a generation of budding engineers.  \"Design Squad\" (working title) will be a 13-part television series, which combines the appeal of a game show with the drama of real-world challenges to engender enthusiasm and promote understanding of, and interest in, engineering and technology.  Behind all the fun that this lively show envisions lays a serious educational purpose -- to get kids to think like engineers and understand how to use science and technology to solve real-life problems.  The television programs will be complemented with materials and training for engineers to mount \"Design Squad\" events in public venues and run workshops in schools, afterschool programs and libraries, and an extensive companion web site.  \r\n\r\n\"Design Squad 's\" three intended strategic impacts are to:  (1) address a critical need in engineering education and children's television, (2) increase students' knowledge of engineering and the design process and (3) improve the public image of engineering, especially among girls and minorities.\r\n\r\nThe WGBH production team will be lead by Brigid Sullivan and Kate Taylor.  The Series Content Director is Dr. Daniel Frey of MIT.  Goodman Research Group, Inc. will conduct the evaluation of the project.\r\n",
