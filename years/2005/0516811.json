Understanding mechanisms of resistance enables crop improvement via biotechnology and plant breeding. Defensins, known from many organisms, are natural products known to have antibiotic effects against bacteria, fungi, or insects. During analysis of gene sequences of two plant species related to crops, it was discovered that more than 1% of plant genes encode proteins related to defensins. These defensin-like genes are much more abundant and diverse than previously realized. This project will study the functions of these genes to evaluate their potential to contribute to plants' arsenals of compounds to protect themselves from attack by microbes.  The study will use molecular biological and microbiological techniques to find conditions when the genes are active and to evaluate the antibiotic effects of the proteins.  The project will also use computational evaluation of DNA sequences to study evolutionary changes in gene numbers and function.  This will demonstrate how this type of defense may change over time.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Three Ph.D. students will carry out dissertation research on the project. At least six undergraduates will conduct project-related research.  In addition to conducting laboratory experiments and computational investigations, students will gain experience in research communication and explore training and employment opportunities in molecular biology, bioinformatics and genomics. \r\n\r\n",
