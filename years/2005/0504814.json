 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary   \r\nOregon State University proposes to operate the Research Vessel WECOMA in support of\r\nNational Science Foundation (NSF) funded scientific research at sea. WECOMA'S primary purpose is to support oceanographic and atmospheric research throughout the Northeastern Pacific for a variety of scientists from around the United States and overseas. The funded research is expected to enhance understanding of various oceanic, geophysical/geological and atmospheric processes, contribute to ecological knowledge in the study areas and provide opportunities for graduate students in atmospheric and oceanic science to gain research experience at sea.\r\n\r\nWECOMA, an \"Intermediate\" sized oceanographic research vessel, is well suited to meet the support needs of the research at an economic cost.  In 2005, the ship has a schedule of 236 days, of which 214 will directly support NSF funded research.  The ship is owned by NSF and is operated by OSU. A five year cooperative agreement will be issued and budgets from 2006-2009 will be renegotiated yearly and will depend on the number of days in support of NSF funded research programs.  The ship serves as a platform for the funded research programs.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nWECOMA, as part of Oregon State University's College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences, provides educational and at-sea research opportunities for graduate, and occasionally undergraduate, students. In '04 two \"teachers at sea\" were able to participate in a cruise by an OSU PI. WECOMA has hosted a number of tours for students from Oregon schools. Public open houses are held when the schedule allows, including participation in the Hatfield Marine Science Center's annual \"HMSeaFest.\" A variety of OSU and NOAA researchers associated with OSU's Hatfield Marine Science Center have been featured in articles in Oregon and Washington newspapers as well as coverage on TV and radio news featuring their NSF and NOAA funded work on WECOMA. Our own web site, along with those maintained by PI's, track WECOMA's daily progress and provide insight into the science being done on the vessel.\r\n\r\nIn addition to supporting the R/V WECOMA, OSU's Ship Operations facility in Newport, OR manages the UNOLS/NSF West Coast Van Pool and provides berthing space and logistics support for other research vessels. The van pool currently has a radioisotope van, cold van and general lab van in inventory. \r\n\r\n",

Between 2008 and 2012 WECOMA supported research funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and secondarily by the Navy\u00c6s Office of Naval Research (ONR).  Principal Investigators (PIs) were primarily from OSU and NOAA as well as others from the U of W and WHOI.

The research supported enhanced understanding of various oceanic and atmospheric processes, contributed to ecologic knowledge in the study areas, and provided opportunities for graduate students in atmospheric and oceanic science to gain research experience at sea. \n\n WECOMA also provided opportunities for those not normally involved in oceanographic research to occasionally participate in at-sea operations.
