 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL: This project aims at a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of rare earth elements on phase stability and microstructure of magnesium alloys by integrating modeling with efficient experimental investigation.  This project will: (a) predict thermochemical data of binary and ternary compounds and solution phases through first-principles calculations; (b) create composition libraries of important ternary systems through combinatorial diffusion multiple experiments; (c) develop thermodynamic descriptions of magnesium alloys through innovative modeling approaches; and (d) establish mechanistic models between properties and the corresponding critical microstructural components through industrial collaborations. The intellectual merit of the proposal lies on the integrated approach to technologically important multicomponent magnesium alloys. The research project will move magnesium research in the U.S. to a higher level by building a foundation to answer fundamental questions that can be addressed most efficiently via combined computational and experimental methodology. For example: What are the best combinations of alloying elements considering cost versus performance? What are the possible composition and temperature variations for robust processing of magnesium alloys? What are the mechanisms for enhanced grain refinement in magnesium alloys?  NONTECHNICAL: This grant supports research on magnesium alloys that could impact the automotive and aerospace industry. The research will have a major impact on materials development with improved predictability of materials properties, reduced consumption of energy and raw materials, and a shorter materials development lead-time. The program is timely in response to an industry call for more fundamental research on magnesium alloys. It is especially desirable in the U.S., as research activities on magnesium alloys appear limited in comparison with activity in other countries. The broader impacts of the research include the training of graduate and undergraduate students to be future professionals mastering both innovative computational and efficient experimental approaches and participating in meetings and activities of professional societies to improve their communication skills.",
