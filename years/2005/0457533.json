 "awd_abstract_narration": "This individual investigator award supports an experimental program to investigate disorder in diverse systems at low temperatures. The two systems that will be studied are (i) superfluid 3He in aerogel, where the aerogel introduces correlated disorder and (ii) silica glass at low temperatures where the sound velocity and dissipation provide sensitive probes for the validity of the \"standard tunneling model\" of disorder in glasses. The project will examine the phase diagram of superfluid 3He for hysteresis in the occurrence of the \"A\" and \"B\" phases, for pinning, and for anisotropy in a variety of magnetic fields using ultrasensitive torsion pendulum devices. 4He will also be used to further reduce the volume accessible to the 3He (eventually into isolated \"bubble-like\" regions, while preserving superfluidity. The experiments on silica glass will use high Q resonators to focus on the very low temperature behavior (below 5mK) where there may be evidence of interactions between tunneling sites, as well as probe the non-linear behavior of these systems. These demanding experiments, which involve cutting edge instrumentation and development of new techniques, provide a challenging environment where graduate and undergraduate students acquire skills (the ability to innovate, initiate, design and carry out) as well as become familiar with analytic and display tools to prepare them for careers in the nation's scientific and technological infrastructure. The research program will also incorporate an undergraduate (year-round) as well as involve a high-school teacher in the research program during the summer. \r\n%%%%%\r\n\r\n3He (unlike all other elements) is in an inherently quantum-mechanical system that does not solidify (unless it is highly compressed) even down to absolute zero. It is one of the purest materials that can be prepared by any means, since at these temperatures, impurities simply freeze out during the procedures required to obtain the liquid state. Eventually 3He attains a highly ordered state - superfluidity, which is different from that attained in most superconductors and its sister isotope 4He. The magnetism of the superfluid atoms means that the atoms pair up together and undergo orbital motion exhibiting different phases or \"flavors\". All of this behavior is affected by introducing aerogel, a highly dilute glass (also termed solidified smoke) whose structure is so small that it penetrates into the superfluid pairs, altering the occurrence (and perhaps even the character) of the \"flavors\" of superfluid that appear. The research will look for changes under a variety of conditions, including when the helium is confined to small \"bubbles\". A second area probes our understanding of the properties of a standard glass at low temperatures, where one imagines that order is imposed by the absence of thermal excitations. However, the glass exhibits quantum characteristics, where atoms tunnel from one configuration to another, affecting the sound propagation qualities. By carrying out precise measurements on these systems the research will add to our understanding of the role of disorder under less extreme conditions. Besides adding to the understanding of quantum systems, this research provides a demanding experimental environment that educates and trains graduate and undergraduate students (and will also create a positive impact by involving a science teacher into the summer research program) for successful careers in the nation's scientific and technological infrastructure. \r\n",
