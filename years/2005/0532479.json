 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brief Project Summary: The proposal was submitted to the ship operations program for funding to support 136 research days in 2005 aboard the Thompson in support of NSF funded research programs.  The total number of days at sea in 2005 is 262 days.  The programs to be supported for NSF include Climate History Studies (Nicholson, 0350573), Hydrothermal vent systems (Kelley, 0426109) and Magma studies by Haymon, 0324668.  These programs are all funded by the Marine Geology and Geophysics Program and require instrumentation that is on the Thompson.  In addition, Ken Smith (0242472) is funded by Biological Oceanography to study phytoplankton at abyssal depths. The Thompson appears to be well suited to support these programs in terms of equipment and experience with ROV ops.  This is year one of a five year cooperative agreement.  The amount of the award in out-years on this agreement will be negotiated yearly, and is dependent on the number of days at sea in support of NSF funded research programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe Marine Operations Department of the School of Oceanography of the University of Washington takes pride in providing essential marine science research and educational facilities to NSF-funded investigators. The University of Washington remains committed to managing these facilities in a safe, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible manner. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe mission of the Thompson also includes the provision of educational opportunities-both to students of the marine sciences, and, through educational outreach programs such as REVEL, \"Teacher at Sea,\" to K through 12th grade students, nationwide. Periodically, The University holds a two day open house and outreach event to provide a learning experience for 3rd grade through high school senior students including tours through the ship facilities and hands-on demonstrations of marine science research guided by faculty, students and ships' crewmembers. In March of 2005, we are inviting the winning team from the CORE-sponsored National Ocean Sciences Bowl (NOSB) to bring their students and coaches along on one of state-funded marine science education cruises in Puget Sound. The University of Washington, with the support of the National Science Foundation and with coordination by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, remains dedicated to, and focused upon, furthering mankind's understanding of the world ocean, the living and non-living resources therein, and their interactions with the approximately fifty percent of our citizens who live within fifty miles of the shoreline. \r\n",

The seagoing academic program onboard the Thompson, in direct support to the UW School of Oceanography, enables students to be initiated into the challenging world of ship-based sampling and data collection, further matures their understanding of the oceanographic sciences, and culminates their studies though their senior science project design and execution during a major scientific cruise onboard the Thompson.  This comprehensive sea-going program, complimented by the rigorous program of classes and projects, provides a robust foundation for UW Oceanography students to develop into world-class oceanographers.\n\n \n\nThroughout this grant period R/V Thomas G Thompson has undergone numerous inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard and the American Bureau of Shipping to ensure the vessel, crew, and ship management meet all regulatory requirements and continue to operate in safest manner possible while incorporating maritime industry best practices.  Additionally, the U.S. Navy and the National Science Foundation have conducted comprehensive inspections to ensure proper maintenance is conducted, established oceanographic research safety practices are followed, and the ship is upgraded regularly to meet the emerging needs of the scientific community. R/V Thompson has been drydocked regularly to enable proper maintenance to take place and to facilitate these various inspections.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/06/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William S Wilcock"
