Melrose, Victor Guillemin\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to support U.S. participants in a program in\r\npartial differential equations to be held in summer 2006, in\r\nCambridge, England at the Newton Institute. The focus of the\r\nprogram is spectral theory: in particular, lowest eigenvalue\r\nestimates, Weyl asymptotics, trace formulae, scattering phenomena\r\nand properties of periodic Schroedinger operators. These are all\r\nvery active areas of research. Moreover, there are celebrated\r\nproblems in these areas which have proved intractible for decades\r\n(such as the \"hot spot\" conjecture of Rauch or the spectral gap\r\nconjecture of Bethe-Sommerfeld) which seem, in light of recent\r\ndevelopments, be on the verge of being settled, and for which the\r\nunderlying phenomena have recently become much better\r\nunderstood. Hence this program is occurring at a very exciting\r\ntime for researchers in these areas, and we should have a lot to\r\nlearn from each other next summer.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of an object is the set of its natural frequencies\r\nof vibration. These include the spectral lines in the light\r\nemitted (or absorbed) by molecules. In many situations the\r\nfrequencies arise as the set of values of a parameter for which a\r\npartial differential equation has a non-trivial solution. The\r\nmost important mathematical questions concern the dependence of\r\nthese frequencies on the geometric attributes of the object and\r\nthe degree to which information about the object can be recovered\r\nfrom the frequencies. Several of the world's leading analysts\r\nwill participate in this program, and it is important opportunity\r\nfor younger researchers, to gain direct access to the general\r\nsubject. The future prospects of research in this branch of\r\nanalysis, which is vitally important for applications to physics,\r\nchemistry and the other sciences, depend very much on the influx\r\nof persons in their twenties and thirties, and summer programs of\r\nthis type provide the opportunity to learn first hand about\r\ndevelopments that are still on the drawing boards, not accessible\r\nin books and journals. More information on the program is\r\navailable at\r\nhttp://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/programmes/STP/index.html.\r\n",
