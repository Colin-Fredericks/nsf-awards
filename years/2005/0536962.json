 "awd_abstract_narration": "he PI intends to undertake a combinatorial study of structures\r\narising from affine algebras with applications to representation\r\ntheory, mathematical physics and q-series.\r\nThe primary combinatorial objects are crystal graphs on the one\r\nhand and rigged configurations on the other hand. Crystal bases\r\nprovide a combinatorial description of the deep theory of crystal\r\nbases of modules over quantized universal enveloping algebras\r\ndeveloped by Kashiwara and Lusztig: As the quantum parameter\r\nq tends to zero, these bases are described precisely by the\r\ncrystal graphs encoding nearly all the essential algebraic data.\r\nRigged configurations on the other hand encode the particle\r\nstructure of the underlying physical model and lead to fermionic\r\nformulas. It is proposed to study the crystal structure\r\non rigged configurations and to tackle the long-standing problem\r\nof a combinatorial expression for the fusion coefficients.\r\nThese studies will have applications to q-series, in particular\r\nthe Bailey lemma, the X=M conjecture, and the theory of symmetric\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of solving certain models in statistical\r\nmechanics, namely via the corner-transfer-matrix method and\r\nthe Bethe Ansatz. Even though the two methods lead to very\r\ndifferent looking answers, they describe the same solutions.\r\n From the mathematical perspective this suggest that there exists\r\na one-to-one map between the two indexing sets that describe the\r\nsolution. The elements in the index set corresponding to the\r\ncorner-transfer-matrix method are called crystal bases. The elements\r\nin the index set corresponding to the Bethe Ansatz are called\r\nrigged configurations. The PI proposes to study the map\r\nbetween the two indexing sets, its properties and generalizations\r\nin detail. This will have applications in many diverse areas\r\nof mathematics and physics, such as representation theory,\r\ncombinatorics, and statistical mechanics.\r\n",
