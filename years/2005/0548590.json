 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nHongJie Dai\r\n\r\nWe propose a focused, bi-lateral US-Japan Workshop on September 12 and 13, 2005 at Stanford University with leading researchers and engineers in the targeted area of \"Carbon Nanotubes\".  The workshop will explore the opportunities, barriers and challenges to these novel nanomaterilas.  The possibilities for international collaboration between the two countries with major investment can be envisaged as a result of the workshop.  In this workshop, we will focus on discussing the progress and future challenges of carbon nanotube research.  We will focus on using nanotubes for applications in nanoelectronics.  Single-walled carbon nanotubes will be the main material in this workshop.  The following specific topics will be covered by the workshop: (1) We will have several talks covering nanotube synthesis and understanding of the synthesis.  Device work is hinged upon synthesis progress. (2) Carbon nanotube electronics. This is the focus of the workshop.  Recent progress in pushing the limit of SWNT field effect transistors will be presented by several groups.  High frequency measurements of nanotube electronics will also be covered.  (3) Novel properties and various potential applications.  Besides the electronics area, we will also have discussions about how various unique properties of nanotubes  that can be utilized for future applications.  These include thermal properties, optical properties and optoelectronic properties and chemical properties.  The applications to be discussed will range from sensors to biological devices and agents.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact resulting from the workshop: In addition to the US and Japan representatives making the presentations, observers from NSF, Stanford,\r\nsilicon valley companies will attend the Workshop.  The program will include tours to the NSF supported Stanford Nanofabrication Facility and laboratories of various Stanford research groups.  The results of the Workshop will be presented in a report to NSF and made available for wide distribution, including presentation slides.  The possibilities for international collaboration between the two countries with major investment can be envisaged as a result of the workshop.\r\n\r\n",
