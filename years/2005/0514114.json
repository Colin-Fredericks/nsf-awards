 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is held annually at sites alternating between North America and abroad. The 2005 ISIT will be held at the Adelaide Convention Centre in Adelaide, Australia from September 4th to the 9th. ISIT has a strong tradition of participation by junior researchers that has helped it maintain its reputation as a leading forum for new ideas. This proposal requests support for the travel expenses of junior participants from the U.S., such as graduate students, research associates, and new assistant professors. These participants would be individuals whose papers have been selected for presentation at the symposium, but who lack funds and would not be able to attend without travel support. It is proposed that the co-chairs of the symposium, Alex Grant and Rodney Kennedy, make the awards. The total amount requested is $30,000, based on 30 awards averaging $1000 each.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
