 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is devoted to the study of three inverse quadratic\r\neigenproblems with their pertinence to physical and engineering\r\napplications. The aim is to develop theoretic understanding and\r\nderive numerical algorithms for the quadratic model reconstruction\r\nso that the inexactness and uncertainty inherent in the model due\r\nto the limitation of current technologies are reduced while certain\r\nspecific mathematical conditions are satisfied. The most difficult\r\ntask in the quadratic model reconstruction is to satisfy the associated\r\nconstraints which could be inherited intrinsically from the physical\r\nfeasibility of a certain mechanical structure or could be driven\r\nextrinsically by the desirable property of a certain design parameter.\r\nThe greatest challenge, which is also an imperative requirement in\r\npractice, is that the reconstruction must be carried out using only\r\npartial eigeninformation which are available by the state-of-the-art\r\ncomputational techniques. The inverse problem of constrained model\r\nreconstruction is essential for the understanding and management of\r\ncomplex systems, yet many questions on the solvability, sensitivity,\r\nand computation remain unanswered.  The investigators have made\r\nsignificant contributions to the quadratic model construction problems\r\nindividually and now intend to extend their investigation and join\r\nexpertise to these challenging inverse problems. This proposed work\r\ntherefore should be of compelling independent interest within both\r\nthe engineering and mathematical sciences communities.\r\n\r\nIn mathematical modelling, techniques of inverse problems that validate,\r\ndetermine, or estimate the parameters of the system according to its\r\nobserved or expected behavior are critically important. This research\r\nconcentrates on the inverse model reconstruction problems with their\r\npertinence to physical and engineering applications. These problems have\r\nbeen strongly motivitated  by scietific and industrial applications,\r\nincluding structural mechanics such as vibration control and stability\r\nanalysis of bridges, buildings and highways, vibro-acoustics such as\r\npredictive coding of sound, biomedical signal and image processing,\r\ntime series forecasting, information technology, and others. Thus this\r\nproject will impact a wide variety of industries utilizing these\r\napplications, including aerospace, automobile, manufacturing and\r\nbiomedical engineering. The greatest challenge facing these industries\r\nis to manufacture increasingly improved products with limited engineering\r\nand computing resources. A great deal of money and efforts have been spent\r\nin these industries to satisactorily perform the model updating task.\r\nHowever, the lack of proper theory and computational tools often force\r\nthese industries to solve their problems in an ad hoc fashion. An improved\r\nanalytical model that can be used with confidence for future designs is\r\nan essential tool in achieving this obejective. The propsed research has\r\nnot only strong mathematical foundation but also significant matematical\r\nmodelling and experimental aspects using idustrial data which should be\r\ninstantly welcome by the industries. Furthermore, the students working\r\non this project for four years will receive a valuable interdisciplnary\r\ntraining blending mathematics and scietific computing with various areas\r\nof engineering and applied sciences.  Such expertise is rare to find,\r\nbut there is an increasing demand both inacademia and industries.\r\n\r\n",
