 "awd_abstract_narration": "A multidisciplinary group of faculty at Auburn University is collaborating to develop new cross-disciplinary curricula in biological engineering. Groups of faculty from biosystems engineering, chemical engineering, and biological sciences will join with experts in teaching and learning and other stakeholders to develop the curricula and innovative teaching techniques. The curriculum development activities incorporate innovative pedagogical techniques aimed at increasing the size and diversity of student participation in these new programs and increasing the students' commitment to social responsibility.\r\n\r\nSpecial emphasis is placed on developing two cross-disciplinary, project-based, spiral curricula in biological engineering. The two respective curricula will have many common elements but will be offered under existing degree programs in Biosystems Engineering and Chemical Engineering. The cross-disciplinary curricula offer many unique opportunities to employ multidisciplinary, team activities for the students. The curricula will incorporate methods in courses to embrace differentiated learning styles of students and will incorporate studio experiences to maintain high levels of student interest and retention. These new teaching and learning techniques will be advanced for use in other engineering and science curricula. Service learning programs, named Project Design Studios will also be developed to build linkages with economically-depressed regions and underrepresented groups. These programs will build a greater sense of societal responsibility among the new biological engineering graduates and serve as models for other institutions.\r\n",
