 "awd_abstract_narration": "0532610\r\nHui\r\n\r\nOver the last decade, III-nitride materials have occupied the central stage in the\r\nsemiconductor research with a predominant focus on applications as photonic devices\r\noperating in the visible and UV regions. The PI systematically investigated the properties of IIInitrides operating in the near infrared wavelength region, including refractive indices, optical\r\nlosses, birefringence and temperature sensitivities. He has developed various photonic\r\ndevices based on AlGaN/GaN planar lightwave circuits, such as waveguide couplers and\r\narray waveguide gratings (AWG) operating in 1550nm wavelength.\r\n\r\nSince III-nitrides are semiconductor materials, carrier injection can be used to modulate the\r\nrefractive index and to change the phase delay of the waveguide. Adding an electrode on\r\neach interference arm of an AWG made by AlGaN/GaN p-i-n heterojunction, for example,\r\ncould make a wavelength demultiplexer switchable at high speed. Obviously, carrier-induced\r\nindex change is a key step toward a real functional device for high-speed all-optical packet\r\nswitch. He proposes to design, develop and optimize AlGaN/GaN-based p-i-n heterojunction\r\nstructure in planar lightwave circuits to realize carrier injection and index tuning. The\r\ntheoretical work will be focused on the p-i-n heterojunction structural design and the\r\nefficiency of carrier-induced index change, including bandfilling, bandgap-shrinkage and\r\nfree-carrier absorption. The experimental work will concentrate on the fabrication,\r\ncharacterization and optimization of the AlGaN/GaN-based p-i-n heterojunction waveguide\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the introduction of a new material group for\r\napplications in optical communications. Fast tuning of refractive index by carrier injection is\r\nthe key to realize high-speed optical switch.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this proposal is two-fold. From the application point of view, the\r\nresult of this research will enable a wide array of applications, which will have enormous\r\nimpact in optical communications. From the material science point of view, a much greater\r\nand fundamental understanding will be gained for III-nitride semiconductors in terms of their\r\noptical and physical properties.\r\n\r\nThe unique properties of III-nitrides make them attractive for guiding and switch of light in\r\nthe infrared wavelength region for optical communications, which may allow the creation of\r\nphotonic devices with unprecedented properties and functionalities.\r\n\r\n",
