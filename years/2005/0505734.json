 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is devoted to studying deterministic and random\r\ncellular automata models of growth processes, with the emphasis\r\non several new directions. The first field of study are\r\nnonmonotone growth models; the investigator aims to study\r\ntheir growth shapes and space-covering properties by extending\r\nrenewal, rescaling and perturbation techniques from probability,\r\nas well as various geometric methods. Also being developed are\r\nnew analytic and computational approaches to higher dimensional\r\nand long range models, and to connections with differential\r\nand integral equations. An important example of a high-dimensional\r\nspace is the hypercube, where the investigator uses\r\ncombinatorial and probabilistic methods to understand the\r\neffect of uncorrelated and correlated random environments\r\non basic growth processes.\r\n\r\nIn a broad scientific context, the aim of this project is\r\nto understand principles by which various physical systems\r\npropagate disturbances. Among instances of such growth\r\ndynamics are growth of snowflakes and other crystals, spread\r\nof epidemics, propagation of waves, competition between species,\r\nand genetic diversification. The investigator's research sheds\r\nlight on how microscopic properties of a growth process influence\r\nits space-covering ability, on the effect of perturbations in\r\nthe environment and in the dynamics, and on the role of dimension\r\nand range of interaction. For example, simple mathematical metaphors\r\nfor neutral mutations, incompatibilities and harshness of the\r\nenvironment contribute to understanding the onset of genetic\r\ndiversity. The project has an essential computational component\r\nand is developing a variety of efficient computer algorithms\r\nfor simulation and visualization of complex processes. Finally,\r\nample opportunities for undergraduate involvement in studying\r\ncomplex and random dynamics help to popularize mathematics and\r\nits applications.\r\n",
