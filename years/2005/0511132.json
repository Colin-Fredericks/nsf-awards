These\r\nprojects are relevant to students in the program and bear on their career interests. The role science\r\nplays in public policy is a main focus of the new curriculum that is meant to help\r\nstudents see the relationship between chemistry and societal needs.\r\n\r\nThe redesigned lecture and laboratory is increasing students' exposure to recent\r\nadvances in instrumental techniques, developing research skills, improving their oral\r\nand writing skills, and allowing them to actively explore the role of the analytical chemist\r\nin shaping public policy. The investigators  are updating chromatographic equipment in the\r\nInstrumental Analysis Laboratory including gas, liquid and ion chromatography.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are (1) the nurturing and development of a cadre of minority chemists to\r\nbecome proficient at working in teams, (2) providing an opportunity for students to\r\nformulate and carry out independent and multidisciplinary research projects and to\r\npresent their findings and (3) broadening the horizons of minority students entering the\r\nfield of chemistry so that they are making connections with human needs outside of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n",
