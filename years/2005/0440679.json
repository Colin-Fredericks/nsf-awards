 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the science management office (SMO) for a series of collaborative science proposals that are part of the U.S. contribution to the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (US ITASE). It supports the science administration and the coordination of logistics needed in order to accomplish the research.  The SMO will work with the Antarctic support contractor to coordinate field operations for the traverse platform so that US ITASE can undertake a series of scientific traverses in the region from Taylor Dome, in Northern Victoria Land to South Pole (NVL-SP) inclusive of interior portions of the East Antarctic plateau such as Dome A. US ITASE is the terrestrial equivalent of a polar research vessel. It offers the ground-based opportunities of traditional style over-snow travel coupled with the modern technology of GPS navigation, crevasse detecting radar, satellite communications, and multi-disciplinary research. By operating as a ground-based transport system US ITASE offers scientists the opportunity to experience the dynamic environment they are studying. US ITASE also provides a stimulating interactive venue for research similar to that afforded by oceanographic research vessels and large polar field camps, without the cost of the former or the lack of mobility of the latter. More importantly the combination of disciplines represented by US ITASE provides a unique, logistically efficient, multi-dimensional view of the atmosphere, the ice sheet and their histories.  Data collected by US ITASE and its international partners is available to a broad scientific community and will contribute to many of the goals of the upcoming International Polar Year (IPY). US ITASE has an extensive program of public outreach and provides significant opportunities for many students to experience multidisciplinary Antarctic research.",
