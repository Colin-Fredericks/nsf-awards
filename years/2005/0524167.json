 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mammals, birds and fish protect themselves from disease using a variety of immune defenses.  Among these are special white blood cells called Natural Killer (NK) cells that recognize the presence of infection early on.  NK cells are able to immediately attack infected cells and to call for help from other cells in the immune system.  The work outlined in this project will advance understanding of natural killer (NK) cells in birds (represented by chicken).  NK cells recognize other cells (healthy and infected) using specific molecules (receptors) displayed on their surfaces.  Preliminary work suggests that the surface receptors preferred by chicken NK cells are somewhat different from those used in mammals and fish.  To define the nature of these NK cell receptors surface proteins will be isolated from chicken NK cells and analyzed using an essentially unbiased high throughput system to identify receptor proteins.  Corresponding genes will be cloned.  Receptors will be expressed and their ligands will be identified.  Broader Impacts: The findings will be useful in comparing the immune responses generated by birds to that of mammals, and it may be useful in developing future strategies to combat disease, particularly those caused by viruses shared between man and birds. Moreover, this project will support the training and education of several high school, undergraduate, and graduate students who will learn a variety of cell and molecular biology techniques.",
