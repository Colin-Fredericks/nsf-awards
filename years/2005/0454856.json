 "awd_abstract_narration": "The timing of the evolutionary radiation of living birds, and their genealogical relationships have long been subjects of scientific controversy.  The incorporation of well-preserved, early fossils of anatomically modern birds into genealogical hypotheses of their living relatives provides great potential for substantially improving our understanding of these critical issues. This 3-year project plans to study a series of exceptionally well-preserved, 55-million-year-old fossil birds from northern Denmark. These fossils include complete specimens that are the best-preserved representatives of the primitive radiation of modern birds.  The study of these ancient fossils will involve anatomical descriptions and analyses of their evolutionary relationships, which will be published in international journals. \r\nThis project will result in a comprehensive study of an important early phase of the evolutionary history of modern birds. This project will provide training for a junior female postdoctoral researcher of Hispanic background and an important supplement to the professional development of a Danish PhD student.  Furthermore, by bringing together an international team of researchers (US, Ireland and Denmark), this project will strengthen the ties between American and European institutions conducting research on evolutionary biology and paleontology of birds.  \r\n",
