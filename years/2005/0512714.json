Hopkins\r\n\r\nThe Talbot program is a series of yearly workshop retreats\r\nbringing together graduate students, recent PhDs, and faculty\r\nmentors for an intense exploration of a topic of active\r\nmathematical research. The Talbot 2004 workshop was devoted to\r\nthe Stolz-Teichner model of elliptic cohomology and was mentored\r\nby Stephan Stolz. The Talbot 2005 workshop will focus on the\r\ngeometric Langlands program and be mentored by David Ben-Zvi. The\r\ngeometric Langlands program is one of the most fertile areas of\r\nmathematics, integrating representation theory, topology, and\r\nalgebraic geometry. The original conjectures of Langlands tie\r\ninfinite-dimensional representation theory to the structure of\r\nGalois groups, with profound applications to number theory. From\r\nthe geometric perspective deriving from the renowned theorem of\r\nBorel-Weil-Bott, one would like to classify such representations\r\nby equivariant sheaves on a parametrizing space. Drinfeld and\r\nLaumon, among others, adapted Langlands' original ideas for\r\nfunction fields to formulate a far reaching geometric\r\ngeneralization, now called the geometric Langlands program. Work\r\nin this area over the past twenty years has changed the face of\r\nmodern representation theory. Recent advances, such as new\r\ngeometric generalizations of the classical Satake isomorphism,\r\nmake this an ideal time to gather young mathematicians to study\r\nthese results, the techniques used to derive them, and newly\r\nexposed avenues for future research.\r\n\r\nThe Talbot workshops seek to introduce aspiring mathematicians to\r\nactive areas of mathematical research, foster community and\r\ncollaboration across subdisciplinary and institutional lines, and\r\nform pedagogical and research ties between established\r\nmathematicians and young researchers. The topic for Talbot 2004\r\nconcerns a central problem in mathematics deeply related to\r\nneighboring areas of science. For instance, the crystallographic\r\nstudy of proteins, quantum states of particles, and the structure\r\nof integer solutions to polynomial equations are all central to\r\nchemistry, physics, and cryptography/number theory; their deeper\r\nstudy requires probing the algebraic structures that govern\r\naspects of their nature. Representation theory is precisely the\r\nfield of mathematics devoted to this study.  Further, the\r\ngeometric Langlands program offers a unifying vision for the\r\nspecific algebraic structures suited to each of these areas,\r\nwhich are called reflection groups, Lie groups, and Galois\r\ngroups. This Talbot workshop will bring together graduate\r\nstudents with different specialties and from many universities to\r\nspend a week focused on this important subject. The participants\r\nand their mentor, David Ben-Zvi, will share a residence as well\r\nas lectures, discussions, and meals. This informal atmosphere,\r\nmixing fellowship and intellectual interest, will promote a\r\nconcentrated study of the material and lay the foundation for\r\nfuture collaboration and research.\r\n",
