This campus-wide facility will allow the integration of activities across many laboratories and enable anywhere, anytime participation by both students and faculty. SmartCampus will aid the analysis and understanding of the underlying technical and social issues and their interactions, taking into account rising privacy concerns. The latter will be addressed from two perspectives: 1) improving system security and trust with the development of ConexGuard, a novel SmartCampus security-on-demand framework for its heterogeneous environment, and 2) creating privacy-sensitive applications that exploit relevant contextual factors - properties of people and places, and relationships between them - thus addressing issues distinct to P3-Systems. The team includes social scientists, computer scientists and electrical engineers in an interdisciplinary effort addressing issues of emerging interest - particularly privacy in community systems. Broader impacts include education and field testing in Newark New jersey.\r\n",
