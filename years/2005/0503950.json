 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the averaging principle and effects related\r\nto large deviations in dynamical systems. He considers perturbations of\r\nsystems with conservation laws, in particular, of Hamiltonian systems.\r\nIf an integral of motion has more than one well, the evolution of the\r\nslow variables occur on a graph or, in the case of several first\r\nintegrals, on an open book, and even pure deterministic perturbations,\r\nin general, lead to stochasticity of the limiting slow motion. In this\r\ncase the investigator studies the limiting stochastic process, in\r\nparticular, he introduces a relative entropy and studies large deviations.\r\nThis allows to describe the motion of an incompressible 3D-fluid which is\r\nclose to a planar motion and reaction-diffusion-convection in such a\r\nfluid. The investigators studies also stochastic resonance and\r\nmetastability as manifestation of large deviations.\r\n\r\n   Long-time effects caused by relatively small deterministic and\r\nstochastic perturbations of a system are considered in this proposal.\r\nThe investigator considers problems, where various processes in the system\r\nhave different rates (fast and slow processes). This allows certain\r\nsimplification and efficient description of the long-time behavior.\r\nAnother approach considered by the investigator concerns systems, where\r\nlong time behavior is defined by small probability deviations from their\r\ntypical behavior. These deviations, which have very small probability on\r\neach fixed time interval, occur sooner or later and define long time\r\nevolution of the system. Problems of this type arise in many technical,\r\nphysical, and biological systems as well as in sociological models.",
