 "awd_abstract_narration": "1. Intellectual Impact\r\nResearch is proposed on two Areas of Interest in NSF Solicitation 05-501: Development of a broad\r\nand general collection of quantum algorithms; Quantum simulation of quantum systems. Specific\r\ntopics:\r\nHidden subgroup problems: The status of the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem (HSP)\r\nis one of the most fundamental open problems in quantum algorithms. In particular, the graph\r\nautomorphism problem may be formulated as a hidden subgroup problem over the symmetric\r\ngroup S n . The abelian case can be effectively computed with a quantum computer by repetition\r\nof coset state preparation and Fourier sampling. The natural generalization of this method to\r\nnonabelian groups is commonly referred to as the standard method for the nonabelian HSP. The\r\nperformance of this algorithm depends upon properties of the irreducible complex representations\r\nof the group. However in most cases they do not yet yield useful algorithms. Research is proposed\r\non improving these methods as well as determining in which cases they are bound for failure and\r\nother methods are necessitated.\r\nAlgorithmic cooling: Algorithmic cooling is an inescapable component of quantum algorithms:\r\nfor example, we can even view fault-tolerant computing as moving heat (random errors) out of the\r\ncomputation registers. These issues are particularly pressing in the context of liquid-state NMR\r\nquantum computing as well as ion trap quantum computing, and we have studied them (especially\r\nin the NMR context) in the past, obtaining results that are nearly best-possible for closed-system\r\ncooling. These results reveal, however, that closed-system cooling cannot be powerful enough to\r\nturn warm systems into large-scale quantum computers. We are therefore turning to the study\r\nof open-system algorithmic cooling. This requires new algorithmic techniques. Also, since open\r\nsystems are more sensitive to decoherence than closed systems, more careful modeling of these\r\neffects will be required.\r\nFault-tolerant Quantum Comptutation: Decoherence is the major obstacle to the experimen-\r\ntal realization of quantum computers. Over the last year there have been two significant break-\r\nthroughs in the ability to carry out fault-tolerant quantum computation in the presence of deco-\r\nherence. The main idea in both cases is the use of uniquely quantum features to limit the exposure\r\nof data to decoherence. We plan to explore these ideas further to a) improve the overhead in the\r\nnumber of ancillas discarded and therefore the total number of qubits required b) improve the\r\nthreshold and decrease computational overhead for more realistic error-models\r\n2. Broader Impact\r\nSocietal impact: Even if quantum computers are a distant reality, encryption of data today so that\r\nit cannot be decrypted at a future time, depends upon the development of cryptosystems resilient\r\nto attacks by quantum computers. This in turn demands an understanding of what problems are\r\nand are not tractable on quantum computers, a core topic of the proposed research.\r\nEducational impact: Ideas from quantum computation and quantum information can poten-\r\ntially have a major impact on how basic quantum mechanics is taught (quite apart from teaching\r\nquantum computation, which is also part of our efforts). We propose to create course material to\r\nmake this happen.",
