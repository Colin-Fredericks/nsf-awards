Steponaitis, John Pleasants will analyze data gathered during his archaeological study of the Initial Period site of Los Chinos (1800 - 900 B.C.).  This site is located in the Moche Valley on the Peruvian north coast, and is notable for its well preserved monumental architecture, which includes a multi-level stone mound approximately 12 meters high. Of the four Initial Period sites containing monumental architecture in the Moche Valley, Los Chinos and two others have received only cursory attention. Pleasants research focuses on understanding the chronology, function, and nature of socio-political complexity (social inequality and political centralization) at Los Chinos. The methodology includes: (1) Surface collection of artifacts; (2) topographic survey, analysis of spatial data, and mapping; (3) excavation of selected architectural features; and (4) analysis of recovered artifacts.  A detailed chronology for Los Chinos will clarify whether it existed contemporarily with the other Initial Period sites. This is important for understanding the regional political organization. Chronology will be established through analysis of ceramics and radiocarbon datable material recovered from room excavations on the top three levels of the main mound and the main plaza; examination of architectural stratigraphy; and comparison of architectural characteristics to other sites with known chronologies. The main mound is the key to understanding site function, and excavations will focus on the top three levels which contain a multi-room summit structure and two small plazas each flanked by multiple rooms and a stone platform. Evidence of function will come from excavations of selected rooms, stairways, and the summit structure facade. Understanding the function of this site will increase current knowledge about its local and regional role in the Moche Valley.\r\n\r\nDuring the Initial Period in the Moche Valley dramatic cultural changes occurred in subsistence strategies, demography, population size, and socio-political complexity. Understanding the nature and evolution of socio-political complexity at Los Chinos will contribute greatly to the knowledge about the development of civilization in this region during this Period.  Pleasants will use excavation and topographic survey and mapping to gather evidence of socio-political complexity such as manipulation of visibility; physical access patterns; the form of rituals; access to ritual; the control of labor, and the techniques of any rebuilding.  \r\n\r\nBeyond these intellectual merits, this research can be used to promote teaching, training, and learning through incorporation into courses such as Andean Archaeology and State Formation. Also, it will lay the foundation for future research at this site, and can provide valuable training in the above archaeological methods and technology for the author as well as other graduate and undergraduate students.  \r\n Public visibility of archaeological data, field notes, and results of this research will be shared in the form of web sites, presentations at technical conferences, and published works.  Finally, the research at the Los Chinos site should promote a positive working relationship between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Instituto Nacional de Cultura in Lima and Trujillo, the Peruvian archaeological community, and the local community near the Los Chinos site. The resulting knowledge about the Initial Period in the Moche Valley could be incorporated into the teaching curriculums of schools and universities in Peru and the U.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
