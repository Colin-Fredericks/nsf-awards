 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of the proposed project is to develop decision and control theory, state estimation\r\nalgorithms, and mathematical tools for networked sensors in a system-level application area of\r\nstructural health monitoring (SHM). We will develop distributed computing algorithms for diagnostic\r\nand prognostic interpretation of the spatio-temporal data. The initial focus is on aerospace\r\napplications but the research results will be suffciently general to be used in many other areas. The\r\nalgorithms will use embedded optimization for accurate estimation of the evolving spatio-temporal\r\npattern of the damage. The computing will be scalable to very large sensor arrays.\r\nThe proposed approach is to develop an innovative engineering application in aerospace\r\nSHM area through industrial collaboration and then generalizing the results. Existing SHM work\r\nis aimed at developing sensors, data interrogation methods, and low-level signal processing to\r\nobtain a single damage estimate array. This project will develop system-level statistical algorithms\r\nfor estimation of structural health state, monitoring, and decision support based on series of spatial\r\ndata arrays obtained from distributed networked sensors. The algorithms will allow for scalable\r\nand reconfigurable distributed parallel computing implementation.\r\nIntellectual merit. We propose to develop algorithms for spatio-temporal estimation of structural\r\ndamage that can be scaled to very large spatial data arrays through networked computing.\r\nThe engineering need and potential for practical impact come from collaboration with Honeywell.\r\nThe place of the problem formulation with respect to existing work is characterized by the\r\nfollowing highlights: (i) We concentrate on mathematical processing of the existing sensor data,\r\nrather than developing new sensing systems; (ii) We focus on spatio-temporal processing of the\r\ndata, while the existing SHM literature is focused on obtaining a single spatial pattern of the\r\ndamage. Modeling and trending the temporal evolution of the damage will enable prognostics;\r\n(iii) We pursue system scalability through constrained optimization-based estimation algorithms\r\nimplemented through distributed computing. Existing distributed algorithms are for optimizing\r\na small number of parameters. We will estimate large spatio-temporal arrays; (iv) The decision\r\nsystem design will include uncertainty, missing data, self-healing capability etc, as opposed to\r\nconsidering an idealized and simplified mathematical problem.\r\nThe main steps and challenges in the proposed work include: 1. Formulating models of spatiotemporal\r\nevolution of the damage and criteria of estimation optimality. 2. Developing solutions of\r\noptimal statistical estimation and detection problems through embedded convex optimization of a\r\nlog-likelihood index. 3. Developing scalable algorithms through networked distributed computing.\r\nBroad impact. Algorithmic and system engineering approaches in this proposal would accelerate\r\nindustrial adoption of the SHM technology by reducing false alarms and improving scalability.\r\nThis would enable condition-based maintenance of structures reducing airline flight delays and improving\r\nmilitary aircraft readiness. Other aerospace applications include next generation space\r\nvehicles and space habitats. The transition into aerospace engineering practice will be facilitated\r\nby the collaboration with Honeywell. The research would help in developing large networked sensing\r\nsystems in other areas. These include SHM of civil structures (buildings, bridges, etc), marine\r\nand ground vehicles, and industrial plants. The results could be also extended to sensing and\r\nhealth assessment in medicine, geophysics (e.g., earthquake related damage), and bio or ecosystem\r\ndamage.\r\nWe will take steps towards developing graduate training in the area of decision technology for the\r\nnetworked sensors by including the research results in the curriculum of existing courses. During\r\nthe planned university visit, the industrial co-PI will teach an industrial-oriented graduate-level\r\ncourse. The students involved with the project or attending the courses will have an opportunity\r\nto work as interns at Honeywell, which will provide them with an additional practical training.\r\n1",
