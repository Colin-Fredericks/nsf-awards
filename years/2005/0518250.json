 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fields of toxicology and ecology are largely separate disciplines in the questions asked and the approaches taken.  However, the two fields share a common goal of trying to understand how anthropogenic chemicals affect species and communities via direct and indirect food web effects.  This common goal is especially strong for understanding how chemical stressors affect amphibian assemblages because of current conservation concerns over their global decline.  Past studies of stress on amphibians have focused largely on the effects on single species under laboratory conditions.  While this work has provided a great deal of excellent data, we ultimately wish to know what happens under more natural conditions.  This proposal addresses these needs by using a series of field experiments that examine seven species of amphibians and common environmental stressor that are associated with amphibian declines.  The work will focus on understanding how predators, and competitors interact with natural and anthropogenic stressors to affect aquatic communities.  The broader impacts consist of training of graduate and undergraduate students (including under-represented groups). The benefits to society include a better understanding of how human stressors affect natural communities and global amphibian declines.  Our results will be disseminated by the PI and students in journals, conferences, and the popular press. The experimental results will be developed into teaching modules for regional middle and high school teachers. Collectively, this research offers a great opportunity to advance our basic understanding of ecological systems and have a strong, positive impact on society.",
