 "awd_abstract_narration": "The five undergraduate Claremont Colleges, Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd, Pitzer, Pomona,\r\nand Scripps, will jointly sponsor this Research Experiences for Undergraduates site. Each summer,\r\nfive Claremont faculty will engage 10 undergraduates in an 8-week program of mathematics\r\nresearch and other mathematical and social activities designed to expose them to professional careers\r\nin mathematics. Students will work in groups of 3 or 4 with one or two faculty advisors\r\non an original research project. Two or three topics will be selected each summer from different\r\nareas of mathematics such as low-dimensional topology, knot theory, combinatorics, group representations,\r\nnumber theory, statistics, dynamical systems, mathematical modeling, and optimization\r\nproblems in computer architecture. Weekly mathematical activities will include seminars, workshops\r\nin research related skills (such as library research, TEXnical writing, oral presentation, and\r\ncomputational methods), and discussions of career opportunities in mathematics. Frequent social\r\nactivities will allow participants to interact with additional Claremont faculty and non-REU\r\nClaremont students also involved in summer research projects.\r\nStudents will give a final presentation of their project, produce a written paper possibly suitable\r\nfor publication, and, after the summer is over, be encouraged to present their work at a meeting of\r\none of the mathematics professional societies. Funds specifically for this purpose will be available.\r\nParticipants will be selected nationwide. Prerequisites will vary each year with choice of topics\r\nfor that year. Women, minorities, and other groups traditionally underrepresented in professional\r\nmathematics are especially encouraged to apply.",
