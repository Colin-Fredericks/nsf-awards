In the first project, building on his\r\nrecent joint work with Persi Diaconis and with Brian Conrey, \r\nthe principal investigator will explore connections between the\r\ndistribution of the secular coefficients of random matrices, the\r\nconjectures of Conrey, Farmer, Keating, Rubinstein and Snaith\r\nfor moments of  L-functions, and some  classical problems in \r\nenumerative combinatorics related to counting  magic squares. \r\nThe  second project of the principal investigator is devoted to \r\nstudying from a unified point of view one of the main problems in \r\nthe theory of expander graphs and one of the basic conjectures in \r\nthe theory of quantum chaos. A basic problem in the theory of \r\nexpander graphs, formulated by Lubotzky and  Weiss, is to what \r\nextent being an expander family for a family of Cayley graphs is a\r\nproperty of the groups alone, independent of the choice of generators.\r\nFor many natural families of groups, in particular, for special linear\r\ngroup of order two, numerical experiments indicate that it might\r\nbe an expander family for generic choices of generators\r\n(Independence Conjecture). A basic conjecture in Quantum Chaos,\r\nformulated by Bohigas, Giannoni, and Shmit, asserts that the\r\neigenvalues of a quantized chaotic Hamiltonian behave like the\r\nspectrum of a typical member of the appropriate ensemble of random\r\nmatrices. Both conjectures can be viewed as asserting that a\r\ndeterministically constructed spectrum generically  behaves like\r\nthe spectrum of a large random matrix:  in the bulk  (Quantum\r\nChaos Conjecture) and at the edge of the spectrum (Independence\r\nConjecture). The principal investigator will work on proving these\r\nconjectures  in the context of the spectra of elements in group rings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRandom Matrix Theory originated in Wigner's suggestion in the\r\nearly fifties that the resonance lines of heavy nuclei might be\r\nmodelled by the spectrum of a large random matrix. In the ensuing\r\nfifty years the scope and depth of Random Matrix Theory has\r\ndramatically increased; in the past decade the subject has\r\nundergone explosive growth. The first project of the principal\r\ninvestigator aims at forging a link between two recent lines of\r\ndevelopment in Random Matrix Theory.  One is the discovery and\r\nexploitation of the connections between eigenvalue statistics and\r\nthe longest-increasing subsequence problems in enumerative\r\ncombinatorics;  another is the outburst of interest in\r\ncharacteristic polynomials of  random matrices and associated\r\nglobal statistics, particularly in relation with the moments of\r\nthe Riemann zeta function, a function of fundamental importance in\r\nnumber theory.  The second  project of the principal investigator\r\nis devoted  to studying connections between random matrices and \r\nexpander graphs -- highly connected sparse graphs that efficiently\r\npropagate information quickly to many nodes along short paths. Recent\r\nexplicit constructions of such graphs have created an explosion of\r\ninterest in their potential applications to network design, complexity\r\ntheory, coding theory and cryptography. These constructions are algebraic\r\nin nature, and provide a beautiful example of how abstract, seemingly\r\nunrelated topics in number theory, group theory and combinatorics  \r\ncan be elegantly combined to solve an important real-world problem.\r\n\r\n",
