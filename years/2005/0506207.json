Hardt and Michael Wolf\r\n\r\nSingular objects and regularity theory for potentially singular\r\nobjects have played and continue to play an essential role in all\r\nareas of geometry, topology and analysis. The works of F. Reese\r\nHarvey and John C. Polking, both jointly and separately,involving\r\nthe analysis and structure of singularities, have ranged widely\r\nover all three areas. This conference, in recognition of their\r\nscholarly and academic service, will treat important issues\r\ninvolving singularities raised in their works over the last 30\r\nyears. It will focus on recent developments in singular spaces as\r\nan outgrowth of calibrated geometries, special Lagrangian\r\nsubmanifolds, removable singularity problems, and the relatively\r\nnew area of singular connections. The conference will begin with\r\nan introductory session aimed at graduate students, recent\r\nPh.D.'s, and non-specialist researchers.  The body of the\r\nconference will involve topics from the wide expertise of the\r\ninvited lecturers which encompass: singularities in calibrated\r\ngeometries, exceptional holonomy, CR geometry, differential\r\ncharacters, geometry of singular spaces, singularities of complex\r\nsubmanifolds and varieties, extension problems for analytic\r\nobjects, geometric aspects of singular connections, special\r\nLagrangian theory, compactification of spaces of connections, and\r\nregularity theory of harmonic maps, special Lagrangian\r\nminimizers, and Yang-Mills connections. Finally one session of\r\nthe conference will be devoted to the study of a specific\r\nimplementation of technology in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThrough mathematical models of a wide variety of phenomena from\r\nmacro-economic systems, to cosmological models of the universe,\r\nto microscopic mechanics of solids, the notion of a\r\n\"singularity\" has gained prominence in the last thirty\r\nyears. It is identified with the sudden disruption in space or\r\ntime of a smooth media. It may occur at a point, as with two\r\ncolliding particles, along a curve, as with lightning, or a\r\nsurface, as with an earthquake fault, or on some higher\r\ndimensional \"surface,\" as occurs in multi-parameter\r\neconomic models. The basic fields in pure mathematics of\r\nanalysis, geometry, and topology, have all attacked problems of\r\nunderstanding singularity formation and structure. This timely\r\nconference, on the occasion of the retirement of two academic\r\nleaders, brings together outstanding researchers and students\r\nfrom all these fields for a synergistic exchange of ideas. Many\r\nof the specific topics of the lectures of the conference have\r\nboth their origins in and applications to mathematical physics,\r\nfrom the Lagrangian description of classical mechanical systems\r\n(1800's) to problems in string theory (1990's). The mathematical\r\nanalysis of singularities provides important information for not\r\nonly these well-established applications but also for new\r\nsingularities arising from biological and computational problems.\r\n",
