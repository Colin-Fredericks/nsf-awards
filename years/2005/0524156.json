The framework\r\nconsists of a suite of security mechanisms spanning three phases:\r\nprevention, detection, and reaction. This research seeks to provide fundamental\r\nsecurity services covering key management, authentication, compromise\r\ndetection, and revocation. These services are essential for the successful\r\ndeployment of sensor networks. In addition, the research seeks solutions that\r\nare designed and implemented in a distributed manner, where no central\r\nauthority is involved. This distributed property is critical for unattended\r\nsensor networks deployed in adversarial environments, because a central\r\nauthority is a single point of failure from both security and performance\r\nperspectives. The success of this project will have broad impact, making sensor networks more trustworthy and amenable to commercial, civilian, and military applications. The results of the project are disseminated through publications and talks, and the research is integrated into the computer science and engineering curriculum at Penn State.\r\n",
