The  research will analyze the processes through which the interaction of dissent and repression impact large-scale social transformations associated with democratization and globalization.  The research team is multidisciplinary,  advancing  knowledge at the convergence of the disciplines of sociology, political science, and international relations.   The PIs will  develop research models that include dynamic and interactive processes in sociopolitical systems affected by extensive and often violent dissent and repression.  While focusing on the Middle East, the project  creates a general model that is applicable to other regions of the world.  Methodologically, the project jointly analyzes  qualitative and quantitative data to  demonstrate how dynamic models deal with major social transformations across time and space. Data catalogs will be compiled on five Middle Eastern countries--Egypt, Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Kuwait and Turkey--using already constructed data from the World Handbook IV and new data from Agence France Preesse, the world's second largest international newswire service.  The later provides detailed identities of actors and targets and map these events to specific locales.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. This project will advance our understanding of the transformative changes associated with democratization and globalization in a strategic region of the world that has major implications for world order and development. It will provide a model for multi-method interdisciplinary social science research and provide important insights into prospects for democratization and globalization in the Middle East.  The PIs will also create a database that integrates qualitative and quantitative data that will allow for the analysis of dynamic models of social transformation across time and space.\r\n",
