 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aerosol science and engineering is a multidisciplinary field with diverse applications, and there is a great demand for trained individuals in this field.  A comprehensive web based program is being developed to enhance the abilities of undergraduate students and instill in them an interest to understand its complex principles.  The program consists of seven modules: (1) Basics, (2) Transport, (3) Instrumentation, (4) Collection Devices, (5) Nanoparticles, (6) Atmospheric Aerosols and (7) Health Care.  Each module contains two parts: (1) a narrative for principles illustrated by dynamic animation with real-world contextual materials; and (2) an interactive web calculator for design/assessment or a web simulator for virtual operation.  These modules can be used individually or as integrated unit.  \r\n\r\nSeveral types of evaluation, from front-end evaluation in the development phase to summative and pilot evaluations to assess the level of knowledge delivered, are being carried out with the participation of both faculty and student users.  Test modules of this unique program are being broadly disseminated through the Internet (http://aerosol.ees.ufl.edu/ or http://www.aerosols.wustl.edu/aaqrl/courses/cycopcresp/ ) to different types of institutions with diverse student backgrounds.  Dissemination is also facilitated by national associations and through supplements to existing textbooks. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is evident by the strong support received from the aerosol community and diverse types of institutions.  This educational tool not only aids in the learning process, but also increases awareness of Aerosol Science and Technology. The success of the program brings about broad impacts to the nation as it helps provide the necessary human resources to keep the nation technologically competitive and economically strong.  The multidisciplinary approach expands students' vision and training to an open ended and creative one.  The collaboration among diverse institutions in the development and implementation phases will help in a broader dissemination of scientific knowledge to diverse groups.  \r\n",
