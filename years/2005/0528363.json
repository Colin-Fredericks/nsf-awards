 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  proposed  research is  to  apply  conformal  surface theory  to\r\nvarious    geometry    representations    to    compute    conformal\r\nstructures.  Using  computed   conformal  structures,  new  geometry\r\nrepresentation and analysis tools  can be developed, which will pave\r\nthe   road  for  advances   in  multiple   fronts  of   science  and\r\nengineering. The work proposed  herein will especially explore these\r\npotentials  in  computer  graphics  and visualization.  Building  up\r\nconformal structures  recasts many three  dimensional (3D) geometric\r\nproblems into two dimensions  (2D) and leads to efficient approaches\r\nfor a number of fundamental geometric problems. These approaches can\r\nthen  immediately benefit  a  wide range  of  applications, such  as\r\nsurface  classification,   surface  matching  and   shape  analysis,\r\ngeometric    modeling,    simulation,    graphics   rendering    and\r\nvisualization.   Performing   conformal  parameterization   requires\r\nsolving  large   least  squares   problems.  To  further   push  the\r\napplication  of  the  conformal  structure to  interactive  or  time\r\ncritical  operations,  the  research  team  will  investigate  novel\r\niterative methods for least-squares  problems based on sparse QR and\r\nincomplete  sparse QR  algorithms.\r\n\r\nVarious  scientific and engineering  applications concern  about key\r\noperations  such  as  modeling,  design, analysis,  simulation,  and\r\ngraphics  rendering.  All  these  operations  are  built  on  top  a\r\nfoundation of  geometry representation. In  this project, scientists\r\naim  to revolutionize  this  foundation by  introducing a  conformal\r\nstructure  uniquely characterizing geometry  surfaces. Many  laws of\r\nphysics  are governed  by  conformal structures.  For example,  heat\r\ndiffusion  and  electromagnetic   field  distribution  on  surfaces,\r\ntension in  soap bubbles and  parts of string theory  in theoretical\r\nphysics are  determined by conformal  surface structures. Encouraged\r\nby the existing success, the scientists strive to explore and unveil\r\nthe  potentials  of  conformal  structures  for  computer  graphics,\r\ngeometric modeling  and much of scientific  computing. To illustrate\r\nthis potential, consider one  aspect of conformal structures, namely\r\nthe canonical flattening of a  surface into a plane, resulting in an\r\nimage like representation of seemingly complicated three dimensional\r\ngeometry.  Overall, the  tools developed  in this  project  can help\r\nboost  the development  of  effective techniques  to  deal with  the\r\nemerging   problems   related   to   scientific   simulation,   data\r\nexploration,   and   identity  matching   or   shape  analysis   for\r\nsurveillance and biological discovery.\r\n",
