The proposed research has the potential to impact a diverse range of areas in engineering from wastewater polishing for reuse to applications in subsurface bioremediation. The research is designed specifically to investigate and describe the multi-scale physical phenomena that affect and control bacterial adhesion at solid-fluid interfaces, and transport of bacteria in porous media systems. The work involves both laboratory experiment and the development of new theory. It is proposed that the most important benefit from the work is the potential to improve our understanding of the processes involved in the filtration of microorganisms for improvement of drinking water\r\n\r\nThe integrated education and outreach component of career development plan involve supporting two graduate students.  Matching departmental funds will also be used.  Two specific educational components are proposed (1) focussed study abroad for graduate and undergraduate students at the CNRS Institut de Mecanique des Fluides de Toulouse and University Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France, and (2) development of a new module on multi-scale biofilm processes that will be taught as part of the laboratory component of a senior-level Environmental Engineering Design course. Additional educational and outreach opportunities such as mentoring underrepresented high-school students to consider science and engineering as a possible career path, and outreach activities in science and engineering for students in grades 5-7. \r\n",
