This Adaptation and Implementation project uses the DyKnow Vision software and tablet computers, which have had early success at DePauw University, to provide an interactive learning experience for students in the classroom to improve student comprehension and enthusiasm.  A \"DyKnow Laboratory\" can be set up in any classroom, so that each topic of study - an algorithm, a graph, an example, or a drawing - can be viewed, modified, and saved by both the instructor and the student. The result of each lab is a separate file that is accessible on the web. Each copy of the file can be annotated digitally, thus providing individualized transcripts for each student. The annotations can be done in real time in the lab or later during study and review.\r\n\r\nThe project centers on four lower-level courses, three in mathematics and one in introductory computer science. The two investigators who teach these courses are transforming them into interactive courses during the two-year life of the project. Student outcomes are being assessed and results are being presented at a National Institute for Technology and Liberal Education meeting and workshop for other liberal arts colleges.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
