 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for logistical and reporting support for a workshop on Sensors for Environmental Observing Systems. The main objectives of the workshop are to provide guidance to the research and sensor development communities on what the highest priority needs are for environmental sensors; to build a multidisciplinary community of researchers who will address those needs; and to provide community guidance to help shape future NSF program announcements in this area. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the workshop will include the formation of a new interdisciplinary community of researchers with backgrounds in both environmental research and sensor development that will be better able to respond to the needs for large networks of sensors that can be deployed for long time periods and that are robust enough to work in harsh environments. The hardcopy and electronic reports from the workshop will also be available on a public Web site to communicate the workshop findings to the broader community. The final report is envisioned that will serve as a reference for this new community for years to come.\r\n",
