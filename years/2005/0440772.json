It began performing this project in 2000 under NSF award OPP-9909727. These bibliographies are the world's premier databases for information about virtually all scientific publications relevant to the world's cold regions.  \r\nThe Library of Congress performed the project from its inception in 1951 until 2000.\r\nAGI will continue to extend its national and international data exchange network to improve comprehensiveness.  Also, individual scientists and others can recommend additional titles as described on the web site.\r\nThe bibliographies are distributed via web and CD-ROM. The web site links to the full texts of cited publications where appropriate. GIS options for retrieval will be evaluated.\r\nAGI produces GeoRef, the primary bibliographic service for the geosciences, and thus compiles the cold-regions bibliographies with a reasonable effort while enhancing them with recent innovations. \r\nThe bibliographies can be searched to at http://www.coldregions.org.\r\nWhat is the intellectual merit of the project?\r\nThe project preserves the scientific research record across all disciplines by enhancing access to and dissemination of research information about cold regions. New dissemination techniques combining web technology with repurposed information obtained from publishers and researchers provides the opportunity to continue improving and extending the bibliographies.\r\nWhat are the broader impacts of the project?\r\nThe project supports the research and education infrastructure across the scientific disciplines by providing access to cold regions literature. These regions are critical for understanding the global system and for other research that is best performed in Polar regions and other cold regions. \r\n",
