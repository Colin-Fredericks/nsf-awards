 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  research in this  proposal is  on the  study and  applications of\r\nefficient  algebraic  multigrid methods  for  the  solution of  linear\r\nalgebraic  systems arising  from  the discretization  of second  order\r\npartial  differential  equations  by  the generalized  finite  element\r\nmethod.  The  proposed research  will  focus  on  the development  and\r\nanalysis of  adaptive techniques in  the construction of  hierarchy of\r\nnested spaces and the choice of approximate subspace solvers that lead\r\nto the efficient and robust multigrid methods applicable to wide range\r\nof generalized finite element discretizations.\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase in the  power of today's supercomputers has made it\r\nfeasible for the scientific  community to use numerical simulations to\r\nmodel  physical phenomena to  produce meaningful  results. One  of the\r\nmodern  techniques  that can  deliver  quantitative  results via  such\r\nsimulations is the generalized finite element method.  This method has\r\nproved to be a very  robust discretization tool, applicable in various\r\nbranches of  engineering and sciences, for example,  in simulating and\r\ndetermining the elastic,  electromagnetic and other important physical\r\nproperties of heterogeneous materials.  Like most other discretization\r\ntechniques, most often the majority of computation in such simulations\r\nis  devoted  to  the  solution  of the  resulting  linear  systems  of\r\nequations.  Hence,  it is very important to  develop efficient solvers\r\nfor these  systems. The  results from the  proposed research  are thus\r\nexpected to have  a broad and noticeable impact  by providing the much\r\nneeded  iterative  multilevel  solution  techniques for  the  discrete\r\nlinear  systems arising  from numerical  models in  many applications.\r\nThe proposed research  is also expected to have  an educational impact\r\nas it will  provide a solid base for training  of graduate students in\r\nthe modern theoretical and  practical aspects of numerical methods for\r\nproblems in science and engineering.",
