 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Army Research Office (ARO) jointly sponsor this workshop entitled, \"Networked Systems: Realization of Reliable Systems on Unreliable Networked Platforms\".  The goal of this workshop is to bring together experienced researchers who have been involved in tool development and networked system development, with leaders in industry who are stakeholders in the progress.  The overall aim is to exchange ideas for continued research in this area and to reduce the gap between foundations and software practice.  The workshop will be the 12th in a series of workshops, initiated in 1993 and devoted to exploring the critical problems associated with cost-effective development of high-quality software systems.  The workshop will discuss the following challenges in networked systems that will require further major advances in software and systems technology: (1)  System integration and dynamic adaptation; (2)  Effects of dynamic structure; (3)  Effects of faults;  (4)  Design for reliability;  and (5)  Effects of scale.  The workshop is expected to produce a newly heightened level of agreements on the promising directions for advancing the state of the art in the engineering of challenging software-intensive systems that involve wireless networked computing and are robust, fault tolerant, and highly available.",
