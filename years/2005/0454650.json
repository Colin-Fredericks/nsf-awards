 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial use of genetically modified conifers is now underway with \r\nfield trials concentrated in the southern United States. Opposition has \r\nranged from requests for a planting moratorium to threats of \r\necoterrorism. This tension will only grow as genomics continues to \r\nprovide gene discovery available for genetic modification. Similarly, \r\npolicy has not progressed as fast as technology. By default, \r\nagricultural policies cover forest management in the US yet few decision \r\nmakers are clear about the many ways in which genetically modified \r\nforests deviate from GM food crops. Balanced, open dialogue is needed to \r\nfind common-interest solutions.\r\n\r\nThe 2004 Nicholas School Forum at Duke University will open dialogue \r\nabout genetic composition of US forests. Attendees will identify \r\nemerging issues for forest genomics portfolios, ecosystem interface, \r\nlandowners, regulations and community perspective. The forum has \r\nattracted inclusive participation by science writers, employees of \r\nbiotechnology firms and timber corporations, non-government activists, \r\nstudents, university faculty, state and federal government officials and \r\nforesters. Eminent international speakers will broaden perspective on \r\nthis regional and national issue. Forum organizer Claire Williams and \r\nher colleagues will complete an edited volume entitled 'Landscapes, \r\nGenomics and Transgenic Conifer Forests' to be published by \r\nKluwer-Springer by summer 2005. Our participatory forum on genetically \r\nmodified conifers is designed to catalyze similar venues in the US and \r\nother countries.\r\n",
