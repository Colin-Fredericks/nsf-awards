 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the development of new chemical methods that are broadly applicable to organic synthesis, focusing on the discovery of novel catalytic systems enabling efficient and selective carbon-carbon bond formation using alkynes. Transition metal vinylidene complexes will be generated and used to effect catalytically a 1,1-geminal addition process. This in turn will lead to the development of tandem inter- and intramolecular addition, cycloaddition/cycloisomerization, and novel alkenylation reactions. Asymmetric variants will be developed through the use of catalysts bearing chiral ligands.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Chulbom Lee of the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University. Professor Lee and his students are exploring metal catalyzed reactions of molecules containing carbon-carbon triple bonds. These studies are leading to an understanding of the fundamental reactivity patterns of the catalysts and to the development of a set of potentially powerful methods for the synthesis of complex organic molecules. Through the discovery of unique reaction pathways and methods for their catalysis, this research offers the potential for the development of conceptually new strategies for the discovery and synthesis of new materials and pharmaceutical products.",
