 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to increase the number of well-prepared individuals entering the biotechnology work force.  By developing and delivering an intensive and practical one-semester certificate program for unemployed/underemployed individuals with baccalaureate degrees (or equivalent), this program offers these students a bridge to the regulated biotechnology workplace.  It is not unusual for individuals with baccalaureate degrees to attend two-year colleges in order to develop practical work place skills to supplement the theoretical understanding gained from a four-year program.  However,  two-year biotechnology programs have not had the resources to create instructional materials and to provide separate programming for these post-baccalaureate individuals and so have placed them in pre-existing associate degree courses.  While this approach has successfully helped some baccalaureate graduates transition into the work place, the length of time required to complete various associate degree courses, and the pace of instruction in these classes, is not suitable for graduates of four-year institutions. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The project develops, delivers, and disseminates up-to-date and accurate instructional materials for post-baccalaureate students, relating underlying science concepts to the modern biotechnology workplace.  Partnerships with industry and university collaborators infuse the project with cutting-edge molecular biology content, including exposure to microarray analysis methods and bioinformatics tools.  Special attention is given to educating students in the culture of regulated business. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The proposed activities have the goal of bringing more people into biotechnology in all areas of the country.  The outreach and dissemination efforts are national in scope and involve instructional materials, both on-line and in print, faculty-enhancement activities, and instruction to students who come from diverse regions.  Additionally, the proposed project serves as a model for other technical programs, not just biotechnology, within the college and other two-year institutions.  Educational materials generated are adapted for use for students for whom English is a second language.",
