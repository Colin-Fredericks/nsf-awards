 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nAcquisition of a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a laser light scattering (LLS) spectrophotometer is resulting in the infusion of the physical chemistry, biochemistry, biophysical chemistry, and independent research courses with biologically relevant, thermodynamic-rich laboratory experiences.  LLS and DSC experiments adapted from the educational literature that incorporate the thermodynamic characterization of synthetic polymers, proteins, nucleic acids, or lipid membranes are being implemented.  For example, in the physical chemistry course students use LLS to determine the molecular weight of a polystyrene-methyl methacrylate polymer and characterize its interactions with organic solvent.  DSC is used to characterize the glass-transition of the copolymer as well as a phospholipids bilayer phase transition.   Biochemistry students use DSC and LLS to characterize T7 polymerase isolated and purified in the lab and relate these investigations to the functional attributes of the protein. Biophysical chemistry students use both LLS and DSC in an independent, investigative format to study the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex formation and its dependence on ionic strength and solvent quality.  The LLS and DSC instruments are also used in collaborative research with colleagues and undergraduate students.  The use of these instruments provides student comfort and familiarity with thermodynamics while addressing the Bio2010 challenge.\r\n\r\n",
