 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component of this CAREER program will investigate processes leading to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The program will focus on the impact of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) on SOA formation potentials, experimentally investigate SOA formation from mixtures of aerosol forming precursors, and evaluate the impact of temperature and relative humidity for a discrete number of systems. The research will use a new, unique environmental chamber for investigation of SOA processes at low NOx and hydrocarbon concentrations that have not been possible previously. The program will advance our understanding of gas-particle equilibria and provide a critical database for evaluation of other current and future SOA predictive models. The results of this work will provide critical insight into and advances in the prediction of aerosol formation processes within the atmosphere. This research is relevant for public policy on air pollution control, public health, and energy strategy.\r\n\r\nThe educational component of the program will generate new teaching modules for K-12 students to understand air pollution. The research will provide for the training of graduate and undergraduate students both in the area of air quality research and in air quality education. The students will be directly involved in the development and implementation of the new K-12 modules in the local school districts by team teaching with local educators about air quality in the region. The research program will advance minority education by interesting local underrepresented students in the region about air quality and by continuing to train a highly diverse student body.",
