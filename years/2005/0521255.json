The research plan includes the study of morphology and architecture in tissues and organs, deformation and failure processes in structures, and bone repair, using a requested high-resolution computed tomography system. The requested instrument will be used for many projects by researchers from different departments. The equipment proposed for acquisition will benefit a diverse group of research projects, including morphology and architecture in tissues and organs, deformation and failure processes in structures, and bone repair. A management plan to maintain and share the equipment is also provided.\r\n",
