 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybrid electric vehicles are different from traditional automobiles in that an HEV utilizes two propulsion systems (internal combustion engine and electric motor) in its powertrain and involves high electrical voltage. Automotive service technicians must possess HEV-specialized knowledge acquired through additional education in order to service these vehicles. This education includes safety, regulations, control systems and propulsion systems. Currently automobile manufacturers are training their HEV automotive service technicians entirely in-house, which limits the number of automotive service technicians available for the growing hybrid market. There is a clear need for a systematic training program on HEV, particularly in Southeast Michigan, where automotive manufacturers and their suppliers are highly concentrated. The goal of this project is to fill this need by developing an industry-based learning environment for HEV technology. The guiding vision of this HEV Learning Environment is an integrated education and industrial based training program for students in automotive programs in community colleges, automotive service technicians, engineering technologists, and K-12 automotive teachers. \r\n\r\nIn order to develop this program, a partnership has been formed between faculty of Macomb Community College Automotive Technology Program and the Division of Engineering Technology at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. The partnership also includes industrial partners from major automobile manufacturers and suppliers. The planned activities for the project include (1) Developing an HEV curriculum and integrating it with the existing Associate of Applied Science program in Automotive Technology; (2) Revising existing courses and developing required HEV specific courses; (3) Creating an HEV specialized laboratory; (4) Developing a two-day short course on HEV technology available for distance learning; (5) Developing and delivering seminars and workshops for different groups of audiences, including K-12 teachers, (6) Creating internship and co-op opportunities, in-plant visits, and an expert lecturer series; (7) Initiating a pilot program for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) certification in hybrid vehicles; and (8) Providing transfer student advising by WSU faculty at MCC. \r\n\r\nThis project holds intellectual merit in that it is developing the first systematic courses and degree programs to educate automotive technicians in the emerging technology of HEV. To date, no automotive program in HEV has been developed for the community college level. In addition to the HEV curriculum at MCC, this program also provides workshops and seminars for general audiences and a short course available for distance learning.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed HEV program extend beyond Southeast Michigan to affect the automotive industry nationally and internationally through the potential of the program to serve as a model for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) HEV training, and planned dissemination activities. These activities include posting course materials online, presenting project results at professional conferences, and delivering a short course through the Internet for corporate education programs.\r\n",
