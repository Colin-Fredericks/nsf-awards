 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF) is developing and deploying the nations largest unified \r\ncomputational infrastructure. The goal of the ETF is to provide scientists with the most powerful, \r\nintegrated computational resource possible, While ETF resources are geographically dispersed, \r\nthey represent the integrated capability of nine different sites. The resources integrated by ETF \r\ninclude compute resources, storage, data collections, instruments, and visualization tools. Users \r\nof the ETF will experience the ETF as a single utility that is not only accessible from anywhere, \r\nbut will also run jobs from anywhere. The ETF will work towards building a common framework \r\nfor expansion and robust reliable operation. Additional sites will be invited to join the ETF and will \r\ndo so by embracing the common software infrastructure that makes ETF more than a loosely \r\ncoupled system of HPC site. The common infrastructure is at the heart of the ETF and brings the \r\ngrid concept to fruition with features such as single login, single allocation currency, single \r\nprogramming environment, single helpdesk, single queuing system but heterogeneous and \r\ndispersed resources. \r\n\r\nPurdue University as a Resource Provider will make available to the ETF, 1,000,000 SUs through \r\nits IBM SP and Linux clusters.  This commitment is expected to increase by 10% each year. \r\nPurdue will also make available and maintain several dataset collections in remote sensing, \r\nclimate modeling, and bioinformatics. Purdue will also work with other RP sites to develop a data \r\ncollection framework that will facilitate metadata publishing and searching as well as post-\r\nprocessing of large datasets. Finally, Purdue will engage scientific users through science \r\ngateways, especially the computational nanotechnology community through the NSF Network for \r\nComputational Nanotechnology (NCN) and the remote sensing community through the Purdue \r\nTerrestrial Observatory (PTO).  With two science partners representing major national and international research communities, Purdue will stimulate the use of TeraGrid resources to explore and extend the frontiers of key scientific disciplines. Our goal and the ultimate measure of our success will be establishing science gateways used by hundreds of scientists in each of these disciplines \r\n\r\n",
