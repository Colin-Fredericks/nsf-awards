 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed applications and the hardware/software platforms on which they\r\nrun are becoming increasingly complex. As a result, it is also becoming\r\nincreasingly difficult to understand and then manage application behavior,\r\nparticularly for applications that are critical to the ability of\r\norganizations to provide services for which they have contractual obligations.\r\n\r\nGeorgia Tech's `Service Paths' project is developing technologies for\r\n(1) dynamically discovering the critical `paths' applications follow\r\nthrough distributed sets of services, and (2) managing such paths in\r\norder to improve an application's ability to meet dynamic service level\r\nagreements. Service path technologies will substantially improve systems'\r\nabilities to provide end-to-end guarantees and enhance the underlying\r\nsystems' capabilities to provide such guarantees. Concrete outcomes include\r\nnew system-level methods and abstractions to better understand current\r\napplication behavior, new middleware abstractions suitable both for\r\nconstructing and managing large-scale software overlays across many\r\nmachines, and experimental results attained with virtualized platforms\r\nlike PlanetLab and with novel hardware support for runtime platform\r\nvirtualization.\r\n\r\nBroader significance: the costs of developing and changing modern IT\r\ninfrastructures are now dominated by personnel rather than hardware.\r\nTechnology providers have reacted to this fact by making it increasingly\r\neasy to develop complex distributed applications. Without also\r\nunderstanding and then being able to manage and control such applications,\r\ncost savings attained at development time cannot be translated to the\r\ncontinuing cost savings required to make U.S. industry competitive with\r\nlow-cost, international providers.\r\n\r\n",
