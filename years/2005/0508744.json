The\r\nconference is sponsored by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) and\r\nits Chinese and Japanese counterparts, the Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of\r\nChina (CIESC) and the Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan (SCEJ). The theme of the\r\nconference is: Chemical Engineering in Sustainable Development and Emerging\r\nTechnologies.\r\nThe purpose of the Conference is to provide a forum for U.S. Chemical Engineers\r\nto meet their counterparts in China and Japan to discuss the latest advancements,\r\nexchange research ideas and discuss opportunities for collaboration. Global issues such as\r\nnew energy sources and clean fuels will be among the focal points of discussion that will\r\nbe beneficial to the U.S. participants. The direct communication will facilitate\r\ndevelopment and expansion of the potentially vast markets in China for U.S. chemical\r\nproducts.\r\nThe proposed budget of $35,000 will provide for approximately 35 partial travel\r\ngrant awards to U.S. speakers, authors of papers, and young academic participants at the\r\nConference. Travel awards will be made based on the following considerations: (1)\r\nscientific or technological merit of the speaker/participant; (2) professional qualifications\r\nrelative to age and position; (3) institutional and geographical distribution. All awards\r\nwill be made in full compliance with the Civil Rights Acts of 1964. NSF travel policies\r\nwith respect to U.S. air carriers will be followed.\r\n\r\n",
