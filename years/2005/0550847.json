 "awd_abstract_narration": "This five-year research study will focus on the impact of different teacher preparation and induction models, as well as on the quality and persistence of secondary science teachers.  Combining the strengths of case-based research with a quasi-experimental design this study will follow 120 secondary science teachers for three years from four different and well characterized preservice - induction programs.  Many of the \"newly\" inducted teachers will be assigned in multicultural, diverse or urban settings and the broader impact will include not only the teachers in the study but the potential impact on their students.  The rationale for this project is well developed from the literature on the STEM teaching workforce as well as reports from the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future.  The rationale for the induction program approaches are also well supported in the literature and is extended through the literature on early STEM teacher development.\r\n\r\n",
