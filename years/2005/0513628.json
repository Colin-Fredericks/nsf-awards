 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop computational approaches \r\nfor studying groups of agents with natural mobility and social interactions. \r\nThe agents in such systems can move on their own due to complex interactions \r\nbetween biotic and abiotic factors, culminating in behaviors that can be \r\nstudied and modeled using physical data, and ultimately controlled. The team will develop algorithms for adaptive data collection during a field experiment,\r\npost-experiment data analysis for modeling behavior, and control of \r\nthe movement of the group using the learned models in  field experiments\r\nand environmnet data from satellite imagery. The main motivation and \r\napplication of this work is  in the area of free-ranging animal ecology. Groups of animals such as herds are complex self-organized systems that are affected \r\nby many factors including age, group size, landscape topography, plant \r\nphenology, weather, and the environment.\r\n\r\nThis project combines the most recent advances in computer networking, modeling, and robot motion planning and control. The team will collect physical data for extensive periods of time in the field to define behavior models  for herds of animals, using these models to develop planning and control algorithms for coordinating the location of these herds, and using the location control system to manage the stock density and optimize the use of land. This includes: (1) tracking the motion and activities of individual animals; (2) identifying natural group formation and behavior; (3) planning and controlling the location\r\nof individuals and groups; (4) managing the density of the group; and (5) using animal groups as networked information backbones. Although the models will be grounded in specific field data, the proposed methodology and resulting algorithms will be applicable to other societies of free-ranging animals and synthetic societies of agents.\r\n\r\nThis work will bring together computer science, robotics, and animal\r\nexperts in a project that rests on the synergy between these domains.\r\nThe work will be grounded on real data and the resulting models\r\nand algorithms will be used to define detailed plans for field experiments.\r\nThe models will lead to a better understanding of animal behavior and \r\ncontrol at the individual and group level, which has the potential to \r\nimpact broadly agriculture and the environment. This research will develop methods to manipulate stocking density and turn foraging into a practical tool \r\nto remediate range ecosystems by controlling grazing patterns.\r\nThis research will contribute to training of a new generation of\r\nstudents in computation for interaction with the physical world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
