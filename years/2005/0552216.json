 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPart of the US prosperity in the last forty years can be attributed to the sustained development of information technology (IT) and the way in which IT has transformed how we live, play, work, communicate and secure the nation.  The technical progress was funded by university-industry-government partnerships in research and development that yielded many billion-dollar industries.  Recent trends suggest that the US base of research is being diminished, leading to a loss of leadership for the nation.   The study will assess changes in the nation's long-term investment in information technology research and development and reasons for the changes.   This should lead to a deeper understanding of the history and impacts of research and development support in computing, communications and their applications, and the complex interdependence of human resources, ideas, and support strategies.  Alternative strategies about funding will be considered.  The results will assist decision makers in both public and private sectors as they develop future strategies and programs.  This should help to sustain intellectual progress in computing and information processing technologies, supporting national leadership.\r\n",
