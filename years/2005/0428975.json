 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA means for unobtrusive and ubiquitous detection and monitoring of heart and respiration activity \r\nfrom  a  distance  could  be  a powerful  tool  for  health  care,  emergency,  and  surveillance  applications,  yet \r\nremains a largely unrealized goal. Without contact or subject preparation (special clothing, attachments, \r\netc.),  this  could  better  extend  health  monitoring  to  the  chronically  ill  in  routine  life,  allow  wellness \r\nmonitoring for a large population without known predisposition for risk or harm, and provide alarm and \r\ndata in emergencies. Such technology could also be used to detect lost or hidden subjects, to help assess \r\nemotional  state,  and  to  compliment  more  cumbersome  measurements  as  pre-screening.  Doppler  radar \r\nremote  sensing  of  vital  signs  has  shown  promise  to  this  end,  with  proof  of  concept  demonstrated  for \r\nvarious applications by the UHM PI.s and others. Unfortunately, this principle has not been developed to \r\nthe level of practical application, mainly due to a lack of an effective way to isolate desired target motion \r\nfrom  interference.  However,  by  leveraging  recent  advances  in  signal  processing  and  wireless \r\ncommunications  technologies,  this  technique  has  the  potential  to  transcend  mere  novelty  and  make  a \r\nprofound impact on health and welfare in society.  \r\nWe propose to explore robust radar monitoring techniques by isolating desired radar return signals \r\nfrom  unwanted  motion  through  recent  developments  in  multiple  input  multiple  output  (MIMO)  signal \r\nprocessing  techniques,  developed  to  enhance  wireless  communications  channel  capacity  through \r\nconstructive use of multipath phenomenon. The approach would involve three primary areas of research: \r\n(1)  development  of  spatial-frequency  algorithms  for  single  and  multiple  source  radar,  (2)  active  radar \r\nsystem  implementation  using  wireless  terminals  and/or  silicon  radar  chips,  and  (3)  development  of  an \r\neffective .pseudo-passive. sensing system where radio signals in the environment are harnessed for radar \r\nmonitoring  without  control  or  specification  of  the  signal  source.  The  project  will  culminate  with  the \r\ndemonstration of robust Doppler radar MIMO system capable of isolating and determining the number of \r\nsubjects in the monitoring field, and measuring their heart and respiration rates.  \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe proposed three-year collaborative research effort between the University of Hawaii at Manoa \r\n(UHM)  and  Bell  laboratories  (BL)  would  explore  techniques  for  making  non-contact  Doppler  radar \r\nsensing  of  cardiopulmonary  activity  a  practical  alternative  or  supplement  to  more  cumbersome  and \r\ninvasive  technologies  that  necessarily  limit  application.  Recent  work  by  the  UHM  PI  and  one  Co-PI \r\n(Lubecke)  to  implement  Doppler  sensing  by  leveraging  telecommunications  technology,  including  the \r\ndetection of heart and respiration signatures with wireless terminals, has attracted international attention \r\nfor  its  potential.  The  second  UHM  Co-PI  (Host-Madsen)  is  an  established  expert  in  statistical  and \r\ncommunications signal processing with numerous publications in multi-user detection, estimation theory, \r\nand adaptive signal processing. The industry partner, BL, is widely considered the leader in the field of \r\nMIMO  and  other  wireless  systems  technology.  In  related  work,  graduate  students  working  with  the  PI \r\nhave won three student paper competition awards in major IEEE MTT and EMB conferences.  \r\n \r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThe outcomes of this project can lead to valuable tools beneficial for society in the areas of health \r\ncare, emergency  response,  military,  and  security  operations.  The  research  would  present  a  particularly \r\nmotivating educational opportunity that leverages Hawaii.s unique needs for remote healthcare tools, and \r\nreaches out to a diverse population of ethnic minority students that have been historically underserved by \r\nlocal  educational  and  industrial  opportunities.  Thus,  an  important  aspect  of  this  program  will  be \r\ninteractions of UHM students with BL industrial co-advisors, involving extended periods of training in the \r\nhighly relevant fields of communications and bio-sensing engineering, beyond the limits of the University \r\n(and Hawaii), at BL in a world-class research environment. The partnership established will allow UHM \r\nstudents  and  faculty  to  complement  UHM  resources  by  leveraging  BL.s  considerable  expertise  and \r\nfacilities without charge, including a broad range of wireless test systems.",
