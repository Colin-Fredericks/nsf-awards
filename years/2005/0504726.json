In the search for genes underlying human complex diseases, \r\nhaplotype-based association analysis has been recognized as a tool with \r\nhigh resolution and, more importantly, potentially great power for \r\nidentifying modest etiological effects of genes.  However, in practice, \r\nits efficacy has not been as successful as expected in theory; one primary \r\ncause is that such analysis requires a large number of parameters in order \r\nto capture the abundant haplotype varieties. While high degrees of freedom \r\ncan hinder the power of identifying modest genetic effects on complex \r\ndiseases, the need to incorporate covariates of other risk factors further \r\nworsens the degrees-of-freedom problem in mapping genes for complex \r\ndiseases. To tackle this issue, the proposed work constructs an efficient \r\nand powerful model-based framework for association analysis at haplotype \r\nlevel. The central focus of the methods development is on the efficient \r\nuse of haplotype information in a model-based framework, and different \r\nstrategies of reducing haplotype complexity are considered at different \r\nresearch stages to optimize efficiency.  For screening-stage analyses, the \r\nPI constructs approaches based on haplotype similarity of pair-wise \r\ncomparison in a regression platform to detect chromosomal regions that are \r\nlikely to harbor disease genes.  For refinement-stage analyses, the PI \r\ndevelops evolutionary-based methods of haplotype grouping to identify \r\nspecific disease-associated haplotypes, and integrate new \r\ndimension-reduction techniques into existing regression methods.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work aims not only to provide novel association tools in \r\ncomplex gene mapping, but also develop a routine method for case-control \r\nstudies and offer a methodological foundation for future advancement. With \r\nthe availability of a better statistical tool, scientists can advance \r\ntheir understanding of complex diseases, and design better diagnostic and \r\ntherapeutic strategies that improve human health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
