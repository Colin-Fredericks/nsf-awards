The research will result in multithreaded architecture and execution models to handle the needs for programmability, scalability, dynamic workload handling, and storage intensive features of applications in this domain. In addition, appropriate compilation methods and tools under the proposed architecture execution models will be developed. \r\n\r\n\tWith increasing availability of multithreaded and multicore chip architectures the need for fundamental understanding of application decomposition, performance and programmability is a significant problem. The project will identify architectures, execution models, and software tools that address these issues based on a demanding set of networking applications.\r\n",
