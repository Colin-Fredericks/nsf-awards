The research will be focused on three\r\ntypes of geometric problems: Plateau-type problems for\r\nhypersurfaces in Euclidean space and in more general manifolds;\r\nthe Minkowski-type problems of finding closed convex\r\nhypersurfaces of prescribed Weingarten curvature, and problems in\r\nisometric embedding.  Each of these problems involves solving\r\nsome fully nonlinear partial differential equations. Because of\r\ntheir origins in geometry, these equations are closely related\r\nand therefore share many common technical issues.  Thus, progress\r\nin one of the problems will very likely lead to progress in the\r\nothers, and more generally in the theory of nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equations (on manifolds) and geometric analysis.\r\n\r\nFully nonlinear equations also arise in other problems in\r\ngeometry and physics as well as in science and\r\nengineering. Results from our research may have impact and\r\napplications in areas such as string theory in physics, and\r\noptimal control theory.\r\n",
