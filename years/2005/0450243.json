 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Comprehensive Molecular, Genetic and Cytogenetic Analysis of Transposon-Induced Chromosomal Rearrangements in Maize\r\n\r\nTransposons are segments of DNA that can move (transpose) from one site to another in the genome.  Sometimes the ends of separate transposons will attempt to transpose; this alternative transposition reaction can cause large rearrangements of chromosomes.  The aims of this project are to determine which arrangements of transposons can give rise to alternative transposition reactions, and what kinds of chromosomal aberrations can be produced.  The research will be conducted using maize (corn), an ideal model system in which transposition events can be detected by changes in kernel color.  The results should be relevant to other organisms, including humans.  The results of this project will help to elucidate basic principles of the biology of transposable elements and their impact on genome structure and expression:  First, this research will lead to a greater understanding of the potential role of transposable elements in genome diversification and speciation.  Second, the results could help to explain the origin of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations that are often associated with certain human genetic diseases including cancer.  Third, the results may provide the basis for development of new methods for studying eukaryotic chromosomes.  An important aspect of this project is the use of complementary approaches to bridge the molecular and chromosomal levels of structure.  In addition, students will be trained in methods of chromosome analysis through the research project and workshops offered by the investigators.\r\n",
