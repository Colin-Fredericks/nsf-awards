 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, creating a distributed computing and decision making environment in which data gathered from wireless networks will be processed utilizing distributed algorithms implemented on AES (Advanced Execution System), addresses the following issues: How to efficiently\r\n-Gather massive but distributed data using a large number of sensors equipped with small wireless radios,\r\n-Aggregate data from a group of sensors to AES for real time processing, and\r\n-Make decisions based on distributed algorithms specifically designed for this purpose.\r\nAES envisions two components, both based on utilizing the concept of volunteer computational resources: An environment with\r\n-A component that allows loosely coupled scientific and decision making applications to be run using stand-alone volunteer computers (Galaxy AES) such as those participating in the PlanetLab project and\r\n-Multiple Beowulf clusters connected for both loosely coupled and more tightly coupled computations.\r\nWireless sensor networks offer unprecedented opportunities for a broad spectrum of applications, including monitoring the environment in order to take corrective action if a hazardous situation arises. Tiny sensor devices sense environmental parameters and transmit data over a wireless medium. This work develops new algorithms/methods for mapping parallel applications onto highly dynamic volunteer resources that contribute in making decisions in real time based on sensor data gathered. Moreover, this instrumentation enables the construction of two sensor networks to continuously monitor outdoor and indoor air quality. The sensor networks are expected to integrate local computations and inter-sensor communication to perform complex global computations, inferencing, and decision making using the distributed algorithms developed for this purpose. The project, expected to provide a testbed capable of handling thousands of volunteer nodes, enables members of the PlanetLab community to use the Galaxy AES testbed for research in areas of P2P computing and volunteer computing. Benefits on the wireless sensor network side include management and control of air pollutants, informed formulation of public policy related to the environment, and educational training.\r\n",
