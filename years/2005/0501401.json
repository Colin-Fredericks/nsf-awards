 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one-day meeting, called the East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD'2005) is being held at Ashland University in Ashland, Ohio on Saturday, March 12, 2005. The purpose of the meeting is to stimulate interest in and understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra. Its format provides a forum for those in the region who are active or interested in becoming more active in computer algebra to participate, interact, and meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible way. This meeting is less informal than the annual meetings of the ACM sponsored International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC), with ample time for unstructured interaction. Participation by the region's graduate students and junior faculty will be particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel support. \r\n\r\nThe invited talks and poster sessions contributed by the community are expected to cover the breadth of computer algebra: algorithms, systems, and applications. The contributed posters and software demo sessions will enable researchers, especially junior faculty and graduate students, to publicize their recent findings and to make new contacts.\r\n\r\nThe ECCAD conference always precedes ISSAC for the same year. ECCAD thus provides participants an excellent opportunity to preview and review important research before a major international meeting. As a result of this conference, there is increased research activity in symbolic computation with better representation at ISSAC from the United States, as well as a wider appreciation, interest, and classroom use of computer algebra systems. As has been for past meetings, ECCAD 2005 will be held without any registration fee. \r\n\r\n",
