 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award through the Division of Chemistry provides support to the Council for Chemical Research (CCR) for travel grants to six faculty members from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions, thereby enabling their participation in the CCR annual conference. The faculty members are from chemistry and chemical engineering departments at universities who are not currently members of CCR. The universities involved have large numbers of students from under represented groups in science, with the potential to increase participation of these individuals in the activities of the Chemical Research Council. The CRC is the only organization of its kind, and participation at the annual meeting will provide a unique learning experience for the participants, putting them in contact with leaders in industry, academia, and government. The MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Affairs funds this award.",
