 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Stephen R. Leone of the University of California - Berkeley and his graduate and undergraduate research students will investigate the use of coherent control methods with tailored ultrafast laser pulses to manipulate chemical events.  Studies will range from rotational heating and cooling of simple diatomic systems to the control of the photodissociation of polyatomic molecules.  The ultimate goal of the research is to learn of ways in which coherent control may be used to achieve exquisite control chemical dynamics.  The information gleaned from these studies is expected to have broad impact on a variety of technologies including fiber optic telecommunications, quantum information, encryption, and data storage and transfer.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the broader impacts of the proposed research, Prof. Leone will continue in his efforts at educating young scientists at all levels - from high school through postdoctoral level.  He will also work on developing curricular materials for undergraduate physical chemistry students.\r\n",
