 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this proposal is to study problems in Convex Geometry \r\nand Geometric Tomography using methods of Harmonic Analysis.  Geometric \r\nTomography is the area of mathematics where one investigates properties \r\nof solids based on the information about sections and projections of \r\nthese solids. It borrows ideas and methods from many fields of \r\nTheoretical Mathematics, such as integral and differential geometry, \r\nstatistics, and Fourier analysis. But perhaps its biggest overlap is \r\nwith Convex Geometry. A major component of this proposal is to study \r\nproblems which arise naturally from the recent work of the PI on Fourier \r\nanalytic approach to the case of the most general measure of sections of \r\nstar bodies. This method provided a number of new links between harmonic \r\nanalysis, probability theory and convex geometry.  PI intends to \r\ncontinue his work in this area and to consider a number of questions \r\nmotivated by Slicing Problem and Isomorphic Busemann-Petty problem. PI \r\nalso proposes a new approach to the study of the geometric properties of \r\nconvex sets with respect to the Gaussian measure. As an application PI \r\nconsider problems connected to the Gaussian Correlation Conjecture. The \r\nidea, of this method, is to restate the conjecture in the language of \r\nGeometric Tomography and to apply recently developed Fourier Analytic \r\ntechniques.\r\n\r\n  Geometric Tomography has a lot of real life applications. It has goals \r\nsimilar to those of many related and often practical areas. One of the \r\nbest known examples is Classical Computer Aided Tomography, which aims \r\nto reconstruct the density of objects by means of their line integrals. \r\nOther examples are crystallography, robotics, stereology, and electron \r\nmicroscopy. One of the ideas of this proposal is to connect theoretical \r\nresults from Convex Geometry to those practical areas via Geometric \r\nTomography.  Another component of the broader impact of proposed \r\nresearch lies in the training of graduate and undergraduate students. \r\nIndeed, a lot of problems addressed in this proposal stated in such a \r\nway that they are intuitively clear not only to graduate but to \r\nundergraduate students. On the other hand, the answers for many of those \r\nproblems are quite counterintuitive which stimulates an interest of \r\nstudents to the subject and Mathematics in general!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
