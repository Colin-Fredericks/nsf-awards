 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe intricacy of developing process-form relationships in geography is evidenced by the number of theoretical, mathematical, and conceptual frameworks used to analyze and model these complex interactions.  Geographers are not alone in their attempt to unravel these dynamics; biologists continue to search for hierarchical connections between microscopic and cellular functions as they relate to coarser-scale ecosystem functions. Engineers, more specifically surface metrologists, are also attempting to understand how continual operation (function) degrades machined surfaces and how this will impact the broader mechanized structure. In geography, if the sub-discipline of geomorphology is to ever realize its goal of linking geomorphic processes and surface form (morphometry), geomorphic studies must adopt comparable measures of form to coincide with data gathered from process mechanics studies.  This research will investigate the nature of the relationships between geomorphic processes and surface form at multiple spatial scales on talus slopes in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains.  Talus cone morphometry can be organized into three spatial scales of analysis: a macro-scale, meso-scale, and micro-scale. At a macro-scale, talus systems are characterized by a cliff face contributing material to the cone, a gully or channel transporting the material removed from the cliff, and the talus cone deposit.  At the meso-scale, talus cones are dominated by lobate features that appear to vary in length and width with position on the cone.  At a micro-scale, variations in morphometry and particle morphology have been described, but not quantified.  The foundation of this research will rely upon remotely-sensed and field-based digital elevation models. Soft-copy photogrammetry from 1:12,000 aerial photographs will be used to analyze surface characteristics of talus cones and their connections with contributing areas at a macro- and meso-scale.  Terrestrial laser scanning equipment will be used to produce micro-scale morphometric parameters. A comprehensive particle sampling strategy that is spatially coincident with surface morphometry at a meso- and micro-scale will be developed.  Particle morphology data will be collected and analyzed using fabric and vector analysis, which are indicative of process mechanics. High-resolution morphometric and particle morphology data can then be used to identify relationships between geomorphic process and surface form. \r\n\r\nResearch regarding the relationship between geomorphic process and surface form has theoretical and applied significance to alpine geomorphology. The hierarchical and nonlinear relationships identified in this research can be used to conceptualize the evolution and development of active talus cones in mountainous terrain. These relationships can be compared to active slopes in other climatic regimes.  The data can be used to analyze relict talus cones in transitional climatic regimes providing a means of understanding climatic change. In addition, human activities, such as recreation, mining, and construction, are threatened by hazards associated with talus cones. The process-form relationships identified in the proposed research can be used as baseline information for assessment and mitigation of talus slope hazards.\r\n",
