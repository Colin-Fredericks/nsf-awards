 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the recent advances in mathematics and science, computational science stands out as a new and third basis for discovery in addition to theory and experiment in research and education. In numerous applications of engineering, biomedicine, economics, sociology, and other disciplines, computational methods are the key to advancement of technology. To address the current trend and to identify important issues in future research and education in computational science, the investigators propose to co-organize an international workshop in Computational Science and Its Education with a group of researchers and educators in United State and China. The workshop will focus on the following areas: (1) Computation and analysis for problems with stochastic nature; (2) Computational fluid dynamics with multi-physics and multi-scale structures; (3) Computational methods for problems in nano scale; (4) Inverse problems with applications; (5) Topics on integration of computer science, electrical engineering and mathematics; (6) Interaction between teaching and research in computational science with emphasis on curriculum reform/design in computational science leading to the enhancement of the mathematical sciences workforce training in the 21st century. \r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop shall be hosted by the Capital Normal University in Beijing, China from August 29 to August 31, 2005. The proposal is requesting support for the travel support for some USA-based researchers and educators for attending the workshop. The participation of USA-based researchers and educators is highly valuable for the nation's advancement in computational science and education. USA has attracted a large number of first class mathematicians and computational scientists in the history, the workshop will push the trend to continue in the future. The workshop will promote inter/multidisciplinary research in its focusing areas: stochastic problems, multiscale and nano problems, and computational fluid dynamics in multi-physics. It will also encourage interaction among researchers and practitioners to advance applications of its focusing areas related to national security and global environment study. In addition, the workshop will facilitate panel discussions to stimulate curriculum reform in computational science education and to broaden the educational spectrum to benefit underrepresented groups in the area made possible by new highly developed computational and educational devices/software. The workshop will make a broader impact on paving the way for worldwide collaborations in computational science research and teaching benefited from the experience between the US and Asia arising from this workshop. Participants will gain insight from the integration of the high technology of US with the rapidly developing labor market in Asia. \r\n",
