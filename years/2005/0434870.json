 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tA grant has been awarded to the Dauphin Island Sea Lab under the direction of Dr. William M. Graham for partial support of a research and education addition to DISL's primary research facility. In its current layout, Marine Science Hall has exceeded its capacity to support the research and education needs of the DISL faculty and students. The lack of space has placed a strict limitation on growth of individual's research, on opportunities to incorporate laboratory sections into courses, on the ability to support a growing visiting researcher program, and on our need to increase faculty numbers. This award will double the existing MSH laboratory, office and teaching space through construction of a 10,000 sq. ft. addition that will include: four new research laboratories; one common-use teaching/visiting scientist laboratory; six new offices; a ventilated sorting room; a seminar and small conference room; a centralized reception area; open lobby spaces. This award covers approximately one quarter of the total construction cost, and the remaining cost will be covered through the DISL General Operating Fund.\r\n\r\n\tThis award will support and enhance a variety of research and educational opportunities at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab.  The Marine Science Hall facility currently supports 10 full-time resident faculty, 4 post-doctoral researchers, and approximately 40 in-residence graduate students. In support of anticipated research growth of 2-4 new faculty over the next 5-10 years, new research laboratory space must be constructed. In addition, marine science education from K-PhD is an integral part of the DISL mission, and laboratory sections of existing graduate and undergraduate-level courses are rare due to the lack of adequate teaching lab space. The new addition will incorporate a flex-usage teaching lab to allow growth of analytical courses. Finally, DISL lacks adequate seminar facilities and the new addition will provide a 1,000 sq. ft. seminar room with raised seating and state-of-the-art A/V equipment.\r\n\r\n\tSince its inception in 1971, the Dauphin Island Sea Lab has been committed to providing science education and outreach to all reaches of society. By creating new opportunities for scientists through new hires in new areas, the MSH addition will directly influence DISL's long-standing mission to providing science education and outreach through formal and informal means. These include, but are not limited to, DISL's ongoing REU program, K-12 activities shared with DISL's Discovery Hall Programs, collaborative relationships with MESC member historically black colleges and universities, Discovery Hall Program's COSEE activities, and continued involvement with local, state and regional policy-makers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
