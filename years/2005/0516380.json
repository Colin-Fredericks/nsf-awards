 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human domination of the earth has led to rapid changes in ecosystem \r\nfunctioning, and has degraded many functions that are essential to human \r\nsurvival, such as climate regulation, water purification and crop \r\npollination. Research on ecosystem function has traditionally been done at \r\nsmall spatial scales using artificially-assembled communities. We therefore \r\nlack a full understanding of how human activities influence function in \r\nreal landscapes where the changes are occurring. The proposed study will \r\ninvestigate a critical ecological function, pollination, in the context of \r\nhuman-induced land use change. The researchers will examine pollination \r\nprovided to native plant species growing in natural habitat fragments, and \r\nto crop plants in agricultural areas. Both systems will be considered \r\nacross a gradient of land use intensity, i.e., with study sites surrounded \r\nto varying extents by agriculture and urban/suburban development. The \r\nfollowing questions will be investigated: (1) How do pollinator communities \r\nchange (in terms of number of species, community composition, abundance and \r\nbiomass) with increasing land use intensity? (2) What are the functional \r\nconsequences of pollinator community change for native plant and crop \r\npollination? (3) What environmental factors most strongly influence \r\npollination function?\r\n\r\nThe work will benefit society at large, because as human populations \r\ngrow, it becomes increasingly important to maintain ecosystem services that \r\nprevent shortages of water, energy and food. Crop pollination provided by \r\nwild species, which depend on natural habitats, can provide economic \r\nincentives for conserving these habitats. The investigators will transmit \r\nthe results of their study to land owners and land managers through \r\nworkshops, manuals, the media, and collaborative projects with conservation \r\nand farming organizations.  The broader impacts of this work will also \r\ninclude promoting teaching, training and learning by providing \r\nopportunities for independent and collaborative undergraduate projects, \r\nfocusing on women from Bryn Mawr College.",
