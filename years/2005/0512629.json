 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a manufacturing process to achieve superior properties of nano-structured composite materials by uniformly dispersing the fillers in a host polymer matrix. A supercritical fluid processing (SCFP) will be used which is  versatile, relatively simple, and environmentally friendly method for producing exfoliated and coated nanoparticles that can be dispersed in a polymer. The overall objective of the proposed Phase I project is to identify the optimum SCFP conditions and compare the SCFP technology with the current technologies for polymer/clay nanocomposites. The research team will conduct a parametric study of processing conditions for two representative clays. Sufficient quantities of exfoliated and coated clay will be prepared for compounding into commercially important polymer matrices. The mechanical, rheological, thermal and barrier properties of nanocomposites prepared by the conventional and the SCFP methods will be measured as a way of benchmarking the SCFP of nanocomposites. The expected outcome of the Phase I project is to prove that SCFP technology is scalable and\r\nrepresents a profitable opportunity for manufacturing well-dispersed polymer nanocomposites compared to conventional intercalated nanocomposites.\r\n\r\nThe commercial potential for these nanocomposites is particularly high in the automotive and food packaging industries. It is estimated that the size of the polymer/clay nanocomposites market for the automotive and packaging industries will be over $250 million by 2007. The breakthrough technology being developed here will be a major factor in accelerating the growth of nanocomposites and other engineered nanomaterials.\r\nExperts agree that if the technical issues surrounding the production of nanocomposites can be overcome, nanocomposites will grow into a multibillion dollar industry.\r\n",
