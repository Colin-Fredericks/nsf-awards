 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary \r\nBrent Mishler\r\nEF 0502081\r\n \r\nProposal for the first meeting of the PIs of the Assembling the Tree of Life Program \r\n  \r\n One of the most profound ideas to emerge from biological research over the last decade is \r\nthe realization that all life, from the smallest microorganism to the largest vertebrate, is \r\nconnected through phylogenetic relatedness to form a single, vast evolutionary tree, the Tree of \r\nLife.  \r\n \r\nIn 2001, the National Science Foundation funded one round of tree of life grants in the \r\nBiocomplexity Program (GEN-EN), and then beginning in 2002 has so far funded three annual \r\nrounds of grants in its \"Assembling the Tree of Life Program,\" on topics ranging across the Tree.  \r\nAn ITR grant was also funded as part of this effort (known as CIPRES).  Now is a good time to \r\ntake stock of these projects, determine what works and what doesn't, explore new approaches for \r\ndealing with the vastly expanded data begin generated, and share ideas among the three cohorts \r\nof PIs and co-PIs.  This supplemental proposal requests funds to hold a meeting of all PIs and co-\r\nPIs of the AToL grants and CIPRES, November 19 - 21, 2004, at NSF in Washington, DC. \r\n   \r\nGoals of meeting: \r\n\r\n1- Sharing of information among the current PIs and co-PIs about common goals and  \r\nobstacles. \r\n2-The establishment of a coordinating structure across the separate AToL programs. \r\n3- Clear understandings developed between CIPRES and the AToL grants, to coordinate \r\ninformatics efforts across AToL. \r\n4-New ways found to increase linkages between AToL and other efforts (at NSF, elsewhere \r\nin the US government, or internationally) in such areas as monographic taxonomy \r\n(e.g., PEET and REVSYS), ecology (e.g., LTER and NEON), evolution & \r\ndevelopment, physiology, and genomics \r\n5- A better picture developed of where AToL should go in the future, both as individual \r\nprojects and in terms of future grants and initiatives. \r\n  \r\nIntellectual Merit.  The Tree of Life provides the framework for much of our modern \r\nunderstanding of biology because it reveals the diversity of life as well as the historical basis for \r\nsimilarity and differences among organisms. The convergence of three important developments: \r\n(1) conceptual and methodological advances in phylogenetic analysis; (2) the rise of comparative \r\ngenomics with its vast quantities of data; and (3) rapid advances in information technology and \r\nprocessing, have now made possible the construction of a robust Tree of Life depicting the \r\ngenealogical relationships of all known species. \r\n  \r\nBroader Impacts. Increased knowledge of phylogenetic relationships will improve \r\nhuman health, push back the frontiers of comparative developmental biology, meet threats to \r\nagriculture and forestry from invasive species and pests, and improve management of our natural \r\nresources.  Without substantial growth in our knowledge of the Tree of Life, it will become \r\nincreasingly  difficult and inefficient to manage, understand, and manipulate biological \r\ninformation held in numerous databases worldwide, including the burgeoning information from \r\nthe genomic sciences, to build our understanding of the relationships among them.  The proposed \r\nmeeting will greatly enhance coordination of this effort.",
