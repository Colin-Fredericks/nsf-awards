 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the fabrication of bias-magnet free on-chip Faraday rotators for ultra-small optical isolator and rotation sensor applications.  The approach is to develop photonic crystal\r\nwaveguides with magnetic nanoparticle resonators on magnetic films to enhance the polarization rotation efficiency and light speed control properties of the core components used in these technologies.  By introducing single-domain magnetic nanoparticles in the photonic bandgap the project seeks to demonstrate a high degree of coercivity, Faraday rotation enhancement and optical time delay in photonic crystal Faraday\r\nrotators while obviating the need for external magnets.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for developing ultra-small magnet-free optical isolators is the economic need to address the interconnection bottleneck to chip performance and sustain the growth of capacity in information\r\ntransmission media.  This goal has long been actively pursued by the telecommunications industry but a number of factors have prevented its realization.  Now advances in crystal growth and the development of the\r\nmagnetic photonic crystals proposed here address these factors.  At the same time, the extreme optical speed control afforded by magnetic photonic crystals addresses another critical technological question, namely, the development of ultra-small and more accurate optical gyroscopes for inertial reference systems in aircraft, satellites and projectiles.  Partnerships with industry through Dupont Photonics and Integrated Photonics, Inc. are being pursued.  Through its participation in the Michigan Tech Women in Engineering Program the proposed activity intends to involve female high-school students in science exploration.  Ties with Texas State University will be used to promote minority recruitment at Michigan Tech.\r\n\r\n",
