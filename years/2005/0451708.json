 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0451708\r\n\r\nMicrobially-mediated dehalogenation processes in the ocean contribute to the global cycling of anthropogenic and biogenic halogenated organic compounds with applications in both natural products chemistry and in bioremediation.  In this study, researchers at Rutgers University will investigate the dehalogenating bacterial populations within the sponge animal with the goal of understanding the roles and metabolic activities of the endomesohyl microbiota.  Sponges (Porifera) harbor large numbers of bacteria that can amount to 40% of the biomass of the animal, although little is know about the specific roles of the bacterial populations associated with them.  Sponges are known to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites that may function as chemical defense against predators and biofouling. Many secondary metabolites are organohalogen compounds that may constitute over 10% of the animal dry weight of some species. The abundance of halogenated compounds in sponge tissue and the high bacterial biomass implies that sponge-associated microorganisms may have the ability to metabolize the organohalide compounds. The sponge Aplysina aerophoba and related species of the order Verongida are chosen as a model system because the presence of brominated compounds is characteristic for this taxonomic group and because this species is experimentally tractable.   The overall working hypothesis is that dehalogenating bacteria form stable populations within the sponge that function in the cycling of organohalide compounds. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  This project will provide unique research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. Undergraduates will be trained through summer internship programs at Cook College and actively partake in the laboratory analysis, providing them with hands on research experience and study on a multidisciplinary topic to foster both career development and professional placement in diverse scientific fields. The project will integrate with the new Microbiology undergraduate curriculum at Rutgers University and employ students from under-represented ethnic groups through the RISE @ Rutgers program.\r\n\r\n",
