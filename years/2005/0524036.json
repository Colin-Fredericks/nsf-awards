An important problem is how to consistently enforce security constraints in a practical manner as policies and the systems themselves evolve over time.  Without care, inconsistently-viewed updates to policy could allow a principal to\r\nperform actions granted by an old policy, or worse, could allow a principal to release information or perform actions authorized by neither an old nor a new policy, but rather an illegal combination of the two.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is to develop, implement, and evaluate security infrastructure for providing strong end-to-end security guarantees in dynamic environments where policy can change.  The researchers will explore a novel synthesis of the state-of-the-art in security-typed programming languages for governing information flow; analysis for uncovering dependencies between principals, programs, and policies; and distributed protocols for coordinating policy updates.  To motivate and validate the design decisions, this infrastructure will be incorporated into the programming language Cyclone, a type-safe variant of C, and used to build and evaluate distributed file system.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
