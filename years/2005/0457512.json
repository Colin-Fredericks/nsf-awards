 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will study forbidden subgraph problems, namely the Turan and\r\nsaturation functions, as well as positional games. It is hoped that a\r\nbetter understanding of some of the key topics, such as the Turan density,\r\nexactness results, stability, jumps, and non-principality phenomena will\r\nbe achieved. The PI will work on enlarging the list of forbidden\r\nhypergraphs for which the complete solution has been obtained. Also, the\r\nmore general setting of the above problems, wherein the restriction of\r\ncontaining no forbidden subgraph is replaced by an arbitrary property\r\nexpressible in first order logic, will be considered. Another direction of\r\nresearch is to study positional games, such as Breaker-Maker, coloring,\r\nand symmetry games. In particular, the PI will continue the previous\r\ninvestigation of the first order descriptive complexity of combinatorial\r\nstructures, in which the Ehrenfeucht game is an indispensable tool.\r\n\r\nThe proposed topics of extremal combinatorics comprise many important and\r\ndifficult problems, some of which have withstood decades of attempts. This\r\narea is rich in connections to other fields, such as the probabilistic\r\nmethod, linear algebra, codes, design theory, and finite field\r\nconstructions. Also, the investigator's work on positional games and first\r\norder properties, which play an important role in combinatorics, computer\r\nscience, and logic, may potentially lead to improvements in redundancy and\r\nrepresentation algorithms for combinatorial data.\r\n",
