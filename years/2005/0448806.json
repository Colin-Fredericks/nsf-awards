 "awd_abstract_narration": "This career-development project will investigate the first generalized scheme for solving topological design problems. This approach combines aspects of optimization, graph theory, mathematical programming, artificial intelligence, and shape and graph grammars. While traditional optimization is typically used to find the best values for dimensions and parameters within an already detailed design, topology optimization can be used earlier in the design process to determine a configuration of constitutive elements. Configuring components can be tedious given the abundance and variety of component types and the pressures imposed by shorter design cycles. Such topological problems are prevalent in engineering design. Examples include the design of sheet metal components, the location and connection of roadways, and the choice and connection of processors in a chemical plant. Thus, a design synthesis method is proposed to automatically choose and configure elements.\r\n\r\nThe research activities will be integrated with an educational plan that includes a project-intensive approach to teaching machine elements, a web-based portfolio tool geared towards high-school students interested in engineering and undergraduate students, and the development of two interdisciplinary graduate courses in design. \r\nIt is expected that the broader impacts of the research will become significant when the new method is used to solve real engineering design problems. Since the method proposes to increase the representation abilities and improve the efficiency of the search process, more ambitious design problems can be addressed computationally. By developing and implementing generalized modules for solving search problems such as these, researchers will be able to implement their specific representation and evaluation code to work within the proposed framework. \r\n.\r\n",
