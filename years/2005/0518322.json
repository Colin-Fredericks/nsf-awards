 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit. The proposed work will address hypotheses regarding the\r\nbiogeochemical interactions that lead to the removal of molybdenum, uranium, and\r\nvanadium from aquatic systems and the fractionation of Mo isotopes that occurs during\r\norganic matter decomposition. Our study site, Lake Tanganyika, is an ancient rift lake that\r\nhas an oxygenated upper water column and sulfidic deep waters. The existence of\r\nsedimentary deposits underlying both these waters offers an exciting and timely opportunity\r\nto quantify changes in metal solubility and to test predictions regarding isotope fractionation\r\nassociated with metal precipitation. Our work is guided by two hypotheses that predict a\r\nclose link between metal accumulation rate and carbon cycling. These hypotheses predict\r\ndifferent behavior for Mo isotopes depending on whether or not the overlying water has\r\nsulfide present. (1) In regions where the overlying water column is absent of sulfide, we\r\nhypothesize that trace element accumulation in the sediments and Mo isotope compositions\r\nare closely coupled to the cycling of organic carbon. (2) Where sediments are bathed with\r\nsulfide-rich water, we hypothesize that trace element enrichments remain sensitive to the\r\norganic carbon cycling but Mo isotope values are invariant. Although we use these\r\nhypotheses as a guide for our research, we do expect that the targeted elements will exhibit a\r\nrange of sensitivities to organic carbon cycling and water column sulfide concentrations.\r\nBroader impacts I: Scientific value. The targeted elements already offer potential as\r\nbiogeochemical tracers, and this proposal represents an exciting opportunity to address\r\nimportant issues regarding their environmental chemistry. Molybdenum isotopes also\r\nretain potential as a tracer for the availability of oxygen and sulfide through geologic time,\r\nand this proposal will allow us to examine how the presence of water column sulfide\r\ninfluences Mo isotope behavior. Finally, the African Great Lakes harbor rich records of\r\nclimate history extending back to the Miocene. What we offer here is an opportunity to\r\ncalibrate a suite of sedimentary tracers that could ultimately provide powerful insights on\r\nbiogeochemical process, not only in Tanganyika, but in other sedimentary systems as well.\r\nBroader impacts II: Human impacts and opportunities for education. Lake\r\nTanganyika is a valuable resource to the East African people. The lake contains a\r\nsignificant fraction of the Earth's fresh water and supplies the economies of several nations\r\nwith a valuable fisheries resource. In a broad sense, this proposal offers tools for\r\naddressing questions related to how the lake's carbon dynamics have responded to past\r\nchanges in climate. As part of this proposal, McManus will be participating in the Nyanza\r\nproject during the summer of 2006. The Nyanza Project is an undergraduate/graduate field\r\nresearch program that offers opportunities to study paleoclimatology and geology in a\r\ncontinental rift cradling one of the world's oldest lakes. As a participant in the program\r\nMcManus will be engaged in training both U.S. and African students, and we plan on\r\nhaving one African student and two U.S. students working on our field research. We will\r\nalso support an OSU undergraduate during our second year of funding. Undergraduate\r\nstudents have contributed significantly to the PI's research program resulting in abstracts\r\ndelivered at major conferences, university-wide student research programs, and coauthorship\r\non two manuscripts. Our college is beginning to engage students from our university's\r\nhonors college in research and we are planning on initiating an REU program in the near\r\nterm. We anticipate having a student from one of these programs participating in the\r\nproposed research as well. Finally, this proposal will provide support for a postdoctoral\r\nresearch associate (Chris Siebert).",
