 "awd_abstract_narration": "RNA is the molecule that carries genetic information from DNA to the rest of the cell.  RNA is a copy of DNA, but unlike the typical DNA double helix, the RNA copy of each gene forms a unique three-dimensional shape that strongly influences its behavior, including how it interacts with proteins. This project uses x-ray crystallography and other biochemical tools to learn the three-dimensional structure of complexes comprised of bulge-helix-bulge RNA and protein. The bulge-helix-bulge RNA structure specifically binds to a protein enzyme called the splicing endonuclease, leading to breakage of chemical bonds at two specific locations of the RNA. This cellular process is an obligatory step required to maturate RNA molecules, much like the way movie films are edited. The goal is to delineate the chemical principles involved in the association of RNA with multiple forms of the splicing endonuclease and the subsequent endonuclease-catalyzed RNA cleavage reaction. Results obtained from this research will broaden the knowledge base of essential cellular processes and enhance classroom teaching of both biochemistry and molecular biology. This project will also provide ample research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students.",
