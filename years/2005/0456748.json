 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe proposal aims at developing new tools in low-dimensional dynamics. \r\nStudying laminations/polynomials requires a combination of techniques \r\nwhich already allowed us to show the existence of wandering gaps of \r\nlaminations and should lead to the description of dynamics of an individual \r\npolynomial, and to the description of the combinatorial analog of the \r\nboundary of the connectedness locus (i.e., the Mandelbrot set for high \r\ndegree polynomials). For the cycles of polynomials we plan to develop\r\nthe rotation theory analogous to that for interval maps, and a version \r\nof the Sharkovskii theorem. We continue developing theory of \r\nc-tent plane maps which combine expansive properties of tent maps with \r\nproperties of complex quadratic maps and should play the same role for \r\nquadratic complex maps as tent maps play on the interval. We also deal \r\nwith Milnor attractors for conformal measures of complex maps, and \r\nwork on some problems in interval dynamics.\r\n\r\nSome natural processes/maps are described by low-dimensional dynamical systems.\r\nThe project aims at solving a few problems helping describe these maps,\r\nas well as their families. Among non-invertible maps in dimensions higher\r\nthan 1 the best in terms of their properties are complex polynomials, and\r\nwe plan to study the families of their combinatorial analogs for dimensions \r\nhigher than 2, as well as individual polynomials in terms of the coexistence\r\nof their cycles (periodic processes). We also study so-called c-tent map,\r\nMilnor attractors, and some problems for map of the interval.\r\n\r\n",
