 "awd_abstract_narration": "Novel Conducting Polymer Nanocomposites with Tailored Thermal and Electrical Properties -  Designing High Performance Thermoelectric Materials\r\nAlexis Abramson, Case Western Reserve University, PI\r\n\r\nThermoelectric devices (e.g. solid state coolers) are especially attractive because they do not contain moving parts, they are environmentally benign, and they may be easily incorporated into technologies for heat removal or for energy conversion. While the use of thermoelectric devices is not widespread today, by replacing conventional semiconductors/semimetals with high performance thermoelectric nanomaterials, a revolution in energy conversion and generation and heat removal applications will undoubtedly ensue. This is because certain nanostructures exhibit enhanced thermoelectric properties; although there is a limited understanding of the phenomena involved. In view of this lack of understanding and its scientific and technological importance, this research plan will consist of a focused investigation into thermal and electrical properties of nanocomposites comprised of Bi, PbTe or Bi2Te3 nanoparticles (of variable volume fraction and nanoparticle size) embedded within a conducting polymer. The proposed program will integrate three major ingredients, i.e. synthesis, experimentation and modeling. Experiments will include Seebeck coefficient, and thermal and electrical conductivity measurements. Additionally, using molecular dynamics simulations, benchmark studies to examine how thermal transport is affected by the presence of nanoparticles in a matrix material (i.e. interfacial regions) will also be conducted. The program will involve and encourage collaborations among educators, researchers, faculty, students of all ages and the general public.\r\n\r\n",
