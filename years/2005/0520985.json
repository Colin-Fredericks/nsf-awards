Winter\r\n\r\nInstitution:  \tSouth Dakota School of Mines and Technology \r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis (rationale for decision):\r\n\r\n\tThe project will develop the infrastructure needed to foster advanced laser spectroscopy research at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and other institutions within a 400-mile radius.  A facility for performing vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy will be developed including the following objectives:  1) development of a picosecond laser pulse wavelength extension into mid-infrared range; 2) construction of a spectrometer; and 3) integration of the new instrument with a time-correlated fluorescence spectrometer.  The facility will allow the spatial dependency, time dependency, and chemical dependency of molecular structures to be determined.  Special investigations of the interface between a substrate and a bulk phase will be possible with the new spectrometer, which will be highly valuable in developing a more fundamental understanding of film fabrication, curing, and adhesion.  Both the interactions of molecular functionalities at interfaces and the mechanisms through which interface dynamics influence these interactions will be investigated.  Polymeric films used for coatings and nanoparticles will be important emphases in the research.\r\n\r\n\tThe new facility will provide new educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from physics, electrical engineering, analytical chemistry, and other disciplines.  Interdisciplinary research efforts will be strongly enhanced.  Programs are in place that provide special opportunities for women and Native American students.  An effective REU program has been established.  The instrument will become a regional facility which will be utilized by a number of institutions that are strongly interested in having this advanced capability.  \r\n",
