The significance of such studies is that one will be able to understand complex properties of different fundamental particle physics models at extremely high energies. In particular, it may help with clarifying the issues in production of cosmic strings after inflation in various models. This study may have significant implications for string theory and for gravitational wave astronomy.\r\nThe proposal will be carried out in an undergraduate women's college and will promote teaching and training in programming, data analysis and other computer skills of an underrepresented group. Even though the project is at the forefront of research in particle physics and cosmology, it has important components in which undergraduate women students can actively participate.\r\n",
