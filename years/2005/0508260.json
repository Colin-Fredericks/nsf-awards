 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the accuracy and reliability of large eddy\r\nsimulation (LES) of turbulent flows. The research on LES includes\r\nmodeling, analysis, algorithm development, numerical analysis, and\r\ncomputational testing. The recent mathematical development of approximate\r\nde-convolution models for turbulence shows this approach to be an\r\nexcellent path for developing accurate, stable and predictive LES models.\r\nThe research on finding better LES models is thus based on the approximate\r\nde-convolution framework. The research on matching algorithms to models\r\nuses an improved understanding of models and their numerical analysis to\r\ndevelop better algorithms. The investigators research studies reliability\r\nof simulations by developing analytical foundations of models and\r\nalgorithms directly from the Navier Stokes equations and by computational\r\nestimation of  model sensitivity. Training Ph.D. students properly to\r\ncontribute to this area is a large part of the proposed effort.\r\n\r\nThe accurate and efficient simulation of and extraction of reliable\r\ninformation from turbulent flows is a central computational challenge in\r\nmany important applications including global change estimation, biomedical\r\ndevice design, energy efficiency improvement, optimization of industrial\r\nprocesses, safety estimation of the new generation of nuclear reactors,\r\npollution dispersal and abatement and security issues involving dispersal\r\nof biological and chemical agents. All the above applications require\r\naccurate and reliable numerical simulations of complex flows and thus\r\nprogress in these applications needs efficient and accurate models of\r\nturbulence and fast and reliable numerical methods. This project involves\r\nthe development and testing of models for turbulent flow which can address\r\nessential difficulties in the modeling and simulation of complex flows.\r\nThis research studies the physical and mathematical foundation of the\r\nmodels as well as efficient computational methods for performing numerical\r\nsimulations of the models.  The aim of the research is to advance the\r\nefficiency, reliability and accuracy of the simulations of turbulence\r\nwhich form a core difficulty in these, and many other, applications.\r\n",
