 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Polish project will provide U.S. undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to conduct collaborative research at the joint Polish/US atomic physics and photonics laboratory at Jagiellonian University in Krakow.  Short visits will also be made to the University of Latvia in Riga.  The research activities will be in the field of modern atomic and molecular spectroscopy and applications of near-resonant nonlinear-optics systems to sensitive measurements of electromagnetic fields. The principal investigators are Dr. Dmitry Budker from the University of California - Berkeley, Wojciech Gawlik from Jagiellonian University in Krakow and Marcis Auzinsh from the University of Latvia. \r\n\r\nThis project in physics research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.  The project will also provide U.S. students with a global perspective and opportunities for professional growth through international cooperative research training, networking and mentoring.",
