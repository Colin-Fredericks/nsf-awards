Hofer and Dusa McDuff\r\n\r\nThis instructional workshop, co-sponsored by the DFG (the German\r\nequivalent of the NSF) will bring together junior and senior\r\nresearchers in the field of symplectic geometry. The field has\r\nits origins in Hamiltonian dynamics and geometric optics and has\r\nmany fundamental applications. For example, numerical methods\r\nbased on symplectic ideas (symplectic integrators) are used to\r\ncompute the orbits of satellites and other celestial\r\nbodies. Historic highlights are KAM-Theory\r\n(Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser), which leads to a proof of the\r\nstability of our solar system, and the theory of\r\ninfinite-dimensional integrable systems, which is the\r\nmathematical underpinning of fiber optics, a technology that lies\r\nat the heart of all of our communication networks. More recently,\r\nthe rapidly developing theory of pseudoholomorphic curves has led\r\nto deep new insights into the structure of three and\r\nfour-dimensional space, and to unexpected new connections between\r\ngeometry and physics.  It is a surprising fact that the same\r\nunderlying ideas apply to geometric optics, to dynamics and to\r\nthe most abstract physics (i.e. string theory).\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of this instructional workshop to describe the\r\nconstruction of symplectic field theory (SFT) in detail. SFT is a\r\ncomprehensive theory of symplectic invariants, including such\r\nwell-known theories as Floer theory, Gromov-Witten theory and\r\ncontact homology. It is constructed by measuring moduli spaces of\r\npseudoholomorphic curves. The richness of its structure comes\r\nfrom the fact that the moduli spaces have boundaries and\r\nsingularities and that infinitely many moduli spaces interact\r\nwith each other.  These structures can be captured by a novel\r\nnonlinear Fredholm theory which is distinguished by two\r\nfacts. The ambient spaces do not carry smooth structures in the\r\nusual sense and even have locally varying dimensions. However\r\nthere is a notion of transversality (or regularity), and at\r\nregular points the solution sets are smooth orbifolds with\r\nboundaries and corners.  Moreover the theory makes precise what\r\nit means for infinitely many Fredholm operators to interact with\r\neach other, which leads to a so-called \"Fredholm Theory with\r\nOperations\". This abstract Fredholm Theory is developed and\r\nillustrated by its application to SFT. The issues addressed are\r\npertinent to a variety of important problems, and one can expect\r\nthat the ideas presented at the workshop will have implications\r\nin a number of mathematical fields and their applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
