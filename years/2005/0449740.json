 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor King, of the Chemistry Department at the University of Nevada Reno, will investigate the synthesis and properties of a new class of helical and linear graphite strips.  These new materials will include a family of chiral helical polymers, graphite strips consisting of benzene rings, and helical strips containing nitrogen that will respond to changes in pH.  These studies will lead to conjugated benzenoid materials that can provide electronic communication, dimensions, and tensile strength similar to carbon nanotubes, but are well-defined tunable materials.  These materials, with their novel electronic and structural properties, will have applications in actuation, sensing, and nanoelectronics.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor King will pursue an educational strategy directed toward the development of an integrated extracurricular learning environment accessible to all students.  In addition, the PI will generate enthusiasm in students towards science by preparing a set of lectures that connect chemistry, other academic disciplines such as history and technology, and everyday experiences.  A major goal of these efforts will be the recruitment of undergraduates into research programs with an emphasis on promotion of diversity.\r\n",
