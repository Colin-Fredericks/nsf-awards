It offers a new approach to Homological\r\nMIrror Symmetry based on the ideas of collapsing Calabi-Yau manifolds\r\ndeveloped jointly by P.I. and Maxim Kontsevich.  Part of the research\r\nis devoted to an unexpected analogy between classical integrable\r\nsystems and Calabi-Yau manifolds over non-archimedean fields.  This\r\nanalogy leads to different approaches to integral affine structures:\r\none is via a kind of Liouville integrability and another one via the\r\nnotion of skeleton introduced by P.I. and Kontsevich.  The problem of\r\nreconstructing a non-archimedean space from the skeleton with\r\n(singular) integral affine structure is raised. The solution is given\r\nfor K3 surfaces.  Non-commutative version of the above analogy is also\r\na part of the project.\r\n\r\nOne of the most challenging problems of modern physics is the\r\nunification of all known forces under the roof of one\r\ntheory. Most promising candidate for such unification is String\r\nTheory.  It is far from being finished. Proposed research is\r\ndevoted to mathematical foundations of Mirror Symmetry, which is\r\none of the better understood parts of String Theory. It is also\r\ndevoted to unexpected mathematical analogies motivated by Mirror\r\nSymmetry.  Hopefully this researh will give new theoretical tools\r\nfor study microstructure of our world via better understanding of\r\nthe underlying local geometry.\r\n",
