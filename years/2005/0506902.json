 "awd_abstract_narration": "0506902\r\nYu\r\n\r\nAs engineered nanoscale building blocks for more complex structures and devices, semiconductor\r\nnanowires are particularly intriguing due to the ability to form wires from a variety of materials with\r\ncontrol over basic electronic properties and the beginnings of control over wire positioning and assembly.\r\nHowever, a broad range of issues pertaining to synthesis of semiconductor nanowire heterostructures,\r\nelucidation of nanoscale structure and electronic properties, processing into devices including contacts\r\nand controlled nanowire placement, and the optimal exploitation of unique electronic, transport, and\r\noptical behavior in nanowires for various device applications remain to be explored.\r\nThe PI proposes a comprehensive investigation of the fundamental properties of semiconductor\r\nnanowires and their application in electronic and optoelectronic devices, focusing on the following device\r\napplications: (1) nanowire-based transistor structures that will offer either (a) extremely low-power, highspeed operation for future logic and memory applications or (b) operation at extremely high frequencies and power densities for microwave and mm-wave circuit applications; and (2) nanowire photodiodes incorporated into structures for (a) generation of terahertz radiation, or (b) multispectral imaging based on integration of different nanowire structures on a single chip. All represent potentially major breakthroughs in device performance or functionality, while sharing common fundamental issues in\r\nmaterials synthesis, characterization, and processing. The proposed team encompasses experts in\r\nmaterials synthesis, advanced characterization, materials processing, and electronic and optoelectronic\r\ndevices and systems, thereby ensuring that materials and processing studies address the issues most\r\nrelevant to the device and system applications, and that device designs exploit the full range of\r\npossibilities provided by advanced materials synthesis and processing.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Fundamental issues in the physics of nanoscale systems and the integration of\r\nnanostructures into realistic, high-performance devices will be addressed by a highly accomplished,\r\nmultidisciplinary team with an established, extensive record of successful collaboration. Research topics\r\nof interest will include synthesis of novel semiconductor nanowire heterostructures; nanoscale electronic\r\nstructure and carrier transport behavior in nanowires; metallurgical, processing, and quantumconductance\r\nissues in contact formation; design of advanced nanowire-based transistor structures for\r\ncomputation and communications; and nanowire photodiodes for terahertz signal generation and\r\nmultispectral imaging. A strong educational component is envisioned, entailing the development of new\r\ngraduate course sequences aimed at a multidisciplinary student audience, a freshman seminar series,\r\nmentoring of undergraduate students, and interaction with secondary school students via the UCSD\r\nPreuss School, a Charter School serving high-ability but socioeconomically disadvantaged secondary\r\nschool students in the San Diego Unified School District.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed program will yield new capabilities and insights in nanostructure\r\nsynthesis, the physics of nanoscale structures, processing and assembly of nanostructures, and their\r\napplicability in realistic devices and systems that will have relevance not only for the device applications\r\ntargeted here, but for research on semiconductor nanowires specifically, and solid-state nanostructures\r\nmore generally. The potential areas of impact include future logic and memory systems, high-speed\r\ncircuits for communications, and terahertz to infrared/visible imaging. Graduate students and\r\npostdoctoral researchers will be educated in a vertically integrated, multidisciplinary setting, with major\r\nnew experimental facilities associated with Cal(IT)2 at UCSD providing new capability as well as a\r\nunifying umbrella for this and related activities. The development of graduate-level course sequences\r\nwill further facilitate training of students in important emerging areas of science and technology, while\r\nthe proposed courses and mentoring/outreach programs at the undergraduate and secondary school levels\r\nwill help both to educate nontechnical students about scientific and technological issues and to encourage\r\nstudents to pursue advanced education and careers in science and engineering.\r\n\r\n",
