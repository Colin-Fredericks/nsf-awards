 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most metallic and ceramic materials used in aircraft, automobiles, and devices such as computers are polycrystalline.  In other words, they are made up of many microscopic crystals held together by grain boundaries.  It is widely recognized that the types of grain boundaries in a material and the manner in which they are connected affect a wide range of properties and, ultimately, a material's performance and lifetime.  In most cases, however, our ability to predict and control the materials properties that are governed by the grain boundaries is severely limited by our incomplete knowledge of the network structure and the behavior of individual interfaces.  The CMU MRSEC's goals are to understand the origins of the quantifiable characteristics of polycrystals that arise during processing, to develop strategies for influencing these characteristics in predictable ways, and to define microstructural metrics that can be directly related to macroscopic properties and performance. The Center's tools and findings will have applications in a range of practical materials processing applications and, to insure rapid implementation, we work collaboratively with government, industry, and international laboratories. The Center's major educational goals are to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in materials research, raise awareness of materials science and engineering among high school students through the curricula used in chemistry, physics, and earth science classes, provide meaningful research experiences for undergraduates, and support interdisciplinary graduate education. \r\n\r\n",

Although the physical and chemical mechanisms that govern different types of performance, such as electrical resistance and yield strength, are completely different, a common requirement for establishing such links is an accurate and quantitative description of the structure.

The extensive data sets acquired in this research were the first to categorize grain boundaries according to all five crystallographic parameters and this led to theories for the mechanistic origins of the grain boundary character distribution and its influence on macroscopic response.\n\nThe principal technical outcomes of the Center can be classified into two categories: the scientific findings and the development of tools.  Among the tools developed by the CMU MRSEC, the most impactful have been those used to create three-dimensional orientation maps of these polycrystals.  These findings and tools have been a major driving force in several new paradigms in the modern materials science of microstructures.  The first concerns our understanding of grain boundaries.  Our research has shown that the long held model for identifying the most important grain boundaries in a polycrystal, and lattice misorientation based models in general, are exceptionally poor indicators of the most common grain boundaries.  The grain boundary plane orientation is far more important.  A second new paradigm is that three-dimensional microstructure characterization is necessary, possible, and now wide-spread in materials research.  The first 3D study of a microstructure with comprehensive crystallographic information was executed by the CMU MRSEC.  The methods have improved greatly since that achievement and this is now standard practice.  When this project started, there were only three groups in the world pursuing 3D approaches to microstructure characterization.  There is now an international conference every two years that attracts hundreds of researchers from around the world.  A third new paradigm is that simulations of microstructures must and can include all of the crystallographic complexity of the true microstructure.  Not only have computational methods expanded in capability to include this information, but our work provided experimental data based that could be used as a basis for simulations.\n\nThe Center\u00c6s educational activities have had broad impact at levels ranging from high schools to our peer institutions.
