New knowledge generated in this project about\r\nphysical and chemical ways to stabilize polymer films at surfaces will be a significant\r\ncontribution to materials and polymer science. Specifically, the project will provide a wealth of\r\ninformation on issues pertaining to molecular design of building block for responsive polymer\r\nself-assembly, derivatization of PEMs into active surface coatings and potential capabilities\r\nin PEM-based regulation of surface adhesion and absorption properties.\r\nOur approach will be based on a combination of molecular engineering and synthesis of\r\npolymeric 'building blocks' of PEMs with the chemical composition necessary for further\r\ntransformation of PEMs into an absorbing film. We will explore several routes of producing\r\nsurface-attached active absorbing films using electrostatic or hydrogen-bonded polymer\r\nmultilayers as a starting material. The first route will be based on the dissociation of components\r\nof electrostatically assembled multilayers at high concentrations of small ions combined with\r\nselective 'salting-out' of one of the film components. In another scenario, we will explore\r\nchemical crosslinking of hydrogen-bonding multilayers as a means to produce surface-attached\r\nhydrogels. One-component hydrogels of polycarboxylic acids will be produced by selective\r\ncrosslinking of self-assembled polycarboxylic acids and further release of hydrogen-bonded\r\npolymers from the crosslinked polyacid matrix. Two-component hydrogels will be obtained by\r\nreacting end-functionalized hydrogen-bonding polymers with carboxylic groups of selfassembled\r\npolyacid. In the latter type of absorbing films, response and absorbing properties will\r\nbe modulated through intermolecular adhesion between hydrogen-bonded polymer chains.\r\nSelective monitoring of film composition, ionization of functional groups and quantification of\r\ncharge balance will be done using in situ ATR-FTIR. The data will be correlated with the results\r\nof film swelling as measured with in situ ellipsometry and in situ AFM. The question of how\r\ninterpolymer interactions respond to environmental stimuli, and how they are translated into\r\nchanges in film density and absorption properties will be addressed.\r\nNON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION                                                                                                                             The use of produced films as re-loadable matrices that could reversibly and\r\ncontrollably absorb and desorb macromolecules and proteins from response to environmental\r\nstimuli, specifically valuable for separation, concentration, and controlled release of chemicals\r\nand proteins in environments with dominating effects of surfaces such as in a microfluidic\r\nchannel. Results of proposed research will be made available to a broad scientific audience\r\nthrough conference presentations, invited talks given by the PI of this project, poster and oral\r\npresentations of graduate students, and archival literature.\r\nThe educational impact includes building a stronger interdisciplinary polymer program at\r\nStevens that will provide better training for students. The results of the proposed research will be\r\nincluded into recently developed advanced polymer courses, such as Polymers at Solid-Liquid\r\nInterfaces, and other core laboratory courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels.\r\nParticipation of women in advanced research will be enhanced also through support of two\r\nfemale graduate students. Finally, economically disadvantaged high school students will be\r\ngiven an opportunity to be exposed to this research due to activities our group sustains in the\r\nACS SEED program.",
