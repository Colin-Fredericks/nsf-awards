 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, researchers are discussing and examining the influence of interpersonal interactions on the development of individuals. Interpersonal interactions can be roughly divided into those occurring within dyadic contexts (e.g., parent-child, romantic couples, peer-to-peer, etc.) and those occurring in group contexts (families, cliques, groups, etc).  Supported by NSF funds, Dr. Little and Dr. Card will organize a conference that will bring together developmentalists, quantitative scholars, and statisticians to address (a) how best to conceptualize the role of interactive processes in development and (b) how to appropriately analyze the interdependence that is inherent in dyadic and group data. Each conference participant will consider one or more methodological concern and relate each to one or more developmental application. Approximately twenty scholars will participate as presenters or discussants. The open 2-day conference format, which will be held at the University of Kansas in spring of 2006, allows significant cross-fertilization of ideas so that each presenter's work will be refined and extended as a result of their direct participation in the conference. The final product will be an edited volume to consist of approximately 20 chapters and a supporting web site.\r\n\r\nBy pairing specific techniques with relevant applications in developmental science, the broader impacts of this conference and resulting edited book will be to: (a) advance conceptualizations of developmental processes to explicitly consider their occurrence within dyadic and group contexts, (b) increase awareness among developmental researchers of the analytic approaches that are needed for analyzing the interdependence that is inherent in dyadic and group data, and (c) extend these analytic methods to specifically address the needs of developmental science (e.g., longitudinal extensions).\r\n",
