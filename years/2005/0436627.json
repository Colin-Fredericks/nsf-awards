The workshop, which is being organized by Drs. Timothy Keener and Mingming Lu of the University of Cincinnati, together with Dr. Humberto Bravo of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), will be held in Merida, Mexico in November, 2005. The workshop will discuss the problems facing these world heritage sites and how researchers with expertise in air quality science and engineering can bring their expertise to focus on their preservation.  \r\n\r\nThe Mayans created colorful murals and many other beautiful works of art that still exist as part of their striking ruins.  However, these are now endangered due to the incursions of air pollution.  At some sites, paint is flaking off extensively and stucco surfaces and stone inscriptions are corroding and crumbling.  This devastation is attributed to acid rain emanating from electrical, industrial and petrochemical plants located around the Gulf of Mexico and include sources from the United States and even as far away as Venezuela.  The meteorological conditions controlling the transport and transformation of air pollutants to and around this region are complex and add to the difficulty of understanding the sources of the problems.  The comprehensive discussion of pollutant emission, transport, deposition and damage mechanisms will result in better understanding of the integrated impacts of industrial emissions, meteorological and geological conditions, and the local socio-economic patterns on the art work. The integration of social economic factors will lead to better success of future research and adaptation by the local government. In the long run, the workshop will help better policy making in balancing industrial development and preservation of historical sites. Workshop results will be widely disseminated, and may be applicable to the other parts of the world experiencing similar environmental challenges. \r\n",
