 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on developing methods to improve the power and performance of an exciting new diode-pumped solid-state laser crystal.  Laser crystals are superior to any other candidate material in the emerging and rapidly developing field of ultrafast lasers by their ability to generate high power femtosecond pulses.  The proposed program will involve crystal growth in order to select the material with optimum operating performance and power handling capabilities.  Issues to be addressed include the optimum concentration in the crystals, the uniformity of dopant incorporation during crystal growth, the preferred orientation of the crystal for laser rod fabrication, and methods to improve the quality and reliability of these crystals.   \r\n\r\nThe first commercial ultrafast laser system based on this technology was recently introduced.\r\n In order to ensure the rapid development of this new technology and the myriad applications in material processing, medicine and basic science it will undoubtedly enable, considerable development effort is required.  This research effort is directed toward bringing the material system on which the laser is based to a point of performance, reliability and producability necessary for the commercial success of this new device.  \r\n \r\n",
