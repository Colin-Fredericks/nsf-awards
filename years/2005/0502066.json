 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will focus on mechanisms by which plants generate and use lipid-mediated signals. Major goals of this conference are to advance further understanding of the plant lipid-mediated signaling networks and to integrate them into the nexus of plant signaling, to discuss and assess current and future methods for studying lipid signaling and to provide training and networking opportunities for young investigators, students and postdocs. \"Connections will be built\" between signaling pathways, upstream and downstream signaling events and researchers. To this end, travel awards will be made to students or postdocs.  There has not been a conference on plant lipid-mediated signaling since 1989. This conference is timely and will have a positive and lasting impact on the field.   A consortium of support for the conference is being organized and it is anticipated that the National Science Foundation will provide the cornerstone by funding travel for students.",
