 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical Engineering (55)\r\n\r\nThe investigators are developing a laboratory that unifies the areas of communications, digital design, signal processing, and VLSI using Rowan University's concept of an \"integrated lab experience\".  The project involves an implementation that spans multiple semesters by developing experiments that may be applied to more than one course and by creating labs where students design and develop a \"product\", and pass this \"product\" on to students in other related courses.  In order to achieve the overall objective, the investigators are creating seven experiments leading to \"products\" that will be a part of the proposed open laboratory. These efforts are not only producing an unusual set of laboratory manuals and \"canned\" experiments for other universities to adapt to their needs, but also a new paradigm that future programs can adopt.  The proposed open laboratory will provide an opportunity to (1) design sophisticated systems/experiments that are impossible to develop in a single course; (2) expose students to real world design problems in the classroom; (3) improve student teamwork via inter-disciplinary group laboratory projects; and (4) improve communication skills through required product documentation.  All experiment descriptions, integration issues, assessment findings, and other outcomes are being disseminated using a dedicated project web site and publications in the engineering education literature. The investigators also are showcasing the open-lab \"products\" and experimental demos in various outreach activities for elementary and secondary students. \r\n",
