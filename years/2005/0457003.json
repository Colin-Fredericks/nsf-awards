 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary for George Andrews\r\n\r\n\t   The first topic covered in this propsoal is Partitions and\r\n\tProbability. Here it is proposed to ground the study begun by\r\n\tHolroyd, Liggett, and Romik in the theory of partitions with\r\n\tthe hope of getting (1) better asymptotics, (2) broader\r\n\tapplications, and (3) further connections with Ramanujan's\r\n\tmock theta functions.  The second topic, Entire Functions\r\n\tand the Rogers-Ramanujan Identities, examines the further\r\n\timplications that arise from two truly amazing formulas\r\n\tthat lay buried in Ramanujan's Lost Notebook.  The third\r\n\ttopic, Engel Transformations, builds upon some \r\n\tof the original amazing expansion theorems due to A. and\r\n\tJ. Knopfmacher.  This algorithm should be useful in any\r\n\tmathematical subject (including statistical mechanics)\r\n\twhere q-series expansions play a substantial role.  The\r\n\tfourth topic, The Okada Conjecture, is one that has been open\r\n\tfor many years.  Recently in joint work with Paule and Schneider,\r\n\tthe PI gave a new proof of the q = 1 case of this conjecture.\r\n\tThis new proof clearly suggests that one should be able to \r\n\textend it to general q.  The fifth topic, Ramanujan and\r\n\tPartial Fractions, was suggested by prior attempts to better\r\n\tunderstand some of the more recondite formulas in Ramanujan's\r\n\tLost Notebook. Great progress has been made in improving\r\n\tprevious work; it is hoped that these methods may be further developed\r\n\tto elucidate a general theory of mock theta functions.  Section\r\n\t6, the final section, concerns the intersection of the PI's research\r\n\twith his efforts to improve teacher education.  Put succinctly,\r\n\tit is clear that the theory of compositions (ordered partitions)\r\n\tcould play a much more substantial role in primary and \r\n\tsecondary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n           This project is devoted to problems in partitions and q-series,\r\n        especially ones that simultaneously (1) advance the central\r\n        theory of this branch of mathematics and (2) have substantial\r\n        potential for application in other branches of mathematics and\r\n        mathematical sciences. The section on partitions and probability\r\n       especially epitomizes this philosophy.  Applications of this\r\n       topic have already been made to cellular automata.  The work\r\n       on Engel Transformations studies an algorithm wherein there are\r\n       potential applications to problems in statistical physics. Work on\r\n       entire functions, partial fractions  and the Okada conejcture\r\n       should develop methods with substantial applications beyond the\r\n       current focus. Section 6, the final section, concerns the\r\n       intersection of research with efforts to improve teacher education.  \r\n      The theory of compositions (ordered partitions) could well \r\n      play a useful auxiliary role in primary and secondary\r\n      education.\r\n\r\n",
