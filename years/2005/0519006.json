These improvements are intended to enhance the faculty-student research program in asteroid photometry at UW-Eau Claire. The goal of this research program is to measure and analyze the light curves of understudied asteroids. Although tens of thousands of asteroids are known, few have well-known rotation properties. These light curves can be used to directly determine the rotation periods of the asteroids, and, when combined with other measurements, can be used to determine the pole orientations of the asteroids.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to its intrinsic scientific value, this research project will provide research exposure for undergraduate students at the UW-Eau Claire. Undergraduate students will work with faculty throughout the project. They will acquire a broad range of research skills as they choose the objects to be studied, plan the observing runs, operate the telescope in camera, and troubleshoot any problems that arise.  They will acquire, analyze, and interpret the data. Finally, they will present their results to their peers and the broader scientific community.  Hobbs Observatory is a multi-use facility. The observatory's telescopes, including the 0.6 meter instrument, are currently used for free public observing, college and K-12 class work, amateur astronomy, and citizen science projects, in addition to university research projects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
