 "awd_abstract_narration": "To a large extent, the history of life is a history of symbiotic interactions, where organisms exist together, either competing or collaborating. The extent to which selfish or cooperative behavior dominates a symbiosis depends on whether the interacting partners' genes are co-transmitted from generation to generation. If strict co-inheritance does not occur, cheating and other forms of virulent behavior can evolve. Using the well-studied intimately co-evolved attine ant-fungal cultivar symbiosis, this study will examine conflict and cooperation between the ants and the cultivar fungi from the perspective of mutualistic and antagonistic evolution theory. In particular, this study will focus on the outcome of the ancient conflict over cultivar escape through fruiting.\r\n\r\nResults will be broadly applicable to other symbioses, such as evolution of disease virulence. Additionally, as fungus-gardening ants (the leaf-cutters) are the most important plant pests of the Neotropics, the economic consequences of the research permit collaboration with a Brazilian research group. This collaboration will foster international academic exchange, building a framework for field research and lab visits. Students from both the US and Brazil will participate in the project, receiving training and opportunities for conducting independent research. These international activities are supported by funds from the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
