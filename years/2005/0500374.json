 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe super representation theory is traditionally regarded as fairly different from \r\nthe usual one for Lie algebras largely because the Weyl group for a simple Lie \r\nsuperalgebra does not suffice to control the structures of the irreducible representations. \r\nThe PI intends to formulate and establish a new direct link, termed as super duality, \r\nbetween the representation theories of Lie superalgebras and of Lie algebras. The \r\nsuper duality asserts certain equivalences of module categories in a suitable infinite limit \r\nand the identification of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for Lie superalgebras and Lie\r\nalgebras. A main algebraic tool is a Fock space formulation of the Kazhdan-Lusztig \r\ntheory. The super duality is expected to provide a new approach toward the \r\nKazhdan-Lusztig type conjectures on irreducible characters for module categories over \r\nsimple Lie superalgebras of various types and for module categories over quantum \r\nsupergroups at roots of unity.\r\n\r\nThere are different manifestations of symmetries in nature, which one can find in, \r\nfor example, a circle, a sphere, or one of the five regular polyhedra, and others. \r\nThe mathematical language used to describe symmetries often involves the concept \r\nof groups or their infinitesimal counterparts such as Lie algebras. Representation \r\nTheory is a way of studying the groups and Lie algebras by expressing them in \r\nterms of matrices. On the other hand, different symmetries can be related to each \r\nother. In search for a unified theory of everything, physicists have proposed\r\nString Theory as a candidate theory. Supersymmetry adds another invisible \r\ndimension to such considerations and the study of Lie superalgebras is crucial to \r\nunderstanding the supersymmetry. Our project on Super Duality can be regarded \r\nas providing a precise and new way of relating supersymmetry to symmetry in the \r\nusual sense. This helps to provide a convincing evidence supporting the idea of \r\nsupersymmetry and may have applications to String Theory.\r\n\r\n",
