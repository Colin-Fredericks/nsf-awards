S. students through an eight-week international research and educational experience in Uganda.  Such international engagement of students is increasing important because although the world has become more interdependent and technologically linked, the number of U. S. science and engineering undergraduate students participating in international experiences has remained  troublingly small. In each of the three years of this award, four U. S. and two Ugandan students will work in teams on research projects associated with ongoing collaborative research between Dr. William Kisaalita (U.S.) and Dr. Muyanja (Uganda). The overarching theme of these projects is to characterize native mineral materials with respect to physical and transport properties. For example, students will characterize native zeolites for use in low cost coolers with applications ranging from vaccine protection to milk preservation in rural areas where there is no access to electricity. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide students with a sound introduction to the principles and practice of engineering research, thus enhancing their ability to play leadership roles in creating appropriately complex or simple systems in both developed or developing countries.  In the near term, the results from the students' research will contribute to developing products, devices, and processes that can add economic value to the host country in ways that also benefit the U.S. economy. The project will strengthen collaboration between the U. S. and Africa by building scientific and personal relationships; such relationships are the foundation for a better global community.\r\n \r\n  \r\n",
