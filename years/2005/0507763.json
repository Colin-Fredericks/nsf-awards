 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST 0507763\r\nJewitt\r\n\r\nDr. David Jewitt and Dr. Ralf Kaiser at the University of Hawaii will conduct a concerted, two-pronged investigation of the surface properties of Kuiper belt objects and related bodies that capitalizes on their access to world-class astronomical and laboratory facilities.\r\n\r\nThe research team will conduct a systematic investigation of the reflection spectra of Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) and related bodies in order to assess the volatile contents of these objects. Particular attention will be given to the distribution of crystalline water ice and ammonia hydrate on KBOs. Both species are expected to be short-lived in the presence of ionizing radiation and energetic particles, as are expected in the Kuiper Belt. The astronomical data will be used to drive a parallel program of laboratory work in which the effects of the space environment on the KBOs will be quantitatively examined. The specific goals are 1) to obtain a set of high quality near infrared \r\nspectra of KBOs and related objects to study the distribution of crystalline ice, ammonia hydrate and other volatile species and 2) to experimentally estimate the timescales for back-conversion of crystalline ice to amorphous ice and for the destruction of ammonia hydrate by energetic particles. The larger objective is to see if astronomically detectable species can be used to estimate the effective ages of the optically active surfaces of the KBOs. \r\n\r\nThis is an interdisciplinary study that will exploit both the world's largest telescopes and a state-of-the-art ultra-high vacuum chamber simulator to investigate the prevalence and stability of crystalline ice and ammonia hydrate in the outer solar system. The research team includes experts in both areas, and they hope to bridge the gap that sometimes divides the disciplines, with benefits for\r\nthe education of the graduate student and postdoc populations in both Physics & Astronomy and Chemistry.  Dr. Jewitt is active in public education in astronomy and physics through speaking to community and educator groups and through TV, radio, newspaper and popular magazine interviews and articles. The postdoc involved with this project will have a unique opportunity\r\nto learn leading-edge techniques of both observational astronomy and laboratory astrophysics. The  reduced spectra and a commentary will be made available to the public and the astronomical community through the Kuiper Belt Home Page (a www site that receives more than 300 hits per day) and all results will be published in a timely fashion through peer-reviewed journals.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
