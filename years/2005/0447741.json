 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: E-textile-based Wearable Computing for Sensing User Motions\r\n\r\nProject Abstract \r\n\r\nIdeally, a wearable computer should always be available to the user,\r\nshould not interfere with the user's movements, and should be invisible\r\nto those around the user.  Electronic textiles (e-textiles), an emerging\r\ntechnology that blends fabric with electronics, has the potential to\r\nmeet these goals. Interconnections and components are an intrinsic\r\npart of the cloth, enabling the creation of \"smart\" garments that have\r\nthe appearance and feel of normal clothing while providing sensing and\r\ncomputing capabilities. This NSF CAREER project addresses the research issues involved\r\nin designing e-textile garments that can sense their own shapes and\r\nthe positions of their sensing/processing elements. The major\r\noutcome of the research component of this project will be a complete\r\ne-textiles design framework that will permit e-textiles to function\r\nrobustly across a wide range of applications and the full spectrum of\r\nthe user population.  The education component of this project integrates\r\ne-textiles research into the classroom and develops novel educational\r\nmodules for improving the debugging skills of students based upon Kolb's\r\nlearning cycle and Felder's learning styles.  The project's intellectual \r\nmerit is that it enables e-textiles to reach their full potential\r\nfor wearable computing, creating a better platform for existing wearable\r\ncomputing applications and being an enabling platform for applications\r\nthat are not feasible with existing technology. The project also has\r\nsignificant broader impact, by enabling novel applications in the areas\r\nof health care for the elderly and people with disabilities, industry,\r\nemergency response, and untethered motion tracking. The collaborative\r\nnature of the project provides students with multidisciplinary research\r\nexperience, enhancing their contributions to the future growth of the\r\nfield.  Finally, it is expected that e-textiles can help reinvigorate\r\nthe Virginia textile industry.\r\n",
