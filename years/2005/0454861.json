 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the development of miniaturized microbial fuel cells at the University of Minnesota.  These fuel cells will use recently discovered anaerobic bacteria such as Geobacter that can directly transmit electrons to electrode surfaces.  The goal is to develop electrical devices that can utilize these bacteria as catalysts and sensors.  A new approach will be demonstrated using silicon-based microfabrication techniques and electrodes directly printed on membranes.  The planned activity will fabricate and test a series of designs intended to fit in a multiwell plate format, adaptable to other high-throughput platforms.  An additional goal is to fabricate microscale flow-through reactors that will create a mechanism for exposing very small populations of bacteria on electrode surfaces to conditions of constant laminar flow for continuous sensing.  These devices will reduce instrument size by two orders of magnitude over typical systems, and they will provide researchers with tools to make sensitive, parallel observations related to extracellular electron transport, conversion of organic compounds into electrical signals by bacteria, and processes related to corrosion and metal reduction.  These proposed instruments will measure electricity production by bacteria in a device designed to utilize membrane-based electrodes similar to those optimized for state-of-the-art chemical fuel cells. They will also provide a microfabricated interface allowing direct conversion of an organic compound into an electrical signal using electricity producing organisms.  \r\n\r\nThe heart of any device converting a chemical into an electrical signal is the catalyst.  Examples include fuel cells, which convert hydrogen or liquid methanol fuels directly into electricity, or 'breathalyzers' which use catalysts to convert alcohol into electricity for sensing.   Typically, precious metals such as platinum are used as catalysts, and they convert simple gasses or chemicals into electricity.  It has recently been discovered that some bacteria in underground aquifers and other oxygen-poor habitats produce energy by transferring electrons to iron minerals present in the sediment.  This process of 'iron reduction' essentially involves conversion of organic chemical compounds in the sediment into electrical signals.  When these iron-reducing bacteria are grown on electrodes, a full range of sugars, fatty acids, and aromatic compounds can be converted into electricity, suggesting a variety of possible electrical power-generating or sensing devices.  Research into this phenomenon is hampered by a lack of devices for studying this unique process, and we propose to use microfabrication and membrane printing techniques to build small microbial \"fuel cells\" from silicon and conductive materials.  By combining our new understanding of the microbiology of this process with advances in electrical engineering and materials science, we will develop instruments to allow simultaneous study of multiple cultures and conditions, and make available the first tools for study of these bacteria as catalysts in miniaturized sensors and other devices. \r\n",
