 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will explore theoretical properties of randomization \r\nprocedures with applications to sequential randomized clinical trials. \r\nThe first problem the investigator will address is sequential monitoring \r\nof randomization tests following restricted randomization, which will \r\nrequire extensive use of techniques in sequential analysis and \r\nnonparametric statistical inference.  The second problem the investigator \r\nwill address is the development and properties of response-adaptive \r\nrandomization procedures, including procedures designed for continuous \r\nresponses, and survival responses with censoring.  The third problem the \r\ninvestigator will address is certain theoretical properties of \r\ncovariate-adaptive randomization procedures, particularly \r\nrandomization-based inference procedures following covariate-adaptive \r\nrandomization.  The ultimate goal of the investigator is to complete a \r\nsystmeatic study of randomization, its properties, and its relevance in \r\nclinical trials.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will explore properties of randomization, the hallmark of \r\na well-designed clinical trial.  The first problem the investigator will \r\naddress is sequential monitoring of randomized clinical trials, which \r\nrefers to making early decisions about the effectiveness of new therapies \r\nwhen compelling evidence is accrued at an interim point in a clinical \r\ntrial.  There are currently no sequential monitoring techniques available \r\nthat allow the randomization itself to be incorporate into these \r\ndecisions, and hence current methodology completely ignores the design of \r\nthe trial in the analysis.  The second problem the investigator will \r\naddress is response-adaptive randomization, and he will develop new \r\nprocedures for clinical trials where the outcome is time-to-event or some \r\ncontinous measure, e.g. cholesterol level.  These response-adaptive \r\nprocedures are attractive from an ethical point of view, because they seek \r\nto maximize power to detect a relevant clinical outcome, while \r\nsimultaneously minimizing the expected number of treatment failures \r\npatients will experience while participating in the clinical trial.  The \r\nthird problem the investigator will address is proporties of \r\ncovariate-adaptive randomization procedures, which is designed to minimize \r\ntial imbalances in important confounding variables that might bias results \r\nof the clinical trial.  Each of these topics is relevant to today's \r\nclinical trials in the drug development phase of new pharmaceuticals.\r\n",
