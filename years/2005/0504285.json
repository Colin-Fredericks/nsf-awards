 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of the existence of a constant scalar curvature Kahler \r\nmetric in a given Kahler class is an important and difficult problem \r\nand has provided the motivation for much current research in Kahler \r\ngeometry.  For the special case of Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano \r\nmanifolds, existence was conjectured by Yau to be equivalent to the \r\nstability of the manifold in the sense of geometric invariant theory.  \r\nThe principal investigator proposes to study three parabolic flows of \r\nKahler potentials which arise naturally in this context.  The first is \r\nthe J-flow, which is the gradient flow of a functional appearing in \r\nChen's formula for the Mabuchi energy.  The study of the J-flow has led \r\nto significant advances in understanding the lower boundedness and \r\nasymptotics of the Mabuchi energy.  The second is the Kahler-Ricci \r\nflow.  Its behavior in the Fano case is not yet well understood, and it \r\nis proposed that the method of multiplier ideal sheaves may capture the \r\nnecessary information about its singularities to be able to provide a \r\nlink with stability.   The third is the Calabi flow.  It is a fourth \r\norder parabolic PDE about which little is known in general.  The \r\nprincipal investigator intends to study the problem of long time \r\nexistence of this flow.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn important problem in geometry and physics is whether a given space \r\nhas a special notion of distance.  Take, for example, the two \r\ndimensional sphere - the surface of a ball.  With our usual sense of \r\ndistance, this space is curved in the same way at every point.  We say \r\nthat the sphere admits a 'metric of constant curvature'. Not all spaces \r\nadmit such metrics, and it is an interesting and deep problem to find \r\nconditions under which they do.   A natural and beautiful approach to \r\nthis problem is the parabolic, or 'heat flow' method.  The idea is \r\nsimple.  The distribution of heat in an object (not subject to outside \r\nsources) will flow in time, becoming more even and finally constant - \r\nno matter what the initial distribution looked like.  In a similar way, \r\nif we start with an arbitrary notion of distance on a space, then we \r\ncan apply a natural 'heat flow' and hope to prove, under the right \r\nconditions, that we obtain convergence to a metric of constant \r\ncurvature, or some other special metric, as time evolves.  If no such \r\nmetrics exist, then we expect the flow to go wrong - to develop \r\nsingularities. The PI intends to study the question of convergence and \r\nsingularities of three such parabolic flows corresponding to different \r\ntypes of special metrics.\r\n\r\n",
