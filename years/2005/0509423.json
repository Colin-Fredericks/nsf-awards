 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wave motion is one of the most common phenomena of the\r\nnatural world and a subject central to Applied Mathematics.  This\r\nproposal focuses on two areas in fluid mechanics: internal gravity\r\nwaves, as encountered in the ocean and atmosphere, and waves at\r\nthe interface between two phases dominated by a large viscosity\r\ncontrast, a setup that occurs in the lung airways.  While situated\r\nfar apart in their relevant scales, these two areas nonetheless\r\nshare common mathematical tools for devising models able to\r\ndescribe and predict their main dynamical behaviors.  Within the\r\nfirst theme, a long term goal is to provide a model of internal\r\nwaves in layered stratification that correctly accounts for\r\ndispersion and high nonlinearity.  The motivation comes from the\r\ngrowing body of evidence, experimental and in the field, that\r\nlarge amplitude internal waves are easily attainable and a common\r\nfeature of ocean dynamics.  The focus of the second theme is to\r\ndevelop the proper model capable of detecting and following the\r\nevolution of instabilities in a class of core-annular flows in a\r\npipe.  The motivation comes from understanding the hydrodynamic\r\nfeedback mechanisms that govern mucus-air flow coupling in\r\nrespiratory systems.  Careful asymptotic analysis taking advantage\r\nof the long wave nature of the dynamics can be brought to bear on\r\nboth problems, with emphasis on strongly nonlinear motion.  Field\r\nand laboratory data test the resulting models and their predictive\r\ncapabilities. \r\n\r\n     The overall aim of this project is to isolate, understand,\r\nand integrate into working models particular mechanisms of wave\r\ndynamics that experiments, field observations, and analysis\r\nsuggest are important for an accurate mathematical description of\r\ncertain fluid flow problems.  The outcome of this approach informs\r\nand benchmarks experiments as well as more elaborate numerical\r\nsimulations.  The understanding made available through the new\r\nmodels has an impact in environmental and health sciences, e.g.,\r\nby enhancing the accuracy of simulations of nutrient and pollutant\r\ndispersion in the environment, or, for the second part of this\r\nproject, by helping devise improved strategies of drug delivery in\r\nhuman airways.",
