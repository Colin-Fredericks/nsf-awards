 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on novel solid compounds composed of elements of boron (B), carbon (C), and nitrogen (N), a class of compounds commonly referred to as frontier carbon materials. Inaddition to investigating how to control the arrangement of B, C, and N atoms during the synthesis materials such as boron nitride, carbon nitride and boron-carbon nitride, the functions of kinetic energy of the growth species, potential energy of the growth species, and the role of catalysts in controlling bonding between B, C, and N atoms will be explored. The goal is to create new thin films and nanostructures of boron nitride, carbon nitride and boron-carbon-nitride with desired physical properties. The project will stimulate cross-disciplinary research collaborations within the campus and in other universities and national laboratories. The related education components will stimulate the interest of teenagers in the physical sciences through undergraduate education, laboratory tours, summer youth exploration, summer research programs, and will include a new graduate course and a minor in nanoscale science and technology. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide training opportunities to new researchers who will then be able to advance the science of novel carbon materials as thin films and nanostructures with desired physical properties. The project will stimulate cross-disciplinary research collaborations within the campus and in other universities and national laboratories. The related education components will stimulate the interest of teenagers in the physical sciences through undergraduate education, laboratory tours, summer youth exploration, summer research programs, a new graduate course and a minor in nanoscale science and technology.  Frontier carbon materials are of high interest to US industry. Students trained in these and related areas are typically highly competitive in the job market.  \r\n",
