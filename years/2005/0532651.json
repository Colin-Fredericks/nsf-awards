 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kentucky Information Technology Center, supported by the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS), is a regional center of all of the community and technical colleges in the Commonwealth.  The goals include enhancing the expertise of high school, community and technical college IT faculty through professional development workshops, both physical and virtual; increasing the support and participation of business, government and industry; and increasing the enrollment and completion rate of students.  The KITCenter builds upon practices developed under prior NSF support, to educate highly skilled educators, practitioners and technicians capable of adapting to changes in curriculum, delivery methods and market demands.  Strong connections are made to the regional industry.  Curricula at the secondary and two-year college level are responsive and adaptive to the IT needs of the workforce so that the graduates obtain the IT skills and understandings needed by technician workforce.  Faculty in high schools and two-year colleges obtain the expertise to provide that education.  The Center provides instruction in emerging technologies such as health informatics, security and GIS.  The support of the KCTCS is an integral part of the sustainability.\r\n\r\n",
