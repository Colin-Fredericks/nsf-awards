 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE; www.dlese.org) provides  access to over 6000 resources of potential use for teaching and learning about the Earth  and environment.  The PI will enhance the value of this collection by providing  review and annotation information about DLESE resources, so that resource creators can  improve their resources, educators can strengthen their relevant pedagogical expertise,  and all users can build on the experience of their peers in selecting and deploying  resources.  This will be accomplished by scaling up the DLESE Community Review System  and developing an annotation service for  related pedagogical resources.     The existing DLESE Community Review System (CRS; crs.dlese.org) gathers,  aggregates, and disseminates web-based feedback from people who have used DLESE  resources to teach or learn. We propose to scale up the CRS by:  (a) embedding an  emphasis on the value of pooling pedagogical insights via the CRS throughout DLESE s  outreach message, (b) opening CRS review to all instructionally-oriented resources in the  DLESE collection, (c) soliciting reviews by email from registered members of the  DLESE community whenever a new resource becomes available for Review that matches  their interest profile, and (d) generating individualized summary reports for instructors by  aggregating learners  reviews  from their own students.  The goal is to reach the point  where regular DLESE users habitually check out the CRS annotations before choosing or  using a new learning resource, and habitually feed their experiences and expertise back to  the community after using a DLESE resource.",
