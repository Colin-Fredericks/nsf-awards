 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Graduate Student Summer Workshop in Algebraic Geometry will be \r\nheld at the University of Washington during July 18-22, 2005. It is \r\nanticipated that roughly 130 students will attend this workshop, along \r\nwith 16 mentors who will lead small groups of students studying \r\nvarious aspects of algebraic geometry.  Each morning there will be two \r\nlectures introducing different areas of the field.  The goal of the \r\nlectures will be to communicate the fundamental motivating questions \r\nin each area, the tools used to address them, and the important \r\nresults currently known. In the afternoon, the participants will break \r\nup into small groups, and work with a mentor on problems that will \r\ngive them a hands-on feel for the methods of the field. The afternoon \r\ngroups will be loosely tied to the morning lectures, which will aim to \r\ngive a survey of algebraic geometry as much as possible.\r\n\r\n     The intention is to help prepare the next generation of leaders \r\nin the subject.  There will be students participating from many \r\nuniversities in an intensive week of activities, including lectures, \r\nproblem sessions, and informal discussions among themselves and with \r\nmentors. This will deepen their understanding and widen their \r\nhorizons. It will also give graduate students an opportunity to meet \r\nsenior researchers in a more relaxed setting, and to begin to \r\nestablish working relationships with their fellow graduate students -- \r\ntheir future colleagues.  The sort of bonding which occurs naturally \r\nin such settings is also an important component of professional \r\ngrowth. Last, but not least, the Workshop will expose graduate \r\nstudents to ideas and problems from other parts of this large field, \r\nfar from their particular research area, and prepare them for the \r\nonce-in-a-decade AMS Summer Institute in Algebraic Geometry that \r\nimmediately follows the Workshop, also being held at the University of \r\nWashington.\r\n",
