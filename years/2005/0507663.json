 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST 0507663\r\nBecker\r\nOn the 20th anniversary of the Very Large Array, the best available survey of the\r\nGalactic Plane at centimeter wavelengths were the 5-10-arcminute resolution Effelsberg\r\nsurveys at 20 and 11 cm. Two years ago, Drs David Helfand and Robert Becker began\r\na program to improve the resolution and sensitivity of the image of the Galaxy by two\r\norders of magnitude with MAGPIS, the Multi-Array Galactic Plane Imaging Survey. They\r\nhave just completed imaging the Plane from longitude l = 5 to l = 32 with a resolution of\r\n5 arcseconds, a dynamic range of 1000:1, and a point-source sensitivity of \" 1 mJy.\r\nThese images are publicly available at the website http://third.ucllnl.org/gps, and will find\r\nuse in a wide variety of applications ranging from the construction of a complete census\r\nof the Galaxy's star formation in conjunction with the ongoing Spitzer Plane surveys, to\r\nthe discovery of the youngest supernova remnants in the Galaxy, to calculation of the\r\nexpected rate of LIGO signals from merging neutron stars. This collaborative project\r\naward for Dr. Helfand at Columbia University and Dr. Robert Becker at the University of\r\nCalifornia at Davis will be used to continue the creation of this definitive image of the\r\nGalactic Plane and to support its public distribution, as well as to use the survey results\r\nin a variety of science programs now becoming possible as a consequence of new\r\nviews through the Galaxy at radio, mid-IR, and X-ray wavelengths.\r\nThe data products created in this project are all publicly available, and will find use in\r\nGalactic studies for decades to come. The tools created for accessing these data may\r\nwell also find wide applicability. The project will also provide many opportunities for\r\nintegrating graduate and undergraduate education with the research effort. These\r\nresearchers have advised to date more than nineteen PhD physicists and astronomers,\r\nand several more will become involved with this project. Six of the last eight PhDs are\r\nwomen, and there will be a continuing effort to focus on redressing the\r\nunder-representation of women and minorities in our discipline.\r\n***",
