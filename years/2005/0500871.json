In particular,   the PI plans to investigate the global (in space) properties of stationary Allen-Cahn equation and related equations. The goal is to completely classify all entire solutions for two  dimensional spaces, and classify certain entire solutions in higher dimensions.  The PI  will also study the singular sets of minimizers of a vector valued Allen-Cahn equation which appears in the analysis of multiple phase segregation.  The goal is to  rigorously prove the  formation of triple junction for general convex domains and  to obtain the dynamics of the triple junctions.  The PI  will also investigate theoretically a new level set method for image segmentation which gets rid of re-initialization in numerical computations.\r\n\r\nThe research will shed a light on the finer structure  near interfaces between different materials and phases,and help to develop more efficient techniques for image segmentations and registrations,  which are very important for medical science and other areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
