 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support to immediately begin both continuous and campaign GPS\r\nmeasurements of ephemeral, post-seismic crustal deformation in the source region of the\r\ngreat Northern Sumatra earthquake of December 2004. This event was one the largest\r\nearthquakes in the last 100 years and is the largest to have occurred since the\r\ndevelopment of GPS, a technology that provides an extraordinary ability to precisely\r\nmeasure tectonic motions. The proposed GPS measurements will provide an\r\nunprecedented opportunity to observe the post-seismic time evolution of earth.s response\r\nto great earthquakes and their effects on ongoing tectonic activity in this geologically\r\nactive and complicated area. A rapid response to this earthquake, through the installation\r\nand operation of both continuous and campaign GPS stations, is essential to capture the\r\nephemeral, non-secular crustal deformation signals and to support a more widespread\r\ncampaign GPS effort. An important broader impact of this work will be a contribution to updating seismic and tsunami hazard for the region. The changes in stress caused by this earthquake may trigger significant activity on the other faults in the region. Developments in real time GPS data processing will allow data from the continuous station to be incorporated into the tsunami warning system being developed for the Indian Ocean. Real time displacement data from GPS will compliment seismic data. This is especially important in the case of tsunami generation by slow earthquakes, which are invisible seismically.\r\n",
