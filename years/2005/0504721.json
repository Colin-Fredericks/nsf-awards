 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n    Weinberger plans to develop both quantitative versions of known \r\ntheorems of algebraic and geometric topology, extending the basic ideas \r\nof controlled topology into directions of both more and less \r\nsmoothness.  In part, this interacts with logic and computer science, as \r\nin the analysis of Dehn functions, and applications of Kolmogorov \r\ncomplexity arguments to variational problems, but the goal is to get \r\nmore realistic upper and lower bounds on specific (solvable) topological \r\nproblems.  A subsidiary task is to understand the \"information based \r\ncomplexity\" of geometric problems, and understand the rates of growth of \r\nvarious sets arising in classification problems via the philosophy of \r\nthe Goodwillie calculus.\r\n\r\n    The motivation for this comes from a number of directions, both \r\napplied and theoretical.  In applications of topology to experimental \r\nsciences, one rarely has as explicit space to study:  one has large data \r\nsets, and the investigator must infer an underlying space.  The features \r\nthat often arise as hypotheses in mathematical theorems cannot simply be \r\nseen: they must be detected.  One problem to be studied is how to \r\ndetermine, say, the dimension of such an underlying space.  After that \r\ncome problems of implementing software and understanding how much data \r\none needs to make reliable estimates.  Another sort of problem comes \r\nfrom the existence of singularities in many equations of applied \r\nmathematics and geometry.  As topology usually confines itself to the \r\nstudy of continuous maps, the implication of discontinuities of various  \r\nsorts could potentially be of use.  Finally, in many problems of pure \r\ngeometry, the detailed structure of solutions which have only been \r\nproved to exist, but which have never been \"seen\" would be of great \r\nvalue.  Reproving their existence with quantitative estimates should \r\nlead to a better understanding of their nature.\r\n",
