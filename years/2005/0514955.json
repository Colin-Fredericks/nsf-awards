How  efficiently to represent, classify, and analyze a large quantity of  high-dimensional data that have complex geometric or statistical  structures becomes one of the most fundamental and challenging  problems in our modern information-technology era. One of the main  difficulties with modeling complex data is that a given data set may  consist of many different components (subsets), each of which may  have different topological, geometric or statistical structures. In  different contexts, such data are called mixed, or multi-modal  \r\nor piecewise, or heterogeneous,or hybrid.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed project is to investigate a novel approach  that models hybrid data as algebraic sets instead. This readily  relates the hybrid-model estimation problem with the study of  algebraic sets in algebraic geometry. It offers rather refreshing  technical tools, different from the conventional statistical learning  methods, which can help resolve the apparent chicken-and-egg  problem in the estimation of hybrid models as well as lead to  efficient and robust algorithms for estimating and decomposing hybrid  \r\nmodels.\r\n\r\nIn the past few years, hybrid model estimation has become a  fundamental problem in many important applications, ranging from  image/video/motion segmentation in computer vision, sparse image  \r\nrepresentation and approximation in image processing, to hybrid  system identification in systems theory. The proposed  interdisciplinary research project provides ample opportunities for  students from both mathematics and engineering to interact with each  other. Engineering students are traditionally weaker in training in  abstract algebra than in analysis, geometry, and statistics. This  project will significantly improve the visibility of algebraic  geometry to engineering students and researchers. It will help to  \r\ndevelop new cross-discipline research programs between mathematics  and engineering. Furthermore, visual examples and demonstrations  developed from this project will also enhance the teaching of  abstract algebraic concepts to undergraduate mathematical students or  even to the general public.\r\n",
