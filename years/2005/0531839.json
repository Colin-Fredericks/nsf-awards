The aim of this\r\nproposal is to organize a workshop on the frontiers of statistics that\r\ninvolve large and complex data. The conference will focus on data-analytic\r\nnonparametric techniques in diverse fields of disciplines such as\r\ncomputational biology, financial econometrics, machine learning, and\r\nindustrial engineering.  It will also include various topics on\r\nstatistical theory and methods.  A distinguished feature of the conference\r\nis that it addresses emerging statistical problems that arise from various\r\nfrontiers of science. It will be very helpful for shaping the future\r\ndirections of statistical research.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this proposal is to bring together top and junior\r\nresearchers to define and expand these research frontiers of statistics.\r\nThe workshop provides a focal venue for top and junior researchers to\r\ngather, interact and present their new research findings, to discuss and\r\noutline emerging problems in their fields, and to lay the groundwork for\r\nfruitful future collaborations.  Moreover, it will provide an overview for\r\ngraduate students who are interested in seeking for an interesting area to\r\nwork.  The workshop focuses on various nonparametric statistical problems\r\nfrom various frontiers of science and engineering such as computational\r\nbiology, financial econometrics, machine learning, and industrial\r\nengineering. It will be very helpful for shaping the future directions of\r\nstatistical research that addresses problems of high societal impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
