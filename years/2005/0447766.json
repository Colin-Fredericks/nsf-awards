 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award provides funding for the development of streamlined algorithms for sequential decision-making under uncertainty.  The focus will be on large-scale systems, such as queueing systems found in manufacturing plants, networks of mobile sensors, and economic systems considered in problems of policy evaluation.  The research will be centered around approximate dynamic programming, a methodology that offers unified treatment to problems of decision-making under uncertainty.  Algorithms and theory for approximate dynamic programming will be developed. In particular, the focus will be on algorithms that generate decision rules with performance guarantees, deal with model uncertainty, and take into account flexible approximation architectures.  Several applications will be considered, including mobile sensor control, optimal optical design, queueing control and quantitative economic policy analysis. In addition to the research activities, a comprehensive teaching plan will be implemented. The teaching activities will target education at MIT at all levels as well as the scientific community at large and industry, through the development of new courses and reformulation of existing ones, organization of industry and academic workshops and advising of undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis research program will amplify the impact and applicability of approximate dynamic programming techniques by addressing key unsolved issues and creating more streamlined and robust methods. A primary objective is to advance the field by addressing fundamental questions in approximate dynamic programming. Another primary objective is to increase the impact of the methodology in industry by making it more streamlined. If successful, this research plan will lead to algorithms and software packages that are stable, exhibit performance guarantees, and can be used with ease to solve industry problems. The applications under consideration pose considerable challenges on their own and their development within the approximate dynamic programming framework will enrich both the methodology and application domains. \r\n",
