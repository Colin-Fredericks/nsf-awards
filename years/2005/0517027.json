 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many essential functions of plant cells, such as taking up and exporting nutrients and hormones, are carried out by transport proteins embedded in the cell membrane. Proper activity of some of these transport proteins depends on their localization to one specific part of the cell membrane. The goal of this project is to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which these membrane transport proteins are directed to the proper place in the cell. The study focuses on the AXR4 gene, which has been shown in the widely-studied plant Arabidopsis thaliana to be necessary for proper location of a protein that imports the hormone auxin. Genetic and molecular approaches will be used to identify genes and proteins that interact with AXR4 and act in the same pathway, which will reveal the cellular role of the AXR4 gene product. The project will enhance our knowledge of basic mechanisms of plant cell function, which may ultimately enable scientists to improve the growth of important crop plants. The project also will support the training in modern research techniques of undergraduates and master's students at a teaching-oriented institution.",
