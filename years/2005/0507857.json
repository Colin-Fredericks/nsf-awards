 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal Baldridge investigates the topology of smooth\r\n4-manifolds using gauge theory techniques. The goals of the\r\nproposer are to find easier ways to calculate the Seiberg-Witten\r\ninvariants of 4-manifolds, to provide new examples of symplectic\r\n4-manifolds, and to better understand the topology of 4-manifolds\r\nwhich admit a circle action and symplectic form. The first project\r\ninvolves studying the moduli space of solutions to the\r\nSeiberg-Witten equations of a smooth 4-manifold when the Dirac\r\noperator is conjugated by the exponential of a Morse function.  In\r\na collaborative project with Li, the proposer also plans to extend the\r\ngeography problem for symplectic 4-manifolds to nonsimply\r\nconnected manifolds and fill out this geography for symplectic\r\nmanifolds with Kodaira dimension 1. In the third and fourth\r\nprojects the proposer explores ideas related to Taubes's question,\r\nthat is: If a 4-manifold is symplectic and diffeomorphic to the\r\nproduct of a three manifold with a circle, does that three manifold\r\nfiber over a circle?\r\n\r\nA 3-manifold is a space that locally looks like the familiar space\r\nwe live in.  If one imagines replacing every point in the\r\n3-manifold with a circle of points in a nice way, one gets an\r\nexample of a 4-manifold with a circle action. Here `action' means\r\na rotation of the space along each circle.  Four manifolds with\r\ncircle actions have many nice periodic and symmetry properties,\r\nwhich makes them particularly suitable for modeling and testing\r\nphysical theories. (For example, the space-time universe we live\r\nin is an example of a general 4-manifold which may have a circle\r\naction.) These manifolds are especially useful for modeling if\r\nthey also have a symplectic structure --- a key ingredient in\r\nalmost all the equations of classical and quantum physics.  Work\r\nin this proposal investigates what shapes symplectic 4-manifolds\r\nwith circle actions can have, and the shapes of 4-manifolds in\r\ngeneral. This is done by relating invariant features of a\r\n4-manifold to the number of solutions of certain systems of\r\nnonlinear partial differential equations on that manifold.\r\n\r\n",
