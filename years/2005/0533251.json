 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThis project aims at providing/developing a model of environmental and thematic feature\r\nperception by blind and visually impaired map users. The project will also provide free, easily\r\naccessible, and easy to use tactile mapping software, downloadable from the Department of\r\nGeography at University of Oregon website. The software will supply teachers with the tools to\r\ncreate navigation maps for blind and visually impaired orientation and mobility education as well\r\nas create tactile socio-economic maps to be used as instructional materials in science and social\r\nscience education. The Research Goals of the project are to:\r\n1. identify the most important environmental objects that are used during navigation,\r\norientation and mobility by the blind and visually impaired\r\n2. identify how blind and visually impaired map users perceive, categorize and use these\r\nenvironmental objects\r\n3. based on the findings from goals 1 and 2, create and evaluate a library of symbols that\r\neffectively represent the environmental objects\r\n4. evaluate the threshold of socio-economic data representation/symbolization on tactile\r\nthematic maps\r\n5. create free, easily accessible Tactile Navigation and Socio-economic Mapping software\r\nthat incorporates research findings from goals 1, 2, 3,and 4\r\nIntellectual Merit. Research Goals 1-4 will be investigated through the design of empirical\r\nexperiments involving human subject volunteers. Researchers and practitioners still do not\r\nunderstand completely how blind and visually impaired map readers perceive environmental\r\nfeatures and then how those features are best symbolized for map use. While some researchers\r\nhave begun to investigate tactile map design, very little has been reported on tactile navigation\r\nmap use and environmental perception. Moreover, little to no results has been reported on tactile\r\nthematic maps (neither design nor use). The results from the proposed research will build on the\r\nlimited knowledge base and begin to develop a model of understanding of both the environmental\r\nfeatures (important for tactile navigation maps) and thematic value differences (important for\r\ntactile socio-economic maps).\r\nIn addition, currently teachers have no automated means to produce navigation and thematic\r\nsocio-economic tactile maps for the education of blind and visually students. The Tactile\r\nNavigation and Socio-economic Mapping that will be authored in this proposed project will offer\r\nthe ability for teachers and parents to create highly customized navigation and orientation maps\r\nfor specific locations such as school, home, church, neighborhood, or playground. Moreover, the\r\nproposed software will allow the mapmakers to insert landmarks that are meaningful to the map\r\nreader. But, one of the most substantial advantages of the proposed software is the additional\r\nability to create hundreds of US socio-economic tactile maps, products that are flatly unavailable\r\nin any realistic way (without expensive custom-ordering from a tactile production company).\r\nBroader Impacts. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Law guarantees that this group\r\nwill receive the materials they need for a free appropriate education. But, they don't have the\r\nsocio-economic maps they need to achieve an understanding of the country that guaranteed their\r\neducational rights. The benefits this proposed project will bring to the underrepresented blind\r\nand visually impaired members of society are potentially monumental. The proposed project will\r\ndeliver not only theoretical models addressing the understanding map use and environmental\r\nperception, but also the software, a tangible product that will enhance the infrastructure of both\r\nresearch and education.",
