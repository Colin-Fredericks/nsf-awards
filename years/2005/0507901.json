 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the non-equilibrium statistical\r\nphysics aspects of large spatially extended systems, in\r\nparticular, nonlinear dispersive wave turbulence.  He aims to go\r\nbeyond the traditional weak-turbulence regime to include the\r\ndynamics of turbulence of coherent excitations induced by strong\r\nnonlinearity, including intermittent wave collapses, in the\r\ninteraction of resonant waves.  The non-equilibrium statistical\r\nphysics of wave turbulence is studied from two new perspectives:\r\n  (1) Fluctuation Theorems: These new theorems have provoked much\r\nrecent activity for many physical systems.  Here the investigator\r\nconsiders whether Fluctuation Theorems hold for non-equilibrium\r\nwave turbulence and studies related far-from-equilibrium issues,\r\nsuch as (i) the universality of Fluctuation Theorems in wave\r\nturbulence, (ii) the relation to large-deviation theory, (iii) the\r\ndynamical consequences of effective temperatures, and (iv) the\r\nimplications of Fluctuation Theorems for phase-mixing and\r\ndephasing processes at the onset of wave turbulence. \r\n  (2) The Maximum-Entropy Principle: Previously, wave turbulence\r\nhas been examined using this principle for equilibrium states\r\nonly.  Here the investigator aims (i) to include the consequences\r\nof the maximum-entropy principle for wave turbulence flux\r\ndynamics, when applied to the weakly nonlinear regime, in which\r\nthe weak-turbulence often arises, and (ii) to further examine the\r\napplicability of the maximum-entropy principle to wave turbulence\r\nfar from equilibrium.  The project requires synergistic\r\napplications of theoretical concepts and techniques that are\r\nderived from statistical physics, stochastic processes, dynamical\r\nsystems, computational science, and asymptotic analysis in modern\r\napplied mathematics.  The topics are theoretically important for\r\nproviding a more complete description of fluctuations in the\r\ndynamics of wave turbulence from near-equilibrium to\r\nfar-from-equilibrium.  The results derived from these\r\ninvestigations could provide new mathematical formulations of\r\nnonlinear dispersive wave turbulence. \r\n\r\n     The investigator uses new theoretical approaches to study\r\nnonlinear dispersive wave turbulence, which is one of the most\r\nchallenging theoretical problems.  This work broadens the scope of\r\nwave turbulence from non-equilibrium statistical physics and\r\nextends the applicability of physical principles of\r\nnon-equilibrium statistical mechanics to wave turbulence, which\r\narises, for example, in nonlinear optics, acoustic waves, plasmas,\r\nsuperfluid helium and the Bose-Einstein condensation, capillary\r\nand gravity waves on the ocean surface, internal waves in the\r\nocean.  Theoretical insights derived from this work may shed light\r\non turbulence-induced complexity, such as in the atmosphere and\r\nocean dynamics, or in the transport of chemicals in a turbulent\r\nenvironment. \r\n",
