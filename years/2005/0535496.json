 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past few decades it has become apparent that scientific progress is commonly best\r\nattained where big problems are addressed by teams of scientists representing a wide\r\nvariety of expertise. In response to these changes in the nature of scientific inquiry,\r\nthe Paleontological Society proposes to organize a workshop accompanied by a series of\r\nresearch forums that will focus on developing several new large-scale research initiatives\r\nthat have the broad support of the paleontological community. The proposed Future Research\r\nDirections in Paleontology (FRDP) Workshop, for which funds are requested, will include 25\r\nparticipants, and is to be held on September 10-11, 2005 at the Department of\r\nPaleobiology, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. This will be preceded by a\r\nresearch forum at the North American Paleontological Convention (June, 2005) in Halifax,\r\nNova Scotia. The workshop will then be followed by two research forums at the Geological\r\nSociety of America Annual Meeting (October, 2005). The final product of this effort will\r\nbe a document of 30-40 pages which will contain short proposals for 5-6 larger integrative\r\nprojects that require significant funding which the paleontological community shows strong\r\nsupport for initiating.\r\nWhat Is The Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity?\r\nThose engaged in paleontological research would agree that many challenges towards our\r\nunderstanding of how life has evolved and existed on Earth would be best approached in a\r\ncollaborative, integrative fashion. The FRDP Workshop and associated Research Forums will\r\nprovide a community-based platform where several of these most important research problems\r\ncan be addressed through development of research projects that will act as initiatives for\r\nthe paleontological community. In this way the Paleontological Society plans to lead the\r\nway towards the future of paleontological research.\r\nWhat Are The Broader Impacts of this Study?\r\nWith the growth of science over the past few decades, many of the most important problems\r\ncan only be solved with interdisciplinary teams of scientists using the best available\r\ntechnology. Such team-based activities will provide numerous opportunities for research\r\ntraining and experience in forefront areas of science, particularly the growing number of\r\nwomen and other under-represented groups which are currently entering the Earth sciences.",
