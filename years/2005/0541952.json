Additionally, three undergraduate students worked in the center through the NSF\nResearch Experience for Undergraduates Program.\n\nSMU's I/UCRC site, in collaboration with its industrial partners, has conducted a number of research projects and a short summary of the outcomes of\nthese projects are shown below.\n\nHalliburton Company financially supported a project entitled: \"Creating and testing of functionally graded materials (FGM) resistant to slurry erosion by laser cladding.\"  The long-term goal of this research is to create a commercially valuable method for producing products consisting of FGMs resistant to slurry erosion.  FGMs consisting of Ni-WC (nickel-tungsten\ncarbides) powders with different concentration of tungsten carbide particles\nare successfully deposited by a laser-based direct metal deposition (LBDMD)\nprocess on AISI4140 steel substrate.

In this study,\nan experimentally based finite element model was developed to simulate\ntemperature distribution for purposes of calculating mechanical stresses in\nwelded structures.  A strong correlation was found between the depth of weld and the airborne sound signature developed during the laser welding of high-strength steels in lap joint configuration. \n\nLockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control financially supported a project entitled: \"Development of arc plasma-based process for building/repair high-value components made of Al-alloys.\"  The main goal of this project is to develop an economically justifiable rapid manufacturing/repair technique based on a variable polarity arc plasma.  A system to repair high-value Al-alloy components by using the variable polarity gas tungsten arc welding process has been developed.  A real-time machine vision system has been integrated to monitor the size of the molten pool and the cathodic cleaning of Al-oxides.\n\nThe Army Rese..."
