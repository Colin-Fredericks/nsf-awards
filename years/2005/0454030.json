 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interior of plants is a vast unexplored habitat for bacteria.  Every gram of growing plant tissue on earth is probably home to at least 10,000 bacteria.  The contribution of these bacteria to plant growth and development is largely unknown.  However, recent evidence shows that one of these bacteria can provide fixed nitrogen to wheat, the most important crop in the world.  Further understanding of this nitrogen fixation in wheat may one day permit the elimination of nitrogen fertilization to agronomic grasses in the United States such as corn, wheat, barley, rice, and others.  Nitrogen fertilization is very expensive to farmers and pollutes ground water supplies.  In this work, the means by which this nitrogen-fixing bacterium enters wheat plants will be determined.   The effects of this bacterium on other bacteria present within wheat plants will also be investigated.  In addition, the basis of the ability of some bacteria to enter plants better than others will be explored.  With this new knowledge, systems may be designed to improve the amount of nitrogen provided by the nitrogen-fixing bacterium to plants so that these systems may one day be applied to agriculture. \r\n\r\n     This work also has a significant educational component.  A national curriculum in microbiology will be prepared for a target audience of 1 million 4H youth nationally.  The objective of this effort is to provide science-based information on those issues that are affected by the wide array of bacteria in our environment including emerging diseases, food safety, bioterrorism, water quality, and even climate change.  With this curriculum, a large number of American youth will be equipped to make informed decisions on these issues.  Over time, this curriculum may also be available to middle schools nationally. \r\n",
