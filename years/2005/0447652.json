 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Progam  award will develop new methods for design, control,  performance analysis, and pricing of differentiated services in technologically advanced service operations. Service differentiation is fundamental to the operation of  most modern service systems as  it allows  diverse requirements of businesses and customers to be met by  means of  service  classes with  varying  quality grades. In addition, it  supports the economic viability of such services.   Examples of  key   questions  that will be addressed by this proposal include the following: 1)  How many agents  should be used to staff a large  telephone call center to meet service level constraints across  multiple customer classes?   2) How should pricing of Internet-based information services  account for  standard quality grades (e.g.,  ``best-effort'' and ``guaranteed'' connections)?    3)    How should  web-hosting service providers verify and monitor a heterogenous mix of service levels dictated by their e-business clients?\r\n \r\nThis investigation ranges from fundamental formulation and analysis of models, to more applied work in collaboration with industry partners. The research agenda  is broad and interdisciplinary, integrating  ideas from statistics, economics, stochastic control, queueing theory, optimization, and simulation.\r\nMethods developed in this award should lead to managerial insights and improved problem solving techniques  that can potentially affect the competitive advantage of enterprises operating in the service sector.\r\n Important synergies with related scientific fields should produce contributions  in the areas of applied probability, statistics, risk management, and  revenue management.  Results will be incorporated\r\ninto teaching materials and new courses,  and will be widely disseminated to academia and industry.  In addition to supporting the PI's research, this project will also support doctoral students and foster research interactions with industry.",
