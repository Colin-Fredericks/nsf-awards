 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is investigating how generic support for speculative\r\nexecution in a commodity operating system can improve the performance\r\nand consistency of remote data access.  Rather than block applications\r\nduring a remote file system operation, the operating system\r\ncheckpoints the state of the calling process, predicts the result of\r\nthe remote operation, and speculatively resumes execution based upon\r\nthe predicted results.  If the speculation proves correct, the\r\ncheckpoint is discarded; if the speculation is incorrect, the calling\r\nprocess is restored to the checkpoint and the operation retried.  The\r\noperating system guarantees safe execution by preventing speculative\r\nprocesses from externalizing output until the speculations upon which\r\nthat output depends have proven correct.  By tracking causal\r\ndependencies created through inter-process communication, the\r\noperating system allows multiple processes to safely share speculative\r\nstate.  In addition to file systems, this project is exploring uses of\r\nspeculation in diverse areas, including cyber-foraging, remote\r\ndesktops, and software installation.\r\n\r\nThe major impact of this project lies in improving the performance,\r\nconsistency guarantees, and safety of current distributed file\r\nsystems.  The project is developing speculative versions of NFS, AFS\r\nand other distributed file systems that perform substantially better\r\nthan current versions of these file systems.  At the same time, these\r\nversions provide stronger consistency and safety guarantees to\r\napplications.  The software artifacts developed as part of this\r\nproject, including a modifed version of Linux that supports\r\nspeculation, are being released to the open-source community.\r\nAdditionally, educational initiatives are helping train the next\r\ngeneration of systems software developers.\r\n",
