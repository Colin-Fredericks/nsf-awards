 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed GeoTraverse workshop is to explore a geologically-based scheme\r\non how to design and coordinate high-resolution, coast-to-coast coverage of the\r\nconterminous United States.\r\nThe primary motivation of a GeoTraverse is the great need for systematic integration of\r\ngeologic data into the EarthScope initiative. Additionally, we assert that broad\r\ninvolvement by the geologic community and recognition by the general public is essential\r\nfor the ultimate success of EarthScope. Among the EarthScope products, an over-arching\r\nsynthesis of all regional EarthScope studies, such as provided by one or more geologic\r\ntransects, is critical to define and understand the structure and evolution of the North\r\nAmerican continent. The difficulty with the current deployment of USArray is that the\r\narrangement offers insufficient spatial resolution of the crust, which is essential to\r\ngeologic analysis. Therefore, the workshop will primarily focus on geologically relevant\r\nand reasonable use of the USArray flexible seismic array, utilizing both passive- and\r\nactive-source seismology.\r\nThe combination of geophysical and geologic data envisioned under GeoTraverse is\r\nscientifically integrative and synoptic, and would optimize public interest and outreach.\r\nA group of 50 or more active scientists will convene at a central location in the US in\r\nNovember 2005 or January 2006. A series of introductory presentations will offer\r\nbackground and technical constraints. Subsequent break-out groups will explore regional\r\nand topical targets, followed by plenary discussion toward a GeoTraverse proposal.\r\nThere will be two lead-conveners who are responsible for organizational matters and a\r\nsteering group of scientists who represents regions and topics in US continental geology.\r\nThe steering group will select participants from applications and by invitation.",
