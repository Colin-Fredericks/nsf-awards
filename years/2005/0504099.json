 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative project, the investigators study the\r\ninteraction between fluids and particle distributions.  They\r\nexamine the nonlinear Smoluchowski equations with both passive and\r\nactive interaction with an ambient fluid.  The specific goals are:\r\na study of the transition to nematic states in the high\r\nconcentration limit, effects of shear, complex dynamics and modes\r\nof coupling.  Particular attention is given to the active\r\ninteractions with fluids, singularity formation, the stabilization\r\nof high concentration suspensions, and the dissipation effects due\r\nto the insertions. \r\n\r\n     Many biological and artificial materials are involved in\r\nprocesses in which melts or fluid flows carry inserted particles. \r\nThe orientation of the particles and their overall distribution\r\ninfluence the physical and chemical properties of the mixture. \r\nThe investigators carry out a mathematical study of models of such\r\nmixtures.  The goals are to describe qualitatively the patterns\r\nformed by the particles, which of these patterns are stable, what\r\nare the conditions for the creation of discontinuities in the\r\npatterns, and what are the energetics and bulk physical properties\r\nassociated with them.  Better understanding of the effects of\r\nsmall-scale nonequilibrium dynamics on large-scale transport in\r\ncomplex particle-fuid systems, such as the viscous polymer\r\nsuspensions considered here, is important in chemistry, biology,\r\nand engineering.",
