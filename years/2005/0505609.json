 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal thrust of this research project is further development of \r\nefficient triangulations and their applications to the study and \r\nunderstanding of 3-manifolds. 0- and 1-efficient triangulations have lead \r\nto a number of new methods and results on triangulations of 3-manifolds, \r\ndecision problems, algorithms, computational complexity, Heegaard \r\nsplittings, and Dehn fillings. We propose to develop further our \r\nunderstanding of 0- and 1-efficient triangulations and to form a notion of \r\ng-efficient triangulations (g > 1). Our goals are to make an explicit \r\nconnection between efficient triangulations and geometric structures on \r\n3-manifolds, to use efficient triangulations for a better understanding of \r\nHeegaard splittings of 3-manifolds, and to use our methods that reduce a \r\ngiven triangulation to an efficient triangulation to achieve a \r\nsimplification to the solution of the Homeomorphism Problem for \r\n3-manifolds (Classification of 3-manifolds).  In particular, we propose \r\nnew algorithms for deciding if a 3-manifold is a Haken manifold, for the \r\nJSJ decomposition of a 3-manifold and for the recognition of Haken \r\nmanifolds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree-dimensional manifolds are mathematical objects which are locally \r\nmodeled on familiar three-dimensional space. The major problem in the \r\nstudy of three-manifolds is their classification, which is to make a \r\ncomplete list of all three-manifolds without duplications. The study and \r\nunderstanding of three-manifolds toward such a classification is the main \r\nobjective of this project. In particular, we know that three-manifolds can \r\nbe considered as a union of building blocks fitting together in a very \r\norganized way. For example, tetrahedra may be used as the building blocks; \r\nin this case, the collection of tetrahedra and the information about how \r\nthey fit together is called a triangulation of the three-manifold. All \r\nthree-manifolds can be triangulated. Thus one of the major strategies \r\ntoward solving the classification problem is to find methods to recognize \r\na particular three-manifold, having been given the three-manifold in one \r\nof its many possible triangulations.  Applications of topology of \r\nthree-manifolds range from questions of protein knotting and unknotting in \r\nDNA to the issue of the shape of space (the universe). In particular, the \r\nlatter may very well come to an issue of recognizing the three-manifold \r\nthat is our universe. Thus the classification and understanding of \r\nthree-manifolds has far reaching applications and implications.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
