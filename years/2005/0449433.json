Originally based on distributed topology, the proposed circuit topologies will exhibit far superior performance (lower noise-figure and higher gain-bandwidth-product) than conventional distributed circuits, while accounting for non-ideal losses of the circuit elements. The core concept of non-uniform downsized distributed circuits can be employed in a broad range of applications, including the design of broadband amplifiers and output drivers for high-speed broadband wireline systems. \r\n\r\nThe proposed integrated research and education activities will address new research challenges incurred in the design and development of silicon-based high-frequency wideband integrated circuits used in a wide variety of high-frequency systems. It will present circuit topologies whose performance is far superior to that of conventional silicon-based circuits, while accounting for non-ideal losses of the circuit elements. Interdisciplinary research and education, as well as government and industry, will benefit from the proposed work. The PI's close collaboration with local industry will facilitate the dissemination of research results to U.S. high-tech companies to contribute to the development of new communication products. Integrating the proposed circuit topologies into next-generation high data-rate wireless communication systems will have a significant impact on law enforcement, rescue operations, and personal area networks. The proposed educational plan will emphasize the participation of underrepresented groups at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels in the integrated research and training programs in UWB integrated circuit design. \r\n\r\n",
