The classical theory of harmonic maps deals with\r\nmaps between Riemannian manifolds.  More recently, the importance of\r\nconsidering singular domains and targets has been discovered.  Harmonic map\r\ntheory in singular spaces was initiated by Gromov and Schoen and their\r\nanalysis of harmonic maps into non-positively curved Riemannian simplicial\r\ncomplexes combined with Corlette's vanishing theorem is the basis of their\r\nproof of p-adic super-rigidity.  The study of harmonic maps into singular\r\ntargets was further generalized by Korevaar and Schoen and independently by\r\nJost.  Further generalization is to consider singular domains.  In this\r\nproject, we study harmonic maps from a simplicial polyhedron to a metric\r\nspace of non-positive curvature.  A fundamental question is the regularity\r\nof these maps, and our goal is to show that these maps are smooth enough to\r\nbe useful in many applications.  In particular, we hope to bring harmonic\r\nmap theory and holomorphic quadratic differentials into the study of\r\nfinitely generated groups.  More precisely, we will use harmonic maps from a\r\ntwo-dimensional simplicial complex to understand finitely generated groups\r\nfrom their actions on R-trees.   This point of view is important in the\r\nstudy of combinatorial group theory and three-dimensional topology.\r\nHarmonic maps will also be used to investigate compactifications of the\r\nTeichmuller space of a compact surface.  Finally, the study of minimal\r\nsurfaces will be considered as an extension of the generalized harmonic map\r\ntheory.  \r\nThe proposed work contributes to the basic understanding of geometric\r\nvariational problems.  Mathematicians have devoted large effort in\r\ndeveloping variational methods and the successes of these investigations\r\nhave laid the foundations of many branches of sience. There is a natural\r\nnotion of energy associated to maps between certain spaces and, in this\r\nproject, we study its critical points which are called harmonic maps. They\r\nhave shown to be extremely useful as an analytic tool in geometry.  The\r\ngeneralization of harmonic maps between smooth spaces to non-smooth spaces\r\npromises to yield many more applications. We investigate the extent to which\r\nthe classical methods in harmonic maps can be carried over to the singular\r\nsetting.  The applications of the generalized theory make these questions\r\nrelevant to a broad mathematical community.\r\n",
