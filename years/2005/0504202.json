In this\r\nsubject, which has been studied extensively in the early years of\r\nglobal Riemannian geometry, only few obstructions are known, the\r\nmajor one being Gromov's Betti number theorem. On the other hand\r\nthere are also very few known examples, mainly arising by taking\r\nquotients of left invariant metrics by a group of\r\nisometries. Recently significant progress has been made by\r\nstudying positively curved manifolds under the presence of a\r\nlarge group of isometries, partly in the hope of finding good\r\ncandidates for new examples of this type. We recently obtained a\r\npartial classification of positively curved cohomogeneity one\r\nmanifolds, i.e. manifolds where a group acts isometrically with\r\none dimensional quotient. In this classification one is left with\r\na very interesting sequence of 7-manifolds which are,\r\nsurprisingly, connected to self dual Einstein metrics and\r\n3-Sasakian geometry. We plan to investigate whether these\r\nmanifolds carry a metric with positive curvature. For\r\nnon-negatively curved cohomogeneity one manifolds there are many\r\nexamples, constructed by the author in previous grant proposals,\r\nincluding some on exotic spheres. On the other hand the author\r\nalso showed that the exotic Kervaire spheres cannot carry such\r\nmetrics. This makes a classification of non-negatively curved\r\nmanifolds a very interesting although difficult question, which\r\nthe authors plans to investigate in the future.  We also plan to\r\nstudy geometric and topological properties of the known examples\r\nof manifolds with positive, or more generally non-negative\r\nsectional curvature. As a next step, we plan to study positively\r\ncurved manifolds with low cohomogeneity.\r\n\r\nSince the round sphere of constant positive curvature is the\r\nsimplest and most symmetric Riemannian manifold, it is natural to\r\nask what manifolds carry metrics with similar geometric\r\nproperties, i.e. metrics with positive curvature. This fits into\r\nthe natural question of what global consequences one can derive\r\nunder local geometric assumptions, a major area of global\r\nRiemannian geometry. A basic unsolved question is whether exotic\r\nspheres, i.e. manifolds that look like spheres but on which\r\nordinary calculus is quite different, can carry positively curved\r\nmetrics.  Symmetries are an important aspect of many geometric\r\nquestions and the principal investigator plans to study manifolds\r\nwith positive or more generally non-negative curvature under the\r\npresence of a large symmetry group. One of the goals of this\r\ninvestigation is the search for new examples.\r\n",
