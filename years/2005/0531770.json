 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first ACM International Computing Education Research Workshop, held in October 2005, is intended to restart the field of Computing Education Research. This project is bringing scholars and researchers to the workshop. This is critical for two reasons. First, it is allowing people to attend who are doing computing education research but do not have funding for that research or for travel. Second, it is allowing the workshop to involve people not explicitly in computing but whose work is relevant to computing education. This includes developmental psychologists who study learning about process, agency, and notation; as well as people studying issues of prime importance to computing education, such as broadening participation in IT careers.",
