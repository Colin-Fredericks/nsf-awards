 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators develop tools and techniques to facilitate the accurate\r\nreconstruction of spectral data from compressed images.  Such reconstruction\r\ntypically aims at recreating gray-scale functions from their Fourier or\r\nspectral coefficients, and necessarily requires both precise information\r\nof the location of the jump discontinuities of the images, as well\r\nas an appropriate conversion, usually via projection, so that the image\r\ncan be viewed in the regions of smoothness.   Current techniques for edge\r\ndetection and projection reconstruction are somewhat successful in avoiding\r\nGibbs oscillations without compromising the integrity of the the images\r\naround the edges (i.e. smearing).  They also can retrieve information of small\r\nscale features which arise in many scientific applications.  However, the\r\nsuccess is seemingly function dependent, and it is difficult to choose\r\nparameters that are robust to be effective in all cases, especially\r\nwhen noise is present in the given data fields.    Furthermore, they are\r\ndifficult to extend to higher dimensions.  The investigators study new\r\nways to improve both edge detection and projection methods and ultimately\r\ncreate an automated robust, user-friendly, computationally efficient, and\r\ninherently multi-dimensional image reconstruction method.  The study tests\r\nthe resulting procedures against current image reconstruction methods on a\r\nrange of applications.\r\n\r\nImage reconstruction is of critical importance in many scientific fields.\r\nThe development of high order reconstruction techniques requires both\r\nmathematical rigor to prove theoretical results and computational\r\nrobustness to ensure practical usage.   The proposed activities address\r\nhow to obtain images efficiently and with high accuracy when small scale\r\nfeatures are of extreme interest in an increasingly image--oriented society.\r\nThese methods can, for example, enhance the diagnostic ability in medical\r\nimaging applications.  They can also be used to better identify the small\r\nscale features in solar activity such as those in connection with Lockheed\r\nMartin's Solar Imaging Suite.  This research is also useful for weather\r\nforecasting models, earthquake and tsunami prediction, and any other\r\nfields in which visualization is critical.  Finally, this study stands to\r\nsignificantly enhance the ability to compress data, as it it will be\r\npossible to optimize the reconstruction parameters when particular\r\ncompression requirements are proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
