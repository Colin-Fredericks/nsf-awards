 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis grant supports the acquisition of a high quality Raman microscope for the study of composition of materials and corrosion products for the purposes of conservation and validation of works of artistic, historic and cultural significance.  The equipment will strengthen the on going scientific research and education program at the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA), in the Center for Conservation, where the Scientific Research Laboratory conducts analysis and scientific research into the composition, structure, characteristics, and behavior of materials relating to works of art. This instrument will complement other major instruments in the DIA's laboratories including x-ray diffraction and fluorescence. This technique is non-destructive, molecular specific, spatially resolved and highly versatile. Examples are the use of Raman scattering to study the composition and symmetries of overcoatings, pigments, and corrosion products. The technique will be used to analyze a wide range of materials commonly found in works of art. These include pigments, dyes, minerals, gems, metal corrosion products, binding media (gums, waxes, resins) and organic materials such as ivory and wood. In addition, analyses often can be performed in situ, thereby affording the opportunity to examine many works of art, such as illuminated manuscripts, from which sampling is either impractical or undesirable. Significant time on the system will be set aside for education of students and visiting scientists.  \r\n\r\nThe understanding of surface science and materials as related to artistic materials is an area of growing interest. The laboratory conducts collaborative research projects with scientists at university and industrial laboratories throughout the Detroit area. The system will be used to train new conservators, to educate conservators on what can be done, and to perform valuable studies on important works.  Initial research will be in three areas: (1) identification of artists' materials; (2) study of metal corrosion products; and (3) study of polymer degradation products.  These studies may lead to improved means of preservation through improved understanding of conditions and mechanisms responsible for deterioration of art works.  This acquisition will enhance the education of undergraduates, pre-program interns, graduate students and post-graduate fellows in chemistry, art conservation and conservation science.  The Detroit Institute of Arts is committed to educating and informing the public sector about the scientific research and conservation activities of the Center through gallery displays, publications; illustrated lectures and tours of the facilities. \r\n",
