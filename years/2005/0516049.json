 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the release of the State Supreme Court Data Project (SSDP), much ground has been tilled in the advancement of the study of courts in general, and state courts specifically. Scholars of the judiciary now have a valuable resource with which to test general theories of judicial behavior. However, in its current format, the unit of analysis in the SSDP does not allow us to study the behavior of individual justices on these courts. The PIs will to transform the existing SSDP from a case-level database to an individual-level (justice-level) database. Specifically, the PIs will transform, check, describe, and archive the individual-level state supreme court judge data.  Given both the importance of the SSDP as well as its frequency of use, supplementing the SSDP with an individual-level database is something that will be widely utilized by scholars of the judiciary.",
