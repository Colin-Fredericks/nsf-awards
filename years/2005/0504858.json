In particular, we study three problems: \r\ni) inverse problems for physiological monitoring, ii) \r\nfluorescence imaging, and iii) direct and inverse \r\nobstacle scattering in tissues. For the physiological \r\nmonitoring problem, one seeks to detect changes in \r\ntissue structure and composition, especially in \r\nsuperficial tissue layers of organs where most \r\npre-cancers form. For the fluorescence imaging problem, \r\ntumor-seeking fluorescent molecules are introduced into \r\ndeep tissues and are excited by a laser. By detecting \r\nthe emitted fluorescent light, one wishes to determine \r\nthe support, and fluorescent efficiency and lifetime. \r\nFor the direct obstacle scattering problem, one seeks \r\nthe light scattered by an obstacle (e.g. a tumor) \r\ninside tissue due to a light source. For the inverse \r\nobstacle problem, one seeks to determine distinguishing \r\ncharacteristics (e.g. support, strength, etc) about the \r\nobstacle from scattered light measurements. The key \r\nchallenge in all of these problems is to understand the \r\ncomplicated light-tissue interactions because tissues \r\nmultiply scatter light strongly. This proposed research \r\naims to develop more accurate theory to predict and \r\ninterpret diagnostic data. In particular, this research \r\nbegins with the theory of radiative transport for light \r\npropagation in tissues. Computational methods for \r\nboundary value problems of the radiative transport \r\nequation will be developed to solve the direct and \r\ninverse problems proposed here. We pay special \r\nattention to computing quantitative resolution \r\nestimates for these three problems.\r\n\r\nMany of the significant advances in biology and \r\nmedicine correlate directly with technological advances \r\nin biomedical imaging systems. In particular, \r\nlaser-based imaging systems offer great potential for \r\nsafe, portable and economical monitoring and imaging of \r\ntissue function and health. This research project \r\ninvolves the theoretical and computational study of \r\nlaser-based imaging of biological tissues. In \r\nparticular, we seek mathematical results that impact \r\ndirectly applications in physiological monitoring, \r\nfluorescence imaging and direct and inverse obstacle \r\nscattering. The interaction of laser light with \r\nbiological tissues is complicated to model because \r\ntissues scatter light very strongly. Hence, the \r\noverarching goal of this research project is to gain a \r\nbetter understanding of multiple scattering of light in \r\ntissues.\r\n\r\n",
