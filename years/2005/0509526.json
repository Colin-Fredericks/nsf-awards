 "awd_abstract_narration": "Security holes and crashes at the operating system (OS) level\r\nrepresent a serious infrastructure problem. These OS bugs are often\r\nthe result of memory management errors, which are very hard for\r\ndevelopers to avoid. In the long run, a broad class of\r\nmemory-management errors can be prevented by using a high-level,\r\ntype-safe language, but whether these languages are suitable for\r\nkernel implementation remains an open question. Unfortunately, any\r\ngiven experiment to answer the question (i.e., using a particular\r\nhigh-level language) involves many differences in implementation\r\ncompared to a conventional kernel, making it difficult to draw\r\nconclusions about which parts of the high-level approach work and\r\nwhich parts do not. This project is an experiment specifically about\r\ngarbage collection for legacy OS kernels, changing as few other\r\nimplementation issues as possible. Concretely, the research is about\r\ndeveloping tools to automatically transform the C source code of a\r\nconventional kernel so that it is compatible with a variety of precise\r\ngarbage-collection strategies. The project's ultimate goal is to check\r\nwhether the OS becomes usefully more reliable as a result of garbage\r\ncollection, and to measure the performance costs in both desktop and\r\nembedded environments. If the experiment shows that the OS improves at\r\na reasonable cost, then the research will have shown how to increase\r\nthe reliability of a major part of today's computer systems\r\ninfrastructure. Tools generated by the project will be made publicly\r\navailable for use in research, for application to practical software,\r\nand for pedagogical purposes.",
