 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computer science department at the University of Texas at El Paso will acquire a department infrastructure of computers and network equipment that will support the group's principal research areas in high-assurance systems and high-performance computing as well as a broad range of educational programs. Research in high-assurance systems includes computer security topics such as network protocols, encryption, anonymizing data sets, electronic voting and electronic money; software engineering for large-scale systems, software tools for Web Services; and usablility and documentation studies. Research in high-performance computing includes performance analysis, self-organizing systems, and computational chemistry applications. Broader impacts of this project include supporting the department as it begins a PhD program, reaching a significant group of minority computer science students, positioning the department to prepare for NSA designation as a Center of Excellence in Information Assurance, and increasing the capability of the department and its students for experimental research.",
