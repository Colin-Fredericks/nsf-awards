Stern\r\n\r\nIn collaboration with Anda Degeratu, the principal investigator\r\nwill continue their study of harmonic spinors on manifolds with\r\ndegenerating spin structures. Their primary goal is to use these\r\ndegenerating spin structures to extend Witten's technique for\r\nproving the positive mass theorem to new classes of higher\r\ndimensional nonspin manifolds. They will also investigate the\r\napplication of index theory to these degenerate spin structures\r\nin order to find new relations for the A hat genus on nonspin\r\nmanifolds. The principal investigator will also continue his\r\nstudy of a geometric model of B fields and the higher p-form\r\npotentials arising in string theory, which is suitable for\r\nunderstanding how these fields affect the application of\r\ngeometric analysis to string theory. He will then apply this\r\nimproved understanding to various questions in string theory,\r\nincluding joint work with Savdeep Sethi on the analysis of\r\ngravitational anomalies of field theories arising from string\r\ntheories on singular spaces.\r\n\r\nAt low speeds and masses, general relativity should reduce to\r\nNewton's theory of gravity. This correspondence is confused by\r\nthe fact that there is no definition of mass in general\r\nrelativity which allows one to define the mass density at a\r\nsingle point in space. One can only define the mass of large\r\nregions. Physicists have introduced several notions of mass to\r\nobviate this difficulty, the best known of which is the ADM\r\nmass. The positive mass conjecture posits that this complicated\r\nADM mass is never negative. This is important because a negative\r\nmass universe seems physically unreasonable. Moreover, the truth\r\nof the positive mass conjecture has strong implications for the\r\nvery stability of space. In lower dimensions (including 4) this\r\nconjecture was proved by Schoen and Yau.  Recent work in string\r\ntheory has led to the study of gravity in more than 4 spacetime\r\ndimensions and thus interest in higher dimensional positive mass\r\ntheorems under investigation in this project.  Many related\r\nquestions arising in the gravity theories produced by string\r\ntheory are not currently amenable to careful mathematical\r\nanalysis because the correct mathematical translation of some of\r\nthe important string theory concepts, such as higher p form\r\npotentials, remains unclear. One of the goals of this project is\r\nto provide and apply such a translation.\r\n",
