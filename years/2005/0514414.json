 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new framework for modeling artificial boundary conditions in a variety of\r\napplications, including fluid dynamics, acoustics, and electromagnetic wave\r\npropagation, will be developed.  Previous approaches have relied either on\r\nsimple descriptions of those processes occurring near boundaries, such as\r\nlinearized disturbances to uniform states, or on a range of ad hoc\r\ntechniques that attempt to mitigate spurious artifacts of domain truncation.\r\nThe present work is based on the concept of a super-grid-scale model that is\r\nin many ways analogous to sub-grid-scale models that are used in Large Eddy\r\nSimulations of turbulent flows.  The formulation explicitly recognizes that\r\nin general systems (especially inhomogeneous and nonlinear PDE), domain\r\ntruncation, like filtering, is a modeling problem--the result is ``missing\r\ninformation'' that cannot be recovered from first principles.  Many existing\r\ntechniques (especially damping layers) implicitly supply such a model, but\r\nour hypothesis, backed by preliminary calculations in compressible flow and\r\nacoustic applications, is that better models can be developed by exploiting\r\na strong analogy with sub-grid-scale modeling techniques.  The analogy is\r\nbased on the dual roles that filtering and windowing play in real and\r\nFourier space.  The proposal details a rationally sequenced research program\r\nthat includes examination of several different super-grid models (based on\r\nanalogies to existing sub-grid models), detailed computations and comparison\r\nwith previous methods in the areas of incompressible and compressible flow,\r\nacoustics, and electromagnetic, and detailed analysis of stability and\r\nconvergence of the models and discretized systems.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that simulation is becoming the 'third leg' of science,\r\ntaking an important place beside theory and experiment.  In engineering,\r\nsimulation is an essential tool that enables design and optimization based\r\non first-principles rather than empirical correlations.  However,\r\ncomputation is only useful when the underlying system is correctly modeled.\r\nIndeed, many relevant systems in fluid dynamics, acoustics, and\r\nelectromagnetic waves cannot be reliably simulated with existing techniques.\r\nTechniques for artificial domain truncation, in particular, are a pacing\r\nitem in many applications in these and related fields.  Artificial domain\r\ntruncation (or artificial boundary conditions) refers to situations where\r\none wishes to simulate only a portion of a larger system in order to reduce\r\ncomputational effort.  The present research will provide a new generation of\r\nsuch techniques that are based on a rigorous and well-validated modeling\r\nframework called the super-grid-scale model.  Successful outcome of the\r\nproposed research has potential for far-ranging impact scientific and\r\nengineering design-oriented simulations.\r\n",
