 "awd_abstract_narration": "55A physical map of the maize (corn) genome (inbred line B73) will be constructed by the Optical Mapping System with 300 fold map coverage. Optical Mapping is an integrated, high-throughput single molecule system that has proven its merit by the analysis of a large number of whole genomes. Very long DNA molecules, directly extracted from cells will be analyzed.  A typical molecule is approximately 500 kb, or about 200 microns in length, and automated light microscopy will be used to image these molecules. Consequently ~1,500,000 single molecule maps will be acquired using an Optical Mapping System and a map will be constructed, to cover the entire genome. DNA sequence data will be compared with this map to aid in the piecing together of such information to cover this very large and complex genome. \r\n\r\nThe Optical Mapping of the maize genome will provide a resource that will significantly advance discovery of genomic information in maize--a critically important crop for animal feed and energy. Optical Mapping is ideally suited as a topic for teaching, training and learning across multiple disciplines, and will strengthen scientific training in plant genomics. Several members of underrepresented minority groups will be active in this maize genome project, and researchers working on the Maize Genome Optical Map will help conduct Outreach workshops, classes, and a course on Plant Genome Analysis. Through contacts in Superior, WI, Native American middle and high school students will come to UW-Madison for a summer course on plant genomics, drawing from Optical Mapping of Maize. A network of collaborators in computer science, engineering, crop genomics, mathematics at the Unerivery of Wisconsin, Madison and at several other institutions will be strengthened as a result of this grant. \r\n\r\nThe Maize Genome Optical Map and associated data will be made accessible through    a project web site (accessible via http://www.lmcg.wisc.edu/index.html),Maize GDB http://www.maizegdb.org/) and Gramene (http://www.gramene.org/).\r\n",
