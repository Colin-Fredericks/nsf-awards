 "awd_abstract_narration": "0507301\r\nPeumans\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes a new organic solar cell architecture that incorporates metal nanostructured antennae into the organic thin films. The metal nanostructures are used to concentrate the incident electromagnetic flux near the active interface of the organic donor-acceptor cells, resulting in increased absorption and exciton diffusion efficiencies. Furthermore, highly transparent nanopatterned metal films will be used as contacts in multijunction solar cell architectures. The high lateral conductivity of such nanopatterned metal films will allow for lateral photocurrent extraction in multijunction cells leading to a reduced sensitivity of the power conversion efficiency to the spectral content. Ultimately, this will lead to more efficient cell designs with power conversion efficiencies >20%. To fabricate the required organic-metal nanostructures, he will use a combination of templated and solution-phase synthesis to create monodisperse metallic nanostructures. These structures will subsequently be deposited using an aerosol technique, simultaneous with thermal evaporation of the organic molecules.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThe demonstration of efficient (>20%) metal nanostructure enhanced multijunction PV cells would represent a true breakthrough in the field of photovoltaics. The availability of cheap, highly efficient PV cells, manufactured without significant pollution, will benefit society enormously in terms of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and pollutants, reducing our dependence on oil reserves, creating new jobs and improving the image of science and engineering. In addition, the work on nanoscale organic-metal composite structures will help elucidate the fundamental limits of nanoscale metals in optical applications.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe work proposed will lead to invaluable insight in the manufacturing of nanoscale features over large areas. The modeling tools, and characterization and fabrication techniques that the PI plans to develop will have broader applications in nanoscience and engineering. In addition, he will organize a yearly workshop on metal-organic nanocomposites, establish a high-school mentoring program, and involve undergraduate students in the research. The results of the proposed work will be incorporated in the televised course on Nanophotonics that is broadcast through the Stanford Center for Professional Development.\r\n\r\n",
