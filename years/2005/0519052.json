 "awd_abstract_narration": "Though the trophic structure of marine ecosystems is known to have\r\nincreased in complexity over time, methods of quantifying this change are lacking. The proposed\r\nresearch will expand upon promising preliminary work using Ca isotope ratios as paleoecological\r\nindicators and develop this isotopic system as a proxy for the trophic level of extinct marine mammals.\r\nBy combining Ca isotope analyses with C isotope ratios, which vary with foraging habitat in marine\r\necosystems, this project will provide a new means to examine the structure of ancient marine vertebrate\r\necosystems. Since the trophic structure of foodwebs has a significant influence on the pathways by which\r\nnutrients and energy move within and between ecosystems, analysis of the Ca isotope composition of\r\nbiogenic hard parts may aid in elucidating how nutrient cycling and energy flow have fluctuated over\r\ntime. Furthermore, by expanding current knowledge of how ancient ecosystems functioned and how they\r\ndiffered from today s ecosystems, a44Ca measurements can help improve interpretations of how climatic\r\nand environmental perturbations have impacted or were impacted by the Earth s biosphere. Ultimately,\r\nthis project will provide new insight into the evolution of whales, whose from a terrestrial ancestor\r\nrepresents one of the most remarkable transitions in the history of life on Earth.\r\nAlthough the ultimate objective of this research is to understand the role of temporal changes in\r\nforaging behavior in the evolution of Cetacea (the clade that includes living whales, porpoises, and\r\ndolphins), the influence on Ca isotope ratios of factors other than trophic level must be examined first in\r\nmodern species before Ca isotope ratios can be applied to extinct species. Samples of marine mammals in\r\nfour, distantly related groups (sirenians, mustellids, cetaceans, and pinnipeds) will be analyzed as a means\r\nof addressing the impact of phylogenetic history on a44Ca values; the degree of similarity of a44Ca values\r\nfor species at the same trophic level will verify whether a44Ca values reflect trophic level differences\r\nregardless of evolutionary history. The C isotope composition of each sample will be analyzed as a proxy\r\nfor foraging habitat preference; a stronger correlation between a44Ca with trophic level rather than a13C\r\nvalues will indicate that trophic level has a stronger influence on a44Ca values than the foraging habits of\r\na species. Variation in a44Ca within a single individual will be explored by analyzing the Ca isotope\r\ncomposition of multiple skeletal elements from a single individual from each of the four modern groups\r\nof marine mammals sampled. Once the factors influencing a44Ca values in modern marine mammals\r\nhave been constrained, the Ca and C isotope composition of Eocene and Oligocene cetacean and sirenian\r\nbioapatite will be analyzed to assess the potential of this proxy for paleoecological studies. The\r\ndiversification of cetacean feeding strategies in the Oligocene should coincide with a large change in\r\na44Ca and a13C values of cetacean bioapatite, providing a clear signal of whether original a44Ca values can\r\nbe preserved and interpreted from the fossil record. Fossil bones of sirenians will also be analyzed as a\r\ncontrol for potential changes in seawater a44Ca values, since the trophic level of this group has remained\r\nconstant over time and any changes in the a44Ca values of this group will reflect changes in seawater\r\na44Ca values.\r\nBroader impacts. The broader impacts of this project are threefold. First, the grant will further\r\nthe training and development of a recent Ph.D. who will be supported as a postdoc. Under the\r\nsupervision of the PIs, this researcher will have primary responsibility for refining the methodologies,\r\nacquiring and analyzing the samples, and interpreting and disseminating the results. Second, the research\r\nwill provide a new and potentially powerful paleoecological tool to the broader community that can be\r\napplied to other ancient marine ecosystems and, after further development, may also have applications in\r\nterrestrial ecosystems. Finally, the results will complement our increasingly detailed knowledge of whale\r\nevolution. Once the proposed research is completed, the ecological and morphological changes\r\nassociated with the evolution of whales will be one of the best documented cases of macroevolutionary\r\nchange in the vertebrate fossil record. Given the historical place of whale origins in anti-evolution\r\npolemics, this research will surely have lasting impact in undergraduate and K-12 class rooms.",
