NSF support is requested to pay travel expenses and meeting costs for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and young faculty.  Financial support will be awarded to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and young faculty who are selected in a competitive process to present a poster at the conference.  The intellectual merit of the proposed conference involves primarily the exchange of technical information in the important area of micro- and nano- fluidics.  The conference provides a unique intellectual experience in which scientific researchers from many different disciplines come together in an intimate forum to discuss research and forge partnerships that are critical to the health and growth of this highly multidisciplinary field.  Topics that will be discussed in invited oral and poster sessions include nanobiotechnology, systems integration, nanofluidics, and single molecule manipulation and measurement with some emphasis on biomedical applications of microfluidics.  Oral and poster presentations at this conference are encouraged to be forward thinking or controversial on subjects that are not yet published. The conference includes extended time for discussions where scientific researchers, both young and old, from many disciplines can share and develop new ideas in an open and collegial environment.  Gordon Research Conferences provide facilities and support that allow for the highest level of interaction among all participants.  The broader impacts that will result from the conference are as follows: (1) improve the understanding of the science that underpins the development of microfluidic and nanofluidic technologies; (2) provide an opportunity for young researchers to interact closely with more established scientific researchers to broaden their scientific education and to promote their future careers as scientific researchers; (3) foster and promote long-term relationships between researchers in diverse fields including bioengineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry, and physics; and (4) promote the development of multidisciplinary teams that can address difficult problems in biological and the physical sciences using micro- and nano-technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-funded by the Fluid Dynamics & Hydraulics, Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing, and Particulate and Multiphase Processes Programs.\r\n",
