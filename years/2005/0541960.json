 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award allows the PI, Sigma Xi, to support a workshop, \"Developing a Strategy for Assuring a Globally Engaged Workforce,\" to be held in Arlington, VA, in Spring 2006.  The workshop is designed to develop a better definition of the People goal in NSF's strategic plan, \"to develop a . . . globally engaged US workforce of scientists, engineers, technologists, and well-prepared citizens.\"  It will convene a meeting of leaders and stakeholders in international science, engineering, and workforce education to determine the various qualities and metrics of good international collaborations.  The workshop will include up to 80 participants from different sectors and disciplines, from different levels of workforce training and participation, and from selected foreign institutions. \r\n\r\nThe workshop is expected to identify the elements involved in the global engagement of the science, technology, education, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, while mapping the steps that different elements of that workforce can take to become globally engaged.  It will help build a more rigorous and comprehensive understanding of models for building a globally competent science and engineering workforce.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop has the potential to substantially increase the knowledge of what works and how with regard to global engagement of STEM professionals.  This will serve to enhance the quality, competitiveness, and international engagement of the US workforce.  Such engagement will help ensure a steady flow of new, innovative ideas to the US research community.  Advances in electronic technology combined with a vision, strong conceptual framework grounded in theory, protocols and strategies to carry out the vision and benchmarks for success can be revolutionary for advances in science and engineering.",
