 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interdisciplinary workshop \"Finite Element Methods in\r\nScience and Engineering\" will take place at the University \r\nof Texas at El Paso on December 11 - 14, 2006. The goal \r\nof the meeting is to facilitate the communication among \r\nmathematicians, engineers, and software developers working \r\nin various areas related to the Finite Element Method (FEM). \r\nThe rapid development of the FEM is tightly connected with \r\nthe development of the scientific computing hardware. In the \r\nlast 15--20 years we have witnessed a substantial development \r\nof computers. Nowadays a desktop PC for about $1,000 has \r\nmore computing power than the best computer that was available \r\n15--20 years ago. According to realistic estimates, this \r\nrapid development will continue at least for the next 10--15\r\nyears. Thus it will be possible to perform extremely large \r\ncomputations compared to what is possible today.\r\nThe input data for scientific computations always contain \r\nsmaller or larger uncertainties that lead to uncertainties \r\nin the predictions based upon the computed results. Therefore,\r\none of the important open questions is how to formulate this \r\nuncertainty and how to control it. A large potential to be\r\nexploited lies in interval computation: A significant \r\npart of the audience will consist of interval computation \r\nexperts. It is another goal of the meeting to disseminate \r\nthe highly-accurate and efficient modern methods, such as \r\nthe spectral and hp-FEM, into the engineering community. Vice \r\nversa, the mathematicians will benefit from getting a realistic \r\nidea about the interests and needs of the engineering audience. \r\n\r\nThe Finite Element Method (FEM) is the most frequently used \r\nnumerical method for the computer simulation of a large \r\nvariety of processes in science and engineering, such as the \r\nweather, heat transfer, elasticity/plasticity, the motion of \r\nfluids, chemical reactions, electromagnetics, and others. \r\nThe efficient and accurate simulation of these processes finds\r\ndirect applications in areas of national interest, such as  \r\n\r\n(a) reducing the energy consumption of major industrial \r\n    technologies,\r\n(b) weather, hurricane, and flood prediction, \r\n(c) prediction of the ozone layer development and global warming\r\n    effects,\r\n(d) improving the security of spacecrafts located on the orbit \r\n    of the Earth and their crews,\r\n(e) improvement of defense systems such as remote location of \r\n    airplanes and missiles, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe FEM also is used to improve the understanding of natural \r\nphenomena that cannot be measured (such as, for example, the \r\ndynamics of ocean streams, fluid-electromagnetic processes \r\non the surface of the Sun, interaction of the Solar Wind \r\nwith the geomagnetic field of the Earth, etc. The audience will\r\ncomprise 8 invited keynote speakers who are renowned authorities \r\nin the field, approximately 30 contributing speakers and 10 \r\nstudents. The proceedings of the workshop will be published in \r\na quality scientific journal (Journal of Computational and Applied\r\nMathematics). The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), with \r\napproximately 19,000 students of whom 80--85 % are of Hispanic \r\norigin, is one of the largest Hispanic-serving institutions in \r\nthe nation. In addition to its scientific goals, the proposed \r\nworkshop is expected to attract the attention of the scienrific \r\ncommunity to UTEP and its effort to develop a new Ph.D. program \r\nin Computational Science.",
