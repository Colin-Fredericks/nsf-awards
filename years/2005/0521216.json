 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, David Russell in the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University will develop a novel hybrid linear ion trap-ion mobility time of flight mass spectrometer (LIT-IM-MS) for structural characterization of gas-phase ions, including smallmolecules, macromolecules, clusters and nanoparticles.  The LIT-IM-MS instrument will combine LIT technology, a periodic focusing ion-guide mobility drift cell, high-resolution orthogonal-TOFMS and multi-anode, micro-array ion detection, which can be used for rapid (microsec to millisec) post-ionization separation and mass analysis of ions formed by electrospray ionization or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, as well as small molecule ion sources.  In adition, IM-MS structural studies can be performed on products of ion-molecule and ion-ion reactions, solvated species, ion clusters which are weakly bound, and species which are weakly interacting. \r\n\r\nAlthough the primary focus of this project is instrument development, it will provide novel interdisciplinary training opportunities for postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students in modern, cutting-edge mass spectrometry techniques and allied research areas.  The research builds upon existing collaborations between scientists at Texas A&M University, Ionwerks, Inc. in Houston, and scientists at AB/MDS-Sciex in Toronto.  \r\n",
