 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to understand the interrelationship between the interface modification and the final performance of the HA coating.  Such coatings should have a strong bonding strength, stable interface, superior corrosion resistance and excellent biocompatibility suitable for orthopedic and dental applications. The proposed approach is to modify the Ti alloy surface prior to HA coating.  A multifunctional compliant multi-layer will be applied to the surface of the Ti alloy, which consists of a FeCrAl thin film bottom layer, a dense, adherent alpha-alumina subscale, and a nano-whisker alumina top layer.  Futhermore, nano HA coatings will be applied onto the surface of the compliant layer using either electrophoresis or biomimetic assembly.  Both coating techniques will be explored as model systems for comparison.\r\n \r\nThe proposed project has a broader societal impact on various scientific disciplines.  Not only will it deliver a new type of implant material with superior performance for better healthcare, but will also give new insights to overcome the long-standing problems of poor metal-ceramic bonding. The nano-engineered metal surface could also provide a new template for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) applications, such as sensors and actuators for harsh environment and drug delivery devices. This project will result in the training of a number of graduate and undergraduate students in the area of biomaterial interface studies, while exposing them to multidisciplinary inter-university (UConn-UCF) collaboration.  In addition, we will perform K-12 outreach to get high school teachers and students, especially female and under-representative minorities, excited about engineering research.\r\n",
