 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heat and mass transfer across thermal and chemical boundary layers \r\nwithin the mantle play a dominant role in the evolution of the \r\nterrestrial planets. Although the interior of planets is not \r\naccessible for direct observation, there are still seismological, \r\nmineral physics, geodetic, and geochemical data that provide \r\nconstraints on mantle dynamics. Relating these observations to \r\ngeodynamic processes is critical for advancing our understanding of \r\nthe Earth's evolution.\r\n\r\nThis project will use laboratory experiments to characterize the \r\nspatial and temporal evolution of compositional heterogeneity in the \r\nmantle. The focus will be on fine-scale structures produced by \r\nentrainment and stirring. An experimental approach will be used \r\nbecause it is well suited for thermo-chemical convection. The overall \r\ngoals of the experiments  are to 1) elucidate the coupling of heat \r\ntransfer and flow in a compositionally heterogeneous mantle, 2) \r\ncharacterize entrainment processes and quantify entrainment rates, 3) \r\ncharacterize the spatial and temporal evolution of compositional \r\nheterogeneity, 4) understand the initiation and extinction of \r\nthermo-chemical plumes. A second project will focus the interaction \r\nbetween thermo-chemical convection and flow associated with plate \r\nmotions.The results of these studies will provide a basis for \r\ninterpreting and drawing conclusions from indirect observations, in \r\nparticular seismology and  geochemistry.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide a training opportunity for a graduate \r\nstudent, and an introduction to research for undergraduates. Outreach \r\nbeyond the group involved directly in the research will be through \r\nclasses at UC Berkeley, scientific conferences and refereed \r\npublications. This project should lead to new interdisciplinary \r\ncollaborations between the engineering and geodynamics communities.",
