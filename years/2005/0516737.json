 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe Principal Investigator studies mathematical models of \r\nepidemics structured by individual behavior. The models are \r\napplicable to three levels of population epidemiology: (1) in-host \r\npathogenesis of microorganisms, (2) noscocomial (hospital acquired) \r\nepidemics, and (3) large-scale epidemics in society. The research \r\nis applicable to (1) models of prion replication with individual \r\nprion polymers structured by fibril length, (2) models of \r\nantibiotic resistance in hospital settings with individual patients \r\nstructured by age since becoming infected with drug resistant \r\nbacterial strains, and (3) models of viral respiratory epidemics \r\nwith individual infectives structured by age since becoming \r\ninfected. The models consist of nonlinear differential equations \r\nand the methods of research utilize differential equations theory, \r\noperator theory, functional analysis, numerical analysis, and \r\ncomputer simulations. The parametric input of the models is based \r\non experimental and epidemiological data in consultation with \r\nscientific collaborators.\r\n\r\n\tThe goals of the research are (1) to evaluate hypothesized \r\nmechanisms of prion proliferation in the development of diseases \r\nsuch as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) and to \r\npredict the efficacy of therapeutic intervention, (2) to understand \r\nthe evolution of multi-drug antibiotic resistant bacterial strains \r\nin hospitals and to evaluate hospital policies that prevent or \r\nreduce their endemicity, and (3) to analyze the effects of \r\nquarantine and isolation measures in epidemics such as the 2003 \r\nSARS epidemic and the influenza pandemic of 1918. The significance \r\nof the research is its contribution to public health policy in \r\ncontrol of epidemic diseases.\r\n",
