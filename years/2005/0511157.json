 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11) Intellectual Merit: This project is increasing learning in night laboratories for three astronomy courses: two Introductory Astronomy courses - one at Rensselaer and one at Siena College; and an upper division Observational Astronomy course for majors at Rensselaer. The project uses studio-style, cooperative, hands-on, inquiry-based laboratories that challenge the misconceptions of students in all three astronomy courses.  The laboratories use concurrent activities to handle an increasing number of undergraduate students interested in astronomy. Many of the night lab activities are adapted from materials developed at other universities.  The curriculum development includes replacement of the aging control system for the Hirsch Observatory 16\" B&C telescope at Rensselaer, and the acquisition of several small telescopes for Siena College.  Evaluation materials that are specifically suited to telescope observations are being generated as part of this project. Additionally, the changes to the course design are being evaluated with the Astronomy Diagnostic Test (ADT), comparisons to archival IDEA course evaluations, and supplemented with student attitude surveys.\r\nBroader Impacts: This project creates a cooperation between astronomy programs at Siena College and Rensselaer that improves both programs.  The improved laboratory curriculum is being advertised and made available to faculty at other universities who might want to incorporate them in their classes.  The upgrade to the 16\" telescope and the modern CCD and spectrograph already in hand allow for high school and undergraduate research projects through both Rensselaer and Siena, and create a resource for amateur astronomers in New York's Capital District.  The renewed facility enhances the popular public observing nights at the observatory. Each year this program attracts 1000 - 2000 members of the public, many of whom are K-12 students with their parents or teachers.",
