 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jeffrey Zink of the University of California-Los Angeles is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to carry out a broadly-based study of excited electronic states and reactivities of inorganic molecular precursors for photodeposition of metals and semiconductors.  The program consists of three complementary objectives, which will be examined by primarily experimental and some theoretical studies.  The first objective, to characterize spectroscopically the excited electronic states of metal-containing compounds, relies on electronic and resonance Raman spectroscopies. The second objective is to study the single and multiphoton photochemistry and the wavelength dependence of the reactions of these molecules.  Primary photoproducts will be identified, and fundamental understanding of the reaction pathways from specific excited states will be obtained.  The third objective is to photochemically make nano-structures of metals and semiconductors.  The emphasis is on photochemistry in the pores of structured nanoporous materials where the material acts as a template for patterned quantum dots and wires.  Outcomes are expected to enable spectroscopic understanding of excited electronic states, interpretation of the photochemical reactions from these states, and insights into photochemical conditions necessary to deposit desired nano-structured materials.\r\n\r\nMolecules that can be useful as precursors for chemical vapor deposition are a focus of this research project.  The possibility of practical applications in making solids and nano-structures motivates these spectroscopic and photochemical studies. Students will have the opportunity to carry out interdisciplinary research with both fundamental and practical impacts.\r\n",
