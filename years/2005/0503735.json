Motivated by the theorem of Witten and Yau,\r\nthe PI and Wang proved some rigidity and finiteness results for\r\nn-dimensional complete manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from\r\nbelow and has the spectrum of the Laplacian bounded from below by a\r\npositive constant.  One of the main projects is to consider a more\r\nrelaxed hypothesis than the above mentioned.  Instead of assuming that\r\nthe spectrum has a positive lower bound, Li and Wang will consider\r\nmanifolds on which a weighted Poincare inequality is valid.  The more\r\ngeneral hypothesis will enlarge the class of manifolds under\r\nconsideration to include even Euclidean space of dimension at least\r\n3. Other projects related to the wieghted Poincare inequality will\r\nalso be considered. In particular, its relationship to Agmon's\r\ndistance in the elliptic setting, the work of Li-Yau in the linear\r\nparabolic Schroedinger equation setting, and the Perelman's L-length\r\nin the non-linear parabolic (Ricci flow) setting.\r\n\r\nThe work of Witten-Yau drew conclusion on a certain physical model of\r\nthe universe and showed that there is no worm-hole.  A broader purpose\r\nof the project is to seek a substantial generalization of their work\r\nin a geometric setting.  In particular, this research project will\r\ngive further understanding of unbounded (infinite) geometric objects.\r\nIn this sense, a possible long-term effect is the understanding of\r\nother physical models of the universe.  The understanding of geometric\r\nstructure will also have broader impact on material science. This line\r\nof investigation will yield direct implications to the theory of\r\npartial differential equations governing the behavior of many physical\r\nmodels and biological models.  It is also related to many engineering\r\nproblems, such as, liquid crystals, heat transfer, and imaging.\r\n",
