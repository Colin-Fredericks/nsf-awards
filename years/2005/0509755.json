 "awd_abstract_narration": "0509755\r\nZhu\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks renewal of a NSF-sponsored integrated research and education program in\r\nfield, microscopic, and modeling studies of silicate reaction kinetics in a groundwater aquifer the\r\nNavajo sandstone aquifer at Black Mesa, Arizona. One of the fundamental problems in modern\r\nhydrogeology and geochemistry is the orders of magnitude discrepancy between silicate dissolution\r\nrates derived from watersheds and soil profiles versus those derived from laboratory measurements.\r\nThis large discrepancy indicates our lack of basic understanding of the fundamental physical and\r\nchemical processes controlling silicate dissolution kinetics in nature.\r\nThe proposed study will test two hypotheses to explain this discrepancy: (1) A large part of the\r\ndiscrepancy between in situ and laboratory rates results from different saturation states under which\r\nfeldspars dissolve in natural systems and in most laboratory experiments. While most laboratory\r\nexperiments attempt to measure the rate of a single congruent dissolution reaction far from equilibrium,\r\nfield studies measure in situ rates amid a complex web of reaction networks and at a condition very\r\nclose to equilibrium with respect to feldspars. Among these reactions is the precipitation of clay, which\r\nremoves solutes from groundwater and hence promotes continued feldspar dissolution. However,\r\ncontrary to the prevailing assumption that clays are at equilibrium with groundwater, we believe that\r\nclay precipitation is much slower than feldspar dissolution, and hence groundwater chemistry is\r\nconstrained to be close to equilibrium with feldspars. Over time, a steady state of groundwater\r\nchemistry is reached with near constant rates of feldspar dissolution and clay precipitation; and (2) A\r\nleached layer forms on weathered feldspar surfaces, which is an important part of how silicate\r\ndissolution occurs in nature and must be considered in rate laws that properly describe reaction\r\nkinetics.\r\nThe proposed study will test the first hypothesis by analyzing dissolved Al3+ concentrations in\r\nthe aquifer, evaluating saturation indices and their variations along a flow path, and numerical\r\ngeochemical modeling to elucidate the complex network of reactions associated with feldspar\r\ndissolution in aquifers. We aim to establish a theoretical framework for interpreting laboratory\r\nexperiments and field data. To test the second hypothesis, we will characterize microstructures and\r\ndetailed chemistry at the feldspar-clay interfaces using an atomic scale Field Emission Gun\r\nTransmission Electron Microscope. The overall objectives are to advance our understanding of the two\r\nkey possibilities for discrepancies between laboratory and field rates: the diminishing thermodynamic\r\ndrive and the characteristics of weathered feldspar surfaces.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe PIs will integrate the research activities into undergraduate and graduate-level geology\r\ncourses. A summer mentorship program will sponsor undergraduate students, particularly from\r\nunderrepresented groups, to conduct research in the PI's laboratories. Partnerships with the National\r\nEnergy Technology Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory will be developed to facilitate\r\ndissemination and applications of the research results to the carbon sequestration and environmental\r\nrestoration programs.\r\nGroundwater is a key source of drinking water and is essential to life on Earth. Groundwater\r\nalso represents 98% of fresh water readily available to humans. Therefore, reaction rates in aquifers are\r\ncritical to water resource and water quality management, waste disposal, and global warming\r\nmitigation strategies. The findings from this project will therefore contribute to our understanding of\r\nthe environment, and help to build a scientific basis for environmental policies and strategies.",
