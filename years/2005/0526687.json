 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to the University of Missouri under the direction of Dr. Henry Nguyen for partial support of genotyping equipment for plant and animal genomics research.  The project will strengthen the existing science and technology infrastructure that fosters multidisciplinary research and educational activities in genomics and biotechnology.  The genotyping instruments will support the common research goal of dissecting the genetics of complex traits and translating genomics to improve economically important plant and animal species.  The acquisition of these instruments will accelerate progress in the construction of integrated genetic and physical maps and will facilitate genome structure analysis on a scale not currently possible.\r\n\r\nStudents work alongside researchers in organizing, analyzing and interpreting data.  Undergraduate interns working with researchers now have for the first time the unique opportunity to use state-of-the-art technology in their own research projects at the cutting-edge that prepares them for future careers and inspire graduate study.  The broad range of research expertise in genomics and life sciences and the unusually supportive environment at MU have fostered many collaborative interactions that provide outstanding opportunities for undergraduate and graduate training.  This is a gateway for students to pursue projects not otherwise technologically possible or affordable.  The instruments will aid researchers by shortening the time needed for the development of crop cultivars and animal genetic stocks vital to the state's and the nation's agricultural systems.  Researchers will be able to take research discoveries from the lab to the field.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying complex traits such as human disease, fertility, development and well-being. The results of the on-going research programs at MU also will lead to the development of new germplasm and the improvement of existing genetic stocks which will have a significant impact on U.S. and international agricultural productivity and will help ameliorate the impact of certain agricultural practices on the environment.  This instrumentation will place the equipment in an environment where there is an on-going commitment to genomics research, outstanding faculty expertise and a rapidly growing research base in both animal and plant genomics.  \r\n\r\n",
