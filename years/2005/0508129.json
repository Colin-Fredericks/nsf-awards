NJ\r\n\r\nThe recent discovery of several powerful quantum algorithms indicates that a \"quantum-mechanical\" computer might have an enormous advantage over its conventional classical counterpart in solving many difficult problems. However, for successful implementation of quantum computing, the quantum computer elements (a.k.a. qubits) should be sufficiently decoupled (\"protected\") from the environment.  The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop the first scalable element for quantum computation that would be sufficiently protection from environmental noise.  The proposed approach to the solid-state realization of a \"die-hard\" Schrodinger cat is based on nanoscale Josephson junctions protected by nontrivial symmetries.  Development of a fabrication-friendly design of protected superconducting qubits and fabrication of this novel nanodevice will be crucial for successful realization of quantum computation.  The proposed experiments will provide a testing ground for the physical realization of ideas of symmetry-based protection developed in string theory, with the aim of applying them towards computer science.  Implementation of the proposed research will contribute to better understanding of the decoherence processes in numerous quantum nanodevices operating at low temperatures.  The multi-component Educational and Outreach Program, an essential part of the project, is designed to nurture an appreciation for nanoscience, to develop innovative curricula and training modules in nanoscience and nano-engineering, and to disseminate the curricula with a view of creating a more scientifically literate general public. \r\n",
