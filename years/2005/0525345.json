The UN General Assembly in 2001 endorsed the holding of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in two phases.  The first phase was held in Geneva, Switzerland in 2003. Through this award, the  US National Committee for CODATA (the Committee on Data for Science and Technology of the International Council for Science - ICSU) will compile an inventory of US public sector scientific and technical activities that respond to the action items proposed in the WSIS I Agenda for Action for formal submittal by the US Department of State.  This will involve a broad search of internationally focused projects and programs of US government agencies, universities and non-governmental organizations that are responsive to the relevant action items in the WSIS Agenda for Action, with primary focus on developing countries.  The report will be available to the public and widely disseminated.  The U.S. National Committee for CODATA will also work with other foreign science and technology organizations to coordinate activities and develop common positions for WSIS II.\r\n",
