 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robotic scrub technician that anticipates a surgeon's request for an instrument during surgery using robotics technology. Phase II research will build upon the success achieved in Phase I work , and will implement cognitive architecture over the current physical  and sensory system of the robot.  To validate the cognitive architecture, the robot will assist surgeons while performing operations on a physical simulator and in experimental animals.  In this way, errors both robotic and human will come into play.  The robot's actions will be judged using criteria for speed and clinical  appropriateness, and the cognitive architecture will be modified to eliminate undesired  behaviors.   It is expected that the robot will perform in a clinically acceptable way. \r\n\r\nThe commercial impact of this project will be in the area of healthcare. The proposed work addresses the issue of critical shortage of nurse technicians, and could reduce personnel costs in hospitals. Furthermore, the use of robots for this environment may free up human technicians to do more critical tasks. \r\n",
