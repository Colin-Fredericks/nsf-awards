Dr. Madan G. Syal, Michigan State University and Priya Swarup, Director General of the Construction Industry Development Council, New Delhi are the organizers of this workshop.  Its goal is to develop a research agenda on housing and infrastructure that is compatible with addressing issues having to do with urban population movement in both countries.  The objectives are to compile a \"state of the art\" on urban housing and infrastructure research in India and the U.S., identify broader areas appropriate for collaborative research, and develop research directions for future collaborative efforts.\r\n\r\nScope:  This project will be catalytic in promoting international partnerships among researchers working on urban housing and infrastructure, in exchanging information, and in initiating long-term collaborative research that will tackle some of the challenges in critical areas facing both nations.  The US delegation will include senior scientists, postdocs, graduate students, and underrepresented groups in science and engineering.
