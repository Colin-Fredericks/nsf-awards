 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY \r\nThe University of Washington proposes to continue operations of the research vessel Clifford A. Barnes in support NSF-funded scientific research at sea in the year 2005. The ship works primarily in the coastal area of Seattle, including Puget Sound and Lake Washington. This is a five-year cooperative agreement, and funding for the years 2006-2009 will be renegotiated and will depend on the number of days at sea in support of NSF-funded research programs requiring the use of an Oceanographic platform.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe Marine Operations Department of the School of Oceanography of the University of Washington takes pride in providing essential marine science research and educational facilities to NSF-funded investigators. The University of Washington remains committed to managing this facility in a safe, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible manner.  The ship operates as a support platform for NSF funded research programs.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nOceanographic vessels, operated by the UNOLS academic institutions conducting missions funded by NSF, the U.S. Navy, and NOAA, are essential multi-use facilities required to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment. These ships working from the ocean's surface complemented by human-occupied, robotic and, more recently -- autonomous undersea vehicles and sensors, along with aircraft and satellites, continue to provide vital tools in our understanding of the role of the oceans in determining our climate and in studying and accessing the living and non-living resources of the world's seas and sea-beds.\r\n\r\nProvision of this sea-going research and educational facility enables marine scientists from the University of Washington and other institutions nationwide to study natural phenomena and to instruct future scientists and stewards of our marine ecosystems.   Essential to our mission is the provision of educational opportunities, both to students of the marine sciences, and, through educational outreach programs.  Periodically, The University holds a two day open house and outreach event to provide a learning experience for over 3rd grade through high school senior students including tours through the ship facilities and hands-on demonstrations of marine science research guided by faculty, students and ship crewmembers. The University of Washington, with the support of the National Science\r\nFoundation and with coordination by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, remains dedicated to, and focused upon, furthering mankind's understanding of the world ocean, the living and non-living resources therein, and their interactions with the approximately fifty percent of our citizens who live within fifty miles of the shoreline\r\n \r\n\r\n",
