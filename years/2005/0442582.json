 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA modular vertically integrated (longitudinal through the four year program) multidisciplinary (seen in classes in different departments) case study is being developed based on a single project that includes problems that are easily incorporated into lower and upper division engineering courses.  The case study problems increase in complexity with the student's engineering skill set allowing students to develop synthesis skills as their education advances.  The modules provide an opportunity for students to address larger problems than encountered in typical textbooks and to see the project multiple times from multiple perspectives. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this case study program are: increase interest (and retention) in engineering studies, advance the student's ability to work at higher cognitive domains and integrate the case study as a way to introduce students to the multidisciplinary aspect of design development.\r\nThe project is developed around the design and operation of wind turbines.  The project approach consists of three elements.  First, case study modules are developed.  Second, the case studies are piloted simultaneously at the University of Wyoming, Laramie County Community College and Western Wyoming Community College.  Third, extensive assessments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the case studies to meet the project goals.\r\n\r\nThe project includes a significant project assessment activity to assist faculty and other engineering programs to adopt the integrated concept.  The assessment component constitutes approximately 40% of the sponsored faculty time commitment.  The assessment is to be conducted in five steps: problem learning objectives, class evaluations, focus groups, centralized tracking, and electronic portfolios.  The broader implication of this research is two fold.  First, the modular program structure allows adoption to be incremental rather than curricula wide.  Thus, trials at other schools become easier to implement.  Second, the evaluation program provides instructors with the best practices for adoption of the case studies in their own classes.  Complementing the technology, a MS student in History develops the historical model of wind turbine development, thus creating a cross over between the Arts and Science College and the College of Engineering.  Undergraduate engineering students are helping to develop the engineering master module and are involved in proof testing problems prior to sending them to the classroom.\r\n",
