 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work will develop and use models of mantle flow and \r\nconvection to understand the state and evolution of the solid earth. \r\nThe work will include studies of mantle plumes and hotspots; plumes \r\nprovide an indicator of mantle flow throughout the depth of the \r\nmantle, and recent seismic observations of plumes will allow a direct \r\ncomparison of models of mantle flow with observation of plumes that \r\nare moved and distorted by mantle flow. These results will also be \r\nimportant for understanding hotspot tracks and plate motions, as well \r\nas flow in the mantle. The work will also address the motions of \r\nsubducted material and other heterogeneities in the mantle, and will \r\nrelate them to geochemical signatures of heterogeneity in the mantle. \r\nThis will build upon recently developed statistical models of the \r\ndevelopment and evolution of mantle heterogeneity, and will provide a \r\nmeans of relating observed geochemical evidence of heterogeneity with \r\ndynamical processes in the mantle. Further development of flow and \r\nconvection models will be done to deal more realistically with \r\nthermal convection and mantle rheology.  Recent developments for \r\ninversion of models will be applied in order to better constrain our \r\nconclusions. Since the models predict a range of geophysical \r\nphenomena (including the geoid, plate motions, polar wander)  the \r\nresults of the model studies will be systematically applied to these \r\nother phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe work will relate the dynamic processes of flow and convection to \r\nthe emerging seismological pictures of mantle structure, as well as \r\nto the geochemical evolution of the Earth. This will allow a more \r\nunified view of the workings of the Earth's interior on both short \r\nand long time scales. The work will involve the training of graduate \r\nstudents, and will also develop numerical models that will be \r\navailable to other researchers. The results of the work will have \r\nbroad implications for understanding the dynamics and evolution of \r\nthe Earth, and will relate dynamical, tectonic and geochemical views \r\nof the evolution and working of the Earth system, which represents an \r\nextremely active area of earth science research.\r\n",
