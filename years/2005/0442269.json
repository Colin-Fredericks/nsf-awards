 "awd_abstract_narration": "In spite of their name, the first vertebrates evolved without vertebrae, which are the bones in the backs of most living species.  Vertebrae have evolved independently at least five different times, in five different groups of ancient fishes, from a non-bony skeleton.  Biologists have sought for years to understand these critical events in vertebrate evolution. The trouble with reconstructing the evolution of vertebrae is that since events occurred nearly 400 million years ago scientists are unable to directly observe and test natural selection in action.  To understand how selection may have operated, the investigators plan to build, swim, compete, and reproduce artificial fish.  \r\n\r\nIn the computerized and robotic fish, investigators predict that vertebrae will evolve repeatedly in response to selection for increased swimming speed, acceleration, and maneuverability.  To add other realistic effects, successful individuals from one population (computerized or robotic) will be transferred to the other, a process of immigration thought to be a key factor driving large-scale evolutionary change in real biological systems.  If the evolution of these artificial fish does not produce vertebrae, it is unlikely that the vertebrae of real fish evolved in response to selection for enhanced swimming performance and navigation.  Thus, the investigators plan to use artificial vertebrates, constructed to mimic real vertebrates, and to examine the feasibility of different evolutionary scenarios.    \r\n\r\nThroughout the four years of this program, the project offers 28 undergraduates a two-year combined apprenticeship-mentorship experience in research.  Beginning with a summer research apprenticeship, cohorts of students work as teams, under the mentorship of a returning student and one of the principal investigators, to master technique, conduct and analyze experiments, and interpret and present results.  By their second year in the program, each student has developed into an independent investigator, conducting a project of their own design for a senior research thesis and returning as a peer mentor for incoming research apprentices.  The project places particular emphasis on involving students from underrepresented groups, having students present their results at professional scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed scientific papers, and providing support for students to continue in research science at the graduate school level. \r\n\r\nAdditional information about this research and training program may be found at:\r\nhttp://faculty.vassar.edu/jolong/vertebrae.html.\r\n",
