 "awd_abstract_narration": "Irving R. Epstein (Brandeis University), Rustem F. Ismagilov (University of Chicago), Anna Lin (Duke University) and Jonathan Sweedler (University of Chicago) are jointly supported to study the chemical processes involved in glial-neuronal signaling. The collaborative project includes fabrication of topologically well-defined networks of microchannels to support neuronal and neuron-glial networks, time-resolved imaging of the calcium levels in both neurons and glial cells of rat hippocampus cultures, specific stimulation of spatially and temporally defined glial cells using microfluidic tools,  advanced data analysis and modeling. \r\n\r\nRecent research suggests that glial cells are actively involved in chemical communication with and between neurons and other glia. Goals of this project include a better understanding of the role of glial cells in individual synapses and in neural networks, elucidation of the interaction between the network topology and the dynamics of individual elements (cells), and the development and evaluation of methods that can be applied to the analysis of complex chemical and biological networks. This project is funded through the Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program (CRC) and provides outstanding opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students to acquire knowledge and skills in neurochemistry and bioanalytical chemistry.",
