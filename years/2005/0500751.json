 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project addresses questions in the representation theory\r\nof affine Lie algebras and their quantum analogs.  The\r\nproblems to be studied are motivated by  applications to\r\nmathematical physics  and  combinatorics.  One of the goals of\r\nthe project is to make a rigorous connection between\r\ncombinatorial results on crystals and the corresponding\r\nresults on representations of the affine Lie algebra.    This\r\ninvolves studying the category of finite dimensional\r\nrepresentations of the affine algebra, the closely related\r\ncurrent algebra and the quantum analogs of these algebras for\r\ngeneric values of the quantum parameter. This category of\r\nrepresentations is not semisimple and exhibits features\r\nsimilar to modular representation theory.  This  is an\r\nimportant motivation for the study of Weyl modules and of\r\nextensions between irreducible representations of these\r\nalgebras   undertaken by the project.  The study of Weyl\r\nmodules and the conjecture on their dimension made by Chari\r\nand Pressley is related to the conjectures of Feigin and Loktev\r\non the fusion product of finite dimensional irreducible\r\nrepresentations of a simple Lie algebra   coming from their\r\nstudy on conformal field theory . It is expected that the\r\nresults on the Weyl modules and their quotients  the\r\nKirrillov/Reshetikhin modules will provide further insight\r\ninto and also lead to generalizations of the conjectures and\r\nconstructions of Feigin and Loktev. An important open problem\r\n is to determine a character formula for the irreducible\r\nfinite dimensional representations \r\n of the quantum affine algebras analogous to the Weyl\r\ncharacter formula. A first step is to  study this problem for\r\nthe Kirrillov/Reshetikhin modules and the project pursues this by\r\nseeing if a conjecture of Dorey made  in his study of affine\r\nToda field theories is correct for these modules.\r\n\r\nThe representation theory of affine Lie algebras and the\r\nquantum algebras is an area where there  is intense research\r\nactivity. It  has had significant impact on other branches of\r\nmathematics such as number theory, knot theory, combinatorics\r\nto name a few. It has had fruitful interaction with\r\nmathematical physics, in affine Toda field theories, and in\r\nsolvable models in statistical mechanics where the tensor\r\nproduct of representations of affine algebras conjecturally\r\ndescribes the interactions or fusing of particles. The PI's\r\nstudy should confirm some of these theories and also have\r\napplications in the representation theory of affine Lie\r\nalgebras of positive level and vertex algebra constructions of\r\nsuch representations.\r\n",
