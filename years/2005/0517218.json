 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: Peter D. Nagy, \r\nProposal number: 0517218\r\nSuppression of viral RNA recombination by host genes. \r\n\r\nEmergence of new RNA viruses is frequently due to RNA recombination, a process that joins noncontiguous RNA segments together. Novel combinations of genes, sequence motifs or regulatory RNA sequences resulting from recombination may cause dramatic changes in the infectious properties of RNA viruses. This, in turn, helps viruses to jump species, to overcome natural resistance mechanisms and renders vaccines and other antiviral methods ineffective. In order to advance our understanding of the role of the host in viral RNA recombination, the PI has recently developed yeast-based replication and recombination systems for a model plant virus, Cucumber necrosis tombusvirus (CNV). This approach led to the identification of five host genes suppressing viral RNA recombination. To characterize the roles of the identified host factors in RNA recombination, the PI will use the advanced genetics tools available for yeast in combination with biochemical approaches. \r\n\r\nPotential impact of the proposed work: The research described here will lead to better understanding of the effect of host genes on RNA recombination and the role of the host in virus evolution. Because the role of host genes in viral RNA recombination is currently unknown, the proposed work may dramatically change our view of the role of the host in viral RNA recombination. Broader impacts of the proposed work: This grant will allow training of high school and undergraduate students in the PI's laboratory. This research will promote interdisciplinary (plant pathology, biochemistry, genetics) learning. The research holds promise of benefiting society by leading to groundbreaking results in the area of virus recombination/evolution and the emergence of new viruses.\r\n",
