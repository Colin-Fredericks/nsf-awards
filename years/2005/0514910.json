 "awd_abstract_narration": "Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics VIII is the eighth workshop in the\r\nseries that was begun in 1991. These workshops aim to advance\r\nstatistical practice by examining Bayesian methods in specific applied\r\ncontexts. The workshops are held in odd years at Carnegie Mellon\r\nUniversity in early fall. The eighth workshop is planned for September\r\n16--17, 2005.\r\n \r\nThe objectives of the workshop, \"Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics\r\nVIII\" is are to explore the interplay of statistical theory and\r\npractice in the context of substantive scientific research; to promote\r\nthe continued development of Bayesian statistics by highlighting\r\nproblems in the sciences that require non-standard approaches; to\r\nprovide an opportunity for scientists and statisticians to present\r\ntheir work in depth, highlighting both the scientific background and\r\nthe analytical approaches; and to encourage dissemination of the\r\nfindings presented at the workshop via well-documented and\r\npeer-reviewed case studies.  As it has evolved, this workshop series\r\nhas become an important meeting for younger researchers in Bayesian\r\nstatistics.  The workshop aims to encourage young researchers,\r\nincluding graduate students, to present their applied work; provide a\r\nsmall meeting atmosphere to facilitate the interaction of young\r\nresearchers with senior colleagues; expose young researchers to\r\nimportant challenges and opportunities in collaborative research; and\r\ninclude as participants women, under-represented minorities and\r\npersons with disabilities who might benefit from the small workshop\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n",
