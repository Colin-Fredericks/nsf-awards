 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Prof. Emanuel Waddell of Morgan State University will develop an in-situ near infrared Raman probe laser ablation system for chemistry research.  This multi-wavelength pulsed UV laser ablation system with a controllable xy-stage will allow for the fabrication of microfluidic systems and analytical sensors in polymer substrates.  It will also be capable of performing in-situ investigations of the polymer surface via near infrared Raman spectroscopy.  The instrument will result in a clearer understanding of the surface chemistry that results as a function of laser ablation, and will provide insight into the effects of local atmosphere and ablation wavelength on the resulting moieties on the polymer surface. \r\n\r\nThe in-situ near infrared Raman proble laser ablation system is a unique instrument as it will allow the in-situ, real-time investigation of the polymer surface during the ablation process.  The near-infrared Raman analysis will provide a nondestructive method to probe chemical reactions on the polymer surface.   Development of this instrument will significantly enhance research in the polymer sciences.  \r\n",
