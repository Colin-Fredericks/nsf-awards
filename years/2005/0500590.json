 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will apply methods from\r\ncomputability theory and other branches of logic and theoretical computer\r\nscience to study the effective content and proof-theoretic strength of\r\nvarious areas of mathematics. In particular, he will concentrate on\r\neffective randomness, computable model theory, and reverse mathematics and\r\neffectiveness of combinatorial principles. He will study the relative\r\nrandomness of reals, using methods from computability theory and\r\nalgorithmic information theory, concentrating in particular on the\r\nK-trivial reals, a natural class of reals that are far from random with\r\nwith many compelling properties and applications. In computable model\r\ntheory, he will continue the development of methods to address issues\r\nraised by effectivizing model-theoretic notions, including the\r\nrelationships between the different ways that a given structure may be\r\neffectivized; the relationships between the degree of effectivity of\r\ndifferent models of theories with few models; and the degrees of special\r\nmodels, such as prime, homogeneous, and saturated models, of complete\r\ndecidable theories. He will also study computability-theoretic and\r\nproof-theoretic aspects of combinatorial principles such as versions of\r\nRamsey's Theorem and principles related to partial and linear orderings,\r\nexploiting the connections between effective mathematics and the reverse\r\nmathematics program.\r\n\r\nThe study of the effective content of mathematics has received increasing\r\nattention in the last few decades. It is a natural outgrowth of the\r\nefforts to understand and formalize the notions of algorithm and\r\ncomputable function undertaken in the early part of the twentieth century.\r\nIt is of both pure mathematical and foundational interest, and has\r\nimportant connections with computer science. This project aims to further\r\nour understanding of how structure affects computability, and how\r\ncomputability interacts with other fundamental notions of modern\r\nmathematics and foundations of mathematics, such as randomness and\r\nproof-theoretic strength. Computability theorists have developed a highly\r\nsuccessful theory of relative computational complexity of sets of numbers,\r\nwhich, in addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest, has been\r\ninfluential in theoretical computer science. One of the goals of this\r\nproject is to continue the development of an emerging parallel theory of\r\nrelative algorithmic randomness, which can act as a theoretical framework\r\nin which to consider questions such as: When should we say that an\r\ninfinite set is more random than another, and what consequences does the\r\nrelative randomness of sets have for their relative computational\r\ncomplexity?\r\n\r\n",
