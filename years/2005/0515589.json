 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Building Demand for Math Literacy\" is a comprehensive project designed to increase arithmetic and algebraic mathematical competency among underserved youth, as well as high school and college students trained as Math Literacy Workers.  This project builds on the success of the nationally renowned Algebra Project that is designed to foster mathematics achievement among inner city youth.  Math Literacy Workers will deliver after school activities to African-American and Hispanic youth in grades 3-6.   In addition to offering weekly math literacy workshops, Math Literacy Workers will also develop and implement Community Events for Mathematics Literacy and activities for families in the following cities:  Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Jackson, MS; Miami, FL; Yuma, AZ; New Orleans, LA; San Francisco, CA and Newark, DE.  The strategic impact will be demonstrated in the knowledge gained about the impact of diverse learning environments on mathematics literacy, effective strategies for family support of math learning, and the impact of culturally relevant software.  Collaborators include the Algebra Project, the TIZ Media Foundation, and the Illinois Institute of Technology, as well as a host of community-based and educational partners.  The project deliverables consist of a corps of trained Math Literacy Workers, workshops for youth, training materials and multimedia learning modules.  It is anticipated this project will impact over 4,000 youth in grades 3-6, 700 high school and college students, and almost 4,000 family and community participants.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
