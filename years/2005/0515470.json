 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  The California Science Center (CSC) proposes to develop Goosebumps!, a 5,000 sq.ft. traveling exhibition on the science behind feeling scared for the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative.  The exhibition will utilize emotional engagement, as well as aspects of popular culture, to involve visitors in aspects of physiology, neurology, psychology and sociology that relate to the fear response.  Exhibit experiences will evoke the fear response in a nonthreatening way and then make those responses the subject of personal exploration.  The exhibition will also provide an opportunity for visitors to participate in a Caltech scientific research project based on the fear response.  The Science Museum of Minnesota will collaborate with CSC in developing this exhibition.\r\n\r\nBROADER  IMPACT:  The exhibition will reach some five million visitors during a five-year tour to 12 other science centers, including the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, PA; the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History in Fort Worth, TX; the Museum of Science in Boston, MA; the Science Museum of Minnesota in St. Paul, MN; the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) in Portland, OR; and the Columbus Museum of Science and Industry (COSI) in Columbus, OH after opening at the California Science Center in Los Angeles, CA.  It will advance the field through offering new ways to engage the public in science through explicit focus on visitor emotional engagement.",
