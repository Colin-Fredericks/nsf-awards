 "awd_abstract_narration": "Critical questions in contemporary biology increasingly require mathematical analyses for their answers, making better cross-disciplinary training for biologists and applied mathematicians an important national need. This program is addressing this need through a new comprehensive undergraduate program --- RUTE: Research for Undergraduates in Theoretical Ecology.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to (1) recruit talented students, particularly students from underrepresented demographic groups, to pursue cross-disciplinary opportunities and careers in biology and mathematics; (2) establish a curriculum that provides freshman and sophomore students majoring in biology or mathematics with a better understanding of the interrelationship between mathematics and biology in addressing contemporary research problems and prepares a selected number for an intensive interdisciplinary research experience by the beginning of the junior year; (3) creates a meaningful, long-term (four semester), well-structured interdisciplinary research experience for eight talented biology and mathematics undergraduates annually; and (4) facilitates a transition from undergraduate studies to graduate studies and interdisciplinary research careers in the critical interdisciplinary area of environmental biology.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The RUTE program directly addresses the need to better prepare talented students for research careers in environmental biology. Each year, eight RUTE Scholars are being selected competitively from an applicant pool consisting of biology majors who have completed Calculus I for Biology and Mathematical Methods for Biology, and mathematics majors who have completed General Genetics and Ecology and Evolution. These RUTE Scholars take a summer course in Research Skills for Theoretical Ecology, and are subsequently grouped into two research teams, each of which consists of two biology students and two mathematics students, at least one faculty mentor from each of the two disciplines, and a biology graduate student. The four-term research experience consists of i) intensive study of the theory and field methods relevant to the research project; ii) ecological research at a field site; iii) mathematical analysis using their field data and mathematical modeling related to the ecological research; and iv) a capstone course in which the teams complete their research and prepare it for presentation. The program design ensures sufficient time and mentoring for success in research preparation, collection of field data, mathematical modeling and analysis, and preparation of results for dissemination, leading to a successful transition to graduate school and career.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The RUTE program is developing a sustainable infrastructure for interdisciplinary research, thereby increasing faculty competitiveness and contributions to new knowledge. RUTE is attracting and preparing more students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to conduct research at the interface between mathematics and biology, thereby increasing the number of students pursuing graduate studies and engaging in interdisciplinary research. A Symposium on Undergraduate Research in Ecology is held annually and disseminates RUTE research results to other institutions in the Great Plains and gives students from those institutions a forum for presentation of their own research results. The RUTE program leads to models of effective cross-disciplinary training, in general, and mathematical training for biologists, in particular.\r\n\r\n",
