As an initial step toward this goal, the PIs are developing an introductory course that provides undergraduate engineering, science and management students with the skills needed to critically examine environmental issues in product design and manufacturing, and to arrive at economically viable solutions to these problems.  The course is structured on a modular design, where each topic incorporates case-based pedagogy, industrially relevant examples and regular assessment - a design that is adapted from the Ford Motor Company's Partnership for Advanced Studies classroom materials.  Instructional content is being compiled by Kettering University faculty members in conjunction with industry experts and partner academics.  Progress in course development is being disseminated at professional conferences.",
