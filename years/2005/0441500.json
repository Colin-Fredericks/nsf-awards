 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the zero-valent iron technology for removing biological contaminants from water.  Results of the Phase I study are expected to demonstrate the potential feasibility of this technology and will serve as a basis for conducting a Phase II study before commercialization.  A recent study by the University of Delaware in 2003 (You, et al., 2004) demonstrated that zero-valent iron could potentially remove and inactivate viral and other microbial agents in water. This discovery suggests the possibility for the development of an innovative security technology.  This process for virus removal from drinking water is straight forward, economic and can be readily retrofitted to the sand filter units of the existing drinking water treatment plants or adopted to meet mobile drinking water needs, thus reducing concerns of drinking water contaminated with viruses by terrorist activities.\r\n\r\nA recent report by the Department of Homeland Security suggests that the presence of chlorine tanks in drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities for disinfection use also may attract terrorist attacks thereby presenting a security risk. The use of zero-valent and nano-iron particles in drinking water treatment plants could reduce or possibly eliminate the current chlorine use for disinfection thereby mitigating this potential terrorist threat. This technology could also be used in developing mobile drinking water units for use by the US military or other field operations in remote regions.",
