 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies till from the glaciers that drain the East Antarctic ice sheet through the Transantarctic Mountains into the Ross Embayment. Glaciers from both East and West Antarctica converge in this area, creating the Ross Ice Shelf, whose size is a sensitive indicator of global climate change. This work will determine till provenance through petrologic, geochemical, and isotopic studies. Its goal is to understand the flow paths of ice sheets into this area during the late Quaternary period, especially focused on the last glacial maximum approximately 18,000 yrs ago. This knowledge is critical to modeling ice sheet formation and behavior. While the East Antarctic ice sheet is considered stable, West Antarctica hosts rapidly flowing ice streams that may be affected by global climate change. The work will also improve our knowledge of the crustal rocks of East Antarctica. Covered by kilometer-thick ice sheets, its basic geology is largely unknown. The provenance studies will also be used in field-based curriculum workshops for Indiana Earth Science educators. Other broader impacts include graduate and undergraduate education, and improving society's understanding of global climate change. Antarctica's ice sheets play a pivotal role in atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and are key factors in sea-level rise. Models of ice sheet behavior rely on accurate reconstructions of past ice sheet configurations that this study will provide.",
