 "awd_abstract_narration": "Presently there is a need for more effective ways to integrate statistical methodologies such as Design of Experiments (DOE) into the engineering curriculum. We are using a fundamentals-based numerical simulation of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to develop a virtual reactor where students will learn and then actually apply DOE.  Associated educational materials are also being developed. The simulation of the virtual reactor is based on fundamental principles of mass transfer and chemical reaction, obscured by added \"noise.\"  However, rather than having access to the entire output of model, the film thicknesses are given to students only at the select points within the wafer and from wafer to wafer that they have decided to \"measure.\" Student assessment will be based not only on the ultimate reactor performance but also on the cost of experimentation. The virtual reactor allows students a broader and more realistic experience in using the DOE methodology for process improvement - as if they were operating an actual industrial reactor.  The Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory is leading the project evaluation while a five-member advisory committee consists of engineers and statisticians from academia (OSU, University of Oregon) and industry (LSI Logic, Intel, WaferTech).",
