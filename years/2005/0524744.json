 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic, environmental and reliability issues are changing the face of electricity generation and supply. Centralized generating facilities are giving way to smaller, more distributed generators. This evolution is well underway, but the technical tools and control structures required for safe and reliable system operation are not yet in place. Centralized control of distributed resources ensures a coordinated response to large disturbances. However such controls are at odds with the level of autonomy desired by equipment owners. A totally decentralized control structure, on the other hand, achieves the desired level of autonomy, but at the expense of reduced overall system performance. Compromises will be explored through a market-based control framework. Underlying the proposed research project is a laboratory scale microgrid at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This system consists of a radial network, with interspersed loads and generation, and appropriate protection and communication. It will serve as a benchmark system for testing novel control strategies.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This project brings together expertise in the areas of power electronics, control and system dynamics. The team is well placed to provide innovative solutions to operation and control problems that are holding back the wide-spread implementation of distributed generation. Broader impact: This project addresses a number of issues that are currently impeding the up-take of distributed generation technology. The proposed benchmark system will provide a valuable resource for verifying control designs. It will allow students to bridge between theoretical investigations and practical implementation. The project will provide a platform for developing a new graduate course that exposes students to wide-ranging aspects of distributed generation systems.\r\n",
