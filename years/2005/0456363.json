 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research deals with topics in Higher Dimensional Complex \r\nAlgebraic Geometry. It is mainly focused on natural questions in\r\nthe birational geometry of complex projective varieties\r\nsuch as the study of the pluricanonical maps of varieties of general type\r\nand understanding how rational curves and holomorphic 1-forms influence the \r\ngeometry of these varieties.\r\nSome of the main problems to be investigated are: For what values of m is the \r\nm-th pluricanonical map of a variety of general type birational?\r\nAre the fibers of a resolution of a variety with mild singularities always \r\nrationally chain connected? \r\nIs it the case that on a smooth projective variety of general type,\r\nholomorphic 1-forms always have non-empty zero set?\r\n\r\nThe classification of complex algebraic surfaces was initiated by the\r\nItalian school at the beginning of the twentieth century. Its main features\r\nhave been long understood.\r\nIn Higher Dimensional Complex Algebraic Geometry, one hopes to extend \r\nthe theory surfaces to dimensions grater or equal to three.\r\nThe minimal model program, for example aims to show, as in the case of\r\nsurfaces, that any variety is either covered by rational curves or\r\nbirationally equivalent to a minimal model.\r\nThe minimal model program is complete only in dimension 3, but it has \r\ninspired many important advances in algebraic geometry.\r\nThis project hopes to answer some of the questions and conjectures that \r\nnaturally arise in this context.",
