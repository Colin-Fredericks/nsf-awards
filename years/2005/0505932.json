 "awd_abstract_narration": "In one-period risk measurement, the risky objects are future\r\nnet worths modelled by elements of a linear space of real-valued random variables\r\nand a risk measure is a mapping from this space of random variables to the real numbers.\r\nTypical examples of future net worths are the accounting value of a\r\nfirm's equity, the surplus of an insurance company or the market\r\nvalue of a portfolio of financial securities.\r\nIn a dynamic setup one can model the future evolution of net\r\nworths with stochastic processes and risks can be calculated at\r\ninitial and later times. A process of risk measures is called time-consistent if\r\nit assigns to a future financial position the same risk irrespective of whether it is\r\ncalculated directly or in two steps backward in time. The purpose of this project\r\nis to understand the structure of time-consistent processes of monetary risk measures,\r\nfind good examples and study their implementation on a computer. It involves methods\r\nfrom the general theory of stochastic processes, locally convex vector spaces as\r\nwell as techniques from linear and convex optimization.\r\nMonetary risk measures are formally strongly related\r\nto pricing in incomplete markets, hedging under constraints,\r\nmaxmin expected utility functionals,\r\nexact games in cooperative game theory as well as to\r\ncoherent lower previsions in the theory of imprecise probabilities.\r\nSince in most of these theories the dynamical aspects are not elaborated\r\nyet, research on the dynamics of monetary risk measures will\r\nalso produce new results in other areas of mathematics and economics.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is expected to lead to a new class of risk\r\nmeasures and algorithms for their numerical calculations. The new\r\nrisk measures will be time-consistent and have good properties for the purposes\r\nof pricing, allocation of risk capital and fair premium calculation. This will lead\r\nto better methods for the regulation of the banking and insurance\r\nindustry, the internal risk management of corporations and a\r\nrealistic assessment of risks the society bears through federal\r\nagencies like the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which\r\nguarantees pension benefits promised by insolvent pension plans.\r\n",
