 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maize cells consist of interconnected but discrete compartments that help to maintain cellular function and order. Identifying proteins that localize to these compartments is critical to understanding developmental and physiological processes in maize, which in turn provides guiding information for crop improvement. This project makes use of recent advances in genomics to identify proteins that localize to diverse cellular compartments. The project will generate reporter lines that express proteins tagged with a fluorescent marker. Using confocal microscopy, the lines will display visual information about when and where the tagged proteins are expressed and how specific proteins may be interacting and functioning. Genes for tagging will provide complete marker coverage of cellular compartments. Several resources will be used for gene selection, including known genes from the auxin/cytokinin hormone pathway and from the RAB-mediated vesicle trafficking pathways. Gene selections will also be guided by public gene models generated from maize genome sequencing projects and by specific requests from the maize research community. The outcomes of the project will include a set of stable tagged lines expressing fluorescent protein-derived tags for 100 proteins, which will represent full coverage of cellular compartments. The tagged gene constructs will be freely available from the Jackson lab, and seeds of transgenic lines will be available from the Maize Genetics Stock Center. \r\n\r\nAccess to project outcomes:\r\nData on characterization of the lines at the cellular level will be compiled in a localization catalog posted on a public website at http://maize.tigr.org/cellgenomics.  Cell biology workshops will help train the scientific user community in analysis of the tagged lines using confocal microscopy. The project will also serve tribal community colleges in the Rocky Mountain West by enhancing education in cell and molecular biology. The project will therefore generate resources that bridge cell biology and functional genomics and will provide training across diverse scientific and learning communities. Training and outreach activities will be reported on the Plant Genome Research Outreach Portal at http://www.plantgdb.org/pgrop/pgrop.php.\r\n",
