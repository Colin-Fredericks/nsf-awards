The GSMT is envisioned to be a public/private partnership requiring approximately equal contributions from both funding sources for design, construction and operation. Funds from this award will further the GSMT effort in the following areas:\r\n\r\n(1)\tThe design and development phase for a 30-meter diameter segmented-mirror, optical/infrared telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT); \r\n(2)\tThe design and development phase another alternative extremely large telescope (ELT) concept, such as the 22-meter Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), to the point where its performance, cost and risk can be assessed; \r\n(3)\tTechnology development common to both ELT concepts; \r\n(4)\tConceptual designs for two instruments: one for TMT and one for the alternative ELT concept; \r\n(5)\tSupport for an education and public outreach program; and \r\n(6)\tSupport for a Theory Challenge program aimed at engaging theorists in shaping the design of ELTs. \r\n\r\nThe first of these investments will leverage $35M in non-federal funding (donated by the Moore Foundation to the California Institute of Technology and the University of California), plus funds requested by the Association of Canadian Universities for Research in Astronomy from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation. This investment will enable the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy to participate on behalf of the U.S. community in a partnership to advance the design to a fully-costed preliminary design by 2008. \r\n\r\nThe second major investment will support a design study for an alternate technical approach that will be funded as a competitive subaward. At this time, the GMT is the only competitive alternative design concept.\r\n\r\nThe power of Extremely Large Telescopes to address questions that excite the imagination of the public, as well as students and teachers, provides a natural focus for a vigorous program of science education and public outreach activities. Activities to be supported by this award emphasize national education needs in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), and build on extant activities within AURA and the partnering institutions in the TMT project.  \r\n",
