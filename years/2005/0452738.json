 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nA wide range of social indicators turned sharply negative for Blacks in the late 1980s. The PI's intend to examine whether crack cocaine can explain these patterns. Despite a general appreciation of the potential importance of crack, very little empirical analysis has been done to date, due in part to the absence of quantitative measures of crack. The proposed research agenda proceeds in three steps. The first two of these are concerned with intellectual merit and the third with the broader impact of the proposed research. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nFirst, the PI's develop an identification strategy for constructing an index of crack that\r\ncan be estimated annually at the city, county, or state level. The basic insight underlying\r\nthe index is that the arrival of crack causes a wide range of previously uncorrelated\r\noutcomes (e.g. youth homicide, cocaine-related emergency visits, low birth weight\r\nbabies, fraction of children in foster care, etc.) to covary. Changes in these correlations\r\nbefore and after crack provide an indirect means of measuring the prevalence of crack.\r\nThe PI's formalize this intuition using the tools of factor analysis. Preliminary estimation\r\nusing a subset of the available data demonstrates that the crack index reproduces many of\r\nthe spatial and temporal patterns described in ethnographic and popular accounts of the\r\ncrack epidemic.\r\nThe second part of the research agenda is to use the crack index to examine how\r\nmuch of the reversal of black fortunes in the late 1980s and early 1990s is attributable to\r\ncrack. Preliminary analysis suggests that the rise and fall of crack had an enormous\r\nimpact on youth homicide, but much smaller effects on homicide rates of adults, as well\r\nas violent and property crime more generally. The PI's find important effects of crack on fetal\r\ndeath, low birth weight babies, the placement of children into foster care, and the death\r\nrate of children aged one to four. Crack does not, however, appear to have an impact on\r\npoverty or unemployment rates.\r\nUnderstanding the timing of crack's rise and fall, and the corresponding social\r\nimpact is the intellectual merit of the proposal.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe third aspect of the research agenda is to analyze the extent to which failure to\r\nadequately control for crack may have led to spurious results in prior research. For\r\ninstance, it has been claimed that apparent crime reductions induced by concealed\r\nweapons laws or legalized abortion are actually due to the omission of crack as a control.\r\nBecause crack appears to be an important determinant of outcomes, and the impact of\r\ncrack is not uniform across states or years (or even within a state and year), the types of\r\ncontrols typically included in empirical studies will not properly control for crack. In\r\naddition to the PI's reanalyzing a number of prior studies, the crack index will be made\r\nfreely available to other researchers for inclusion in future analyses, increasing the\r\npotential for the work to have broad impacts.",
