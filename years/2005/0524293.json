El-Shenawee, U of Arkansas\r\n\r\n\tThis integrative systems proposal focuses on developing a new compact microwave imaging system (hardware and software) aiming to reconstruct tumor images of diameters less than 5 mm. The investigators intend to answer two main questions associated with microwave imaging systems as; (i) what are the most efficient antennas to be used as transmitter and/or receivers in a radar-based imaging system for breast cancer detection? (ii) which imaging algorithms are capable of processing the received signals and produce reconstructed images in realistic time frame? The investigators are proposing to build an advanced ultra wideband compact imaging sensor that is specifically designed for breast cancer imaging. This sensor will be an antenna array composed of dielectric wideband elements. Each element will be a dielectric resonator antenna that can be flexible in shape, small in size and light in weight, making the sensor practical for use on the breast. Also, the investigators are proposing to develop and hybridize potential imaging algorithms to efficiently and rapidly reconstruct the tumor shape and location using received signals. The intellectual merits of this proposal focus on designing and building an advanced compact ultra wideband lightweight microwave sensor; developing efficient and robust imaging algorithms to be integrated with the hardware part of the system; and validating the developed algorithms on real data to be collected by the sensors. The proposed hardware sensor will be used to validate the imaging algorithm and once proven successful the investigators will seek funding in collaboration with medical researchers for clinical use. \r\nThe broader impact of this project will be on women's health in general and on breast cancer disease in particular. The new system will offer an economical and less painful option for many women. This project will influence the sensor technology and data acquisition techniques associated with the microwave imaging modality. The proposed research will have significant bearing on the graduate and the undergraduate research opportunities at the University of Arkansas and the University of Mississippi.\r\n",
