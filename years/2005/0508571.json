 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrogen is often considered the most important element structuring terrestrial ecosystems.  Human activities now add more inorganic nitrogen (IN) to ecosystems than all natural processes combined, resulting in losses of biodiversity, increased pollution of groundwater, and often leading to weedy invasive species displacing natives.  However, the mechanisms behind these community shifts remain unexplained. New studies exploring the importance of organic nitrogen (ON) to plants offer exciting and novel hypotheses.  Recent research suggests that many temperate grassland communities are comprised of species adapted to nutrient poor environments, with few species able to capitalize on the relatively rare condition of abundant IN.  Consequently, when IN becomes readily available, either through experimental addition or through deposition from human activities, most species present are unable to utilize this resource and are rapidly displaced by opportunistic weeds.  My research will investigate drivers of biodiversity loss following IN addition by exploring how species differ in their abilities to use IN versus ON, as well as predict communities that are particularly sensitive to N deposition.  I am currently involved in mentoring several undergraduate students from underrepresented groups who are conducting ecological research and by developing teaching modules on biodiversity for the Sunrise Park Middle School, and by working on similar collaborative projects with researchers from the United States and Europe.",
