 "awd_abstract_narration": "The motion picture industry in Hollywood is undergoing a transformative shift.  Since the late 1990s, the motion picture industries have been experiencing significant spatial re-positioning in the location of specific labor tasks.  According to industry information from the Hollywood Reporter and Variety, international locations such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Czech Republic, and South Africa have emerged as the most frequent locations for motion picture productions originating from Los Angeles.  This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the spatial redefinition of the motion picture production industry with an eye to these changes, specifically through the lens of \"runaway production\".  The two top satellite production locations, Australia and Canada, will be studied closely but within the context of the secondary production centers (New Zealand, Czech Republic and South Africa) to assess the extent that industrial restructuring in these locations is taking place, both between these satellite production locations and Hollywood.  The objectives of this investigation are (1) to assess the rate of decentralization from Hollywood and its causes, (2) to analyze the changing qualitative nature of runaway task packages, (3) to discuss the competitive advantages of satellite production centers, (4) to analyze the shifting spatial pattern of the satellite production centers, (5) to assess the present and future international division of labor in film and (6) to analyze the policy context of Hollywood and the satellite production centers.  The research strategy is based on four components for data collection:  (1) a survey of current projects filming in the top five satellite production locations, (2) mapping of production companies in satellite production centers, (3) interviews with production companies and studios in Canada (Toronto and Vancouver) and Australia (Melbourne and Sydney), and (4) institutional/agency interviews for the Australian and Canadian contexts.\r\n\r\nThis project will expand on Froebel's concept of the new international division of labor by showing how production functions are becoming more spatially differentiated internationally, with \"below-the-line\" functions taking place in foreign satellite locations.  This project is expected to inform debates about the current exportation of labor tasks by companies who are seeking cheaper labor markets.  By investigating the current mobility of motion picture production, the research will inform the presence of production relocation to other global locations which are increasingly exhibiting similar production location traits.  The impact of this study is not limited to the motion picture industry.  International shifts in labor are also becoming evident in sectors such as clothing, finance, software design, insurance, telecommunications and a variety of manufacturing and service industries.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\n",
