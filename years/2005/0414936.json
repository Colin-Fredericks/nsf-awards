 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support of the work of Professor Andrzej Rajca of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE.  The research will extend the PI's research on high-spin polyradicals and chiral conjugated pi-systems.  In the area of polyradicals, the PI will synthesize molecules having multiple unpaired electrons that are expected to be stable at ambient temperatures.  Stability will be enhanced through the use of nitroxides as carriers of electron spin.  These will be materials with high-spin electronic ground states that exhibit strong ferromagnetic coupling, giving them the potential to function as organic magnets.  In the area of chiral conjugated systems, the PI will synthesize enantiopure helicenes with more than seven fused aromatic rings in order to understand the principles governing the rational design of strongly chiral organic materials.\r\n\r\nThese multidisciplinary studies are expected to provide important fundamental information that will contribute to the development of lightweight organic magnets and of chiral materials with novel optical and electronic properties.  In addition, the research will provide students with diverse training in physical organic chemistry, organic synthesis, solid-state chemistry, and magnetism.   \r\n  \r\n",
