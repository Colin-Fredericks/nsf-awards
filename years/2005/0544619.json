Practical applications of fundamental results in these areas are beginning to appear across the entire spectrum of science.  Research in this area is characterized by international and interdisciplinary cooperation.  The aim of this International Workshop on Applied Dynamical Systems to be held at The Centre de Recherches Mathematiques in Montreal, Canada, during October 15-16, 2005, is to provide a forum for the discussion of developments in Non-linear Dynamics and Bifurcation Theory.  We will make special efforts to promote communications between the theoretical and applied communities by bringing together experts with very different backgrounds and expertise within the engineering, science, and applied mathematics communities, and promoting themes of common interest in classical and emerging areas of Applied Dynamical Systems research.  Travel support provided by this project will enable a group of 12 US researchers to attend this workshop.  An important product of this activity will be the education of a new generation of truly multidisciplinary graduate students in nonlinear dynamics and related fields.  We anticipate significant numbers of participants from Canada and the US.  It will provide an opportunity for graduate students to have a global picture in these fields and set directions in their research plans, and to establish new research links.\r\n\r\n",
