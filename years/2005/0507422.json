 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geologic Timeline for the Rocks of Mohave County, Arizona, \r\nEducational Boulder Display\r\n\r\nMohave Community College is constructing a geologic timeline that correlates continental positions, major geological events, and major life form developments to chronologically arranged geologic specimens of an existing educational boulder display.  A series of signs with informational artwork depicts each geologic period and complements and completes an existing educational display.  This display educates the public about the geology of Mohave County, which includes the stratigraphy of the Grand Canyon and Zion National Parks.  \r\n\tThis project provides members of the community with a scientific and structured understanding of their geologic environment. It also provides an educational resource for students as they study the local geology in relation to geologic time.  The geologic timeline, in conjunction with the educational boulder display, concentrates in one place a wide variety of geological wonders that are scattered throughout Mohave County.  Viewers of the timeline experience geological detail up-close and can appreciate the relationship among Earth's development, geologic events, and history of life.  \r\nMohave Community College is partnering with a local school district, a charter high school, and a local gem and mineral club.  This project is designed to instill in the public, faculty, and students of the partner schools, an enduring interest in the study and appreciation of the geosciences.\r\n",
