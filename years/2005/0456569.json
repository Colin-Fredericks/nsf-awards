 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAs average American homes have become larger in size, their shapes have deviated from rectangular boxes with simple roofs to irregular plan forms necessitating complex roof configurations. The performance of these newer buildings was severely tested by Hurricane Charley, the first Category 4 hurricane to hit Florida in 12 years. A preliminary post-Charley survey found that roof damage in newer homes was in many instances limited to missing tiles or shingles. This damage therefore provides a qualitative map of the wind pressure distribution and its intensity in irregular structures under hurricane force winds. Such data from actual buildings is invaluable for calibrating numerical and experimental analyses of irregular structures.\r\nThe aim of this study is to compile wind damage data systematically and expeditiously before it is irretrievably lost. The focus of the data collection will be (1) roofs of selected irregular structures with missing tiles or shingles as discussed, (2) open structures such as gas stations and carports - the failure of these structures under category 1 wind loads (e.g. due to Hurricane Charley and more recently Hurricane Frances as they traversed across Polk County) suggests possible deficiencies in code provisions that may require rectification through model testing and (3) floor slabs of failed commercial buildings to determine if they assisted footings in supporting uplift loads as suggested by testing and analysis. Evidence from failed structures will lead to more effective design, construction and retrofit. The information gathered will enable future calibration of computational models and/or wind tunnel testing for determining wind pressure coefficients in irregular, low-rise buildings. Emphasis will be placed on obtaining quality and complete data for the selected structures.\r\n",
