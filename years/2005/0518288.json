 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Richard B. Cole and Guangdi Wang of the University of New Orleans are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to:  a) characterize the effect of ambient reactive gases on potential distributions within the electrospray  emitter in mass spectrometry; b) acquire and evaluate a full array of current measurements to improve the understanding of the essential role that electrochemical reactions play in the functioning and success of electrospray device; c) develop a  fast electrochemistry / electrospray mass spectrometry technique to investigate electrochemical reaction mechanisms that are not accessible by other means; and d) develop a new method to make thermochemical measurements on electrospray-generated complexes, and apply it to measure bond dissociation energies of lithium ion adducts, and halide adducts of lipids having molecular weights in the range of 300-700 Daltons\r\n\r\nThe low ion yield from electrospray sources is a major hindrance to better mass spectrometric analysis.  The mechanism of ion formation for a wide variety of molecular species is not known. This research will advance our understanding of the array of electrochemical reactions within the electrospray emitter and the rates at which they may occur.  Detailed understanding of this inherent aspect of electrospray enhances the ionization of analytes and improves their detection and analysis by mass spectrometry.  The project includes a plan for a cooperative partnership between the University of New Orleans and Xavier University of Louisiana (an HBCU) to promote exposure of students at both institutions to advanced concepts and methodologies in mass spectrometry.\r\n",
