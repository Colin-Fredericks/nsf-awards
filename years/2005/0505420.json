 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMathematical Finance not only has relevance to asset pricing, credit risk, \r\nand the term structure of interest rates (for example), but also presents \r\nto mathematicians a new way of looking at research in probability, since \r\nthe types of questions that need to be answered are no longer motivated by \r\nphysics or subjects such as electrical engineering.  Building on the \r\nfoundation of the First Cornell Seminar in Finance, the Second will again \r\nbring together leading researchers from the Northeast and selected points \r\nbeyond for an exchange of ideas in seminar format.  The basic themes will \r\nbe asset pricing and hedging, viscosity solution based control theory, \r\ncredit risk, interest rates, and numerical methods and data analysis using \r\nmodern statistical techniques.\r\n\r\nFundamental research in finance has helped to change the world of commerce \r\nduring the last 30 years, and has arguably contributed to the explosive \r\ngrowth in wealth.  The key idea is the transfer of risk: modern financial \r\ntools allow one party to sell an aspect of a risky exposure to another \r\nparty, and to do so at a fair price. Often a way for the buyer of the risk \r\nto hedge against the risk (a hedging strategy) can also be provided in \r\nterms of mathematical formulae.   A problem is, however, that while the \r\nmodels have led to huge advances, they are still often crude approximations \r\nof reality, and also most of the advances have come from the creation of \r\nfinancial derivatives in markets such as the stock market.  Of current \r\ninterest is the development of analogous tools one could use in other \r\nmarkets, such as credit risk.  For example, two companies issuing similar \r\nbonds may command different prices due to the markets' differing \r\nassessments of their risk of not repaying the bonds.  How to model this \r\nrisk mathematically is as yet poorly understood, and the subject of intense \r\nresearch efforts.  This conference will bring together leading scholars, \r\nyoung researchers, and advanced graduate students for an intellectual \r\nexchange involving both formal presentations of research advances and also \r\nprivate discussions of special research topics.  It will be held at Cornell \r\nUniversity, one of the nation's leading institutions of higher learning.",
