 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a new manufacturing process for producing  light weight, strong and fire-resistant polymeric foams by using innovative nanotechnology. The team will synthesize nanocomposites using polymers with a high CO2 affinity as matrices, an environmentally friendly process compared to current chlorofluorocarbon blowing agents. To improve fire-resistance, surfactant-free and water-expandable polymer/clay nanocomposites will also be prepared by suspension polymerization of inverse emulsion. The project will further expand the polymer nanocomposite family by exploring the utilization of different nanoparticles, such as carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Since surfactants are not needed, there is no fire hazard problem. These nanocomposites will be compounded into different polymer matrices and then foamed into high performance products through both batch and continuous extrusion foaming processes using environmentally benign CO2. The foamability and mechanical properties of these nanocomposites and their blends will be investigated. \r\n\r\nCommercially, nanocomposite foams are aimed at both structural and insulation\r\nApplications and have the potential in structural applications to replace solid polymers. The proposed manufacturing process may achieve better energy savings in automotive, aerospace, infrastructure and housing industries. The potential market for this technology is huge because polymer foams touch nearly every aspect of modern life. The U.S. market for polymer foams was more than 7.4 billion pounds in 2001.\r\n",
