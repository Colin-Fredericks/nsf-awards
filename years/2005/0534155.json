 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workshop: Sino-US Collaborative Research On\r\nCritical Transitions In History Of Life\r\nConveners\r\nZhe-Xi Luo (PI), Douglas H. Erwin & Samual A. Bowring\r\nIntellectual Merit of Proposed Activity\r\nThe history of earth and its diverse life are characterized by several critical transitions.\r\nThese include the origins of metazoan animal phyla during the Neoproterozoic, the great\r\nbiotic extinction and subsequent recovery through the Permo-Triassic transition, the\r\nMesozoic origins of flower plants and living vertebrate lineages, and the radiation of\r\nmammals in the early Cenozoic. A critical issue in understanding these transitions is the\r\nrelative importance of ecological processes and response to changes in physical\r\nenvironment. Over the past decade important discoveries and research advances for\r\nunderstanding these great evolutionary transitions have came from China and the United\r\nStates, the two countries with remarkable scientific resources and complementary\r\nstrength in geological and paleontological research.\r\nThe PI and co-coveners propose to hold a workshop to bring together the US and Chinese\r\nscientists most active in these research areas, to exchange ideas and data, and to nurture a\r\nmore effective network of scientists in geochronology, sedimentology, isotope and\r\norganic geochemistry, and paleontology in both countries.\r\nFollowing preliminary discussion among US and Chinese organizers in the summer of\r\n2005, 10-12 American scientists will meet with Chinese counterparts from major national\r\nresearch institutes and universities in this proposed workshop on the Critical Transitions\r\nIn History of Life in Washington, DC in the fall of 2005. This workshop will explore the\r\npotential for future collaborative studies on the major transitions in history of life and\r\ntheir associated environmental changes. Particular focus will be given to development of\r\nintegrated research in geochronology, isotope and organic geochemistry, sedimentary\r\ngeology and paleontology. Long-term plans for collaborative work and a reciprocal visit\r\nby US scientists to relevant institutions and research sites in China will be made.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe proposed workshop has broad implications for the US and Chinese Earth Sciences\r\ncommunity. The major transitions in the history of life are of interest not only to\r\npaleontologists, but also to geochronologists, isotope and organic geochemists, and\r\nsedimentologists, and are most likely to stimulate integrated multidisciplinary research\r\nbetween the US and Chinese scientists. It is expected that these activities will create a\r\nnetwork of Chinese and American scientists with common goals so as to facilitate the\r\nsharing of knowledge and information. The steering committee will strive to create\r\nopportunity for junior scientists and students to be involved in international collaboration.",
