 "awd_abstract_narration": "0552469  Shah  In the proposed project we aim at substituting organic acid used in ligand mediated copper Fenton's reaction with chelating polymers. The hypothesis behind the proposal is that the polymer when immersed in copper solution would chelate the metal ion.\r\nHydrogen peroxide (which is readily available at low price) would be added to contaminated areas and the metal containing polymer sheets immersed into the floodwaters.  After incubation of predetermined time period, polymeric sheets will be removed. Hydrogen peroxide is converted to water, free radicals generated by the\r\nPolymer-Copper-Peroxide system will \r\n- Kill the micro-organism present.\r\n- Degrade the PAHs and other hazardous aromoatic hydrocarbons to safe products.\r\n- The free chelating sites on the polymeric sheet would chelate the heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic.  Two types of polymer-metal sheets will be developed. One that would remain near the surface of the water and other that would sink to the bottom of contaminated site.\r\n",
