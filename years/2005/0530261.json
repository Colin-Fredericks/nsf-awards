 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed research addresses the design issues for nanotechnologies, with a special focus on the architectural level and the integration level. The research tasks include investigation and development of efficient design methodologies, algorithms, and microarchitectures for the emerging nanotechnologies, including both nano-CMOS and technology candidates beyond CMOS.  We plan to use nano-FPGA (nano-Field Programmable Gate Assembly) as an architecture/platform driver to explore various issues in nanotechnology designs. The regularity and reconfigurability makes nano-FPGA an ideal candidate to support the reliability and complexity requirements of designs in nanotechnologies. Based on this driver, we will explore novel techniques to achieve highly reliable and error-resilient designs to overcome likely defects and non-deterministic behavior of new nanodevices. The outcome of this research project will be innovative design methodologies, tools, and algorithms that enable efficient and economic design solutions for nanotechnologies as soon as they become available and practical. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) has identified nanoelectronics, one of the next generation of information technology devices, as one of nine \"Grand Challenge\" areas because of the potentially significant economic and societal impact of innovations in this area. While most innovations in nanotechnology at this stage are primarily at the level of individual devices, it is at the systems level where the true potential of nanotechnology can be realized.   The rather unique focus of this project on design methodologies and systems-level issues, such as design of architectures, robustness, and error-resilience, will help accelerate the development of viable nanoelectronic systems. On the other hand, at this early stage, nanotechnology research requires extensive investment and is truly pre-competitive in nature, which makes it an ideal candidate for international collaboration so that we can leverage the global investment and coordinate research efforts in this area.  Therefore, we will explore international collaboration opportunities with researchers and educators from leading universities in Taiwan, and China in this target area. In addition to research collaboration, we will initiate an educational program that will enable U.S. students and young researchers to visit the participating countries for workshops, joint research, student exchanges, etc.  It will help them appreciate the culture, technology, and economic development of these regions, thus developing the scientific talents and social interaction skills required of future leaders with international vision and experience. \r\n",
