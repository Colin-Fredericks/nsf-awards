 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n0542681\r\nLaurie Williams\r\nNorth Carolina State University\r\n\r\nA special one-day Academy for Software Engineering Educators & Trainers (henceforth referred to as\r\nthe Academy will be offered on the day prior to the start of The Conference on Software Engineering\r\nEducation and Training (CSEE&T). The purpose of the Academy is to provide an opportunity for software\r\nengineering educators and trainers to learn from master instructors in a highly dynamic, hands-on,\r\ninteractive environment. The Academy will provide a learning opportunity to PhD students who will be\r\nentering academic careers in the near term, new faculty members, and mid-career faculty members who\r\nare beginning to teach software engineering course(s). Subsequent to the Academy, Academy attendees\r\nwill participate in CSEET conference sessions, providing further educational opportunity and exposing\r\nthem to the software engineering education community and to integrating research and education in their\r\ncareers. This purpose of this proposal is to seek funding for two US student and three US new faculty\r\nAcademy attendees.\r\nIntellectual merit criteria. The attendees of the Academy will obtain essential knowledge on structuring\r\nsoftware engineering courses. The students of Academy attendees will gain from the attendance of their\r\ninstructor. Additionally, attendees will gain exposure to the software engineering education research\r\ncommunity which will help them integrate research and education in the future. NSF is focusing on this\r\nintegration. PI Williams is the program chair of the CSEET conference for 2006. She has been on the\r\nprogram committee for this conference in 2002, 2003, and 2005 and presented a keynote at CSEET\r\n2005. The Academy is an innovative means of instructing and preparing new software engineering\r\nfaculty. Students and new faculty interested in obtaining NSF funding for the Academy will apply for\r\nfunding. The CSEET steering committee will chose five of these applications for funding. Students will\r\nsubmit receipts to be reimbursed. Necessary administrative resources for this project will be provided by\r\nNorth Carolina State University.\r\nBroad impact criteria The purpose of the academy is to improve attendee understanding of software\r\nengineering topics that are taught in university and industry courses. These activities promote teaching,\r\ntraining, and learning. In our selection process, we will focus on increasing the participation of women\r\nand underrepresented minorities. Additionally, we will focus on the selection of attendees from institution\r\nwhere alternative funding is less likely to be available. The Academy will enhance the infrastructure for\r\nnew faculty to obtain guidance on teaching software engineering courses. Academy instructors will be\r\nencouraged to share resources (presentation slides, webcast) on the conference web site. Additionally,\r\nresources can be cross-posted on the Open Seminar for Software Engineering, a freely-available\r\nsoftware engineering web resource. The Academy will prepare faculty for teaching software engineering\r\ncourses. Society will benefit from having better prepared students who are taught by these faculty\r\nmembers.",
