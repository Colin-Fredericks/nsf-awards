 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project seeks to develop a new, ultrasensitive laser based explosives detection system (EDS). The system will be capable of rapidly detecting and discriminating among common explosives materials in a timescale commensurate with that of existing passenger screening systems that are presently used in airports. The proposed EDS technology is based on a combination of a new, rapidly and widely tunable laser system with a novel optical cavity enhanced absorption method. The research effort comprises constructing and testing a bench top version of the system that is suitably configured for use in the middle infrared, where explosives can be detected via their characteristic spectral signatures. If successful, the instrument will be capable of significantly exceeding the sensitivity level of existing commercial EDS sensors, as well as potentially providing an orthogonal sensor platform.\r\n\r\nThe sensor will be suitable for passenger, baggage, and cargo screening applications, and will be engineered specifically for integration as a plug-in replacement or parallel technology to existing screening systems. In addition to advancing laser technology, the project has the potential to benefit society by assuring safer transportation to the general public. The ability to rapidly scan the middle infrared spectral region with high absorption sensitivity will enable the rapid detection of numerous trace chemical species including toxic industrial chemicals, chemical warfare agents, and industrial pollutants. \r\n",
