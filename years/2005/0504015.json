 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Michael Glascock and his colleagues will continue the operation of the Archaeometry Laboratory at the University of Missouri Research Reactor Center (MURR). The MURR Archaeometry Laboratory is one of the most comprehensive US-based laboratories dedicated to chemical characterization studies of archaeological materials. The analytical techniques available at MURR include neutron activation analysis (NAA), inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) of solutions using high resolution and quadrupole instruments, laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS), and conventional- and portable-XRF. These multi-analytical/multi-elemental techniques permit the quantification of major, minor and trace elements simultaneously and with considerable accuracy and precision in a wide range of archaeological materials. \r\n \r\nThe MURR facility also plays an important role in training students in the advantages and disadvantages of applying specific analytical techniques to archaeological questions.  Frequently, archaeology students are invited to spend time on site visiting the Missouri laboratory where they are taught a variety of methods for interpreting archaeological data and have direct access to the large compositional databases containing more than 70,000 previous analyses of pottery, obsidian, and chert by INAA.  Online access to these databases is continuing to be developed and improved for integration with databases from other laboratories.\r\n \r\nIn addition to continued support of student and senior archaeology research projects, Dr. Glascock will also work toward the development of calibration standards and analytical procedures that facilitate the integration of data from multiple analytical techniques (e.g., INAA, ICP-MS, XRF). This effort will benefit both new and mature analytical programs involved in archaeometric compositional analysis research. Dr. Glascock and his colleagues also will continue to oversee the development and application of LA-ICP-MS to archaeological materials and will facilitate the development of portable-XRF for archaeometric research. \r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of this grant are that elemental data generated in collaboration with colleagues and students will be continue to be used to address important topics related to past human and social dynamics, such as, mobility patterns and migrations of people, cultural responses to conflict and stress, community social organization, the development of craft production and specialization, and the creation and maintenance of social boundaries and identity. Compositional data also can improve understanding of ancient technologies and (through analysis of skeletal remains) can provide insight into prehistoric diet and nutrition.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n",
