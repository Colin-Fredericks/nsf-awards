 "awd_abstract_narration": "(59-Engineering:Other) A multidisciplinary team of faculty at Clemson is working to \r\ndeliver more effective Statics and Dynamics instruction. Their work builds particularly on\r\ntwo other NSF-funded projects. The project is developing cooperative learning\r\nactivities that are complementary to those developed through Statics: The Next\r\nGeneration and delivering them using the Student-Centered Activities for Large\r\nEnrollment University Programs (SCALE-UP) model, teaching large studio classes\r\nwhere the primary emphasis is on learning by guided inquiry instead of by\r\nlistening. The present lecture approach is being revised significantly and the\r\ntwo sequential courses are being integrated according to the needs of students in\r\nmechanical engineering and civil engineering. A partnership to include learning\r\nexercises from multivariate calculus is helping students transfer knowledge and\r\ndevelop a more robust understanding of the course content. Improvements in student \r\nlearning is being measured in terms of normalized gain on existing conceptual tests. \r\nFaculty development activities, including workshops and mentoring, are nurturing a \r\ncadre of faculty who are learning to design and implement cooperative learning\r\nactivities. The mentoring of faculty in large-enrollment classes is helping\r\nexpand the use of these teaching methods throughout the curriculum, and the\r\nmaterials developed in this project are applicable to statics and dynamics\r\ncourses at other universities.",
