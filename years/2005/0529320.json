Wang & Ernesto Indacochea\r\nUniversity of Illinois, Chicago\r\n\r\nThe objective of this investigation is to develop advanced nanostructured hydrogen sensors with high sensitivity, selectivity, fast response and able to work at low temperatures. Recent research thrusts for alternate methods of power generation has turned to production and storage of H2 as alternative fuel, as it is the most environmental friendly fuel. It is foreseen that H2 will become a basic energy infrastructure to power future generations. However it is also recognized that if it is not handled properly (e.g. transportation, storage), it is as dangerous as any other fuel available. Safety, therefore, is a natural concern in all aspects of H2 energy. Ultra sensitive hydrogen sensors are urgently needed for fast detection of hydrogen leakage at any level, such as the H2 leaks in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). Current commercial sensors are generally too large in size to deploy and have a very slow response. Emerging nanosensor research is currently in its early stage but shows promises in the areas of rapid detection and sensitivity. The PIs proposed to investigate a new type of Pd nanotubes that has recently been developed, and for which the initial results show high selectivity, sensitivity and fast response times at room temperature. These nanotubes will be incorporated into the design and fabrication of a nanostructured MOS sensor which will be evaluated for H2 detection under laboratory conditions and field testing. Development and certification of a nanostructured sensor to detect low levels of H2 at room temperature will have an immediate economic and environmental benefit by improving the safety on detecting, handling and storing H2. \r\n\r\nThis is a project supported under the sensor initiative NSF 05-526.\r\n\r\n",
