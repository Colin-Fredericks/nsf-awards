Parent\r\n\r\nInstitution:  \t\tAmerican Chemical Society \r\n\r\nThe American Chemical Society has partnered over the past several years with NSF, EPA, and other federal funding agencies to support an annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference. The topic of this meeting focuses on the design, development, and implementation of chemical processes and products that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances in a way that is both feasible and economically viable.  Green chemistry and engineering are important tools in preventing pollution at the source and in providing solutions to long-term global challenges.\r\nFunding from NSF will provide scholarships for undergraduate and graduate student participation in the Joint Meeting of the Second Conference on Green and Sustainable Chemistry and the Ninth Annual Green Chemistry & Engineering Conference, June 20-24, 2005, at the Hotel Washington in Washington, DC. The theme of the meeting is \"Taking Measure of Green Progress: Opportunities to Meet Global Challenges\".  Students will have the opportunity to engage in topics not commonly encountered in traditional chemistry courses and conferences. Technical talks will be given in such areas as alternative solvents, catalysis, renewable resources, and benign synthesis and processing. This highly interdisciplinary meeting will be an excellent opportunity for students to present their research, learn the latest developments in green chemistry and chemical engineering, and expose themselves to the broader economic, social and political context in which these developments occur. Students will have an excellent opportunity to learn about the newest research developments in their areas, dialog with other academic, industrial, and governmental researchers, advance their participation in professional societies, and expand their network of professional contacts.\r\nA diverse group of students from geographical locations across the United States has received scholarships through NSF funding to attend these meetings.   Nearly all students have been involved in oral or poster presentations.  The international aspect of this meeting will prove a much broader perspective on green chemistry and engineering, and the impact on student education and development should be very significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
