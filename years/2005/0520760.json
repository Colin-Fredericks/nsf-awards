 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical 1/f noise has received much attention in the last twenty years because it is used as a measure of the quality of semiconductor materials, devices and semiconductor lasers. It creates especially many problems in the applications of semiconductor devices and lasers used in communication and in instrumentation. With improved technology associated with software, the present challenge is the ability to measure the 1/f noise with precision. The 1/f noise acquisition instrumentation will help to set up a complete and an extensive research which will shed considerable light on the causes and possible reduction of 1/f noise in solids, semiconductor materials and lasers. The results will be used to determine the temperature dependence, properties and performance of semiconductors and metal films. The broader impacts of the research include the training of undergraduate minority students for carrying out challenging noise research projects during the academic year as well as the summer. The academic year component will focus on strengthening the student's science and engineering background through new educational technology in the noise measurement laboratory while the summer research activities will be designed to strengthen the preparation and research skills of students majoring in science and engineering disciplines.",
