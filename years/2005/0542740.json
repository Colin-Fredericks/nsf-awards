 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Fuel cells are being actively developed because they can provide a more efficient and pollution-free method for converting chemical energy to electricity.  While fuel cell electrodes typically have a complex micro- or nano-structure that is critically important in determining their performance, current methods for measuring electrode structure are quite limited.  The aim of the proposed project is to develop a powerful new method - focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy - for fully characterizing three-dimensional electrode microstructure.  \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: A main aim of this research is to fully understand the relationships between electrode processing, structure, properties, and performance.  This will ultimately allow design of higher performance and more stable electrode microstructures, as well as providing processing information needed to achieve these structures.  The new methods and understanding will be included in new university course materials and in educational modules designed to reach a broad spectrum of age groups. This research is a collaborative effort with University of Washington and University of Michigan.\r\n\r\n",
