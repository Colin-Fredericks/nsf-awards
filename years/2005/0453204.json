 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a research experience for undergraduates (REU) site that provides 10 archaeology students a hands-on, six-week summer research training experience and public outreach activities at the Homolovi Ruins State Park in Arizona.  Students conduct their own research projects investigating changes in the economic and social organization of ancient communities in the American Southwest.  As part of their research experience, students also work on public outreach projects, which provide a context to discuss the ethical responsibilities of archaeologists and museum professionals.  The goal of the program is for students to understand how to integrate information from archaeological fieldwork with broader questions about human behavior and to be able to communicate this often complex and highly technical knowledge to a nonprofessional audience.  Intellectual Merits- The research contributes to the understanding of the origins and development of ancient village life-the type of community organization that was the foundation of more complex societies.  Research focuses on household decision-making strategies during a period of fundamental change in the American Southwest.  Because similar shifts in domestic architecture and village organization have been documented in other areas of the world, the research has interesting implications beyond the immediate geographic area.  Broader Impacts- The REU site enhances the information available to general audiences about archaeology and Native Peoples in Northeastern Arizona.  Through the contributions of student research projects to the interpretive programs at the Homolovi Ruins State Park, the project will increase the public understanding of the scientific methods and processes used by archaeologists to interpret the remains they unearth.  This type of approach is important in the United States where pseudoscientific interpretations of archaeological remains often capture the public's imagination and archaeological sites are being destroyed by vandalism on a daily basis.",
