 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Robert Noyce Scholarship Program at Duke University provides funding to train eleven secondary science and mathematics teachers per year over a three-year period for a total of 33 students completing the master's degree in teaching. The recruitment of under-represented minorities and undergraduates who might not consider teaching is emphasized. The Program is increasing the number of highly trained mathematics and science teachers who have advanced study in their teaching discipline and extended teaching experience under the direction of highly skilled mentors. By training in the Durham Public Schools, a high-need school system, these teachers are well prepared to begin their careers in similar school systems where the need for qualified mathematics and science teachers is greatest. Students complete five graduate level courses in their teaching field in addition to course work in education. The teaching internship takes place under the direction of a career teacher who has received extensive training in mentoring and adult development.  The internship covers one full semester and a portion of the second semester so that all participating students gain extensive experience teaching high school students in a variety of disciplinary courses and at various performance levels. Each teaching intern works with high school students who are not fluent in English and with students who have been identified with special learning needs in addition to high performing students in advanced placement classes. \r\n\r\n",
