 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThere is a long and fruitful history of interaction between\r\nvarious branches of analysis and probability theory.  This\r\nproposal focuses furthering these connections, both by applying\r\nrecent results in probability to analyze dynamical systems, and\r\nusing ergodic theory and other branches of analysis, to study\r\nquestions in probability.  Two probabilistic models which have\r\nseen large contributions from ergodic theory are first passage\r\npercolation and Richardson's growth model. The work in this\r\nproposal aims to apply techniques from ergodic theory to study\r\nquestions of coexistence of multiple infections in Richardson's\r\ngrowth models and the existence of one sided geodesics in first\r\npassage percolation. One proposed application of probability\r\nresults to study dynamical systems is the use of domino tilings\r\nthe possible ergodic properties of two dimensional subshifts of\r\nfinite type. Another is to use recent advances in necessary\r\nconditions for ergodicity of g measures to answer a longstanding\r\nopen question about the necessary conditions modulus of continuity\r\nof an Anosov map on the torus which ensures ergodicity of the\r\ncorresponding measure preserving system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMathematicians have long used probabilistic models to gain\r\nunderstanding of complex physical, biological and social systems.\r\nExamples of these models include the Ising model to understand the\r\nprocess of magnetization, random graphs to study the spread of\r\ndisease through sexual contact, and Richardson's growth model to\r\nunderstand the spread of infection. This proposal aims to\r\ncontribute to this field by using new techniques in the\r\nmathematical field of dynamical systems to analyze probabilistic\r\nmodels inspired by physics and biology.\r\n\r\n",
