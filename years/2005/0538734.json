 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sottile  will work on projects ranging from research in algebraic geometry \r\nand algebraic combinatorics, to strengthening links between algebraic\r\ngeometry and applied  science, to educational outreach.  His work in algebraic \r\ngeometry will focus  on concrete aspects of flag manifolds and their  Schubert\r\nvarieties, involving a range  of problems  from the  real Schubert  calculus,  from \r\nextensions  of  quantum  Schubert calculus,  from combinatorial  problems in  \r\nSchubert  calculus, and  from  the geometry  of Schubert  varieties.  This  will \r\ndeepen  our understanding  of computation, combinatorics,  and real-number \r\nphenomena  in algebraic   geometry.  Sottile will study structural properties of\r\ncertain combinatorial  Hopf algebras, work that has  applications to polytopes, \r\nto the  Schubert calculus, and to certain  combinatorial   schemes in  physics.   \r\nHe  is  actively engaged  in applications   of  computational  algebraic   \r\ngeometry  to   other  fields,particularly discrete geometry and  the applied sciences.  \r\nA unifying theme in  this scientific work  is studying  concrete mathematical  \r\nobjects using computer experimentation to inform theoretical work.\r\n\r\nWhile  algebraic  geometry is  concerned  with  abstract  questions about \r\nsolutions to equations,  its value to other disciplines  is largely through concrete \r\nobjects and computational tools.  A major activity of this project is  to  help \r\ndisseminate  the  modern  computational  tools from  algebraic geometry to \r\nother fields,  including the applied sciences, through research collaboration,  \r\norganizing  conferences,  and  co-authoring a  textbook  on algebraic  geometry  \r\nfor applied scientists.  Sottile will  also organize an outreach program for talented \r\nhigh school students in Western Massachusetts with the particular  goal of\r\nserving the needs of  students in nearby urban areas,  many of  whom come\r\nfrom groups  traditionally  underrepresented in science.   The  intention  of  \r\nthis  work:  the  research,  the  technology transfer, the service and the outreach, \r\nis to provide a firm foundation for a lifetime of integrated research and \r\neducational activities for Sottile.\r\n",
