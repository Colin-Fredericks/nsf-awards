 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of nanostructured electrodes for micro polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells based on carbon nanotubes. The primary goal of this project is to create a synergistic integration of nanotechnology and fuel cell technology in the manufacturing of such electrodes. The research objectives of this effort are to study the growth of carbon nanotube arrays with controlled tube diameters and number density, deposit highly dispersed platinum nanoparticles on the carbon nanotube arrays, develop fabrication techniques for the nanostructured electrodes, and characterize the nanostructured electrodes in micro fuel cells. The educational objectives of this effort are to train graduate and undergraduate students, recruit women and minority students to participate in the proposed research, and outreach to high school students to attract them to an engineering profession. This GOALI project will establish a close partnership between the academic (University of Missouri-Rolla) and industrial (NanoLab, Inc. in Newton, MA) parties. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the research will lead to a better understanding of manufacturing methodologies of fuel cell electrodes and new knowledge in nanomaterials synthesis and microcomponent fabrication. It will result in a new design of fuel cell electrode structures that incorporate nanostructured materials and their components. The results of the research will benefit the research communities in nanotechnology and fuel cells. They may lead to potential technologies for commercialization, and help industries in related areas develop new products and create new jobs. The work in general will benefit clean energy production technologies, alleviate dependence on petroleum imports, improve air quality, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n\r\n",
