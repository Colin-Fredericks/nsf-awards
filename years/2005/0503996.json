 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Polymers (West) Gordon Research Conference (GRC) seeks to supplement the available funds for travel support to enhance participation of post doctoral and senior graduate students at this meeting in Ventura, California, January 9-14, 2005. This request is for $4,000 for supporting 8 supplemental travel packages at nominally $500/person.  Funding request by junior faculty will also be considered provided they can demonstrate no other source of support for travel to the conference.  These funds will be used to cover costs associated with travel to the conference (economy air fare, bus fare to the conference from LAX) and the GRC registration fees, which cover all housing costs and meals.\r\n\r\nThe invited speakers at the Polymers (West) GRC are internationally known, world class experts in their respective areas of polymer chemistry, physics and engineering.  Having such distinguished leading experts participate as speakers and discussion leaders is critical to assuring that the GRC is highly successful.  Another criterion that is viewed as an important measure of the success of a GRC is attendance and active participation of young researchers.  For many of us, including the Chair and Co-Chair of this conference, early career attendance at GRC's provided scientific stimulation, development of professional relationships, and collaborations with other scientists that have been important in our professional development.   Our motivation for the present request is to give as many young polymer scientist as possible the opportunity to experience their first GRC in Ventura next January.  Due to the limited funding for support of young participants provided by the GRC, NSF funding is critical to achieving this goal.\r\n\r\nThe technical merit of this proposal is to facilitate enhanced participation of young polymer scientists in a Gordon Research Conference that addresses several key areas at the frontiers of polymer science and engineering.  The broader impact lies in the cultivation and development of tomorrow's leaders in the polymer field, with an eye toward enhanced diversity.\r\n\r\n",
