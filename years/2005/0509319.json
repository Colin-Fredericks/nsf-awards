 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0331315\r\nAngela Gibney\r\n\r\nThe moduli space of curves is an algebraic variety (more accurately a\r\nscheme or a stack) whose points parametrize isomorphism classes of\r\nalgebraic curves of genus g.  In studying the behavior of families of\r\ncurves, it is useful to consider each curve as a point in the moduli \r\nspace, or in the natural projective closure (called the Deligne-Mumford \r\ncompactification) whose points correspond to curves with at most \r\nnodal singularities. The components of the boundary are the images of \r\nmaps from moduli spaces of stable n-pointed curves. In fact, it turns \r\nout that the birational geometry of these various moduli spaces of \r\ncurves frequently reveals interesting properties of families of curves.\r\n\r\nOne of the most fruitful ways to study the birational geometry of\r\nprojective varieties is to investigate the divisors and curves on them.  \r\nIn particular, it is a fundamental  problem to describe the effective  \r\nand nef cones of divisors, and hence the effective cone of curves of \r\nthese spaces. The research program to be pursued is a many faceted \r\nattack on this problem.  The goal is to provide further clarification \r\nof the nature of these cones, the relationships between them as well \r\nas to provide a collection of rich examples which would deepen \r\nunderstanding of the birational geometry of the moduli spaces and \r\nalso broaden general knowledge about cones of curves and divisors.\r\n",
