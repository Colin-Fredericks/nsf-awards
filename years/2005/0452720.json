 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of ecology is to understand the factors promoting coexistence among\r\ncompeting species. Chief among the hypothesized mechanisms is habitat\r\nheterogeneity, but alternatives include temporal fluctuations in resource availability,\r\nspatially restricted dispersal, and tradeoffs among fecundity, dispersal, and competitive\r\nability. Only a handful of these mechanisms have ever been shown to operate in the\r\nfield, and experimental tests simultaneously evaluating multiple mechanisms are rare.\r\nThe proposed study will evaluate alternative coexistence mechanisms in an emerging\r\nmodel system in community ecology - ants that compete to establish colonies in\r\nspecialized plant structures known as domatia. Three species of ants colonize the\r\ndomatia of the Amazonian trees Tococa bullifera and Maieta guianensis. Using this\r\nsystem, non-mutually exclusive mechanisms that may promote ant coexistance will be\r\ntested with a combination of field observations, manipulative experiments, and\r\nmathematical models. Because this system is composed of two specialists that coexist\r\nwith a generalist on two resources, our results could provide unique insights into the\r\nevolution of specialization in ecological communities. The project will provide ample\r\nopportunities for students at multiple stages of their academic careers to develop\r\nresearch, modeling, and mentorship skills. Furthermore, the collaborating PI's are at\r\ninstitutions with large minority enrollments, which will allow them to continue mentoring\r\nstudents from underrepresented groups. Finally, this project will strengthen a dynamic\r\nand productive international collaboration, and allow US students to gain their first\r\nexperience working in Amazonian ecosystems.",
