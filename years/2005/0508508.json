 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 04-043, category NER.  The objective of this research is to devise strategies for the large scale assembly of functional nanostructures. The specific approach is to use electrodeposition and self-assembled molecular templates.  This NER proposes the formation of long range, periodic nanoscale structures (metal and polymer) by electrodeposition in nanoscale areas defined by self-assembled molecular structures.  These nanostructures and their formation will be investigated by atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy.\r\n\r\nQuestions that we will address include\r\na)\tWhat is the effect of molecular template structure on the deposition pattern (molecular length, molecular shape and effect of end groups,)?\r\nb)\tWhat is the range of species that can be deposited (different metals, organic species that can be electrografted to the surface, )?\r\nc)\tCan molecular templating supplement other nanolithographic processes (nanoshaving, dip-pen nanolithography,)? \r\n\r\nThe broader impact arises from the potential that controlled assembly of individual atoms and molecules on surfaces could supplement lithographic techniques in manufacturing, as nanoscale molecular engineering becomes an integral part of miniaturization in electronic and photonic devices.  However, turning arrays of atoms and molecules into practical, useful supramolecular structures to be used as templates for nanostructure formation requires that a number of fundamental questions be resolved regarding the nature of the controlled assembly process.  The results of this research will be of significance in those fields where the formation of functional nanostructures is important including electrocatalysis, self assembly and electrodeposition of organic and inorganic species. Broader impact of the proposed research includes the training of post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students, the next generation of scientists.  Our group is committed to the undergraduate research experience, a central core of our group's mission to exposing students to state of the art scientific methods.\r\n",
