With this RDE-FRI project, TERC and Vcom3D will use the SigningAvatar\r\naccessibility software to develop an interactive 3D dictionary of science terms and definitions to support\r\naccess to standards-based science content among elementary and middle-grade students who are deaf or\r\nhard of hearing and whose first language is sign; evaluate the extent to which use of the dictionary\r\nfurthers understanding of science content, interest in science, and the ability to study independently; and\r\ncreate a more robust sign/facial expression/body space library for use in developing subsequent volumes\r\nof the dictionary or in SigningAvatar-enabling other science materials. At the end of two years,\r\nproducts will include:\r\n robust 3D interactive SigningAvatar-enabled dictionary of at least 1,300 key science terms\r\nidentified from instructional materials used in elementary and middle grade classrooms;\r\n report of findings from analysis of qualitative and quantitative student and teacher field-test data\r\nabout the effectiveness of the dictionary;\r\n addition of new vocabulary of technical signs to the Avatar characters' sign/facial expression/body\r\nspace lexicon in the areas of life, physical, earth and space science, and scientific inquiry.\r\nIntellectual Merits. The project represents a third collaboration between TERC and Vcom3D and\r\nleverages findings from two existing collaborations. Founded in 1965, TERC is a not-for-profit education\r\nresearch and development organization dedicated to the improvement of science, mathematics, and\r\ntechnology teaching and learning for all students. Vcom3D is a female owned and managed small\r\nbusiness, founded in 1997, and the developers of the SigningAvatar accessibility software. In 2001,\r\nworking together, the partners combined forces for the first time to SigningAvatar-enable the web\r\nactivities for three of the elementary and middle-grade science curriculum units called EnViSci Network.\r\n(Development of the SigningAvatar software, EnViSci Network, and this first collaboration were\r\nfunded, in part, by NSF.) Findings show all students who completed the signed units had significantly\r\nhigher post-test scores compared to those on matched pre-tests; post-test scores were also similar to those\r\nfor hearing students. Realizing the benefits of the Avatar and that cost and time preclude one-by-one\r\nsigning of even the most widely used instructional materials, the partners explored alternative means for\r\nintegrating the SigningAvatar software into science materials on a broader scale. What emerged was the\r\nneed for an interactive 3D dictionary of signed science terms and definitions that could be used as a\r\nuniversal tool for teaching and learning independent of the curriculum in place or materials being used.\r\nWith funding from NEC Foundation of America, the partners embarked on a second collaboration and\r\ndeveloped a 300-term prototype of such a dictionary. The Signing Science Dictionary project, and third\r\ncollaboration between the partners, builds on their collected knowledge.\r\nBroader Impacts. The proposed dictionary is designed to serve the approximately 50,000 students in the\r\ntarget population who require services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and\r\nare required by it and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 to have access to the same content as\r\nstudents with disabilities. The dictionary will offer members of this target population greater access to the\r\nsame opportunities as hearing students for rigorous science study that can potentially lead to careers in\r\nSTEM and expand over a lifetime. It will also offer teachers a library of recognized signs for studying\r\nscientific ideas with students. Unlike existing dictionaries, this first-of-its kind product will allow users to\r\nselect from a range of characters with different personalities and facial expressions, to alter the speed of\r\nsigning, and to sign a selected term and its definition in American Sign Language (ASL) or Signed\r\nEnglish (SE). Delivered as a single CD-ROM for use with a Windows operating system, this complete\r\nassistive tool will require low bandwidth and can be used with and without an Internet connection.\r\nPublication by a major publisher will result in dissemination of the dictionary nationally. Terms in the\r\nlexicon will be available through Vcom3D to publishers, developers, and educators to sign other\r\ndictionaries or science materials.",
