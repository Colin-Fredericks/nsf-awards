 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intent of this proposal is to establish a three-year, youth-based program aimed at developing, enhancing and/or expanding students' interest in Science and Engineering (S & E) and Information Technology (IT).  The objectives are to:  (1) stimulate interest in S & E among students who are currently underrepresented in S & E and IT fields; and (2) provide students with skills in IT that will enable them to conduct needs analysis, design, fabrication and evaluation of devices that meet the needs of disabled/elderly people.  The content focus is electronic with embedded microcomputers.  Approximately 400 students in 8th through 12th grades will be targeted by the program.  Students will participate in weekly tutorial sessions, monthly hands-on workshops and weeklong summer programs to improve their knowledge and skills in S & E and IT.  The expectation is that 400 students in 8th through 12th grades will use their knowledge and skills to reach up to 150 disabled/elderly persons during the award period.  \r\n\r\nThe project has a focus but flexible recruitment and selection process aimed at selecting a high percentage of at-risk students, although the program is not limited solely to that population.  To ensure participation by all targeted schools, each school will be given a quota of openings.  In addition, the proposers defined a rich array of scaled up experiences that move students from awareness and introduction about S & E and IT to design and application of those concepts.  Weekly sessions, monthly workshops and weeklong summer programs with scientists and IT professionals will comprise most of the work.  The intended outcome of the program is to deliver tangible products and adapted electronic devices via CD, DVD and web-based resources.\r\n",
