It is a scientific organization in which the exemplary work of several long-term committees has permeated the entire organization. The organization has a strong committee structure and uses networking as a mentoring strategy and to increase information sharing with underserved populations. ASCB has a long history of achievement in increasing the participation of women and minorities in research and study in science disciplines. Women, minorities and other participants in the mentoring programs have greater access to and interaction with well-known scientists, including Nobel Laureates, and national policy leaders.  Overall, this organization is making a significant difference in the discipline by extending its commitment to pursue diversity issues to other dimensions of the organization.\r\n\r\nThe submitted nomination package is in support of a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) to recognize outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that enhance the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science, mathematics, and engineering.\r\n",
