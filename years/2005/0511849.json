 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2005. The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in US science. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Super-Resolving Vector Beam Microscope for Fast 3-D Biological Imaging.\"  This research aims to develop a high-resolution (superresolution) optical microscope for fast 3-D biological imaging. This is achieved through utilizing an optical vector beam input, an interferometric (4-Pi) design, two-photon fluorescence excitation, and multi-focal imaging. \r\n\r\nThe training plan includes this research encompassing acquiring expertise in microscopy using biological samples, vector beams, and image processing as well as bringing the Fellow closer to his personal goal of synthesizing diversity, science, and pedagogy.\r\n",
