 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Vincent M. Rotello at the University Massachusetts- Amherst whose work on the recognition-mediated assembly of macromolecular systems will provide unique capabilities for the bottom-up assembly of nano- and microstructures. One central theme of the current research program is the assembly of randomly substituted complementary systems into organized ensembles. This mode of self-assembly differs dramatically from the programmed interactions observed in DNA and protein structure. It likewise differs from simpler self-assembled systems both in terms of specificity and in the ability to balance specific favorable interactions with phase separation behavior. This level of control provides a new (but little understood) route to polymer self-assembly. In preliminary research funded earlier, Professor Rotello has shown that random systems featuring complementary functionality can produce systems featuring higher-order structures. In these studies, the unprecedented self-assembly of random copolymers into giant vesicles was demonstrated. In future studies, the structure and properties of these Recognition-Induced Polymersomes (RIPs) will be probed. Professor Rotello will also extend self-assembly studies to block copolymers, and explore the synthesis and properties of recognition element-functionalized alternating copolymers that feature regular intergroup spacing.\r\n\r\nThe Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Vincent M. Rotello whose research will provide a roadmap for the creation of self-assembled polymer microstructures. This insight will enhance the ability to create such diverse pragmatic systems as delivery devices and micro reactors. Moreover, the program is highly multidisciplinary, featuring tools and techniques from the fields of chemistry, materials science and physics. The graduate and undergraduate students working on this research will gain an integrated understanding of these diverse methodologies, providing them with powerful tools for their future careers.\r\n\r\n",
