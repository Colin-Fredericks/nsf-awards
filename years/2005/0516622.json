 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many plants have a distinct vegetative phase in which leaves are produced and a reproductive phase, in which flowers are produced. The pathway that triggers flower formation is the focus of this research. The master regulator LEAFY is instrumental for switching between the vegetative and the reproductive developmental program, yet the steps downstream (after) LEAFY are poorly understood. This research project will  investigate events following LEAFY activation that culminate in formation of the first flower. Several new regulators of this process were identified previously and are currently being characterized. Because the regulatory mechanism studied is conserved in many crop plants, this research has the potential to benefit agricultural crop production. In addition the project provides training for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in state-of-the art Molecular Biology and Genetic research.",
