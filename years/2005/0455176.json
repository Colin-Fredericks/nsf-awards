The equilibrium amounts of the sorbents that the PI has developed are nearly proportional to the total sulfur concentration in the feed.  In future work a significant challenge will be to develop high-capacity p-complexation sorbents for low-sulfur fuels. Two approaches, based on nanoscale considerations, will be followed in this project (1) to use a cation (or atom) that forms strong p-complexation bonds with thiophene and thiophenic molecules; and (2) to increase the exposed cation site density.  Palladium-based sorbents will be studied because they are known to form the strongest p-complexation bonds.  Monolayers of various salts supported on high-surface-area substrates will be studied. A research plan for denitrogenation in parallel with desulfurization will be carrier out.  Ab initio molecular orbital theory calculations will be used as a guide for selecting the proper cations and anions. Molecular orbital calculations also provide a basic understanding of the bonding for adsorption.  In terms of the broader impacts, the PI has had a long-standing record of involving minority and female students in his research programs as well as having active participation of undergraduate students. The proposed research may lead to a new technology for desulfurization and denitrogenation of liquid fuels that is fundamentally different from the traditional technology of hydrotreating. It may also solve the crucial problem for using liquid fuels as the power source for future hydrogen fuel cells.\r\n",
