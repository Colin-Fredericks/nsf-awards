 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) provides funding for the development of new methods based on statistical mechanics of complex networks to address the problem of growing scale of engineered systems. In specific, supply chains, sensor networks and homeland security are considered as examples of large-scale engineered systems. The work will focus on two areas: 1. Information routing in weighted complex networks by developing efficient decentralized algorithms for sending and receiving information.  2. Survivability of complex networks by designing networks that have the ability to continue to operate effectively even under adverse or chaotic conditions. The project aims to develop an interdisciplinary graduate level course covering Physics, Mathematics and Engineered systems.\r\n\r\nIf successful this research will create a new pathway to design and analyze large-scale engineered networks. The mathematical models for analyzing weighted networks will revolutionize how search will be done in any complex network. The results of this research can easily be migrated to applications as diverse as social networks to telecommunication networks. This is a significant point that will influence the society at large. In specific, this project's success will influence supply chains, homeland security and sensor networks design and analysis. This research, in the long run, will lead to formulating an inter-disciplinary program/institute to foster the study of large scale engineered systems from a complex networks point of view.",
