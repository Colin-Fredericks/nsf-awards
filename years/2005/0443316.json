 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities - Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF-MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa will purchase a scanning probe microscope (SPM) with the following capabilities: atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopy (AFM and STM); magnetic force microscopy; electrochemistry capabilities; liquid attachment for controlled environments; optical microscope attachment; patterning/molecular attachment; glove box attachment; temperature control; and quantitative AFM phase imaging.  The SPM will enable the following projects: a) the synthesis of bottlebrush polymers; b) assembly of monolayers on silicon and their applications in nanotechnology; c) in situ studies of surface reactions of atmospheric and environmental relevance; d) studies of hierarchical structures of nanocrystalline zeolites; e) characterization of nanoelectrode structures; and f) investigation of cellular function at single cells.\r\n\r\nThe scanning probe microscope (SPM) enables researchers to image atoms directly. The interdisciplinary studies that will be carried out using this instrument will have an impact in materials sciences, nanotechnology and environmental chemistry.  In addition, a significant number of graduate and undergraduate students will gain hands-on experience with this state-of-the-art instrumentation since it will be used in both a laboratory course and in research.  Finally, external users from regional universities and colleges will have access through a weekend program.  \r\n",
