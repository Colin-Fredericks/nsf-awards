 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calostoma is a morphologically and ecologically enigmatic genus of puffball-forming fungi. Its bizarre structure has historically left the determination of its relationship to other fungi in dispute. Calostoma's ecological role is also undefined - it has been described as either a litter decomposer or as symbiotic with plants. The purpose of this project is to study the evolutionary relationships and ecological role of Calostoma using a combination of DNA analysis and measurements of nitrogen and carbon isotopes. This study will compare the relationships and ecologies of Calostoma species where they occur in North America, Asia, Southeast Asia and Austrailasia.  Fungi are vital to the health of ecosystems, functioning as recyclers of nutrients, or as symbionts of plants by supplying minerals in exchange for sugars from photosynthesis. Understanding the ecological roles of fungi like Calostoma will aid in assessing the health of the ecosystems where these fungi occur. Analyses of the DNA from Calostoma and related fungi will accurately address questions of fungal biodiversity and clarify evolutionary relationships of fungi. The results of this study will be presented at various scientific conferences, published in scientific journals and presented as a web\r\npage for the Tree of Life Web Project.",
