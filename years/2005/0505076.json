 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project concerns contact geometry and the geometry of minimal varieties.\r\nThe soft properties of contact geometry are governed by so called\r\nh-principles. In recent years, the hard properties have been uncovered by\r\nusing holomorphic curve techniques in the framework of Symplectic Field\r\nTheory. The project proposes to study a part of this theory known as\r\nLegendrian contact homology. This theory has had enormous success for\r\nLegendrian knots of dimension 1. Parallels of the 1-dimensional phenomena\r\nhave been shown to exists for higher dimensional Legendrian submanifolds\r\nbut the effectiveness of contact homology in higher dimensions has been\r\nlimited because computations in the theory are comparatively difficult\r\nsince they involve infinite dimensional spaces in an essential way. One of\r\nthe main goals of this research project is to prove a conjecture which\r\nreduces the computation of Legendrian contact homology in 1-jet spaces to\r\na purely finite dimensional problem. This would be important not only for\r\ncontact geometry itself: profound recent results in knot theory were\r\nderived using heuristic arguments from higher dimensional contact homology\r\nand a proof of the conjecture would establish the link between knot theory\r\nand higher dimensional contact homology rigorously. The conjecture will\r\nalso be applied both to internal questions in contact geometry (e.g. to\r\nestimate the number of double points of exact Lagrangian immersions in\r\n$\\C^n$) and to problems in differential topology. The project also intends\r\nto complete earlier results concerning minimal surfaces with small total\r\nboundary curvature as well as expand the range of applications of the\r\ntechniques used there, in particular, to problems concerning higher\r\ndimensional minimal varieties. Many of the problems arising in connection\r\nwith this study asks for topological constructions with geometrical\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nIn topology one is often concerned with open differential relations and\r\nthe class of allowed deformations is very large. This is a reflection of\r\nthe fact that spaces studied in topology in a sense are \"soft\" objects. In\r\ngeometry, on the other hand, one often faces differential equations and\r\nthe class of deformations is considerably smaller. Comparing to the\r\nsituation in topology, one could say that objects in geometry are \"hard\".\r\nThis project proposes to study problems in the two areas, contact geometry\r\nand minimal varieties, using the interplay between soft and hard.\r\n",
