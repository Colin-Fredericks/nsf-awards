 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has assembled a global alliance of partners who will investigate suitable approaches to develop, test, and disseminate advanced software and underlying technologies which provide generic applications with the ability to be aware of their network, Grid environment and capabilities, and to make dynamic, adaptive and optimized use of networks connecting various high end resources.  The project will look into possible approaches to develop advanced software and Grid middleware to provide the vertical integration starting from the application down to the optical control plane.  Among the possible approaches are exploring the use of network monitoring tools, to dynamically adapt and optimize communications, and work on the needed utility applications, such as underlying data transfer and network monitoring services themselves.\r\n\r\nThe areas of investigation include (a) advanced software and Grid middleware needed to vertically integrate highly dynamic, extreme-scale applications, (b)  on-demand, dynamic end-to-end high-speed optical networking connections needed by these applications, (c) Grid middleware to coordinate the three vital Grid resources per application requests.  The project will explore  advanced software and middleware  needed  for both dynamic and interactive applications to access and allocate network bandwidth.",
