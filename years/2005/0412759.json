 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bad weather can severely limit the usefulness of computer vision in\r\nthe outdoors. The algorithms (segmentation, tracking, recognition,\r\netc.) used in today's vision systems are not equipped to handle the\r\nadverse effects of weather. For outdoor vision systems to perform well\r\nin all conditions, they must explicitly account for the diverse\r\neffects of weather.  The visual effects produced by different weather\r\nconditions can be broadly classified into two categories: steady (fog,\r\nmist and haze) and dynamic (rain, hail and snow).  This research\r\nproject is devoted to the modeling and analysis of dynamic weather\r\neffects.  The first stage of the study is to develop compact and yet\r\ndescriptive photometric and geometric models of raindrops and\r\nsnowflakes. These models will be used to develop advanced models for\r\nthe dynamical and statistical properties of rain and snow.  Using\r\nthese models, efficient and robust algorithms will be developed for\r\ndetecting and removing rain and snow from videos.  The proposed models\r\nwill also be used to develop algorithms for fast and realistic\r\nrendering of rain and snow. In addition, the developed models will be\r\nused to design and implement real-time rain and snow gauges based on\r\nvideo cameras. Such gauges will be very inexpensive compared to ones\r\ncurrently used in meteorological sciences, and yet will provide high\r\naccuracy in the estimation of weather parameters.\r\n\r\nThe results of the proposed research are anticipated to have a broad\r\nand tangible impact on both research and education. From the\r\nperspective of research, the results are expected to impact the\r\nrobustness of outdoor vision systems and the realism that computer\r\ngraphics can achieve. The models, algorithms and databases developed\r\nduring the project will be broadly disseminated in a timely\r\nfashion. With regards to education, the PI is currently developing a\r\ncourse titled ``Computer Vision through the Atmosphere,'' and the\r\nresults of this investigation will contribute significantly to the\r\ncontent of the course.\r\n",
