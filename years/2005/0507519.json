They are the\r\nintermediate evolutionary stage between high mass-loss asymptotic giant branch stars and white\r\ndwarfs. As the final stage of mass loss for low and intermediate mass stars, the nebulae represent a\r\ncritical step in the mass and chemical evolution cycle for more than half the material ejected into the\r\ninterstellar medium. The ubiquity of planetary nebulae and their ease of observation have also made\r\nthem premier laboratories for testing new astrophysical theories. Here, a program to better\r\nunderstand the formation of planetary nebulae and the late stages of stellar evolution for low and\r\nintermediate mass stars will be undertaken.\r\nHigh resolution images of planetary nebulae and their progenitors have triggered a critical reevaluation\r\nof the dominant paradigm for nebular shaping. The new data has revealed features such\r\nas non-axisymmetric episodic jets and multi-polar outflows which can not be embraced with purely\r\nhydrodynamic theories. In addition, data from studies of proto-nebulae show energetic winds\r\nforming from cool stars that lack sufficient luminosity for radiative driving. Thus the theory of\r\nplanetary nebula evolution and, by implication, our ideas about processes at work in the late stages\r\nof stellar evolution, require fundamental revision. Previous work by Frank and collaborators has\r\nestablished the potential efficacy of magneto-centrifugal launching processes in planetary nebulae\r\nand proto-planetary nebulae. The central source driving the outflow is either a rapidly rotating\r\nstellar core or a binary-fed accretion disk or both. In all cases the magnetic field is likely to\r\noriginate via dynamo processes. The goals of the present study, which build upon this earlier work,\r\nare three fold: (1) To understand the nature of magnetic field generation in single asymptotic giant\r\nbranch (pre-nebula) stars, binary systems and in accretion disks. (2) To link magneto-centrifugal\r\nprocess at the core (star and/or disk) to global planetary nebulae and proto-nebulae morphologies,\r\nkinematics and ionization/chemistry states. This will be achieved through the use of a new Adaptive\r\nMesh Refinement code, AstroBEAR, built at the University of Rochester in collaboration with the\r\nUniversity of North Carolina Applied Math Department. (3) And to provide theoretical support for\r\nan ongoing series of laboratory astrophysics experiments conducted at Imperial College in London\r\nwhich have generated supersonic magnetically driven bubbles. These experiments are directly\r\nrelevant to these planetary nebula models.\r\nWhile the work here is focused on planetary nebulae it will be of direct relevance to other fields\r\nboth theoretically and observationally in the sense of allowing planetary nebulae to potentially act\r\nas a test-bed for theories of magnetohydrodynamic outflows. The work with the Imperial Collage\r\ngroup helps to deepen the rapidly growing field of High Energy Density Laboratory Astrophysics.\r\nThe development the AstroBEAR code is of particular benefit as it includes new multi-physics,\r\nmulti-numerics methods and the work on it here will help train the next generation of computational\r\nastrophysicists. Finally, an innovative outreach program is included which involves the creation of\r\nSci-Interactives: simulation based learning modules which will be posted on popular science\r\nmagazine websites.",
