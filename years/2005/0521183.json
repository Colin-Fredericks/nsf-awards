The equipment will be used for scientific/engineering research, course lab activity, enhanced student training and exposure of science/engineering to visiting students and their families. A state-of-the-art servohydraulic materials test system (fatigue rated) with 55 kip capacity capable of performing a wide range of mechanical tests will be acquired. This instrumentation will replace severely outdated mechanical testing capabilities (currently utilized by approximately 100 undergraduate students per semester) that are incapable of performing many of the tasks needed to characterize the behavior of modern materials. Current areas of research and development destined to utilize the new instrumentation include cellular solids and composites. The award also provides ERAU with state-of-the-art capabilities for visitor (e.g., ERAU Summer Academy students) demonstrations esigned to help explain the importance of materials to society and how materials are selected based upon measured properties. Exposure to new materials, structures and the associated measurement apparatus enhances the learning experience and promotes science/engineering at an early age. \r\n\r\nThe current state-of-art-knowledge regarding the design, fabrication and performance of new cellular solids is limited to relatively few cellular architectures and base materials. Little properties data exists and industrial scale-up has not yet been achieved. The proposed research would contribute to the knowledge of how to design and fabricate new types of cellular solids. Combined with properties evaluation (made possible using the proposed test system) this will enable further progress by establishing baseline performance standards and the means for future industrial scale-up. The proposed test system would also play a critical role in composite materials research. Investigations involving the compressive strength and residual fatigue life of impacted composites would utilize the proposed instrumentation. Quality results of great importance to composites researchers and the aerospace community are planned. \r\n\r\nThe research portion of this award revolves around discovering and understanding how to design, fabricate and test cellular solids and composites. Owing to their exceptional weight specific properties and potential multifunctional capabilities, these materials allow society to do more with less for optimal resource use. They make extremely efficient use of raw materials such that material resources and energy are conserved. Accurate properties measurements are achieved using the proposed instrumentation. Enhanced are the experimental and research capabilities at ERAU for the benefit of students and faculty interested in materials related research. A multi-disciplinary research team with 7 faculty members from 4 academic departments is involved. The new instrumentation will enable these departments to create well-equipped learning environments that integrate research with education. Since ERAU is primarily a teaching institution, the instrumentation will also be utilized for graduate and undergraduate courses. This exposes students to experimental techniques and equipment widely used to study the properties of materials and structures. Visitor (e.g., ERAU Summer Academy students) demonstrations help explain the importance of materials to society and how materials are selected based upon measured performance. By showing young adults state-of-the-art materials and apparatus, exciting innovations begin to nurture at an early age.\r\n",
