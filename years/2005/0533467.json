 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical. \r\nA workshop on \"Self-Assembled Photonic Materials\" will be held in Honolulu, HI, December 15-20, 2005. The workshop provides an interdisciplinary forum for researchers to examine complex scientific and technological issues pertaining to utilization of supramolecular chemistry in the field of photonics, including prototype device configurations such as components for computers, sensors, and data storage. Latest developments in the use of self-organizing systems in solar energy conversion will also be discussed. The overarching goal of the symposium is to provide a forum for direct interaction between polymer, materials science, chemical engineering, surface science, and biological researchers in order to explore new interdisciplinary research activities/issues in the nanoscience of photonic materials. The workshop focuses on the use of self-assembly and self-organization to form designed photonic materials, and is thematically divided into several sessions. These sessions focus on the use of self-processes to form photonic materials, photochemical energy conversion systems, hybrid materials, and biophotonic materials.\r\nNon-technical. \r\nThis requested funds will be used to support students and junior faculty to attend the Workshop. Participating in the workshop will increase their knowledge of the field and help them assimilate new ideas and results from leading Pacific Rim (e.g. USA, Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, Australia, etc.) laboratories and elsewhere in the world. It will also help these and other U.S. participants to identify priority directions for future research in the field. \r\n",
