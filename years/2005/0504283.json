 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the investigators will develop two novel, but related,\r\napproaches to regression model variable selection. Both procedures\r\nmake use of multiple, Monte Carlo-generated, pseudo data sets to tune\r\nthe controlling parameter alpha in a standard variable-selection\r\nroutine (e.g., alpha = \"alpha-to-enter\" in forward selection). In the\r\nfirst approach, white noise is added to the response variable with\r\nvariance in controlled multiples, m, of the full-model mean squared\r\nerror (FMMSE). The variable selection process is run on the\r\nnoise-enhanced data, and the selected model mean squared error (MSE)\r\nis found for each value of the selection process tuning parameter\r\nalpha.  This process is repeated for many bootstrap-type replications\r\nand the average MSE is retained for each value of m. The optimal alpha\r\nis determined as the value that gives, on average, the theoretically\r\nexpected mean squared error, FMMSE(1 + m), for the noise-enhanced\r\ndata. This approach has wide applicability to variable selection\r\nprocedures used with additive-error regression models. In the second\r\napproach phony predictors are added to the data set, and the\r\nproportion of phony variables included in the selected model for\r\ndifferent values of the selection process tuning parameter is\r\nestimated. Then, by averaging over bootstrap-type replications, the\r\nfalse selection rate (FSR) for the process can be estimated for the\r\nobserved data for each value of the process tuning parameter\r\nalpha. The FSR is controlled by choice of alpha. The FSR is a very\r\nunderstandable and meaningful quantity to control.  This method is not\r\nrestricted to additive-error models and thus has wider applicability\r\nthan the noise-enhancement above.\r\n\r\nRegression modeling is the most widely used statistical procedure.\r\nStatisticians have long known that the choice of predictor variables\r\nto use in a regression model is the most important component of\r\nregression analysis. Yet the identification of important predictor\r\nvariables remains one of the least understood and most important open\r\nproblems in statistical inference. This is true for small to moderate\r\ndata sets with a handful of potential predictor variables, as well as\r\nfor the huge data sets with potential predictors numbering in the\r\nthousands that are becoming more prevalent in statistical\r\napplications. In this project the investigators develop methods for\r\nidentifying important predictor variables from a larger set of\r\npotential predictors. The impact of the research is as broad as the\r\napplication of regression modeling. The new methods will enable\r\nresearchers in all application fields to better fit regression models\r\nto data sets, both small and large. The range of applications is\r\nenormous and includes, for example, genetic microarray data, drug\r\ndevelopment data, census bureau data, financial data such as credit\r\ncard transactions or loan applications, large weather and\r\nenvironmental data sets, and electric power usage data.\r\n",
