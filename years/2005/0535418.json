 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to facilitate outreach between the software\r\nengineering and embedded systems research communities by providing travel support for\r\noutstanding students of one community to participate at the flagship conference of the\r\nother. The proposed travel stipend intends to improve the mutual awareness of the ACM\r\nsoftware engineering (SIGSOFT) and embedded systems (SIGBED) research\r\ncommunities to the opportunities and challenges emerging in their research areas.\r\n\r\nSupporting the crossover of ideas between these communities has been an important\r\ngoal. The outstanding scientist and recognized National leader in computer science\r\nwho has been working for this goal until his untimely death in 2004 has been Dr Frank\r\nAnger, Deputy Director of the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations\r\nin the Directorate of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) at the\r\nNational Science Foundation (NSF). The basic idea for this travel support has been\r\nconceived in the spirit of his work and his legacy.\r\n",
