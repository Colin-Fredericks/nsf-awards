 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Hampton University supports Dr. Jale F. Akyurtlu, Chemical Engineering Department, for her work on introducing the undergraduate engineering and science students at Hampton University, an HBCU, to nanoscience and nanotechnology and to create a critical mass of engineering and science faculty who are capable of introducing nanoscience and nanoengineering in their respective currciula, who can engage in state-of-the-art research in nanoscience and technology, and who are able to cooperate with other HBCUs and majority institutions in education and research.  To achieve these goals, an elective multidisciplinary and modular nanotechnology course is proposed.  This course will be enhanced through course and laboratory modules and a seminar series.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education (NSEE) Program Solicitation, NSF 05-543, Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) component and is jointly funded by the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems (CTS) and the Division of Electrical and Communications Systems (ECS), both in the NSF Directorate for Engineering (ENG).",
