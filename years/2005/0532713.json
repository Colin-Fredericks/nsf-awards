 "awd_abstract_narration": "This symposium will cover various aspects of the solution-mediated crystallization of a range of materials including proteins, organics, and inorganic minerals. New characterization tools (e.g. scanning probe microscopies and high intensity synchrotron sources) and a variety of approaches from these different crystal growth communities are enabling the analysis of crystallization reactions at the nanoscopic scale. The crystalline self-assembly processes in biological systems is influenced by a broad range of factors including compartmentalization, phase transformation, and the presence of soluble process-directing agents and/or insoluble templates. Biocrystallization studies have traditionally been concerned with nucleation and growth, but recent evidence suggests that precursor phases may play a central role in biomineralization as well. The development of biomimetic in vitro models is of interest because they provide valuable information on crystallization mechanisms that can be correlated with ex vivo features found in biological systems. Biomimetic approaches are also useful for creating oriented patterned arrays of crystalline materials and for creating composite materials with unique materials properties. These and other priority areas will be discussed at this conference.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include opportunities for the participants to foster collaborative relationships with other scientists where there are mutual interests in biomaterials areas. It will give early career faculty, post doctoral scholars, and graduate students an opportunity to engage in cross-disciplinary discussions with colleagues from other universities, government laboratories and industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
