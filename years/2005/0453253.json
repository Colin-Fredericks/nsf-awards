 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Idaho Physics Department REU site will host seven undergraduate physics students for a ten-week summer research experience. These students will work closely with Idaho faculty members in the areas of condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, materials science, and atomic & molecular physics. The objectives of this site are: (1) to introduce undergraduate physics\r\nmajors to the excitement of physics research, (2) to train these students in the laboratory skills needed in modern physics research, (3) to foster student personal growth by having the students work in teams and by teaching them the ethical dimension of scientific research, and (4) to promote diversity in the field of physics by encouraging applicants and participants from under-represented groups. The Idaho physics faculty will design research projects that are challenging yet viable. Both theoretical and experimental projects will be made available. The students will be encouraged to work in small groups to foster teamwork skills. Weekly meetings will be held to allow the students to interact and to keep each other posted on their progress. The REU students will interact with Idaho faculty, research staff personnel, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduates. Supplementary activities will include weekly lunch together with faculty and weekend activities that revolve around the tremendous outdoor experiences available in Idaho. A targeted recruiting plan will be undertaken. Particular attention will be given to recruiting from institutions with significant populations of students from traditionally under-represented groups. The program will conclude with REU student research presentations.",
