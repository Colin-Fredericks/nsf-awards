 "awd_abstract_narration": "IDSolutions, in partnership with the National Association of Health Education Centers (NAHEC) and eight NAHEC member organizations will develop an original project to provide informal science education experiences to children, families and the local community via visual communications' technology.  This initiative includes building a technical infrastructure that will connect participating Health Education Centers.  It will expand beyond the installation of a network and will focus the bulk of its energy on the technology's application -- generating inquiry-based science experiences through active engagement with content that originates from remote locations.  Through the creation of an Interactive Videoconferencing Programming Collaborative (IVPC), IDSolutions, NAHEC, and NAHEC Members will produce and disseminate to our target audience of school-age children, families, community groups and teachers, a high volume of science-related programming.  The core content of the initial set of programs will be extracted from one of the nation's most popular life science traveling exhibits called \"Grossology.\"  These distance-learning programs will originate from a central \"studio\" location and will be available during the day, after school, on weekends, during summer breaks and holidays.  Supporting this effort will be Advanced Animations (designers of \"Grossology\" and \"Experience Science!\"), a science education consulting company.",
