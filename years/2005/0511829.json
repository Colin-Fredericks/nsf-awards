 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support measurements of nitrogen oxides, nitrates, peroxynitrates, nitric acid, and nitric acid anhydride during the MIRAGE/MILAGRO campaign. The objectives of the overall project are to determine the regional and global chemical impact of the megacity outflow both in terms of atmospheric composition and climate forcing. This instrument will be deployed on the ground at the supersite north of Mexico City where an extensive suite of gas phase and aerosol measurements will be available. Continuous measurements will provide insights into both daytime and nighttime chemistry involving reactive nitrogen, and information on the relative roles of deposition and mixing of nitric acid, and the production and removal processes of organic nitrates.  Further analysis of the data will provide information on various oxidation mechanisms and radical termination processes in an urban plume, as well as details of nighttime chemistry involving nitrogen oxide compounds.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project lie in the support for a female graduate student, and training opportunities for other students. The measurements will contribute to an improved understanding of the complicated chemistry of tropospheric ozone and its precursors and its role in air pollution and climate.",
