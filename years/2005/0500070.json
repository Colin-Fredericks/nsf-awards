 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThe increased demand for knowledge of small-scale behavior is making microrheology a key\r\nstep in the understanding of biological systems, the design and use of advanced materials,\r\nand the novel applications of already existing materials. Most microrheological experiments\r\nand analyses to date have focused on linear viscoelastic properties, by correlating the\r\nrandom thermally-driven displacements of small tracers to the complex modulus through a\r\ngeneralized Stokes-Einstein relation, a process which is relatively well understood but which\r\nis limited in its scope to equilibrium systems. Many systems of practical interest are driven\r\nout of equilibrium and display nonlinear behaviors, but the microrheology work in this\r\narea has been scarce (conventional macroscale rheometers are used to measure both linear\r\nand nonlinear regimes), and the connection between micro and macroscale measurements\r\nis unclear. The need and interest in microscale measurements, whether due to the scarcity\r\nof the material or the size of system, makes microrheology an important technology, but\r\nunfortunately one which currently lacks fundamental understanding in many aspects.\r\nThe proposed research examines the relation between micro and macrorheology through\r\n theoretical studies, with a particular and strong emphasis on the `active' (driven) and nonlinear regime. \r\nThis research is best described in terms of applications to colloidal dispersions, and will focus on such systems\r\nbecause they offer very well-defined and well-characterized materials, allowing for comparisons\r\nto macroscale measurements. However, the impact of this research extends beyond\r\ncolloidal systems as the theoretical foundation and general conclusions are extendable to\r\nmany complex materials, especially biomaterials. Specific issues such as shear thickening\r\nin microrheology, the effect of the size ratio (tracer size to typical medium length scale) on\r\nthe `continuum approximation' and on microscale velocity fluctuations, and the interactions\r\nbetween pairs of moving particles leading to structure formation are addressed. This is the first attempt to analyze the nonlinear behavior of materials within the context of microrheology\r\nand provides a fundamental validation of microrheology as a sound technique, critical for\r\nits continued application and future growth.\r\nBroader Impact: In a broader context, this research will engage PhD students who will\r\nbecome experts in colloidal physics and rheology, and who will go on to positions of leadership in industry and/or academia. \r\nTo aid in the education of future generations of scientists and engineers, a microrheology section for the undergraduate\r\nchemical engineering laboratory at Caltech will be developed. To disseminate the research\r\nas widely as possible, in addition to publication in conventional technical journals, a website\r\nwill be maintained with research results that are accessible to the general public. Since this\r\nresearch provides the theoretical foundation for a new experimental technique that has\r\nwidespread application in science and technology, its impact is both very broad and deep.\r\n",
