 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technology in today's virtual world has progressed rapidly and we have the capacity to create virtual environments that are remarkably realistic.  However, we do not yet know whether online education is at least as effective as traditional classroom instruction. In the present study, the question of equivalent effectiveness will be examined using a number of research methods and techniques, including literature reviews, surveys of users and non-users of online education, classroom observations, analyses of existing student data, and focus group studies. By gathering information from multiple sources, we will essentially have a snapshot of the perceptions of existing online education systems, allowing us to identify similarities and differences between online education and face-to-face course delivery.\r\n\r\nIdentifying perceptions of online education will lead to a benchmark analysis of online education tools and systems currently available to educators. One major element of this study will be the identification of deficiencies of current online education systems in utilizing cognitive processes, social awareness, and learning experiences. Next, technological trends and issues will be identified. It is hypothesized that few current online course delivery systems fully use the available state-of-the-art technology; therefore, candidate technologies that can be used in online education will be identified and evaluated. Finally, the findings from all sources will be combined and analyzed to develop a behavioral/social/cognitive model of online education systems. The tangible outcome of this project will be detailed specifications of an ideal system for use by online education system designers.\r\n",
