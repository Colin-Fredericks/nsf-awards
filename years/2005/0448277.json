 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the very early years of computer science it has been clear that\r\ncomputational problems vary greatly in difficulty, ranging from easy to\r\nmoderately hard to intractably hard to outright unsolvable.  \r\nComputational complexity theory is the branch of computer science that\r\nseeks to rigorously and mathematically study the inherent difficulty of\r\ncomputational problems, measured as the amount of a certain resource (or\r\nresources) required for their solution, and organize problems into\r\nclasses based on their inherent difficulty.  Examples of relevant\r\nresources include processing time, storage space and inter-computer\r\ncommunication.  Communication complexity involves the latter\r\nresource and asks how many bits must be communicated between different\r\ncomputers to solve a problem whose input is split between these\r\ncomputers. \r\n\r\nThere is plenty of intrinsic interest in communication complexity,\r\nbecause of the large variety of Internet-driven applications where it is\r\nrelevant. In addition, over the last decade and a half, communication\r\ncomplexity has been emerging as an area that unites many seemingly\r\ndisparate areas of theoretical computer science some of which do not\r\ndirectly involve communication; examples are circuit complexity, query\r\ncomplexity, quantum computing, algorithmic game theory, optimization and\r\ndistributed computing. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, information theory has proved itself to be a powerful\r\ntool in the study of communication complexity, and therefore in the\r\nvarious other areas of complexity theory that communication impacts. I\r\nhave already explored this theme in my recent work and was an author of\r\na recent paper that formally introduced the concept of information\r\ncomplexity and described its relation to communication complexity.\r\nOther subsequent work of mine has applied information theoretic\r\ntechniques to prove theorems about communication complexity and applied\r\nthese theorems in turn to explore the inherent difficulty of problems\r\nnot directly involving communication.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to continue this line of work in two\r\nways. First, I shall continue to develop and extend what I call the\r\ninformation complexity framework and attempt to apply it to models of\r\ncomputation where it hasn't yet been applied successfully. A noteworthy\r\nsubgoal of the first goal will be to use this framework to understand\r\nthe limitations of quantum computation. Second, I shall seek to study\r\ncertain concrete problems in communication complexity that have known\r\nconnections to other areas of complexity theory. Two specific areas I\r\nshall focus on are (1) the complexity of data stream computations and\r\n(2) circuit complexity, with an emphasis on the power of shallow\r\ncircuits. \r\n",
