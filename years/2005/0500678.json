 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPIs Geronimo and Woerdeman will continue their investigations into\r\nfactorization and extension problems. In particular we hope to\r\ndevelop a constructive proof of the celebrated Ferguson-Lacey\r\nextension theorem and build on it using the results we have\r\nrecently obtained on the spectral factorization of positive two\r\nvariable trigonometric polynomials. We plan to investigate in more\r\ndetail fast algorithms for computing the structured matrices that\r\narise from the two variable trigonometric moment problem as well as \r\nstudy the orthogonal polynomials that arise in this case. The PIs\r\nalso plan to continue their individual investigation into the\r\nimportant problems arising from quantum computing and the\r\nasymptotics of solutions to 2nd order difference equations.\r\n\r\nThe types of structured matrices under study here arise in many\r\nproblems of practical interest such as two variable\r\nauto-regressive models and two variable filtering. The PIs will\r\ntry to recruit more undergraduate and graduate students to help in\r\nthese problems as well as give courses and lectures at conferences\r\nto increase the impact of their efforts. In order to make the\r\nintellectual merit of the proposal apparent the PIs will continue\r\nto publish their results in well respected journals, and also\r\ndisseminate them via the PIs' homepages, preprint servers such as\r\narXiv, software sharing websites, etc.\r\n\r\n",
