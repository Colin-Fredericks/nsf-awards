 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the workshop is focus on the evolution and transmission\r\nof pathogenic microbes in models of infectious diseases.  Because\r\npathogenic agents may evolve rapidly, have varied mechanisms of\r\ntransmission, and involve complex treatment strategies, researchers from a\r\nvariety of fields are necessary to understand and control infectious\r\ndiseases. The contributions of researchers in mathematical models of\r\nepidemics is important in this effort. This workshop provides a forum for\r\nleading researchers in the subject of mathematical models of epidemics to\r\nexchange ideas, explore new methods, and discuss future directions with\r\nexperts in epidemiology and public health. The workshop greatly benefits\r\nresearchers and their graduate students at universities in Canada and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n        In recent years mathematical models have been widely used to study\r\nemerging infectious diseases. Infectious diseases are a vital concern to\r\nsociety, and mathematical modeling allows the design of epidemic control\r\nstrategies and the development of effective vaccines.  Mathematical\r\ninsights also help in understanding and predicting the emergence of\r\nantibiotic and antiviral drug resistance, and suggest new therapeutic\r\nstrategies to better address these important public health concerns. The\r\noutbreak of SARS in Asia and Canada in 2003, the increasing number of AIDS\r\ncases worldwide, and the recent resurgence of tuberculosis in Canada and\r\nthe United States all demonstrate the urgency and importance of this\r\nresearch.\r\n",
