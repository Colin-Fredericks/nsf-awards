The foundation for the manual will data and information presented at a\r\nresearch symposium sponsored by ACAD and OTS at Howard University last summer.\r\nACAD is a standing committee of the OTS Board of Directors and is responsible for providing\r\nadvice and council to OTS on broadening participation of underrepresented minorities at the\r\nundergraduate, graduate and professional levels. Since 1999, OTS has increased its efforts to\r\nattract minority students to the field of tropical initiatives such as ACAD and the Minority\r\nScholars Program.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nCreation of a manual of best practices is an important next step to increasing the number of\r\nAfrican Americans, Hispanic, Native Americans and Pacific Islanders who pursue careers in the\r\nenvironmental and biological sciences. The Organization for Tropical Studies for much of its\r\n42-year history has primarily focused on working with private, elite colleges and universities.\r\nThe ACAD committee through this project will foster greater participation of state, HBCUs,\r\nHispanic Serving, Tribal colleges and universities in the OTS consortium.",
