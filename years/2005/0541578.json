The support requested in this proposal will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend.  Particular attention will be paid to directing support towards underrepresented minorities including women, African-American, and Native Americans.\r\n\r\nFor over 30 years SOSP has been the leading forum for innovative research in operating systems. SOSP will bring together researchers from around the world to present and discuss the latest results in Operating Systems Principles such as; emerging topics as ubiquitous and mobile computing, sensor networks, overlay and peer-to-peer communications and power management.  There will also be poster and work-in-progress sessions for the presentation of promising preliminary work.\r\n",
