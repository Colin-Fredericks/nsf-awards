 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application, development and evaluation of tree building techniques, for the\r\ndetection of genetic associations will be examined. Evaluation of the performance of all\r\ntechniques developed in this proposal will involve both the identification of significant\r\nassociations of a trait with allelic variants of candidate genes and with combinations of\r\ngenetic markers at a genomic level. This proposal expands on nested clade analysis,\r\nwhich is being more commonly implemented in many fields of research. This approach\r\nwill be critically evaluated under controlled conditions with varying parameters for the\r\nfirst time in the context of identifying genotype/phenotype associations. The results of\r\nthis project will have broad implications on data analysis and interpretation in the fields\r\nof ecology, evolution, developmental biology, genetics, epidemiology and medicine,\r\nespecially for those studies looking to identify quantitative trait loci. The production and\r\ndistribution of a computer program implementing this analysis will make it universally\r\navailable and accessible to researchers in all fields, especially those who are not familiar\r\nwith the techniques that it implements. Perhaps the greatest intellectual merit is in the\r\nestablishment of phylogenetic techniques as a reasonable method to evaluate certain\r\ntypes of population data that do not require completely resolved individual relationships.",
