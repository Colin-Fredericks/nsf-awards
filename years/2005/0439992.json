 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMountain building by continent-continent collision is the most\r\nimportant orogenic process on Earth whose mechanism is not\r\nwell understood.  The collision between India and Asia is the\r\nlargest region of such collision and has produced the world's most\r\nspectacular topography. Within this region, the Tibetan Plateau\r\nstands out as a natural laboratory in which we can test hypotheses\r\nregarding a fundamental process that has impacted continental\r\ndynamics.  Collision models, obtained in various studies, predict\r\nsignificantly different upper-mantle structure beneath the plateau.\r\nThe upper mantle, therefore, holds a key to differentiating between\r\npossible collisional models and to unraveling how this archetype\r\nof plateaus came into being.  The objective of this research is\r\nto determine high resolution 3-D upper-mantle P and S velocity\r\nstructure beneath the Tibetan Plateau and neighboring regions.\r\nThe PIs will collect and process available seismic waveform\r\ndata of more than 300 broadband stations in the study area from\r\nearthquakes in the upper-mantle distance range.  These studies\r\nshould provide much improved lateral and depth resolution in the\r\nupper mantle than it has been possible in all previous studies.\r\nThe results of the proposed study can be used to verify or dismiss\r\nexisting collision models and to develop new ones.  The research\r\ntopic is also closely related to several undergraduate and graduate\r\ncourses (plate tectonics and geodynamics) that the PI is currently\r\ndeveloping and teaching at SLU.  The proposed research involves\r\ncollaboration between Saint Louis University and the Institute of\r\nGeophysics, Chinese Earthquake Administration.  It will use seismic\r\ndata collected by several multi-national (China, France, Germany,\r\nUSA, etc) projects in Tibet.\r\n",
