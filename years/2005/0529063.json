 "awd_abstract_narration": "0529063  Lu  The goal of this project is to integrate recent developments in wireless sensors and data management algorithms to monitor critical air pollutants and study the effects of traffic emissions on ground-level ozone levels. The network will be located on the two adjacent campuses of the University of Cincinnati, which are situated between two major interstate highways and surrounded by local roads. Several stationary sources of air pollutants also are located in the vicinity of the network site. The targeted pollutants are NOx and ozone. Wireless sensors for these constituents will be constructed by integrating gas detectors with signal converters and transmitters linked to data aggregators that will pass the data to a central controller. Issues of sampling frequency, sensor maintenance, data processing, transfer, querying, and scalability will be studied to ensure effective functioning of the network and the production of meaningful data. This research has the potential to positively influence the further development of air quality monitoring networks and promote the use of mobile sensors in new application areas. The proposed sensor network will serve as a model for networks in heavily impacted urban areas and provide useful information for designing and deploying other types of environmental observing networks. Issues this study will address have broad relevance to deployment of wireless sensor networks in natural and built environments. \r\n\r\n",
