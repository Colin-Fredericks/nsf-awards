The purpose of the work is three-fold. \r\n\r\nThe first purpose is to provide an opportunity for practical and creative problem solving by students in addressing a well-defined problem for meeting the required design component of their study program. A positive outcome of this involvement is that persons with disabilities receive devices that provide significant improvement in quality of life and independence at no cost to the recipients. This is especially important in light of the distance learning component of this proposal, as the clients to be served reside in an economically deprived Appalachian region of Southeast Ohio. In many cases, development of devices and/or software for an individual may lead to applications for others with similar disabilities. Students are also exposed to a unique body of applied information on current technology in the area of rehabilitation design.   \r\n\r\nThe second purpose is to motivate students, graduate engineers and other health care  \r\nprofessionals to work more actively in rehabilitation, towards an increased technology and knowledge base, to effectively address the needs of persons with disabilities. This complements the implementation requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). \r\n\r\nThe third purpose is to allow for the controlled study of the pedagogical efficacy of the specific experiential teaching/learning processes to be incorporated into the proposed design experiences. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGilbert B.

Many of the projects were constructed for children with cerebral palsy.  A list and description of projects recently completed include:\nThe Smart Kart: A Recreational Vehicle. This two-seater vehicle is a gas-powered, joystick-steered device that allows the client to drive the vehicle thus interacting with friends and practicing his motor coordination skills.\nThe All-Terrain Power Chair. The all-terrain power chair was designed to travel on light trails and other locations that lack pavement.\nCustom Tilt-in-space Wheelchair. This custom designed wheelchair has a tilt-in-space feature to accommodate the client's growing needs.\nThe Bicycle Sidecar. The bicycle sidecar was built so that the client could bicycle with her father. The family wanted her next to them when they were riding so that they could talk to her and get her more involved in the experience. A tumbleforms chair seat was used.\nBeach Wheelchair.

While the client is physically incapable of skiing on her own, with the assistance of a skilled skier and\nthe Assisted Skiing Device, she will have the ability to ski.\nThe Adaptive Position Chair. The Adaptive Position Chair (APC) was designed to add ease to the lives of a family with a child of\nlimited motor and communication skills. The most functional piece of the APC is the tray table. It has three planes of motion to allow for many uses relevant to our client and her family's daily life. The APC also includes support mechanisms to help compensate for her lacking motor control. These mechanisms include a pommel that fits between her legs and a butterfly chest harness. The chair is also adjustable in various ways to provide room for growth.\nThe Ride-On Remote-Controller Car. To give the client a sense of mobility and freedom, the ride-on remote-controlled car was constructed. The vehicle is not controlled by Samantha, but by allowing her to be mobile by letting her parents drive the vehicle using a standard RC radio controller.\nA Motorized Assistive Jumping D..."
