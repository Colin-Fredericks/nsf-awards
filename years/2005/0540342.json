 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic technological framework used to manage the national electric power grid is several generations old and is not prepared to meet the increased pressures of a growing economy, especially with the reduced\r\ninvestment for transmission infrastructure in the past several decades. Experts recognize that\r\nblackouts similar to the Northeast US - Canadian blackout of August 2003 remain a reality. The\r\nDynamic Data-Driven Applications (DDDAS) paradigm offers a unique framework for\r\nmethodological innovations that can revolutionize the nation's energy infrastructure, alleviate the\r\nthreat of blackouts, and assure the long term stability, reliability, and efficiency of the electric power\r\ngrid. New technology designed for the national energy infrastructure would increase the total energy utilized by\r\ndynamically balancing power supply and demand, and by providing the ability to respond to\r\npotentially debilitating situations before they develop into a crisis. The proposed research will\r\nadvance new methodologies for situation awareness, control flexibility, autonomic functionalities, and\r\nself-healing that will revolutionize the state of the art in energy management. The centerpiece of the\r\nresearch will be an integrated real time dynamic sensing and simulation capability for the electric\r\npower grid. DDDAS provides the framework for the methodological innovations to achieve\r\nseamless and robust integration of measurements and dynamic simulations across the multiple\r\nboundaries of timescales and spatial characteristics encountered in the power grid.\r\nTo achieve its objectives the project will make advances along six integrated tasks (e.g. Simulation, Sensing, Integrative Methods, Visualization,\r\nComputer Security, and Demonstration). The advances of this research include 1) real\r\ntime, high fidelity power grid simulation using integrated distributed heterogeneous simulation (DHS)\r\nand neural network techniques on high end computational platforms, 2) the integration of real time\r\nsimulation and sensing using both high cost, high precision and low cost distributed sensor networks,\r\n3) a new class of stable and robust mathematical algorithms for solving complex ill-posed problems\r\nsuch as the real time power grid simulation/sensing application, 4) new approaches to real time\r\nvisualization and computer security. To demonstrate the intellectual merit and to achieve the\r\nbroadest impact of this research, the team will take advantage of existing collaborations with the\r\nMidwest Systems Independent Operators (MISO), the first regional transmission organization\r\napproved in the United States, and technology transfer mechanisms are essentially already in place.\r\n",
