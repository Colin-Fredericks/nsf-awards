 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of decision theory focuses on how choices are made among a set of alternative outcome options.  However, many real world decisions are \"unstructured\" in the sense that choices or \"alternatives\" are not specified in advance.  Instead, decision makers must create an ideal option. This has application in business decision making, policy analysis, medical decisions, and consumer product selection. \r\n\r\nThis research examines a two-component model that may explain the process of unstructured decision making. The first component focuses on identifying the decision maker's goals. The second addresses the presentation of information in relationship to these goals.  Three phases of research will investigate each of the first two components separately then the two components jointly.  The studies will examine product customization problems, which exemplify unstructured decision making because they force individuals to select desirable attributes to create personalized alternatives. A web-based program, Interactive Choice, created by the investigators and modeled after electronic commerce websites, simulates a customizing experience. The project also involves creation of an electronic decision aid called Choice Builder to assist decision makers in making unstructured decisions. \r\n",
