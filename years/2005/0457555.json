 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on the coupling of new concepts of asymmetric supercapacitor design with well defined and well aligned carbon nanotube arrays to design unique electrode materials in the supercapacitors. Utilizing the remarkable properties of Carbon Nanotubes the PI will develop a range of Carbon Nanotube-based supercapacitors both in symmetric and asymmetric configurations. Different design configurations such as coaxial cable type and parallel plate will be explored with nanotubes. Experiments to determine and understand the relationships among synthesis, microstructure and geometric architectures of Carbon Nanotubes, and their electrochemical performance as supercapacitor electrodes will be elucidated. Also, predictive model and experimental evaluation for supercapacitance in super-long single-walled Carbon Nanotube strands will be performed. Synthesis and electrochemical characterization of CNT-metal oxide composite and nanoporous carbon electrode supercapacitors will also be done in order to compare the performance with the pristine Carbon Nanotube electrode supercapacitors. The newly designed and fabricated Carbon Nanotube asymmetric supercapacitors are expected to show high energy density and high power density, as well as long cycle life.\r\nThe success of the proposed project will enable an integration of nanotechnology with power storage system, which has a broad impact on integration of nanotechnology with electronics. This integrated technology will offer superior and reliable solution in replacing heavy and short-life battery. The outcome of the proposed project will offer the potential for high power switching at high frequency and can form the basis of a miniaturized device that can be used by any electronics such as on-chip power systems. Further, the successful optimization of the supercapacitors with carbonaceous materials as electrodes at smaller scale, will lead to the directions on the possible realization of the power source for zero-emission electric vehicle applications.  \r\n",
