 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a field-based study focusing on surficial processes and landscape  evolution in western Colorado.  This region is a spectacular natural field laboratory, and the location in  Grand Junction, CO, makes Mesa State College (MSC) an excellent base for the proposed research  activities. The importance of this topic is two-fold:  1) given the significant past and ongoing research  in surficial processes in these regions it is highly appropriate that undergraduate geology students learn  about landscape evolution in this classic geological setting, and 2) the proposed student research activities  will provide students with in-depth exposure to aspects of surficial processes (e.g., geomorphology, soils,  neotectonics) that are not typically required for undergraduate geology majors in the U.S. (these topics are  typically electives).  MSC faculty have extensive experience mentoring undergraduate students and supervising  research projects.  Novel aspects of this proposal include 1) its emphasis on field-based research, 2)  research activities that examine landscape evolution at multiple time scales, and 3) the goal of working  with students that are in the earliest stages of their research careers (e.g., sophomores or juniors; students  that have not yet completed major requirements such as field camp).  Research by MSC faculty has  identified a series of viable, cutting-edge student projects ranging from studies of arroyo entrenchment to  the origin of the Colorado River.  The outstanding geology of western Colorado will serve as the natural  field laboratory for all projects, and provides an ideal hands-on learning environment for project  participants.",
