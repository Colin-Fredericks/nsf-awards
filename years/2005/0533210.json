 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Shodor Education Foundation, Inc. requests funding support in the amount of\r\n$292,590 for a research and development effort, Deaf Educational Access For Science,\r\nTechnology, Engineering, and Mathematics (DEAF STEM). DEAF STEM will expand\r\nthe work of Project SUCCEED-HI (NSF #9906189) by adding American Sign Language\r\n(ASL) versions to the existing text of a wide variety of Shodor materials. A project goal\r\nis to improve access for all students to the National Science Digital Library (NSDL),\r\nincluding Shodor's extensive STEM materials, which have been developed through\r\nprevious, and current NSF funding. In addition, DEAF STEM will provide a dynamic\r\nresource for educational interpreters and other providers to increase their competence and\r\nconfidence in interpreting and supporting education in STEM areas to deaf students.\r\nIntellectual Merit: DEAF STEM addresses the needs of both deaf students and their\r\nteachers/educational interpreters. Deaf students are underrepresented in STEM fields in\r\nlarge part because of the documented low-grade reading level (3 rd  4 th grade) of the\r\naverage deaf high school student and the minimal skill levels of most educational\r\ninterpreters. DEAF STEM will address the teacher and student needs by expanding on\r\nthe work of SUCCEED-HI to provide bilingual versions of two of Shodor's award\r\nwinning activities: Project Interactivate and the Computational Science Education\r\nReference Desk (CSERD) which has been selected as one of the inaugural pathway\r\nprojects of NSDL. Purely text-based approaches to STEM materials are insufficient to\r\nensure active access to STEM information by deaf students. Through focused research,\r\nDEAF STEM scientists will work with deaf educators and their students to perfect the\r\nmodification and presentation of NSDL materials, while assessing a variety of\r\ntechnologies, including video and the use of avatars. This focused research includes the\r\ndevelopment of best practices for providing bilingual materials to our audience.\r\nAdditional online tools for searching our growing collection of signed lessons will\r\nsupport educational interpreters. These tools will enable providers to locate correct\r\nexamples of STEM concepts communicated through ASL. The DEAF STEM team will\r\ninvite educational interpreters in the field to submit STEM passages that they need help\r\nsigning. These passages will be signed and posted on a signing STEM forum. This will\r\nprovide an open-ended opportunity for interpreters to both improve their signing skills\r\nand to provide support for the issues they face on a daily basis.\r\nBroader Impact: The impact of our DEAF STEM project will be felt on two fronts. By\r\nproviding deaf students with signed assistance to read STEM text, the students' ability\r\nand confidence in reading STEM materials will be improved. The bilingual presentation\r\nof the STEM materials in both English text and ASL video clips will provide an\r\nopportunity for language arts and STEM teachers to work together to improve their deaf\r\nstudents' reading and English skills.\r\nBy creating a web based DEAF STEM Forum, the entire deaf community will be\r\nencouraged to explore the signing of STEM concepts. By appealing to the deaf\r\ncommunity's interest in promoting their language, DEAF STEM will widen the exposure\r\nof the deaf community to relevant STEM issues. As a deliverable under the\r\nNSDL/Pathway memorandum of understanding, Shodor will be sharing these best\r\npractices with other projects in NSDL to maximize impact and breadth of dissemination.",
