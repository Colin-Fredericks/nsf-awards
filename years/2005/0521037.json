The PI plans to increase the energy density available in university research by an order of magnitude or more. The new laser will then be applied to research at Princeton in light-driven chemical processing, in quantum computing, and in higher-power table-top X-ray lasers. Adaptive feedback control will be a crucial element in making the overall system actually work. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The most important broader impact is the potential impact of this technology as such. If the instrument development is successful, partnership between the PI and the primary component supplier will probably result in making such instruments widely available and used across the world. Light-driven chemical processing is an important emerging area, with potential in many areas, such as advanced, more efficient fuel processing. Development of the underlying technology here - light enhancement by Raman backscattering - might improve the economics or feasibility of laser-induced nuclear fusion, an energy source that could fill a crucial hole in the future global economy. This equipment will also support crossdisciplinary education - both graduate and undergraduate - at Princeton.  \r\n",
