 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Washington University Department of mathematics will host an international conference on the Interplay of Complex Variables, Probability and Partial Differential Equations from May 11 to May 14, 2005. The last afternoon session will be devoted to a celebrattion of the achievements of Albert Baernstein II on the occasion of his sixty-fifth birthday. The main theme of the conference is to discuss the deep connection between Analysis, Probability and Partial Differential Equations, including recent advances in the well-known conjecture on the L^p norm of the Beurling-Ahlfors transform, symmetrization in partial differential equations, and extensions of classical ideas of function theory to higher dimensions. In addition to six plenary lectures and thirteen invited talks, a panel on future research directions, a panel on graduate studies in Analysis and a workshop for graduate students will be convened. More details are available at http://www.math.wustl.edu/ac. \r\n\r\nMany important discoveries in Mathematics are rooted in the interplay between apparently different areas. This conference is centered on the mutual relationships between Complex Analysis, Probability and Partial differential equations. The main point is that deterministic phenomena can be analyzed by random techniques and vice versa. The method of simulated annealing in optimization and the Black-Sholes equation in mathematical finance are two important examples with many practical applications. This conference will provide an opportunity to present ideas from these different areas to graduate students\tand young investigators. A workshop will provide the necessary background for this group. In addition, researchers from Europe and the United States who would not otherwise have the opportunity to collaborate will find one by this meeting. One of the conference's main goals is to serve as a platform to attract more women and under-represented minorities to Analysis.",
