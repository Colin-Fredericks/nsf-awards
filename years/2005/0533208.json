The overall goals of the proposed work are to understand and implement the pedagogical requirements for students with visual impairments in chemical engineering, and to determine if techniques developed are useful by testing them during practicum within the context of chemical engineering design. Chemical engineering pedagogy and practicum will be explored via the following.\r\n\r\n1. Adapt current engineering design software to permit use by an engineer with a visual impairment.\r\n\r\n2. Determine the utility and limitations of adaptive technology (AT) that circumvents graphical user interfaces (GUIs).\r\n\r\n3. Develop specific strategies to balance visual and verbal dialog within a design team when an engineer with a visual impairment is present.\r\n\r\n4. Assess the first two goals within the context of student internship experiences with a firm.\r\n\r\n5. Disseminate goal findings.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate that with the addition of further programming routines AT can be used in conjunction with GUI-based software in both the classroom and industry contexts. Such a study will serve to pilot such efforts at other institutions and engineering firms. An added dimension of the work includes preparing the sighted members of a design team to effectively communicate in a technical fashion with less reliance on visual cues.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThis study will illustrate that through the use of properly designed AT, an individual who is visually impaired will be able to demonstrate proficiency in chemical engineering, with an emphasis on design. Dissemination of the material and techniques developed via a range of mechanisms will no doubt aid others to adapt chemical engineering curriculum and industrial settings for people with visual impairments.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
