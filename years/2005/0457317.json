It is believed by many that supersymmetry will be discovered at LHC or other experiments in the near future. If so, making contact with Nature will involve understanding string theory with N = 1 supersymmetry. With this amount of supersymmetry, string theory has immensely rich dynamics, which contains many clues into what the fundamental formulation of string theory should be. Yet, the dynamics is constrained enough to be tractable.The PI proposes research which addresses fundamental questions regarding various particular N = 1 string theories, as well as the global space of N = 1 string theories. She will exploit a tool known as ?topological string theory?. This theory is very closely related to the physical string - in fact, it gives the same answers for a large class of questions. Yet, it is simplified enough that progress can me made on otherwise intractable problems. The PI proposes to develop novel topological theories to widen the class of questions that can thus be approached. The PI will also use the topological string as a direct tool for developing a non-perturbative formulation of string theory. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
