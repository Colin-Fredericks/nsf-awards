 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit of Proposed Activity\r\nMultiphase systems containing liquid crystalline dispersed phases are of interest for a variety of\r\ntechnological applications, including display technology, self-reinforced composites, and electrorheological\r\napplications. The liquid crystalline structure manifests itself not only through the bulk properties of the\r\ndispersed phase, but also (and sometimes primarily) through the impact of liquid crystallinity on the\r\nnanoscopic interfacial region and the interfacial properties. The proposed research addresses the effect of\r\nthe liquid crystal/isotropic liquid interface on morphology and flow, particularly in smectic systems.\r\nExperimental. A bicontinuous gel-like liquid crystalline dispersion with nanoscale dimension is obtained\r\nwhen a minor phase of a smectic biphenylcarbonitrile (8CB) is mixed with poly(dimethyl siloxane). The\r\ngel is meta-stable through the nematic regime and then undergoes a spontaneous transition to a dispersed\r\ndroplet morphology at the nematic-isotropic transition. The droplet morphology is meta-stable and does not\r\nreform to the gel with lowering of the temperature. We plan to carry out the following experiments, with a\r\ngoal of developing an understanding of this remarkable kinetically-trapped system and placing the\r\ninterfacial and bulk mechanics of the liquid crystal dispersion in the broader context of colloidal gels: (i)\r\noptical microscopy; (ii) nonlinear rheology and determination of the dynamics of the bicontinuous\r\nmorphology; (iii) broadband dielectric experiments in the gel and droplet morphologies. The interfacial\r\nmechanics of the smectic phase in blends are essentially unknown. We plan to measure the interfacial\r\ntension of smectic 8CB against PDMS and to carry out a systematic study of droplet deformation and\r\nrecovery for 8CB droplets in isotropic, nematic, and smectic regimes in a PDMS matrix.\r\nTheoretical. The mechanics are ultimately determined by the interplay between surface ordering and bulk\r\nstresses from the liquid crystalline orientational elasticity. We will employ a simulated annealing method to\r\ndetermine orientation distribution in the liquid crystalline phase. The mechanics of the gel-dispersed\r\ndroplet transition in the 8CB/PDMS system seems to be a surface tension-driven phenomenon; the\r\ntransition does not occur at the smectic-nematic transition because the system appears to be kinetically\r\ntrapped in a meta-stable state, and a similar kinetic trapping appears to prevent a spontaneous morphology\r\ntransformation to recover the liquid crystalline gel. We will study the mechanics of the interfacial tensiondriven transition between extended and spherical homeotropic liquid crystalline phases embedded in a\r\nviscous matrix.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the proposed activities\r\nAdvance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. The Principal\r\nInvestigator has an established record of training Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows and of\r\nincorporating undergraduate students into his research group. The research group is a part of the\r\ninterdisciplinary Benjamin Levich Institute for Physico-Chemical Hydrodynamics and the NSF-CREST\r\nCenter for Mesoscopic Modeling and Simulation, and there is considerable interaction among the faculty\r\nand students, who come from the Departments of Chemical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering,\r\nMechanical Engineering, and Physics. Professor Denn is the Principal Investigator for an NSF-IGERT\r\nprogram on Multiscale Phenomena in Soft Materials, and members of his research group interact with\r\nIGERT participants through regular joint seminars and a body of new soft materials courses, including two\r\nlaboratory courses.   Broaden Participation of Underrepresented Groups. City College is an urban institution with an 85% minority student body that includes many returning students, often with family responsibilities.   Undergraduate students participate regularly in the soft materials research activities. We will seek to include up to two undergraduates annually who have successfully completed the first part of the third-year transport sequence and wish to pursue undergraduate independent research or summer research. We will profit in reaching out to undergraduates from the presence on the campus of many programs already in operation to enhance the participation of members of groups underrepresented in science and engineering,\r\nincluding the CUNY Pipeline Program for undergraduates interested in pursuing a Ph.D. program.\r\nBenefits to society. The proposed research addresses problems that are relevant to a variety of important\r\ntechnologies, as well as providing training opportunities in the important area of soft materials.",
