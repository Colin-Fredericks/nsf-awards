 "awd_abstract_narration": "WNET is producing \"The Human Spark,\" a multimedia project that includes a four-part television series (4 x 60 min) for national primetime broadcast on PBS, innovative outreach partnerships with museums, an extensive Web site and outreach activities, including a Spanish-language version and companion book.  Hosted by Alan Alda, \"The Human Spark\" will explore the intriguing questions: What makes us human?  Can the human spark be found in the differences between us and our closest genetic relative -- the great apes?  Is there some place or process unique to the human brain where the human spark resides?  And if we can identify it, could we transfer it to machines?  The programs will explore these questions through presenting cutting-edge research in a number of scientific disciplines including evolution, genetics, cognitive neuroscience, behavioral science, anthropology, linguistics, AI, robotics and computing.  The series will highlight opposing views within each field, and the interdisciplinary nature of science, including its intersection with the humanities.  The series will develop a new innovative format, the \"muse concept\", which involves pairing the host with a different scientific expert throughout each program.\r\n\r\nThe outreach plan is being developed with a consortium of four leading science museums, American Museum of Natural History in New York, Museum of Science in Boston, The Exploratorium in San Francisco, and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, paired with their respective local public television stations. An additional six museums and local broadcasters will be chosen through an RFP process to develop local initiatives around the series. \r\n\r\nMultimedia Research and Leflein Associates will conduct formative as well as summative evaluations of the series and web \r\n",
