Shankar Sastry, Principal Investigator\r\nUniversity of California at Berkeley\r\n\r\n\r\nComputer trustworthiness continues to increase in importance as a pressing scientific, economic, and social problem.  The last decade has seen a rapid increase in computer security attacks at all levels, as more individuals connect to common networks and as motivations and means to conduct sophisticated attacks increase. A parallel and accelerating trend of the last decade has been the rapidly growing integration role of computing and communication in critical infrastructure systems, such as financial, energy distribution, telecommunication and transportation which now have complex interdependencies rooted in information technologies. These overlapping and interacting trends and needs force us to recognize that trustworthiness of our computer systems is not an IT issue alone; it has a direct and immediate impact on our nation's critical infrastructure and workforce issues. As a consequence, there is an acute need for developing a much deeper understanding of the scientific foundations of cybersecurity and critical infrastructure systems, understanding the economic and public policy drivers and impacts for cybersecurity, and assuring the workforce required for research and development.  \r\nIn response to these needs, the Team for Research in Ubiquitous Secure Technology (TRUST) will be devoted to the development of a new science and technology that will radically transform the ability of organizations (software vendors, operators, local and federal agencies) to design, build, and operate trustworthy information systems for our critical infrastructure. The Center will bring together a team with a proven track record in relevant areas of computer security, systems modeling and analysis, software technology, economics, and social sciences.  The team consists of investigators from the University of California at Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell University, Stanford University, Vanderbilt University, and San Jose State University. The research team will be advised and supported by an External Advisory Committee (EAC) with strong representation of vendors of information technology, critical infrastructure protection providers, and other relevant stakeholders.  The STC team, including the researchers, education group, and the knowledge transfer group, the EAC, and participant groups will promote workforce diversity.\r\nThrough the active coordination and integration of efforts, TRUST researchers will consider security in a hierarchy of approaches that ranges from secure embedded systems to complex interdependent systems, each approach informing and building upon the others.  Equally important, TRUST will address economic, social, and privacy considerations as the technology is acquired and absorbed into cybersecurity products and the critical infrastructure. The integrated, multidisciplinary approach made possible by the Center mode of funding will allow solutions to synergistically emerge from a \"holistic systems\" view of computer security, software technology, analysis of complex interacting systems, and economic and public policy.\r\nThe unifying approaches of TRUST are computer security for component technologies, composition of components into secure systems, test and evaluation strategies, social and economic factors for successful security and the integration of the Center's research with education and knowledge transfer.  Leveraging the prior investments of NSF, DoD and other agencies in various application testbeds, TRUST will continuously test the technologies resulting from its research. The role of the testbeds will be to integrate and evaluate technologies in specific and realistic systems, keep the research on track to answer societal objectives, and demonstrate the technologies for stakeholders in real systems.  \r\nTo achieve and demonstrate the core objectives in the selected real-life testbeds, TRUST will pursue a strongly coordinated research agenda in the following areas Security Science (1) Software Security; (2) Trusted Platforms; (3) Applied Cryptographic Protocols; and (4) Network Security\r\nSystems Science: (1) Complex Interdependency Modeling and Analysis; (2) Secure Network Embedded Systems; (3) Model-based Integration of Trusted Components; and (4) Secure Information Management Software Tools.\r\nSocial Science: (1) Economics, Public Policy and Societal Challenges; (2) Digital Forensics and Privacy; and (3) Human Computer Interfaces and Security.\r\nTRUST will have an education and outreach component that focuses on integrating research and inquiry-based education and on transferring new and existing knowledge to undergraduate colleges, educational institutions serving under-represented populations, and the K-12 community.  In so doing, TRUST will help lay the groundwork for training the scientists and engineers who will develop the next generation of trustworthy systems, as well as to help prepare the individuals who will ultimately become the users, consumers and beneficiaries of such systems.\r\nTRUST will also take a comprehensive approach to knowledge transfer.  Since TRUST addresses well-defined and long term societal needs, the results in computer security, privacy and critical infrastructure protection will be easily communicated to decision makers, policy makers, and government agencies.  With respect to industry, the selected integrative testbeds will be the focal points to interact with major stakeholder industries: power, telecommunication and embedded systems.  Since TRUST will comprise multiple institutions, including technology vendors, infrastructure providers and leading research universities, the result will be wide spread dissemination, adaptation and continued evolution of ubiquitous secure technology.  \r\nThe legacy of TRUST to the nation will be the creation of a science and technology base, policy base, educational base, and technology transfer methodology for cybersecurity.  The long-term research agenda of TRUST will not only advance the frontiers of knowledge in trustworthy computing; it will influence on a national scale future academic research, industrial R&D and education as TRUST researchers identify new directions of inquiry, disseminate their findings to the broader community, and produce a diverse group of skilled graduates who will advance the field further yet.\r\n",

As the role and penetration of computing systems and networks in our societal infrastructure has gown, their importance to societal safety and security has never been greater. Beyond mere connection to the Internet and access to global resources, information systems form the backbone of our nation's financial services and electronic commerce, are used for controlling critical infrastructures such as power, water, and telecommunications, and enable the rapid evolution in healthcare toward enhanced services increasingly supported by the digital storage of and instant access to patient health and medical data.</span><br /><br /><span>Through a long-term investment by the National Science Foundation, the TRUST Center brought together several universities that joined forces to organize a multifaceted response to these issues. TRUST represented the strongest and most diverse engagement in the area of trusted systems ever assembled and combined fundamental science with a broad multidisciplinary focus on economic, social, and legal considerations as well as a substantial education component. TRUST facilitated dialog with stakeholders whose needs could not be approached in a narrower and purely technical manner or by any single research group. As such, TRUST acted as an intermediary between policy makers and society at large on the one hand, and researchers, academics, and industrial providers of services and technologies on the other. TRUST achieved its mission through research as well as a global policy for engaging in education of society as a whole.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>In research, TRUST achieved success along several fronts and addressed fundamental scientific and technological problems and advancing the state-of-the-art in a number of areas: security and privacy issues associated with the rapidly increasing use of electronic media for the archival and access of patient medical records; web authentication, end-user privacy, next-generation browser security, malware detection, and improved system forensic techniques to combat online attacks; application defenses for network-level intrusions and attacks including compromised and malfunctioning legacy applications, viruses, worms, and spyware; incentives for research, investment, policies, and procedures for technology that enhance system security, privacy, and trustworthiness; secure embedded sensor networks for large-scale applications critical to the nation's economy, energy, security, and health; and techniques that ensure trustworthy computing by securing hardware, improving software robustness, and increasing the survivability of critical systems.</span><br /><br /><span>In education, TRUST leveraged an existing learning technology infrastructure to quickly enable TRUST-developed courseware and material to be assembled, deposited in a repository, and adapted for wide web-based content dissemination. In addition to creating special courses for undergraduate and graduate curricula, and regular seminars and webcasts, the Center organized a series of workshops and conferences. It also developed online courses and support for defining an improved security curriculum for the nation's higher education system that leverages the rapid technological developments in the security area.</span><br /><br /><span>In diversity, TRUST had an ambitious goal of reaching a diversity goal across the Center of 30% women and 10% from underrepresented minorities. The Center was very proactive in this regard and expanded several programs for enhancing diversity and broadening the participation of women and underrepresented minorities.</span><br /><br /><span>In knowledge transfer, TRUST implemented a robust program of technology transition with industry (from reporting security vulnerabilities to software vendors to various consulting activities) and active engagement with governmental agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Energy (DoE), and the Intelligence Community (IC) which are all concerned with issues of cyber security and trustworthiness.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Team for Research in Ubiquitous Security Technology (TRUST) was created in response to a growing sense of urgency in dealing with all aspects of cyber security as it affects society. As the role and penetration of computing systems and networks in our societal infrastructure has gown, their importance to societal safety and security has never been greater. Beyond mere connection to the Internet and access to global resources, information systems form the backbone of our nation's financial services and electronic commerce, are used for controlling critical infrastructures such as power, water, and telecommunications, and enable the rapid evolution in healthcare toward enhanced services increasingly supported by the digital storage of and instant access to patient health and medical data.\n\nThrough a long-term investment by the National Science Foundation, the TRUST Center brought together several universities that joined forces to organize a multifaceted response to these issues. TRUST represented the strongest and most diverse engagement in the area of trusted systems ever assembled and combined fundamental science with a broad multidisciplinary focus on economic, social, and legal considerations as well as a substantial education component. TRUST facilitated dialog with stakeholders whose needs could not be approached in a narrower and purely technical manner or by any single research group. As such, TRUST acted as an intermediary between policy makers and society at large on the one hand, and researchers, academics, and industrial providers of services and technologies on the other. TRUST achieved its mission through research as well as a global policy for engaging in education of society as a whole. \n\nIn research, TRUST achieved success along several fronts and addressed fundamental scientific and technological problems and advancing the state-of-the-art in a number of areas: security and privacy issues associated with the rapidly increasing use of electronic media for the archival and access of patient medical records; web authentication, end-user privacy, next-generation browser security, malware detection, and improved system forensic techniques to combat online attacks; application defenses for network-level intrusions and attacks including compromised and malfunctioning legacy applications, viruses, worms, and spyware; incentives for research, investment, policies, and procedures for technology that enhance system security, privacy, and trustworthiness; secure embedded sensor networks for large-scale applications critical to the nation's economy, energy, security, and health; and techniques that ensure trustworthy computing by securing hardware, improving software robustness, and increasing the survivability of critical systems.\n\nIn education, TRUST leveraged an existing learning technology infrastructure to quickly enable TRUST-developed courseware and material to be assembled, deposited in a repository, and adapted for wide web-based content dissemination. In addition to creating special courses for undergraduate and graduate curricula, and regular seminars and webcasts, the Center organized a series of workshops and conferences. It also developed online courses and support for defining an improved security curriculum for the nation's higher education system that leverages the rapid technological developments in the security area.\n\nIn diversity, TRUST had an ambitious goal of reaching a diversity goal across the Center of 30% women and 10% from underrepresented minorities. The Center was very proactive in this regard and expanded several programs for enhancing diversity and broadening the participation of women and underrepresented minorities.\n\nIn knowledge transfer, TRUST implemented a robust program of technology transition with industry (from reporting security vulnerabilities to software vendors to various consulting activities) and active engagement with governmental agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Energy (DoE), and the Intelligence Community (IC) which are all concerned with issues of cyber security and trustworthiness. TRUST also worked with an active set of industrial partners to engage in research and development collaborations of mutual interest, resulting in a number of Center-developed technologies being adopted by companies, the creation of startups in the security and privacy field, and the placement of many TRUST-supported undergraduate and graduate students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: S.
