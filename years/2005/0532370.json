 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonparametric model identification and specification play a critical role\r\nin asset pricing and risk management.  The objective of the investigators is\r\nto study a number of important model specification problems using\r\nnonparametrically estimated transition densities and transition\r\ndistributions. The proposed method integrates a number of seemingly\r\nunrelated model identification problems into a common paradigm, by framing\r\nthem as various restrictions on the transition density or distribution of\r\nthe underlying process, sampled at the observation frequency. This will\r\nprovide a rich framework for analyzing other similar problems. By\r\nestimating the transition density and distribution under null and\r\nalternative hypotheses, appropriate test statistics will be proposed and investigated.  The\r\nproperties of the tests include\r\nboth the asymptotic null distributions and power functions and will also\r\nbe analyzed via carefully designed simulations.  The relative merits of\r\nvarious methods will be critically examined. Several testing problems\r\narising frequently in the empirical finance will be carefully\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigators intend to develop new techniques and theories that arise\r\nfrom frontiers of financial econometrics. The investigators will develop\r\nmodels and cutting-edge technologies for model specification problems in\r\neconomics and financial econometrics.  Common characteristics of these\r\nproblems are that the dynamics of stocks and interest rates are hard to\r\nspecify and hence contemporary nonparametric techniques are particularly\r\npowerful for these problems. The proposed techniques and results will have\r\nstrong impact on assest pricing, portfolio allocations, risk managements\r\nand other problems in empirical finance. The project will integrate\r\nresearch and education by working closely with both undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students, creating datasets and developing publicly available\r\ncomputer code.  Postdoctoral fellows and underrepresented groups will be\r\ntrained as a part of our research investigation. The results will be\r\ndisseminated broadly through presentations at seminars, conferences,\r\nprofessional association meetings and via internet.\r\n \r\n",
