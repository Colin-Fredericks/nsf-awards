 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is intended to undertake several related investigations into processes of high energy atomic\r\nphysics, including their extension toward lower energies. This involves studying the interactions\r\nof photons and electrons with correlated atomic structures, including circumstances in which\r\nthere are several interacting continuum particles in the final state. These studies can yield\r\nunderstanding of the role of relativistic, retardation and higher multipole effects in regimes\r\nwhere they become comparable to or dominate the many electron correlation effects, and it can\r\nlead to an identification of the nature of the correlation effects which persist at high energies.\r\nSpecific studies include: examining high energy behaviors of atomic processes, the extent to\r\nwhich these behaviors follow from the singularities of photon and electron interactions, and the\r\nextent to which they depend on correlations; understanding other global features of processes,\r\nsuch as analyticity, also the trajectories of zeroes which serve as a surrogate for structural\r\ninformation; clarifying the relations and transitions between classical and quantum behavior; and\r\nstudying the relationships among observables, partitioning, and entanglement. Other projects\r\ninclude considerations of deficiencies in the description of basic processes, such as Delbruck\r\nscattering and bremsstrahlung, and characterization of atomic processes (such as\r\nphotoionization, Rayleigh and Compton scattering and bremsstrahlung) and the independent\r\natomic information they contain.\r\n",
