 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaboration between the American Chemical Society (ACS) Examinations Institute, Clemson University and the IMMEX project, to develop an alternate assessment instrument for the first two years of college chemistry by adapting IMMEX technology.  The goals and objectives consist of the following.  1.  IMMEX cases with content emphasis on chemical structure and function are being collated and adapted for summative problem solving assessment, and additional cases are being devised as needed to complement current cases with structure and function content bases.  2.  Analysis of dynamic problem solving behavior for individual cases within IMMEX is being adapted to allow the measurement of the structure and function cognitive domain across several cases, and cognitive measures.  3.  The internal reliability and validity of the comparison of structure and function problem solving is being established across multiple IMMEX cases using a combination of measures including Item Response Theory analysis as well as performance and progress measures derived by neural network and hidden Markov modeling. These include measurement rubrics for transitions\r\nbetween dynamic problem solving states for students to determine gains in the use\r\nof successful problem solving strategies for students in the first two years of college chemistry.  4.  A remote IMMEX server is being established at the offices of the ACS Examinations Institute to enhance the ability to provide IMMEX cases to a growing national pool of students.  5.  A reporting system is being devised that will be published from the Exams Institute to provide instructors with reports of the gains in successful problem solving strategies for their students participating in this project.\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThis project is grounded in the prior research on assessment of problem solving using\r\nIMMEX technologies. A range of problems, based on the relationship between structure\r\nand function, is being developed and the resulting assessment data are being used to develop predictive models for individual student problem solvers. The resultant database of student problem solving behavior also provides a resource for chemical educators.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThis project involves the extension of new assessment technologies to a national\r\npopulation. The resulting reliable, normed assessments from a trusted source (the ACS\r\nExaminations Institute) that focus on deeper aspects of problem solving will be available\r\nto a broader audience. The availability of these instruments is expected to facilitate the spread of reformed curricula that emphasize deep learning and problem solving.\r\n",
