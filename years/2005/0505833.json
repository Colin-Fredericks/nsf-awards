The driving phenomenon is the\r\nexistence of photonic frequency stop-bands for periodically structured\r\nmaterials, called photonic crystals, which is the source of the\r\nrichness of their resonant behavior.  One of the salient problems of current\r\ninterest is anomalous transmission of source fields through periodic\r\nslabs near resonant frequencies, corresponding to weakly leaky guided\r\nslab modes.  The project addresses the mathematics of this and related\r\nproblems on several fronts:  We use the complex-analytic theory of\r\nboundary-integral operators to obtain asymptotic formulas for the\r\nstructure of transmission anomalies near non-robust slab modes; we\r\npursue a development of the spectral theory for general open systems,\r\nsuch as leaky slabs, based on the concept of the unique conservative\r\nextension of a dissipative system; and we investigate the existence\r\ntheory of modes and optimization of the associated resonant phenomena,\r\nas well as efficient numerical schemes for their simulation.\r\nCollaborators include S. Venakides, A. Figotin, D. Volkov, R. Lipton,\r\nand O. Bruno.\r\n\r\nBecause of their capacity to block electromagnetic waves at selected\r\nfrequencies and to trap energy, photonic crystals have become a\r\nsubject of intense research in recent decades.  Applications include\r\nhigh-efficiency lasers and filters, waveguides, and directional\r\nantennas.  Engineering of these devices relies on precise tuning of\r\nresonant frequencies, transmission-vs.-frequency profiles, and the\r\ninteraction of open electromagnetic resonators with their surrounding\r\nmedium.  This project aims to set the theoretical framework of these\r\nresonant phenomena on a solid mathematical footing.  The central theme\r\nis the frequency-response theory of open resonators, which provides\r\nthe framework for the guiding of light and other radiation by\r\nstructures, precise computation of the interaction of guided energy\r\nwith applied sources, and optimization of resonant properties.\r\nNumerical computations and experimental results from the literature\r\nwill guide the theoretical investigations.  The project involves an\r\nundergraduate student and a graduate student as research assistants.\r\nThe undergraduate has been assisting the PI in numerical simulations\r\nand will be part of a collaboration with the computational\r\nelectromagnetics group at Cal Tech.  The graduate student will pursue\r\nher Ph.D. on the subject of resonant scattering by periodic pillars. \r\n\r\n",
