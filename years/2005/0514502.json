 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is provided to support the publication of a special issue of The Oceanography Society magazine Oceanography on \"Harmful Algal Blooms and Black Sea Oceanography\".\r\n\r\nOceanography is now in its 17th year of publication.  It is published four times per year, with issues going to the membership of TOS worldwide as well as to the libraries at major oceanographic institutions. TOS membership (and, hence our readership) includes most of the senior administrators of government oceanographic agencies and academic research institutions. In the past, the magazine has published special issues on a range of topics including the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, Census of Marine Life, an issue highlighting the contributions of Dr. John Knauss to marine science and ocean policy, JGOFS, Ocean Observatories and of importance to the Division of Ocean Sciences priorities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe proposed special issue of Oceanography will bring together some of the top experts in the world, who will summarize the state of the art in HAB and Black Sea research. These articles will be written at the level that an educated layman could understand. As such, they will likely be used frequently in undergraduate and graduate classroom teaching, and possible high-school marine science courses. They will be useful tools in helping scientists and laymen alike in understanding the advances and limitations of recent HAB and Black Sea research.\r\n",
