 "awd_abstract_narration": "0506828  Masten  The proposal team has come together as a result of the realization that an interdisciplinary approach to combining new technologies in ozonation and nanofiltration with recent advances in membrane science and newly available surface characterization methods could greatly enhance the safety of the nation's water supply. This new hybrid technology will enable the deployment of a highly efficient self-cleaning membrane filtration system capable of removing nanoscale contaminants. Water pollutants targeted in this project are 1) newly synthesized nanomaterials with demonstrated cytotoxicity and 2) naturally occurring nanoparticles, which are known disinfection by-product precursors. This is the first project that will address the issue of the removal and treatment of waters laden with synthetic nanomaterials.  The proposal brings together a diverse team of highly qualified researchers, including experts in membrane-based separations, the effects of ozone in water treatment, ceramics and material sciences, and surface/colloid chemistry. Joining the team is the Chair of the Science Department at Lansing Community College, allowing us to enhance the science curriculum in the area of nanotechnology for K-12 students and develop a specialized nanotechnology program within LCC.s chemical technician curriculum. The activities under this project will be led in a hands-on fashion by PIs with postdoctoral and graduate assistants who will be trained to operate in an interdisciplinary team-oriented environment.  The project is organized to have postdoctoral and graduate assistants at the focus of day-to-day operations, with training and participation in all aspects of the technological and pedagogical tasks of this project.  The team will carry out the research in state of the art facilities at a major research university with a strong commitment to collaborative and innovative research.   \r\n \r\nBroader impacts:    \r\nSuccessful completion of the proposed research will advance discovery and understanding on several fronts. The first advance would be demonstration of a reliable, long-lived, fouling-resistant and cost-effective membrane filtration technology for nanoparticle removal from the nation's drinking water supply. The second advance would be the development of modules on nanotechnology for K-12 students and teachers and the formation of a nanotechnology curriculum for community college students.  A new membrane filter technology such as this would meet a critical need for improved security in the drinking water supply. Recent outbreaks of drinking-water borne disease emphasize the importance of this goal. Applications of self-cleaning membrane filtration technologies could also positively impact other fields such as filtration in food, pharmaceutical and biologics production. The K-12 curriculum and the nanotechnology college curriculum will likely become models for many other programs. Effective dissemination of these materials across the US will maximize societal benefit.   As a result of this proposal, researchers will be trained to operate comfortably and knowledgably in the areas of water treatment, colloid chemistry, ceramics, and surface spectroscopic analysis. Their skill set should prove in valuable as work in these areas must necessarily advance together if the nation's water supply is to be improved and protected. The principal investigators have a distinguished record of advancing the participation of underrepresented groups in engineering and science, and this, combined with the proposed participation in strong, established science/engineering programs targeted at women and minorities (namely, the Detroit-Area Pre-College Engineering Program (offered at MSU) Summer Program and the Women in Engineering Summer Residential Program), creates a potent combination for creating new education and outreach activities. In addition, the senior researchers involved will merge their expertise, facilities and instrumentation into a single working unit that will facilitate future collaborations and partnerships.  The strong scientific reputations of the principal investigators will facilitate the rapid and widespread dissemination of the results of this work.\r\n\r\n",
