 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this research is to investigate the long time\r\ndynamics of large solutions for nonlinear hyperbolic balance\r\nlaws with lower order dissipations where the theory\r\nis most lacking. The research will concentrate on problems for\r\nlarge solutions and strong waves. This often encounters the\r\ninvestigation of qualitative behavior of weak solutions without\r\nany regularity. First, we will verify the Darcy's law\r\nfor porous media flows as long time asymptotic of damped Euler equations.\r\nNext, we plan to establish nonlinear stability of\r\nelementary waves for compressible Euler equations with relaxation\r\nfor traffic flows and then extend the results obtained that far to more\r\ngeneral dissipative hyperbolic balance laws. The study of these problems\r\nrequires new techniques that will be developed in this project.\r\n\r\nThe work deals with mathematical analysis of a class of partial\r\ndifferential equations describing nonlinear flows, waves and materials.\r\nThe research seeks better understanding on qualitative behaviors of\r\nsolutions to systems with important applications to\r\nporous media flows, traffic flows and semi-conductor devices.\r\nThe results of this research are expected to benefit the\r\nstudy of compressible flows in areospace sciences, traffic control\r\nsystems, semi-conductor devices industries and the energy industries.",
