 "awd_abstract_narration": "The High Energy Physics group at California State University, Fresno, requests support for an RUI (Research at an Undergraduate Institution) in frontier collider physics research.  CSF is a non-PhD granting institution and a major focus of the program is undergraduate involvement in all levels of experimental HEP.  The research program is focused on the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron with analysis activities in the area of top physics (t-tbar production cross section and studies of t-tbar events in the dimuon channel), and hardware activities in the upgrade of the Silicon Microtracker Sybsystem (electronics testing for the new Layer 0 detector).\r\nTo facilitate their activitiesm the CSF group has: installed an electronics laboratory on their campus for the development and production testing of solid state detectpr readpit electronics used by D0; installed computing facilities for data analysis and HEP software development; and has involved students at the graduate and undergraduate levels in the operation of the D0 experiment.\r\nThis request will provide support for continued undergraduate student participation on the experiment.",
