 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extremal Problems in Graph Theory\r\n\r\nThe PI plans to continue his research in the area of developing\r\nand applying a method in extremal graph theory based on the\r\nRegularity Lemma and the Blow-up Lemma. The method finds certain\r\nspecial subgraphs in dense graphs. The main idea of the method is\r\nto reduce the general embedding problem in the original graph to\r\nembedding into (Szemeredi-) regular graphs. For the purpose of\r\nfinishing the embedding once this reduction is achieved, a general\r\ntool, called the Blow-up Lemma, was developed to find bounded\r\ndegree spanning subgraphs in these regular graphs. The PI proposes\r\nto develop this method further. He plans to improve on some of\r\nearlier applications of the method, to apply the method to new\r\nproblems, and to extend it into new directions.\r\n\r\nThis research is in the area of extremal combinatorics. The\r\ncentral question of this field has the following form: determine\r\nthe maximum (or minimum) size of a discrete mathematical object\r\nthat satisfies a certain condition. It turns out that this general\r\ntopic has connections to very diverse fields (geometry, design\r\ntheory, number theory, algebra, topology, etc.) and to areas with\r\nimportant concrete applications in everyday life (computer\r\nscience, coding theory, cryptography, optimization and scheduling\r\nproblems, communication and networking problems, etc.). Therefore\r\nthe broader impact of this proposal is that developing the method\r\nfurther and achieving results on the proposed research problems\r\nwill have serious implications in these applications as well.\r\n\r\n",
