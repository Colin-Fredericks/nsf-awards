 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator studies special wavelet decompositions of\r\nrandom processes and fields. These representations have a multi-resolution\r\nstructure and share other nice properties of standard wavelet\r\ndecompositions. In contrast to the standard case, however, the high\r\nfrequency (small scale) terms in special wavelet decompositions have an\r\nelementary stochastic structure. Random processes and fields are\r\nconsidered under a wide range of assumptions: Gaussian, Gaussian\r\nsubordinated, stable, stationary, self-similar, some non-stationary, and\r\nothers. In addition to establishing and understanding special wavelet\r\ndecompositions, questions regarding their use in simulation, analysis and\r\nmodeling are also addressed.\r\n\r\nThe project adds to the recent growth of the multi-scale\r\n(multi-resolution) approach where observed phenomena are considered at\r\ndifferent scales (resolutions). This approach where wavelets play a\r\ncentral role, has found successful applications in numerous fields such as\r\nmedical imaging, turbulence, de-noising, astronomical and Internet traffic\r\ndata analysis. The goal of the project is to develop a new\r\nmulti-resolution framework that is suitably adapted to random phenomena.\r\nDespite some progress, such multi-resolution framework has been missing at\r\na fundamental level. The developed framework should provide novel analysis\r\ntools and conceptual perspectives, for example, establish new connections\r\nbetween models in discrete and continuous times, shed light on simulation,\r\nwhich has become an indispensable tool of any scientific research, or be\r\nuseful in modeling through the multi-scale approach. The project should\r\nalso be of direct interest to and enhance ties between researchers in many\r\nareas of Science such as Applied and Pure Mathematics, Physics, Signal\r\nProcessing, Probability and Statistics.\r\n\r\n",
