 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morphology patterns that appear in complex materials are\r\nintimately related to their physical properties.  Examples include\r\nlamellar, cylindrical, and spherical patterns in block copolymers,\r\nneutral and charged Langmuir monolayers, and smectic liquid\r\ncrystal films. The investigator and his collaborators analyze and\r\npredict morphology patterns based on mathematical models derived\r\nfrom first principles of statistical physics.  They develop\r\ntechniques to deal with nonlocal constitutive relations, singular\r\nperturbations, and critical eigenvalues.  These mathematical\r\nphenomena are proved to be the reasons behind self-organization\r\nand pattern formation.  The investigator finds effective reduction\r\nmethods that accurately simplify the original infinite-dimensional\r\nproblems to manageable finite-dimensional ones.  The investigator\r\nalso studies the dynamic phenomenon of pattern nucleation in\r\nmaterials by finding and characterizing some unstable solutions to\r\nthe Euler-Lagrange equations of the free energy. The project\r\nexpands our knowledge of singularly perturbed variational\r\nproblems.  It enhances classical theories such as Gamma\r\nconvergence.\r\n\r\n     Complex materials, such as block copolymers, are used\r\neverywhere. The polyurethane foams used in upholstery and bedding\r\nare composed of multi-block copolymers known as thermoplastic\r\nelastomers that combine high temperature resilience and low\r\ntemperature flexibility. Common box tapes use triblock copolymers\r\nto achieve pressure-sensitive adhesion. Block copolymers are\r\nblended with asphalt in road construction to reduce pavement\r\ncracking and rutting at low and high temperature extremes. This\r\nproject seeks to deepen our understanding of the mathematical\r\ntheories underlying these systems.  It produces effective methods\r\nthat characterize and predict the mechanical, optical, electrical,\r\nionic, barrier, and other physical properties of these materials. \r\nThey help today's synthetic chemistry technologies to produce\r\nexquisitely structured materials to meet an ever rising demand\r\nfrom civil infrastructure and manufacturing.",
