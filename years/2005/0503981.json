 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nSequential Monte Carlo methods provide a versatile and powerful tool for\r\nsolving complex statistical inference problems. The objective of this\r\nproposal is to develop sequential Monte Carlo techniques in three\r\nimportant areas: conditional inference on multiway tables, likelihood\r\ninference in population genetics, and adaptive control of nonlinear\r\nstochastic systems. A common theme in these applications is computational\r\ncomplexity.  The investigator develops efficient proposal distributions\r\nand resampling techniques to improve current methods in these three\r\napplications.  New theories arising from these applications shed light on\r\nseveral fundamental issues related to the implementation of sequential\r\nMonte Carlo methods, in particular, the decomposition of a high\r\ndimensional problem into small components so that each component is easy\r\nto handle and the sequential nature of the problem can be utilized, and\r\nthe choice of the proposal distribution so that it is easy to sample and\r\nclose enough to the true underlying distribution.\r\n\r\nThe investigator develops innovative sequential Monte Carlo techniques in\r\nthree important areas.  The first area is conditional inference on\r\nmultiway contingency tables. Such tables arise very often from social and\r\nmedical sciences, including large survey data and grouped case-control\r\ndata with several risk factors. The second area is likelihood-based\r\ninference in population genetics, which is motivated by the interest in\r\ninferring key biological characteristics of the major pathogenic serotypes\r\nof Cryptococcus neoformans, an agent of serious respiratory disease in\r\nhumans. The third area is on-line identification and adaptive control of\r\nnonlinear stochastic systems. The investigator improves the current methods\r\nused in these three applications and develops a systematic theory that\r\nprovides insight into general strategies for applying sequential Monte\r\nCarlo methods.  New theories arising from these applications are of\r\ninterest across a broad range of areas in statistics, science and beyond.  \r\nThe proposed research has significant impact on education through\r\ninvolvement of Ph.D. students directly in the proposed research and\r\nincorporation of results into undergraduate and graduate courses.\r\n",
