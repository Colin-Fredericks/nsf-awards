 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n0509018\r\nMasanobu Shinozuka (Univ Calif/Irvine)\r\n\r\nThis research develops a sensing and diagnosis platform for multiple wireless and self-powered sensor nodes, named DuraNode, which was designed, assembled and laboratory and field tested at University of California, Irvine in collaboration between Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  The test results involving an existing bridge were verified against traditional high precision piezo-electric sensor. Substantial cost effectiveness enables a large number, say of DuraNodes to be manufactured and assembled as a prototype of next generation of SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) system, which is expected for use of control of spatially distributed urban systems, particularly utility system operations. This new version of SCADA system to be developed is for damage localization and condition assessment of these urban systems under transient disturbances due to natural and man-made hazards.\r\n\r\nScientific Merits: The proposed DuraNode-based platform permits wireless data acquisition, transmission, processing, analysis and decision making all in real-time. This is the first known effort to transform existing structural monitoring technology into the next generation SCADA for assessing structural damage and lifeline system malfunction for proper maintenance and emergency response. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The research infrastructure developed as part of this effort will provide  a basis for sharing data/simulations/test-beds within the larger engineering community,  support outreach programs to disseminate results across a broad spectrum of government agencies, practioners, and the general public, and allow underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students and other groups (minorities and small minority-owned businesses)\r\nto participate as major partners.\r\n",
