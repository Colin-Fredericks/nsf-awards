 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of an analytical transmission electron microscope (TEM) for interdisciplinary research and education at Boise State University (Idaho) is proposed.  This state-of-the-art tool, a JEM-2100, will be equipped with 200kV acceleration voltage, a Lab6 filament, an energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer, and the ability to do imaging via scanning transmission electron microscopy.  It will also allow for digital acquisition of images via a 2k x 2k pixel CCD camera with 16 bit dynamic range.  The instrument will serve the departments of Materials Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Geosciences at Boise State University. The TEM will initially be used by a core group of faculty who have experience in using TEM as an analytical tool.  These faculty investigate diverse topics including:  micromechanics, phase transformations and microstructures of ferromagnetic materials, nanoparticles formed via reduction, biomineralization, spintronic materials, extracellular matrix structures, through wafer interconnects, phase stability of gate oxide materials, nanophase structures in block copolymers, the intrusive growth of plant cells, conductive polymers for chemical sensors, and surface oxide formation on metal surfaces.  The TEM will be housed in the Boise Electron Microscopy Center, which will make it readily accessible to all researchers in the metropolitan area as well as to neighboring institutions. Access to this instrument is critical, as presently, there is no regionally available TEM for use in training and research. Very strong support for the long term maintenance and management of the proposed instrumentation is demonstrated, through a combination of institutional support ($196,000) and support from the Micron Foundation that includes both cash ($125,000) and the donation of a focused ion beam system (FEI FIB-200).\r\n\r\n\r\nAn electron microscope (TEM) for interdisciplinary research and education at Boise State University is proposed.   The instrumentation will significantly enhance the training of scientists and engineers in Idaho, and particularly in Boise, home to over one-third the population of the state. State-of-the-art materials characterization made available through access to this microscope is critical for many areas of research and development in a wide range of technologies including biomedical, microelectronics and nanotechnology.  Faculty, students and researchers from small companies in the greater Boise region currently do not have access to this instrumentation.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will have access to this instrument through research opportunities and through a specially designed new course on microscopy.  Boise is one of the fastest growing high technology regions in the country, which has resulted in an extremely strong demand from industry for highly trained materials researchers.  This demand resulted in the College of Engineering at Boise State being formed in 1997 and in the program of Materials Science and Engineering being established in 2004.  The regional need for graduates with experience in microscopy is demonstrated by the commitment from the Micron Foundation for $125,000 to pay the service contract on the proposed instrumentation for five years, and by the donation of a critical additional piece of instrumentation to the project.",
