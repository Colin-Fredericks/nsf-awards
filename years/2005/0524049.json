 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this research is to develop a 2-D planar, patch-clamp biochip to study ion-channels on biological cells trapped in nanopores located in nanowells. Ion-channels are the molecular elements of excitability in the nervous system, heart and skeletal muscles.\r\n\r\nThe approach combines biotechnology, microelectronics, MEMS, silicon microfluidics, advanced signal processing, and software development to sense the rapid openings and closings of the ion-channels. A low noise, correlated-double-sampling (CDS) signal readout combines with a switched-capacitor, 'head-stage' preamplifier, all in 1.5 micron\r\nCMOS technology, for a transimpedance gain of 1V/pA for 1-10 kHz ion-channel switching frequencies.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe study of ion-channels and cellular functions in vitro is fundamental to biological research and other fields, such as clinical diagnostics, therapy, pharmacological drug screening, and environmental monitoring. A biochip will enable experimental verification of ion-channel models as well as to extract ion-channel time and frequency response in pharmacological drug experiments. Solid-state simulation tools provide new techniques to model and characterize potential, electric field and ion concentration in ion-channels, such as the KcsA ion-channel. These simulations offer new insight into ion transport in ion-channels -important to understand diseases and processes in cardiovascular and central nervous systems.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThis research involves the integration of engineering together with the physical and life sciences. In addition, the program integrates research and education through the introduction into the classroom of the latest developments in nanotechnology as applied to the study of ion-channels. The program enhances the physical infrastructure with the incorporation of new analytical and measurement techniques, such as a bioelectronics/biophotonics laboratory to conduct experiments on ion-channel characterization. Promotion of partnerships will be within the university - across departments and colleges - as well as with the pharmaceutical industry. A cooperative effort will be introduced between NSF REUs and Lehigh's summer scholarships, as each year, undergraduates, particularly underrepresented minorities, will be introduced into\r\ninterdisciplinary research and educational in the study of ion-channels.\r\n",
