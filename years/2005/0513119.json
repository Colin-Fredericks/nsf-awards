 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues develop numerical methods for scattering\r\n\r\nproblems, and perform a detailed analysis of these methods. Specifically,\r\nthey develop boundary element methods for integral formulations \r\nof the Helmholtz equation, in which the basis functions are asymptotically\r\nderived. Each basis function is the product of a \r\nsmooth amplitude and a highly oscillatory phase factor, like the asymptotic\r\nsolution. \r\nThe phase factor is determined a-priori by geometrical optics and the\r\ngeometrical theory of diffraction, while the amplitude is a smooth function.\r\n This choice of oscillatory phase factor, ensures that the number of\r\nunknowns is virtually independent of the frequency. The basis functions\r\nbeing studied are designed in a way that the matrix, resulting from the\r\ndiscretization, has a number of significant entries which is proportional to\r\nthe number of basis functions, in the large frequency limit. \r\nHence, this matrix can be approximated with a sparse approximate \r\nmatrix. The investigator and his colleagues explore the use of the sparse \r\nmatrix instead of the original matrix, in order to obtain an approximate \r\nsolution to the problem, and they study the solution of the approximate\r\nproblem with iterative methods, and multi-grid methods. In addition they\r\nstudy the use of the sparse matrix as a preconditioner.\r\nThis new methodology is being developed by studying problems of increasing\r\ncomplexity, such as convex domains with corners in two dimensions, and\r\nconvex three dimensional domains. The impact of this research is therefore\r\nin the development of discretization schemes for the Helmholtz equation in \r\nwhich the number of unknowns is virtually independent of the frequency, and\r\nthe design of optimally fast algorithms for solving those discrete problems.\r\nThis transforms problems which are computationally exceedingly difficult if\r\nnot intractable, into ones which are readily solved.\r\n\r\nThe solution of scattering problems has many applications in technology.\r\nApplications include remote sensing, ultra-sound imaging of tissue,\r\nnon-destructive testing, geophysical prospecting, the design of reduced\r\nradar signature airplanes, and the determination of the acoustic signature\r\nof submersible vehicles. For the current configurations of interest,\r\ngeometrical complications and/or compositional complexity in the underlying\r\nstructure make manual solutions practically impossible. Moreover, in the mid\r\nto high frequency regime, standard computational approaches require an\r\nexceedingly large amount of calculations, leaving some problems\r\ncomputationally intractable. The fast and efficient algorithms for\r\nscattering problems developed by the investigator and his colleagues will\r\nbroadly impact design and discovery tools in the application areas mentioned\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n",
