 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight participants will spend 8 weeks at Auburn University during the summer of 2005 working on problems in Discrete Mathematics and Algebra.  The first two weeks will serve as orientation and introduction, with two formal meetings per day, plus at least an hour of computer lab.  During this period, participants will be given some of the necessary background for research in the areas of interest, and will be introduced to problems and classes of problems that they might work on.  In addition, each participant will be asked to prepare an \"ice-breaker\" presentation.  These presentations will be completed by the end of the third week, by which time the participants, in collaboration with each other, the project directors, and interested faculty and graduate students in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Auburn University, will be working on particular problems.\r\n  \r\nRegular meetings will continue, with talks by the participants, faculty, graduate students, and visiting luminaries.  Participants will write up their research findings during the course of the summer to be submitted to the project directors at the end of the program.  During the last week of the program, each participant will give a final presentation describing his/her work. At the conclusion of the program, participants will be asked to write a critique of their experience, and of the program overall.\r\n",
