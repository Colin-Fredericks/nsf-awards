 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyst: Center of Excellence in Adaptive Neuro-Biomechatronic Systems (CEANS)\r\n\r\nWhen using a tool or a device, a person must learn to interact with it appropriately in order to accomplish the task at hand.  We learn to swing a hammer in a manner that strikes the nail accurately; we learn to press the brake with an appropriate level of force to decelerate the car smoothly; and we learn to move a computer mouse in order to proficiently utilize software.  As technology becomes increasingly complex in its operations, its functionality, and its degree of interaction with the user, there is a growing need to embed adaptability and intelligence into the device itself.  In this situation, the device and the user simultaneously learn in an attempt to optimize their interactions.  The degree of success in this sensorimotor learning process depends strongly on the interaction between the person and the engineered system.  \r\n\r\nThe focus of the Center of Excellence in Adaptive and Neuro-Biomechatronic Systems (CEANS) will be to understand and to optimize the learning that occurs as humans interact with adaptive technology.  The Center will focus its efforts on addressing a few broad questions:  What are the biological processes that occur as a person learns to interact with a device?  How do the properties of the device affect the learning process? How can we design engineering devices to maximize the effectiveness of the learning process? \r\n\r\nCEANS will use advanced prosthetic systems as a research platform to address these questions regarding the nature of the sensorimotor learning process and to develop strategies for the design of adaptive systems to achieve specific learning outcomes.  After a traumatic injury such as limb loss or spinal cord injury, technology can assist in tasks such as stepping, reaching or grasping.  Several intelligent robotic devices and electrical stimulation systems with adaptive capabilities that are either on the market or on the horizon require that the person learn to use the device as the device adapts to meet the needs of the person.  CEANS will use these types of co-adaptive prosthetic systems to investigate the molecular, cellular and systems-level dynamics of sensorimotor learning.\r\n\r\nOur goal for this Catalyst project is to lay the foundation for a Science of Learning Center that addresses key issues regarding learning in the integration of adaptive biological systems with adaptive engineered systems.  In the planning period, we will develop a proposal for a Center that integrates interdisciplinary research and development with educational and outreach programs. Our research agenda will be at the intersection of molecular biology, neuroscience, mathematics, bioengineering, and rehabilitation.  CEANS will draw upon a wide range of expertise to discover the principles that govern activity-dependent learning in living systems, to develop novel approaches to sense dynamic changes in adaptive living systems, and to deliver new adaptive technology for sensorimotor learning. The scope of activities will include experimental biological investigation, design and development of new technology to maximize learning outcomes, the evaluation of the effects of the technology on biological learning processes, and the transfer of these techniques to biomedical industry and clinical practice. \r\n",
