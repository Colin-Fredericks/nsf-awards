 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is being made in response to a proposal submitted under the Materials World Net for collaborative research on computational materials between the NSF and EC.  \r\n\r\nCarnegie Mellon  University  (CMU)  and  Princeton  University  propose  to team \r\nwith  three  institutions  in  Europe  to  address  the  multiscale  challenges  of  modeling \r\nrecrystallization.   The US side  of  the  project  will  address  issues  of  three-dimensional representation  of  materials  that  include  the  relevant  aspects  of  microstructure  and  state, heterogeneous subgrain coarsening leading to nucleation, dislocation dynamics during recovery and  grain  boundary  properties  relevant  to  microstructural  evolution.    Recent  developments  in level  set  methods,  for  example,  have  opened  up  new  possibilities  and  will  allow  us  to  make quantitative  predictions  of  the  complex  dislocation  motions  that  occur  during  recovery  that \r\ninclude  climb  as  well  as  glide.    At  a  somewhat  coarser  length  scale,  modeling  and  theory  of subgrain coarsening has progressed to the point where it should be applied to the complex and variable structures observed in deformed materials.  Thus the project will have specific impact on fundamental research on materials in terms of developing new understanding of the processes of microstructural  evolution  via  quantitative,  predictive  models.    It  will  also  have  broad  impact through  the  education  of  students  with  regular  international  exchanges  and  through  the \r\ndevelopment of tools that can be readily transferred to industry for modeling the processing of commodity materials.\r\n   \r\nThe overall thrust of the collaboration is to develop the Digital Microstructures approach that will develop computational  tools  that  address  the  combination  of  heterogeneous  plastic deformation with recovery and recrystallization processes through numerical characterization and simulation from the atomistic scale required for boundary motion, through dislocation dynamics of deformation followed by recovery at the cell and subgrain scale, to the grain-scale aspects of plastic  deformation, coupled  with  long-range motion of  boundaries (as  recrystallization fronts).  The US members of the team will concentrate on key aspects such as kinetic properties of grain boundaries  (mobility),  dislocation  dynamics  in  recovery  and  mesoscopic  simulation  of  the recrystallization process including all  relevant features such as grain structure  and crystallographic orientation.  Verification of the predictive capability of the set of computational tools will be conducted by  comparing  the  statistics  of  the  computed  microstructures  to microstructures  measured  experimentally  (based  on  data  available  from  prior  work).  This proposal outlines the entire collaborative project but only those aspects to be worked on in the US are described in full.  The elements of the program to be conducted in the US are identified.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
