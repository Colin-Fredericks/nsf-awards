 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the role of resource environment in determining plant mating system (i.e., the degree that plants self versus outcross pollinate) and pollen export by altering flowering traits, vegetative growth and interactions with insect pollinators. These factors, in turn, are instrumental in shaping the optimal plant breeding system for a given environment. This work will use replicated populations of plants and genetic markers to estimate the effects of resources on pollinator behavior, pollen movement and mating system. This work will significantly advance our understanding of why plants with separate genders are favored over those with combined genders in dry, resource poor environments.\r\n\r\nThis work will inform broadly on how environmental change can impact plant breeding systems via plant growth and pollinator interactions. Thus, this work will contribute to our understanding of how climate change and global pollinator declines may impact plant reproduction. It will promote student training in molecular techniques and field experimental design. By participating in the research endeavor these students will act as informal ambassadors for the field of science regardless of their final professional goals. Results of this work will contribute to society by expanding our knowledge of the mating patterns and consequently the genetic diversity of an important wild relative of the cultivated strawberry.\r\n",
