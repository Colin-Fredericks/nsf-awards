Johnson\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Co-PI's of this project will organize and host the next\r\noccurrences of two important conferences on geometry and topology\r\ncosponsored by the hosting institutions and the Journal of\r\nDifferential Geometry.  The first conference will be held in May,\r\n2005 and will be hosted at Harvard University, Cambridge ,\r\nMassachusetts.  This conference will be international in scope\r\nand will highlight recent developments in the field of geometry\r\nthat will likely determine the primary direction of research in\r\nthis area for the next several years.  The other two conferences\r\nwill be the next occurrences (thirteenth and fourteenth) of the\r\nLehigh Geometry and Topology Conference and will be held on the\r\ncampus of Lehigh University, Bethlehem Pennsylvania in June, 2006\r\nand June, 2007.  These conferences will be international in scope\r\nas well with a combined emphasis on the areas of geometry and\r\ntopology.  All three conferences will be designed to attract\r\nparticipants at all stages of careers from a large geographic\r\narea.\r\n\r\nProminent researchers will be invited to prepare lectures for the\r\ngeneral audience on a range of topics highlighting significant\r\nrecent research developments and their connections to the fields\r\nof geometry and topology as well as the applications of results\r\nin topology and geometry to other areas of mathematics and\r\nscience.  All attendees will be encouraged to present current\r\nresearch results and to participate in mathematical discourse.\r\nIn particular, special effort will be undertaken to ensure that\r\nthis conference will benefit individuals in the early stages of a\r\ncareer in mathematical research. Financial support will be\r\nprovided to undergraduates, graduate students, recent PhD's and\r\nuntenured assistant professors, and members of under-represented\r\ngroups; the invited speakers will be expected to serve as their\r\nmentors by providing comment and suggesting additional problems\r\nfor study.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded jointly by the programs in Geometric Analysis\r\nand Topology.\r\n\r\n",
