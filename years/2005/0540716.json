 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing concern with security issues in the world has led to greater interest in improving the technology and methods available for detecting deception. Under direction from Congress, the NSF and the Office of Science Technology Policy are facilitating a series of six workshops to address current and future research on the science and technology of security evaluations. This workshop focuses on the methodological issues related to the use of brain imaging technologies, like fMRI, to recognize deception. The workshop will bring 12 leading experts and practitioners together for two days in August 2005 at the NSF. Participants will present and discuss the results of recent brain imaging research on basic cognitive and emotional processes as they relate to the activity of deception. Both small group and large group discussions will be used to focus the ideas and experiences of the participants in outlining key issues and research questions, ultimately leading to the formation of a series of proposed research directions. Participants will also address the ethical, legal and privacy concerns of current research. A final report will be prepared summarizing presentations and views of the workshop participants and the resulting research agenda.",
