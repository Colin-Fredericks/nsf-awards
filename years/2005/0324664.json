 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of Cast Modular Components for Steel Construction, CMS proposal 0324664\r\nPI: Fleischman, Arizona\r\n\r\nA major initiative is proposed to improve  the reliability and economics of steel construction in the \r\nUnited States through the use of modular cast components. The initiative represents a unified effort between the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC), the Steel Founder's Society of America (SFSA) and researchers at the University of Arizona (UA). A task group, Steel Founders / Steel Construction (SF/SC), has been organized to spearhead this effort.  In addition to  the AISC and SFSA staff listed above as co-PIs,  the SF/SC is comprised of SFSA foundry members, AISC fabricator members, and practicing structural design engineers. SF/SC has been meeting since early 2002 to initiate discussion on areas of common interest. The activity will involve identifying structural steel applications where modular construction can: (1) improve economy and/or reliability of a component; (2) eliminate difficult or costly fabrication and/or difficult or dangerous erection; and, (3) permit  the use of steel construction in situations previously unexplored for practical reasons. Cast modular components will be conceived, including more efficient details/sections and altogether new forms, with an emphasis on economy, constructability, and meeting architectural need. Alpha prototypes for these forms will be developed through extensive parametric studies used to evaluate geometry, material or develop special features. These  parametric studies will be analytical in nature: structural performance will be evaluated through finite element  solid modeling while castability will be evaluated through solidification modeling. Optimal shapes will be obtained through an iterative procedure involving electronic exchange of solid model data between the structural analysis team at UA and the casting analysis team at SFSA. Once  designs have been optimized, the SFSA team will cast full-scale physical prototypes. Using the appropriate surrounding steel members, the AISC team will fabricate the prototypes into structural assemblages. These steps also allow the SFSA and AISC teams to evaluate manufacturing issues related to the ease, integrity and economy of the casting and fabrication processes. The prototypes will be tested in the full-scale reaction frame at the UA Integrated  Computation and Experimentation Laboratory (ICEL). These verification tests will be used to qualify a detail or identify further challenges in structural performance to be addressed in a beta prototype. This approach to the development of cast modular forms has been used with great success by the PI in his NSF CAREER  Research. Following successful verification testing of a prototype, the AISC team will identify appropriate implementation sites and the erection issues will be evaluated. The team's strong presence in the construction rich Chicago-land area will facilitate this final step in the proof of concept. Each development process will  conclude with a comprehensive economic analysis; prequalification/codification, and outreach/marketing efforts by the SF/SC. Industry involvement will involve both the parent organizations AISC and SFSA and several of their industry members. AISC, SFSA and their members will contribute time and cost sharing including: in-kind funds, donations of material and labor costs associated with the creation of specimens for the experimental program; engineering in terms of conception and  development of the prototypes;  expertise in performing comprehensive economic  evaluations and feasibility studies; technology  transfer activities including qualification, code development, marketing and outreach. The monetary value of the first two items alone: in-kind funds (estimated @ $6K/yr per industry organization) and donation of material and labor for specimens (also $6K/yr per ind. org.) will not be less than $72,000 for the 3-year duration of the project. The significant engineering efforts associated with this activity will place the industry contribution at $168,000. \r\nIntellectual Merit.  The project will advance knowledge within the field of steel construction in better understanding force flow between components; and across fields by exchange of approaches, knowledge base, and technology. The project explores a creative approach to building, manufacturing and design of steel structures. To accomplish these goals, the project will advance the state-of-the-art in integrating manufacturing with analytical simulation, and this integration will be accomplished between academia and industry. \r\nBroader Impact: The project will directly impact two key domestic industries: the steel construction industry and the steel casting industry, and develop partnerships among them. Industry interest is evidenced by the participation of the two representative institutes, AISC and SFSA, including the formation of a joint industry committee and financial support as indicated above. The project results, when realized, will result in new efficient, safer and economical connection designs and move the steel construction industry toward modular construction. The project will support 2 graduate students, who will be educated through research and interactions with industry practitioners. Research results will be disseminated directly to industry practitioners. \r\n",
