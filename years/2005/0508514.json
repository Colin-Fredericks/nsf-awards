 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the study of the structure-electrical property correlations in multi-walled carbon nanotube based Y-junctions, for the development of nanoelectronic components such as inverters, logic gates, and frequency mixers. The approach is the sequential: (1) synthesis of Y-junction morphologies through chemical vapor deposition processes, (2) assembly of the junctions into electrical circuits through nano-contacts fabricated by focused ion beam milling and in situ metal evaporation, (3) electrical characterization of nanoscale transport characteristics, (4) structural analysis by transmission electron microscopy, and (5) identification of desirable device characteristics for novel nanoelectronic devices. The carrier delocalization, and the catalyst particles introduced during growth, induces scattering centers at the junction region which can be exploited in Y-junction based electronic devices. In preliminary electrical measurements, both diode like and inverting/switching behavior was observed in three-terminal Y-junctions, up to 50 kHz, which will be investigated.  \r\n        The broader impact would be: (a) the fabrication of novel and economical devices with advantages of low power consumption, radiation hardness, and reduced heat dissipation over conventional silicon based technologies, relevant to both civilian and military applications, (b) to convey the excitement of nano-science and technology to the wider community through developing new courses, freshman seminars, and outreach activities. By working with Preuss High School on the UCSD campus, a student and teacher exchange program will be developed. The graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will be exposed to cutting edge nanotechnology research, preparing them for careers in academe and industry. \r\n",
