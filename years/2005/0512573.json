 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I SBIR project aims to develop manufacturing techniques for passive nanowire arrays to be used in electronics thermal management devices. The project team  proposes to develop a heat pipe technology using passive nanowire array structures that are an integral component in the manufacture of low profile, high performance heat pipe/spreader devices. The use of passive nanowire arrays is the enabling innovation for the low profile heat pipe devices. The nanowire arrays allow the height of the heat pipe to be reduced to less than 1 mm (0.040\") and to be used where conventional thermal management devices are inadequate. Developing the processes for creating large sheets of nanowire arrays will enable automated equipment to produce large numbers of these devices at low cost while meeting the performance needs of next generation circuits. A strategy will be defined to manufacture large area structures that can then be used in automated assembly equipment for high volume, low cost heat pipe manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercially, the thermal management issue has become critical in electronics systems as circuits with 100 million transistors dissipating more than 100 W become commonplace. Development of the proposed technology will enable high power circuits and devices to be inserted into smaller system enclosures, allowing for the continued decreases in overall system size without sacrificing performance. The development of an\r\nautomated assembly process for heat pipe devices will enable heat pipe cost to be\r\nreduced and enter the mainstream electronics market. \r\n\r\n",
