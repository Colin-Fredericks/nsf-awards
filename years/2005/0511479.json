 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discipline: Biological Sciences (61)\r\n\r\nThis project is designed to address the problem of retention of biology majors at an HBCU (40% of incoming biology majors are being lost to other majors). Materials, on-line learning modules developed by Pennsylvania State University, perfected for one population are being adapted for use by a different population of students while retaining the same aims as the original designers.  This project is adding cases of particular interest (eg Sickle Cell Anemia) to African American students to the cases currently on the web.  In addition Introductory life science courses are being redesigned to include use of these new cases and others as a basis for in class discussion, homework assignments and monthly structured peer-monitored group discussions. A strong evaluation plan involving control groups is a further indication of the intellectual merit of this project.\r\n\r\nThe use of peer facilitators directly involves a cadre of students from a group currently underrepresented in the sciences in activities that help increase students learning of and interest in the sciences.  Dissemination is being done broadly at both the state and national levels.  The PIs are distributing materials through an existing series of state organizations including a statewide conference designed to encourage dissemination among faculty of IT developed materials (North Carolina Teaching and Learning with Technology Collaboration (TLTC) and the UNC Professional Development Portal).  National platforms such as MERLOT and presentation of findings at appropriate professional meetings and in national journals are also being employed as dissemination mechanisms.  This project is co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
