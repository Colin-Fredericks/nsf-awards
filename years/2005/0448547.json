 "awd_abstract_narration": "0448547\r\nPun\r\n\r\nNanoparticle formulations of imaging and therapeutic delivery agents are revolutionizing biomedical technologies.  Currently, there are several approaches being developed for cell-specific targeting of nanoparticles from systemic administration, but the fate of these particles inside the cell is generally not well controlled nor well understood.  Technologies that enable efficient delivery of nanoparticles to specific intracellular locations would significantly impact healthcare.  The objective of this CAREER Award is to develop materials that overcome transport limitations in order to accomplish rapid intracellular delivery to target organelles.  Specific project objectives include: (i) identifying a peptide sequence that binds specifically to motor protein complexes, (ii) integrating this peptide into a synthetic gene delivery vehicle designed to promote nuclear delivery, and (iii) assessing the vehicle's delivery efficiency in non-dividing cells in cell culture and animal models.  The techniques developed in this work may be applied to enhance the efficiency of other drug delivery systems.  The educational plan includes initiatives to nurture and encourage under-represented students in engineering.  Junior high and high school students are exposed to the field of Bioengineering and to higher education through a summer camp experience that incorporates short lectures with lab tours, hands on activities, and device demonstrations.  The teaching modules developed for the camp will also be presented in local schools to reach a broader audience.\r\n",
