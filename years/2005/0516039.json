 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nNavigating Transnational Forces: Consistency and Change in Environmental Movement Organizations in Central and Eastern Europe\r\n\r\nOver the past fifteen years, environmental movement organizations in Central and Eastern Europe have gone from relative isolation to high levels of integration into transnational networks and initiatives. Despite the benefits derived from transnational interactions, critics maintain that these relations are shaping organizational agendas and actions. With environmental decision-making around the world becoming more inclusive, and policy implementation more dependent on environmental organizations, the ability of these groups to represent their constituencies and take action in accord with their mission and goals is an increasingly significant issue. Therefore, this research examines the extent that the activities of domestic environmental organizations are driven by organizational mission and goals as opposed to transnational actors and initiatives. To address this issue, interviews will be conducted to trace the development, goals, and activities of three environmental organizations in the Czech Republic relative to their interactions with transnational actors and initiatives over time. The findings from the interviews will provide a basis for the second phase of research, a survey of national environmental organizations in four countries in Central and Eastern Europe that recently joined the European Union. The results from this inquiry will generate new insights that contribute to scholarship on transnationalism and diffusion, internal processes within social movement organizations, and democratic transition and maintenance. The project also will have broad policy and educational impacts. This includes providing graduate students with opportunities to gain research experience in domestic and international contexts. In addition, the interview materials will be incorporated into an archive and information about the history and activities of Czech environmental organizations will be made available through the project website. Further, a policy report summarizing survey findings related to current challenges that environmental groups in Central and Eastern Europe are facing as a consequence of accession to the European Union will be produced and disseminated.\r\n\r\n",
