 "awd_abstract_narration": "With NSF support through the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), Morehouse College will enhance the quality of their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics instructional and outreach programs as a means to increase participation in the Nation's STEM workforce. Project objectives include (1) increasing the number of STEM graduates; (2) increasing the number of STEM graduates who enter graduate school in pursuit of research careers; and, (3) increasing the success of STEM majors in graduate school and the STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nProject components include comprehensive curriculum reform and laboratory enhancement, expansion of undergraduate research experience and enhancement of students' preparation for and success in graduate school.  Curriculum enhancements include a summer program for High School students; reform of the gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics and psychology; and, the infusion of technology and new pedagogy into STEM courses and laboratories.  Undergraduate research opportunities will be enhanced through the Atlanta Undergraduate Research Alliance. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project includes research in curriculum reform and laboratory enhancement designed to provide students with the skills and knowledge needed to pursue STEM research careers. Research efforts will yield valuable  information regarding key questions concerning the critical skills a mentoring program should address and the role of diversity in furthering student success.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this project include the dissemination of effective undergraduate research and educational enhancement practices among institutional members of the Atlanta Undergraduate Research Alliance. \r\n",
