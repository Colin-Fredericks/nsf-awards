Storage and conversion of energy is critical for society, and fuel cells are an efficient means to convert chemical energy into electrical energy with little or no emissions. In particular, low-temperature (less than \r\n200 C) fuel cells are well suited for operation with hydrogen fuel. Recent reports have identified the development of cost-effective, durable, and safe fuel-cell systems as a key research challenges in the 21st Century. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together an interdisciplinary group of scientists and engineers with expertise in low-temperature fuel cells. The specific objectives are to 1) identify gaps in low-temperature fuel-cell\r\ntechnologies, 2) describe technical approaches to meet these critical research needs, and\r\n3) establish an agenda for basic research in low-temperature fuel cells necessary to\r\nadvance knowledge across several disciplines.  Significant progress has been made in the development of low-temperature fuel cells.  Nonetheless, it is clear that present technology falls far short of the ultimate requirements, and significant effort in fundamental understanding is warranted. The starting point for the discussion will be the assessment of the status of low temperature fuel cells, the end-use requirements, capabilities and limitations of existing systems for energy conversion. This information will be obtained through an exchange between scientists and engineers and experts in the automotive and energy companies. The challenges are broken down into the following subtopics: 1) proton conductors, 2) electrocatalysis, 3) transport, particularly at temperatures below the freezing point of water, 4) modeling and simulation, and 5) systems integration. In terms of the broader impacts, the findings of this workshop will\r\nbe published in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society. Thus, these findings will be\r\nwidely disseminated and have broad impact on the development of a hydrogen economy,\r\ntechnologies to meet future energy needs, and educational initiatives needed to foster\r\ninterdisciplinary research.\r\n",
