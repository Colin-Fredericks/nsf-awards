 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research project develops models for multivariate categorical\r\ndata by mimicking Gaussian models with a desired model structure that can\r\nbe captured in terms of the non-parametric concept of conditional\r\nindependence.  This method has a long history: graphical log-linear models\r\ncan be induced in this way by Gaussian models defined by zero constraints\r\non the inverse covariance matrix. The project seeks to greatly extend the\r\nscope of the approach.  It is proposed to define and study marginal\r\nindependence models for contingency tables, discrete-valued time series\r\nwith moving average-like dependence structure, seemingly unrelated\r\nregressions with discrete response variables, and discrete graphical\r\nmodels based on the recently introduced AMP chain graphs and ancestral\r\ngraphs.  The main objectives of the study are development of\r\nparameterizations, construction and implementation of efficient algorithms\r\nfor maximum likelihood estimation, and investigation of procedures for\r\nmodel selection. A particular focus of the project will be on employing\r\nmodern tools from computational algebra in the analysis of the structure of\r\nparameter spaces and properties of likelihood functions.\r\n\r\nMultivariate statistical models seek to describe the complex relationships\r\nbetween a large set of variables. A particular class of such models,\r\ncalled graphical models, has found wide-spread application in fields like\r\nartificial intelligence, bio-informatics, biology, epidemiology, and\r\nspeech recognition.  The models proposed in the project extend the realm\r\nof graphical models and it is anticipated that they will be applied in\r\nmany of these fields.  Moreover, the proposed methodology will provide new\r\ntools for the analysis of data of public interest such as census data.\r\nThe researchers also plan to make software tools freely available as part\r\nof a larger open source statistical software package called R.\r\n",
