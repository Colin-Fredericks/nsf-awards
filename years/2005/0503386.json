In DeKalb, Illinois at Northern Illinois University, the PIs will identify and recruit Earth science teachers serving large Hispanic populations for a paid field experience in Northern Illinois and Mexico. This intensive summer program combines science, culture, and pedagogy and begins with a multicultural workshop followed by actual fieldwork locally and in central Mexico. The fieldwork in Mexico exposes the teachers to a geologic and social environment outside of their community where they can interact with a diverse group of scientists from the Universidad National Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).  The program addresses issues of local concern, specifically water availability and quality, both in Northern Illinois and in Mexico. Upon returning to NIU, the teachers participate in a methods course and produce peer-reviewed, standards-based educational materials addressing issues of diversity, multiculturalism, social context and science content. These materials show students that Hispanic scientists are important and active contributors to science. The relationship between the cooperating teachers and NIU personnel is being leveraged, allowing for direct mentoring of Hispanic students during regularly scheduled visits in the cooperating schools.\r\n",
