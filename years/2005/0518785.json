 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: Patterned polymer brushes, that is, thin\r\nfilms of polymers end anchored to surfaces are becoming increasingly important in a number\r\nof advanced technology applications ranging from microelectronics to biotechnology. A\r\npatterned polymer brush in comparison is one that is attached to a surface in a spatially\r\ndefined micron or nanometer-sized region. A focus of the proposed research will be to\r\nexamine the synthesis of di- and triblock copolymer brushes and to evaluate in detail\r\ntheir polymerization and microstructure. A second focus of this proposal will be to\r\npattern polymer brushes at length scales comparable to brush length and to investigate\r\ntheir behavior and microstructure in these confined regions. Patterning methods will\r\ninclude e-beam and EUV lithography as well as near-field scanning optical methods. If\r\nsuccessful, this study will provide an exciting opportunity to overcome many of the\r\nbarriers currently encountered in small scale (~10 nm) structure formation and at the same\r\ntime provide an excellent model system for exploring the converging length scales in\r\ntop-down (lithography) and bottom-up (self-assembly) processing. We expect that this\r\nconvergence will lead to interesting synergies and may enable directed assembly of the\r\nblock copolymer brushes. Such an approach could bridge the gap between the limits of\r\ncurrent lithographic methods (>50 nm) and the need to achieve nanostructures as small as\r\n10 nm. The proposed research will require expertise in polymer synthesis, lithographic\r\npatterning and analytical methods capable of characterizing the small-scale structures we\r\nplan to produce. To aid us in the characterization of these new materials, we will make\r\nuse of our collaborations to investigate the patterned block copolymer brushes using a\r\nrange of synchrotron based analytical methods including X-ray reflectometry, grazing\r\nincidence (GI) SAXS and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) studies.                          \r\nBroader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity: This program will engage motivated\r\nundergraduate researchers throughout the course of the proposed research program.\r\nStudents will be connected with graduate student mentors and will participate in all\r\naspects of the research program. REU students from programs at Cornell will take part\r\nduring the summer. Participants in this program will take part in outreach activities\r\naimed at communicating the use of patterned polymer brushes. We will also provide\r\neducational samples of patterned brushes to interested teachers during participation in\r\nCornell high school teacher outreach activities. A number of companies will collaborate\r\nwith us on our research activities helping to carry out patterning studies. Both graduate\r\nstudents and especially undergraduate students will be encouraged to carry out work\r\ninternships with our collaborators.",
