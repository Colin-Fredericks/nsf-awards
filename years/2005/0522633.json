 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to combine laser micro surface melting and autonomous motion control to achieve automated polishing of micro/meso parts. The approach will be to perform laser micro melting tests on workpieces with given surface micro patterns to investigate the effect of laser wavelength, pulse duration, intensity, scanning speed (overlap), repetition, scanning pattern, and spot size on temperature distribution and surface topography change. This will allow micro melting and kinetic models to be developed that will guide process optimization and predict laser polished surface topography. Means for surface condition representation, surface condition prediction, and laser motion control with respect to the micro/meso part will be developed and combined to create an effective laser micro polishing process.\r\n\r\nSurface conditions (including roughness and waviness) of parts fabricated by emerging micro/meso manufacturing processes generally are far worse than those of larger parts fabricated by conventional manufacturing processes. If successful, the benefit of this research will be significant improvement in these surface conditions. This will result in improved performance of micro/meso parts such as dies/molds that, for example, can be used in the making of very small medical equipment components. Also, the highly repetitive surface processing motion that will be studied may improve and facilitate automation of other manufacturing processes. To improve public knowledge of micro/meso manufacturing and surface engineering technologies, this work will be introduced in an appropriate manner to engineering students and, through outreach activities, to students and teachers in elementary and secondary schools.",
