 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for the development of technologies for performance modeling.  Specifically to measure, predict, and understand the performance of a computer program on a computer system. The applications of performance modeling are numerous, including evaluation of algorithms, optimization of code implementations, parallel library development, comparison of system architectures, parallel system design, and procurement of new systems.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this effort is to survey a number of applications demanding high-end computing in an effort to ascertain their needs determining what metrics exist and what metrics need to be developed in terms of performance and productivity. The specific objectives of this effort are:\r\nTo establish a comprehensive set of parallel benchmarks that is generally accepted by both users and vendors of parallel systems.\r\nTo provide a focus for parallel benchmark activities and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and proliferation of benchmarks.\r\nTo set standards for benchmarking methodology and result reporting together with a database/repository for both the benchmarks and the results.\r\nTo make the benchmarks and results freely available in the public domain.\r\nTo engage the high performance community in helping define the future expansion of the benchmark collection.\r\n\r\n",
