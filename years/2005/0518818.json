 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clinker, rock metamorphosed by natural coal burning, has formed in the Powder River Basin (and other areas of the Rocky Mountains) since at least Pliocene. Clinker dominates the topographic form of many of the basins in which it is found, because it is more resistant to weathering than surrounding unaltered bedrock. It also preserves a record of the spatial-temporal patterns of fluvial incision, lateral backwasting, and plateau formation in these landscapes, because coal only burns when close to the surface, above the water table and ventilated with surface oxygen. Using (U-Th)/He ages of detrital zircons that are reset during clinker formation, we will map the patterns of coal burning and shallow exhumation in detail in several regions of the PRB in Wyoming and Montana, as well as characterize clinker ages over a broader scale throughout the basin. Model predictions of clinker age-patterns in individual drainages and across the landscape suggest that our results will be able to discriminate between at least some of these possible climatological or tectonic mechanisms driving landscape evolution. This work will form the basis of collaborative research between Reiners and Riihimaki, as well as individuals in the BLM and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, and undergraduate students from Yale and Bryn Mawr.",
