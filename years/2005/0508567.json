 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Verrucariales is a poorly studied group of mostly rock-dwelling lichens (fungi in mutualistic association with algae). They are found in varied habitats ranging from marine and fresh water to dry environments. The discovery that some human pathogens are derived from lichen-forming ancestor was unexpected and needs to be further investigated. First, DNA sequences will be obtained for a large sampling of Verrucariales and the classification of this order will be revised. Second, the sampling will be expanded to the Chaetothyriales and the transition from mutualistic lichen ancestors to animal and human pathogens will be characterized using computational methods. Because of their diversity in lifestyles, these two orders are ideal to study the changes of nutritional modes in fungi.\r\n\t\r\nThis project will be the first extensive molecular study on the Verrucariales and will greatly contribute to the understanding of this poorly known order of fungi. It will have a broader impact in developing new protocols suitable for microbes that are not amenable to molecular studies. Finally, it will enhance our understanding of the origin of fungal pathogenicity.\r\n",
