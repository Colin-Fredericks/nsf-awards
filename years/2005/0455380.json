When individuals in different populations no longer recognize each other as mates, they will no longer interbreed.  Consequently, the populations may become separate species.  Understanding how mating behaviors become so distinct among populations is therefore critical to understanding when and how new species are generated.  \r\n       Interactions with other species are one way that populations may develop different mating behaviors.  Because mating with the wrong species can result in few or no offspring, males and females are expected to possess mating behaviors that prevent them from mating with the wrong species.  If populations differ in the species with which they interact, then populations may become divergent in their mating behaviors.  This research will evaluate this issue by examining whether interactions with different heterospecific species can cause the diversification of both male and female mating behaviors.  To that end, artificial neural network models - mathematical models that mimic neural function - will be developed that simulate the development of female mate preferences and male mating signals in populations that occur with different species.  Moreover, the predictions of these models will be evaluated using empirical data collected from a spadefoot toad (Spea multiplicata) study system.  In addressing these goals, this research will help us understand the origins of biodiversity.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts. As the use of artificial neural networks becomes increasingly common, it is critical to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique across different disciplines.  Because empirical data will be used to test the predictions of these models, this project will evaluate the use of artificial neural network models as a research tool for predicting the behavior of natural systems.  This project will also seek to increase representation of underrepresented groups in science by providing access to research opportunities.  The proposed research will be used in presentations at historically minority universities (HMUs) to illustrate how computational techniques can be applied to questions in animal behavior.  These presentations will be used to recruit students from the HMUs into research projects associated with the funded proposal.  Ultimately, the goal is to convey to minority students that basic research is a viable career path.\r\n",
