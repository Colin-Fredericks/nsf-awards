 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is expected to elucidate the key parameters that control the interactions between proteins derived from the cell cytoskeleton, which lead to hierarchical supramolecular structures on the nanometer to micron scale.  Experiments with custom synthesized macromolecular counter-ions with defined chemical structure, will distinguish between the differing roles of charge and size of the counter-ion in controlling intermolecular interactions.  Peptide-based counter-ions will be used to clarify the role of the shape of the counter-ion on the symmetry of the self-assembly.  From a broader perspective, the research will lead to the rather exciting and formidable task of unraveling the biophysics of the cell cytoskeleton.  The elucidation of the basic rules of assembly of filamentous proteins has potential for developing novel miniaturized materials for the 21st century.  The multidisciplinary project integrates research and education in order to train students and postdoctoral researchers in modern methods required to address important problems at the interface between physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering with potential applications in biotechnology and nanotechnology.\r\n%%%%%\r\nThe project centers on discovering the key parameters that control the interactions and forces between proteins, which are used as the building blocks of the skeleton of cells.  To a large extent Nature uses electrostatic forces to assemble its building blocks in distinct shapes and sizes for specific functions.  The learned concepts should lead to the exciting possibility of developing advanced nanometer scale materials for nanoscience applications in the electronic, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries.  The multidisciplinary project integrates research and education in order to train students and postdoctoral researchers in modern methods required to address important problems at the interface between physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering with potential applications in biotechnology and nanotechnology.  The acquired interdisciplinary skills, which include synchrotron x-ray diffraction at National Facilities and state-of-the-art optical and electron microscopy methods, prepare the trainees for careers in academe, national laboratories, and industry.\r\n",
