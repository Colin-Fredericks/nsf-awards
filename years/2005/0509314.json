 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will develop  a Content and Service Composition Architecture, called Orpheus, which will manifest itself as an overlay hourglass service infrastructure for cooperative grid computing.  To solve the challenges of the hourglass Orpheus, the project involves four major research goals: (a) specification of composite content request from a user/group with similar interests, (b) construction of the hourglass service infrastructure, (c) distributed production and dissemination services and policies, and (d) multi-view presentation systems to display customized composite content according to display capabilities. The hourglass service infrastructure is a novel solution that will provide fundamentally new possibilities in Advanced Execution Systems.  The cooperative grid computing is in great need of such a solution as current solutions do not offer flexible, customized distributed composition and delivery of different content types based on user/group interest/scores.  Many distributed sources are accessible via the Internet and it would be advantageous for grid and other communities to get access to these sources in such a way that user group preferences are taken into account.  The hourglass service infrastructure represents a breakthrough solution and significant computer science advances that will integrate service computing, QoSaware service multicasting, multi-view presentation systems and content information management to support complex distributed systems such as autonomous, distributed and dynamic content production and delivery.",
