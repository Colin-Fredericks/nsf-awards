 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Dean Roddick of the University of Wyoming Chemistry Department is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program for his inorganic chemistry studies on the synthesis of new perfluoroalkylphosphine (PFAP) supported metal cations, molecular ions that combine cationic metal centers, strongly-accepting ligands, and coordinative unsaturation to form \"superelectrophiles\", systems where metal electrophilicity is maximized.  This PFAP metal coordination chemistry has provided a wide array of acceptor metal complexes that are electronically similar to carbonyl analogues.  The combination of PFAP ligands with cationic or polycationic metal ions provides strongly electrophilic stable coordination complexes, \"superelectrophiles\", with applicability to challenging problems in coordination chemistry and catalysis, and practical applications in organic synthesis and the production of commodity chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  Research in PFAP platinum coordination chemistry has resulted in the strongest (and least coordinating) superacid system known.  \r\n\r\nThis research will focus on the chemistry of new perfluoroalkylphosphine (PFAP) supported metal cations. Such metal-mediated electrophilic catalyst molecular species have practical applications in organic synthesis and the production of commodity chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  The development of new classes of powerful metal electrophiles is relevant to alkane functionalization and conversion chemistry, with implications for a future chemical industry based on methane as a primary feedstock.  Postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students will receive multifaceted training in inorganic and organometallic synthesis and characterization.",
