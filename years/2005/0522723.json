 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop an improved understanding of the micromechanics of wear at fine scales, with a special emphasis on erosive wear and self-sharpening of composite (abrasive plus bond) grinding tools. The approach to be used incorporates detailed experimental characterization of composite tool erosion and its influence on surface structure development, followed by process modeling and verification experiments on commercial grinding platforms. Students participating in this project will be involved in educational and mentoring activities in addition to their research, with the results assessed in terms of their impact on both the participating students and their classmates.\r\n\r\nIf successful the benefits of this research will include an improved ability to use the inherently flexible and robust process of tool self-sharpening to grind and finish complex, ultra smooth parts from difficult to grind ceramic materials. Additionally, an improved understanding of the fundamental micromechanics of composite wear, and its influence on the development of surface structures at a fine scale, will be developed.  This has potential applications in designing, manufacturing, and predicting the lifetime of composite materials for use in a wide range of additional applications. The research activities of students supported in this project will be leveraged with ongoing research and teaching to provide an enhanced educational experience for both the students directly involved and their classmates. This educational activity targets both retention and recruitment of students in science and engineering, and may be of benefit in improving the participation of diverse student populations.",
