 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nProposed research develops new practical methodology and algorithms as\r\nwell as theoretical results for high-dimensional data classification. The\r\nmain issue is that when the number of measured variables exceeds by far\r\nthe number of observations, estimating the full covariance matrix\r\naccurately is impossible. The investigator has previously shown that\r\nignoring the dependence completely in such a situation is a better option,\r\nbut it means discarding a lot of information.  This problem will be\r\nresolved by developing new sparse covariance estimators which will only\r\nretain important dependence information, and studying their behavior\r\ntheoretically in the context of discriminant analysis. New practical,\r\ncomputationally efficient algorithms for computing these estimators from\r\ndata will be developed on the basis of clustering and graph partitioning\r\nmethods and compared to existing regularization techniques. Theoretically,\r\nasymptotically optimal or near optimal classification performance is\r\nexpected to be demonstrated.  Another way to reduce the size of the\r\nproblem and get to the underlying structure is to reduce the data\r\ndimension using recently developed nonlinear manifold projection methods,\r\nwhich aim to discover a nonlinear low-dimensional embedding preserving\r\nmost of the information contained in the data. Using these methods\r\nrequires estimating intrinsic data dimension and neighborhood scale on a\r\nmanifold, and new rigorous estimators for both are proposed, along with an\r\nanalysis of their statistical properties.  Careful estimation of these two\r\nparameters will improve on the current mostly heuristic methods used in\r\nmachine learning and increase applicability of manifold projection methods\r\nfor high-dimensional data classification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses the new challenges posed by the massive amounts of\r\ndata collected in the modern world by developing new theoretical and\r\npractical tools for dealing with high-dimensional data, particularly with\r\nthe situation when the number of measurements taken for one observation is\r\nlarge relative to the number of observations.  New sparse estimators of\r\ndependence structure in such data are developed, which only contain the\r\ninformation relevant for data classification.  The new estimators can also\r\nbe used in any problem where large covariance matrices need to be\r\nestimated from limited amount of data, and hence will have an impact on a\r\nwide range of modern applications, such as classification and analysis of\r\ngene expression data, analysis of complex chemical and physical\r\nexperiments, remote sensing, and medical imaging, among others.\r\n\r\n",
