 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site in the Department of Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University runs concurrently with the department's Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP), which has been in existence since 1987. With NSF support, this 10-week residential summer program provides intensive, mentored research experiences in molecular biology and genetics, cell and developmental biology, biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology, and computational biology and bioinformatics. Target REU students include rising juniors or seniors from small colleges and universities that do not have extensive research programs, and students from groups underrepresented in the sciences. Ten selected students receive a stipend, meal allowance, housing, and reimbursement for travel costs. The core of the program is the opportunity to carry out an individual mentored research project, tailored to students' interest. The program includes faculty research talks, presentations and discussion by students of articles from the scientific literature, presentations on career options and scientific ethics, and a concluding symposium in which all students give formal talks about their research. Students are encouraged to consider careers in biological research, and are taught experimental, communication, ethical, and critical thinking skills needed for success. The Mellon Institute and other university facilities provide all necessary resources for conducting research, and an abundance of professional and social events enfolds REU participants into the Carnegie Mellon experience. More information is available at www.cmu.edu/bio/undergraduate/research/SURP/reu.shtml.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
