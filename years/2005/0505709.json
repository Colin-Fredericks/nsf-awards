 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0505709\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Rafe Mazzzeo\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes several activities, all fitting in the framework\r\nof linear and nonlinear elliptic problems arising in geometric\r\nanalysis on noncompact and singular manifolds. He proposes\r\ncontinuing his collaboration with Vasy on new microlocal\r\ntechniques for constructing the resolvent on locally symmetric\r\nspaces of arbitrary rank. This approach has already led to a new\r\nproof of a meromorphic continuation of this resolvent, which in\r\nturn will have applications in scattering theory and to nonlinear\r\nelliptic equations on asymptotically symmetric Einstein spaces. A\r\ngoal of this portion of the proposal is to create versatile\r\nmethods, adapted from N-body Schroedinger theory, to open the\r\nanalysis on higher rank spaces to a purely microlocal approach.\r\nThis should lead to advances in geometric scattering theory on\r\nthese spaces. The other part of the proposal discusses\r\ndeformation theory of noncompact Ricci flat Einstein spaces and\r\nof Einstein spaces with conic singularities. Even for surfaces,\r\nthe PI expects these methods to give new results about the\r\nexistence of constant curvature and Ricci soliton\r\nmetrics. Finally, the PI proposes to continue his role as\r\ndirector and teacher in SUMaC, the residential summer program for\r\nmathematically talented high school students, and also to\r\ncontinue his other mentoring and outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThe overall area of research in this proposal concerns a study of\r\nthe relationship between the geometry of higher dimensional\r\ncurved spaces and the behaviour of solutions of certain natural\r\nequations on these spaces. One example is a subject called\r\ngeometric scattering theory, which seeks to describe the\r\nbehaviour of waves, measured at large timescales, and to see how\r\nthese are influenced by the curvature of the underlying\r\nspace. The PI has developed methods to study such problems on a\r\nnatural class of spaces which appear in several different\r\nbranches of mathematics. Other examples include the study of\r\nsolutions to the Einstein equations, which are supposed to\r\ndescribe possible configurations for the large-scale shape of\r\nspace. There are many such solutions; one way to organize them is\r\nto describe their deformation theory, i.e. to see how they may be\r\naltered continuously. The PI proposes to study these questions\r\nfor certain of these spaces. A key novelty of his methods is the\r\ndevelopment of techniques from a field called microlocal analysis\r\nto these geometric problems. The nature of these topics will lead\r\nto interactions with mathematicians in diverse areas as well as\r\nphysicists, and it is hoped that the results of this proposal may\r\nhave some impact in these other areas. The PI is also actively\r\ninvolved in training and mentoring at various levels. His SUMaC\r\nprogram, now entering its eleventh year, is a proven success in\r\nmotivating gifted high school students to continue their\r\nmathematical studies. He has also been active in graduate\r\ntraining and in collaborating with young postdoctoral\r\nresearchers.\r\n",
