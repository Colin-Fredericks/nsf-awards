 "awd_abstract_narration": "The majority of people on the planet lack housing security, which means they rent without tenancy protections, live in vastly expanding slums, or squat (defined as residing in a space without legal entitlement). This dissertation research by a cultural anthropologist will explore housing insecurity in contemporary urban life by investigating how low income people find housing in Amsterdam, a wealthy Western European city with a serious housing shortage and a highly structured social housing system. The project studies how race and citizenship affect the way people find housing. Amsterdam has a severe housing shortage, a constant influx of low-income new arrivals in need of housing, and state-subsidized low-income housing, which new arrivals cannot access for reasons that vary with their citizenship status. Recent arrivals thus must engage in the extra-legal housing options of squatting, anti-squatting, and subletting. This study's objectives include understanding characteristics of illegal households; determining if residents' race and citizenship impact which tactics they use to find housing; and understanding how housing seekers' personal networks impact their decisions to sublet, squat or anti-squat.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include the value of the new knowledge to be produced for housing policymakers in the EU and in the Netherlands; in addition the study will contribute to the social science training of a female minority PhD candidate in Anthropology. \r\n",
