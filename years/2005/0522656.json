Preliminary results indicate that a novel selective filling technique can be employed to create complex patterns in chromatographic chip systems.  State of the art techniques employed for making sol-gel binders with unique properties will be developed for chromatographic chip systems. Efficient chromatographic chip systems will be developed by the immobilization of small particle diameter chromatographic materials using sol-gel techniques along with increased column lengths and gradient operation. The chromatographic chip systems will be evaluated for pore morphology, permeability, pore size distribution, chromatographic efficiency, and separation capability using biological test mixtures. Multifunctional systems will be examined using the selective filling sol-gel technique for integrating enzymatic digestion with gradient chromatography in a chip format.  In terms of the broader impacts, this project may guide the development of a new platform technology for implementing chromatographic separations in multifunctional chip formats, which will have a potential impact on a variety of fields ranging from proteomics to environmental science. In addition, the development of selective filling sol-gel immobilization technology will facilitate advances in the state of the art of lab on chip devices. The project will also educate both undergraduate and graduate students in the state of the art of sol-gel nanotechnology as well as chip based separation systems.  Chromatographic chip technology can impact areas where bioseparations are important, including environmental science and proteomics.\r\n",
