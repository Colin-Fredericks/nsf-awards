 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of the organization of a symposium that will review the accomplishments of the Materials World Network since 1995 and plan for its future. The symposium is one of the scheduled symposia of the Mexican Materials Research Society annual meeting and XIV International Materials Research Congress to be held in Cancun, Mexico, on August 22-25, 2005. The organizers of the symposium are Prof. Chang and Prof. Mauricio Terrones, at the Instituto Potosino de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas, San Luis Potosi, Mexico.  Invited participants include leading members of the global materials community, investigators of NSF-funded international materials research collaborations, representatives of government agencies, members of adhering bodies of the International Union of Materials Societies, directors of materials research and education centers and networks, students who have participated in NSF-funded materials research and education programs, etc. Roughly two hundred participants are anticipated. \r\n\r\nThe event includes plenary presentations and small planning group discussions on topics that include research collaboration, education, funding opportunities, development and use of cyber-infrastructure, etc. A workshop report will be generated. Anticipated outcomes of the meeting include the development of new strategies for further development of the Materials World Network and of plans for their implementation, as well as development of new international collaborative partnerships and networking efforts through participation in the broader International Materials Congress.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
