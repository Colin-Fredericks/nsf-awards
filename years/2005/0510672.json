 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThis project is integrating FT-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy into the undergraduate science curriculum via a mechanism that exposes over 200 students per year to modern instrumental techniques.  Beginning with an introduction to NMR in General Chemistry and culminating in individual research projects in Physical Chemistry and Biochemistry, STEM students are interacting with FT-NMR techniques in as many as six courses within the curriculum.  This project is using the Anasazi FT-NMR system because it offers a cost-effective means for providing students with the necessary training in using 1- and 2-dimensional NMR.  This instrument provides a mechanism for students to perform successful autonomous scientific investigation at the undergraduate level by requiring them to complete projects and presentations using the NMR instrument as part of their senior thesis.\r\nBecause NMR is a fundamental technique that is an essential part of a high-quality undergraduate science experience, the project's intellectual merit is evident.  This instrumentation is not only a research tool of the bench chemist, but it has broader significance to the general public as the basis for MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) used in the medical field.  This project is providing students with essential proficiency in the use of modern technology, and undergraduate chemistry students, specifically, must possess a working knowledge of NMR to be successful in employment or further study in the field.  To broaden its impact, this project is exposing this fundamental technique not only to chemistry students but also to biology and non-science majors by engaging them in activities using the NMR to develop critical thinking skills.  In partnership with local education agencies and teachers, the community at large is gaining exposure to FT-NMR concepts and techniques through this project.  Further dissemination is occurring through professional development workshops afforded to chemistry teachers in the surrounding area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
