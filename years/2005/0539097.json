 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sixth International Workshop on Accurate Solution of Eigenvalue Problems (IWASEP VI) will bring together leading researchers in the numerical solution of eigenvalue and singular value problems. The IWASEP meetings have a strong history of research presenations in perturbation theory and algorithms for the symmetric eigenvalue problem, the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem, singular value problems, and, more recently, polynomial eigenvalue problems. The format of the workshop is designed to facilitate interaction, give visibility to leading research in the field, and stimulate new research. Eigenvalue and singular value computation has always been an important  area within numerical linear algebra and numerical analysis, thus the workshop will stimulate research in an important and intellectually deep field.\r\n\r\n\r\nEigenvalue and singular value software is at the core of software in many engineering disciplines. Many computer similation codes for the stability of a structure (e.g. a building, bridge, or tower),  and fluid flow codes (for gas dynamics or weather prediction)  rely upon eigenvalue software. The Google web page solves an eigenvalue problem inside its page rank software, a commonly used web browsing tool. The singular value decomposition is the basis of computations in face recognition applications in vision (for security at  airports), data mining (interpreting large volume of information in a concise understandable manner), and image compression (reducing the storage for an image or video so that it can be transmitted more quickly over the internet)..  The funding of this proposal will help graduate students, post doctoral researchers, and new university faculty to attend IWASEP VI; having an impact on education of the graduate students and post doctoral researchers, having an indirect impact in university classrooms throughout the U.S., and further developing our understanding of a field of scientific computation that is important in many practical engineering problems.",
