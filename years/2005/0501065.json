 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT.\r\n\r\nPI's propose to concentrate their efforts on several classical problems in\r\nAnalysis and Spectral Theory  that remained unsolved for the last 20--50\r\nyears, due to the lack of appropriate technical tools.  Among the problems\r\nare:\r\n\r\n* bilipschitz equivalence for higher dimensional analogues of analytic\r\ncapacity; \r\n\r\n* two weight estimates for the Hilbert Transform;\r\n\r\n* well-posedness of the inverse scattering problem for the discrete\r\nSchrodinger operator,\r\n\r\ni.e., uniqueness of the inverse nonlinear Fourier transform;\r\n\r\n* selected problems of noncommutative harmonic analysis\r\n\r\nAlthough the problems span several different areas of analysis and\r\nmathematical physics, our recent research revealed striking connections\r\nbetween  the proposed problems. To put it briefly, they all are unified by\r\nthe fact that in all of them the same type of singular kernels (usually the\r\nCauchy kernel) appears. Also, the problems share the same difficulty, the\r\nkernel got \"spoiled'' by multiplication by virtually arbitrary functions\r\n(weights). Recent developments in the non-homogeneous harmonic analysis,\r\nwhich treats exactly this type of situations, made  successful solution of\r\nthe proposed problems plausible.\r\n\r\nHarmonic analysis investigates complex processes by representing them as a\r\nsum of elementary ones (sinusoidal waves, wavelets) with well understood\r\nbehavior. A central part of modern harmonic analysis deals with \"singular\r\nintegral operators\" of one type or another. Such operators are pervasive in\r\nthe scientific landscape: they turn up in mathematical physics, probability,\r\nengineering, image processing, etc. While the theory of singular integral\r\noperators is now well developed (starting with works of Calderon and Zygmund\r\nand continued by  numerous researchers after them), it deals with  the\r\noperators defined on a nice \"smooth\" set, like the usual Euclidean space.\r\nHowever, in many problems one needs to investigate such operators on a \"bad\"\r\nset, like surfaces with singularities and even on more pathological sets.\r\nThe non-homogeneous harmonic analysis  was introduced  by the PI's to deal\r\nexactly with such situations: recent solution by X. Tolsa of the famous\r\nsubbaditivity problem for the analytic capacity is one of the most\r\nimpressive applications of this PI's theory of nonhomogeneous analysis. PI's\r\npropose to attack several classical problems, where the framework of the\r\nnon-homogeneous harmonic analysis appear naturally.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
