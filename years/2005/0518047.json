 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary This dissertation project examines how the general political preferences of legislative decision-makers translate into attitudes toward specific policies. It challenges the assumption that the conversion of ideological and constituency interests into policy preferences is direct and automatic, and seeks to explain how preferences over political outcomes become preferences concerning particular policy proposals. The project focuses on preference formation in the European Parliament (EP). This research consists of the analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data. The dissertation student processes and analyzes approximately 70 elite interviews with members of the European Parliament and EP officials. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity: The research is based on an original, deductively derived theoretical model that recognizes the interaction of structure, process, and actors in shaping policy choice. This model fuses a rational choice approach to the study of preferences (spatial theory) with an innovative model that acknowledges the importance of the cognitive and ideational context within which collective action takes place. This approach has been laid out in an article accepted for publication in the American Journal of Political Science, indicating its perceived merit and potential impact in the field. The preliminary research presented in the article also shows the co-PI to be well qualified to conduct the proposed research program: he has demonstrated his familiarity with the relevant literature, his ability to perform the necessary research, and his capacity to successfully present his theory and results to a broad professional audience. The research contributes to three strands of literature. In the realm of European Union studies, it adds to our knowledge of law-making in the EU and advances our understanding of political contestation and voting behavior in the European Parliament. It also makes a broader contribution to the study of legislative decisionmaking by specifying the conditions under which structural factors shape policy choice. At the most general level, it contributes to the study of preferences and preference formation, which have been examined widely in the research on policy choice, by questioning the conceptualization of preferences as exogenous inputs into decision-making processes. \r\nThe broader impact resulting from the proposed activity: This research contributes to our understanding of democratic practices and the conditions under which the representatives of the people make decisions. Most importantly, it challenges William Riker's argument that the ideal of representing the \"will of the people\" is impossible and meaningless because all electoral results are arbitrary and manipulable through agenda-setting and strategic voting. By specifying the context and the constraints under which agenda manipulation takes place, this research illustrates the limits of agenda manipulation and challenges Riker's assertion that manipulation is ubiquitous. It thus contributes to our knowledge of both democratic theory and practice. The potential implications of this research for democratic governance are especially relevant in the European Union, where the discussion of the \"democratic deficit\" uniquely fuses theoretical understanding with real-life experience.  \r\n",
