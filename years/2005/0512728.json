 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project constitutes initial instigations into the use of alternative fluorous solvent systems for biphasic catalysis.  Based on preliminary results which demonstrate the enormous impact that solvent tuning can have on fluorous separations, a research plan using alternative fluorous solvent systems in biphasic catalysis is proposed. The objectives of the Phase I research are: (1) To identify alternative fluorous/organic solvent systems suitable for liquidliquid extraction processes. (2) To identify solvent pairings in three reaction modes. (3) To study the features of the three prototype processes.\r\n\r\nThe innovation meets pressing needs of pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers to produce important small organic molecules on large scale, cost effectively and in a safe and environmentally friendly manner. These alternative solvents are not only more effective, but also less expensive and greener.  Fluorous techniques are already being used in a range of applications including drug discovery, small molecule library synthesis, peptide and oligo synthesis, and proteomics. The research proposed will lead to even wider acceptance and use in all areas where separations are problematic.  \r\n",
