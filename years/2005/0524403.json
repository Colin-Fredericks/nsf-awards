 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate materials that can inject efficiently electrons of predominantly one spin state into semiconductor devices.   The approach is to explore the following  promising systems.  1) Side emitting Fe-based spin light-emitting diodes.  These require very small magnetic fields for their operation.  The side emitting geometry offers the possibility for the development of spin lasers.  2) InAs quantum-dot-based light-emitting diodes with Fe spin-injecting contacts.  These devices can operate at room temperature due to the zero-dimensional character of the InAs quantum dots.  3)  InAs-based spin light-emitting diodes. This material system offers high electron mobility for optical applications in the mid-infrared.   4) A new class of spin light-emitting diodes which utilize half metallic MnAs layers as spin injecting contacts. \r\n\r\nThe proposed program combines scientific research with education and outreach to the local high schools. In the former category we expect that the proposed scientific work, will have a significant impact on the future development of information technology due to the potential use of the results for practical applications in spintronic devices.  Some aspects of the proposed work on InAs quantum dots are also expected to find applications in the emerging, and related, field of quantum computing.  The educational aspect of the work has two directions: 1) training the next generation of scientists and engineers in the emerging field of spintronics; and 2)  disseminating information on the scientific method in general and on the proposed work in particular to students at the high school level.\r\n\r\n",
