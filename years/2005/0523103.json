 "awd_abstract_narration": "Homologous meiotic recombination is an important process because it creates new genotypes by shuffling chromosomal segments that otherwise would be inherited as blocks and promotes fertility by ensuring that chromosomes segregate properly.  Recombination allows the construction of genetic maps, which are used in risk prediction for inherited disorders, in marker-assisted selection of desirable genotypes in agriculture, and in map-based cloning of valuable genes in plants.  This project will increase our understanding of homologous meiotic recombination in maize, which is an excellent model organism for studies of recombination and has economic importance to American agriculture and industry.  Much of the work is based on the discovery in the PI's lab of an unprecedented level of haplotype variability in maize.  The project aims to study how recombination is affected by it.  The project will continue to analyze meiotic recombination in maize by combining the power of the genetics of the bz region with that of modern molecular tools.  \r\n\r\nThe project is relevant to U.S. agriculture in that it studies meiotic recombination, the phenomenon underlying most plant breeding.  The project will be staffed by members of under-represented minorities and will serve as excellent training ground for undergraduate students interested in learning modern genotyping techniques. The P.I. himself is actively involved in collaborations with scientists from developing countries.  \r\n\r\n",
