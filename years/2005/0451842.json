 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radiative corrections have played a central role in the development of theoretical\r\nphysics since the original successes of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in the late\r\n1940's. Their calculation in atoms and ions is technically challenging because of the\r\ncomplexity of the electron propagator in bound states. Two theoretical tools will\r\nbe used in this project to attack this problem. The first, S-matrix theory, is most\r\napplicable to highly charged ions. QED effects are highly enhanced in these ions,\r\nand recent advances in experiment provide a wealth of data sensitive to this physics.\r\nS-matrix theory can be used to systematically calculate radiative corrections in these\r\nions, provide tests of QED, and possibly uncover new physics through the comparison\r\nof theory and experiment. The existence of an expansion parameter, 1/Z, leads to\r\nthe simplification of having to deal with a limited set of Feynman diagrams. A major\r\npart of this work  involves the calculation of these diagrams, which should allow\r\nthe above-mentioned tests.\r\n\r\nIn neutral atoms the 1/Z expansion parameter is not available, and precision tests\r\nare much more difficult. A major development of recent years has been the application\r\nof non-relativistic QED (NRQED) to few-electron systems. This technique allows one\r\nto start with the Schroedinger equation, which can be solved with high accuracy for\r\nfew-electron atoms. NRQED provides a systematic method to account for relativistic\r\nand QED corrections. Another major component of the proposed research is applica-\r\ntion of this method to the fine structure of helium, where comparison of sufficiently\r\nadvanced theory with already existent experiments should allow a determination of\r\nthe fine structure constant with high accuracy.\r\n\r\nFinally, the evaluation of radiative corrections to parity nonconserving (PNC)\r\nprocesses in heavy neutral atoms is proposed. The earliest particle physics evaluations\r\nof this radiative correction, which involved free propagators, are significantly changed\r\nwhen bound propagators are used. A full calculation has not yet been carried out,\r\nbut work carried out under the previous grant should be generalizable to this complex\r\ntask, which has important particle physics implications.\r\n",
