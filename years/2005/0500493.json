 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Nuclear Physics Summer School (NNPSS) brings together \r\nleading researchers to lecture on their specialties to advanced \r\ngraduate students and post-doctoral research associates in experimental \r\nand theoretical nuclear physics.  The overall goal of the NNPSS is to \r\nprovide students with a reference frame for defining critical problems \r\nof nuclear physics and the most useful methods of analysis of the \r\nproblems.  The intent is to broaden the students' appreciation for and \r\ninterest in the field of nuclear physics, while also strengthening them \r\ntechnically.  In bringing students togther from different parts of \r\nnuclear physics, the NNPSS also plays an important role in building a \r\nnuclear-physics community, i.e. the school often is the first \r\nopportunity for young researchers to interact across subfields and to \r\nnetwork with their peers.\r\n\r\nThe NNPSS is organized and hosted each year by leading nuclear \r\nphysicists at major universities and national laboratories.  The site \r\nof the NNPSS is moved each year so that on average participating \r\nstudents travel similar distances over the lifetime of the schools.  \r\nThe NNPSS is governed by a national steering committee, appointed by \r\nthe Executive Committee of the Division of Nuclear Physics of the \r\nAmerican Physical Society.  The Principal Investigators work with the \r\nsteering committee and with the organizers to facilitate the annual \r\nschools.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Intellectual Merit:  The National Nuclear Physics Summer School, held annually since 1988, is an effort by the nuclear physics community to acquaint students with the forefront issues of the field and with the experimental and theoretical tools that are available to nuclear physics researchers.  The intent is to broaden student appreciation for and interest in the field, while also strengthening them technically.  Typically most of the field\u00c6s major directions are represented in the lectures: hot and cold nuclear matter, electromagnetic physics, weak interactions, astrophysics, and nuclear structure.  Advanced graduate students and beginning postdoctoral researchers are the target audience.  School organizers are charged with identifying outstanding lecturers from theory and experiment, conducting the school in a manner that encourages discussion and interaction, and developing supporting materials, including an online archive of lectures that can serve as a long-term reference for participating students and for others who are interested in the current status of nuclear physics.  School organizers are assisted by the Principal Investigators and by a Steering Committee appointed by the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society.  The award, which terminated on February 28, 2011, supported six summer schools, held at the University of California-Berkeley (2005), Indiana University (2006), Florida State University (2007), George Washington University (2008), Michigan State University (2009) and the TRIUMF laboratory in Vancouver, BC, Canada (2010).  A photo, showing the lecturers and students who participated in the 2010 summer school, is attached.  The 2010 school, held in Canada, indicates the international nature of training and research in physics.  Important outcomes for the grant period include the presentation and archiving of lecture series from 39 lecturers, the presentation and archiving of special seminars from 42 speakers, and opportunities for 270 students to make public presentations on their personal research.   All archived materials are maintained by the national Institute for Nuclear Theory (University of Washington) on its website http://www.int.washington.edu/NNPSS/.   This is a heavily used resource for the entire nuclear physics community.\n \nBroader Impacts:  The school is often the first opportunity for students to recognize the breadth of nuclear physics and to interact across sub-fields.  Thus, it plays an important role in building a nuclear physics community.  Student morale is enhanced by this opportunity and by the chance to meet with some of the field\u00c6s leading researchers.  The school allows students from under-represented groups to network with their peers.  Students leave the school with stronger backgrounds in nuclear physics, and with new knowledge of their chosen specialties.  As the lectures are preserved in an on-line archive, the students can return to this material when a need arises during their subsequent training and research.  Students are given a chance to present talks and thus to gain experience in making presentations to a diverse audience.   A total of 270 students had the opportunity to experience the school, attend the lectures, and network with fellow students over the course of the grant period.  We feel that the summer school encourages a more diverse and a better connected community of young researchers in nuclear physics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wick C Haxton"
