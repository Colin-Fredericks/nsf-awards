Yau\r\n\r\nThis research proposal contains projects in five areas: (1)\r\nFundamental problem in CR geometry, (2) Explicit computation of\r\nCR automorphism groups, (3) Simultaneous embedding problem for a\r\nCR family of compact CR manifolds, (4) Deformation of CR\r\nmanifolds and deformation of isolated singularities, (5)\r\nHolomorphic De Rham cohomology and complex Plateau problem. Yau\r\nintroduces a new Bergman function for any strongly pseudoconvex\r\ncomplex manifold, which is invariant under biholomorphic maps. He\r\nintends to use this Bergman function to study the CR equivalent\r\nproblem of strongly pseudoconvex CR manifolds lying on the same\r\nvariety with isolated normal singularities. He developed a new\r\ntechnique to define a continuous numerical invariant on strongly\r\npseudoconvex CR manifolds lying on the same variety. He shows\r\nthat his invariant varies continuously in R when the CR structure\r\nof strongly pseudoconvex CR manifold changes in the variety. Yau\r\nobserves that his new Bergman functions put a lot of restriction\r\non biholomorphic maps between strongly pseudoconvex CR manifold,\r\nfrom which the automorphism groups of the CR manifolds can be\r\ndetermined explicitly. He illustrates how this works in a\r\nconcrete example. The proposed work in (3) builds on his joint\r\nwork with Xiaojun Huang and Hing Sun Luk on simultaneous\r\nembedding of CR manifolds. It will be done in collaboration with\r\nXiaojun Huang. They intend to use their prior work on further\r\nextensions to study the most subtle problem on simultaneous\r\nembedding of 3-dimensional CR manifolds. Yau plans to use the\r\ntechniques developed in (1) and (3) above to understand the\r\nrelation between the Kuranishi family of CR manifolds and versal\r\ndeformation of isolated normal singularities in a more concrete\r\nmanner. Finally the work in (5) is part of Yau's ongoing project\r\non holomorphic De Rham cohomology and complex Plateau problem. He\r\nhas shown that the vanishing of holomorphic De Rham cohomology of\r\nthe CR manifold X gives a lot of restriction on the singularities\r\nof the variety which X bounds. He plans to use his result to\r\nsolve the clasical complex Plateau problem for 3-dimensional\r\nstrongly pseudoconvex CR manifolds in 3-dimensional complex\r\nEuclidean space.\r\n\r\nThis research proposal has an important theme of unifying\r\ndifferent fields such as CR Geometry, Complex Analysis,\r\nSingularities Theory and Algebraic Geometry together. The\r\nphilosophy and technique of the proposal will also be useful in\r\nbiotechnology. With the completion of human genomic sequence, it\r\nis an urgent task to accurate identify protein coding regions\r\n(exons) from genomic sequence. Similar to Yau's proposal, one can\r\ntry to find numerical characters of exons which introns do not\r\nhave. In this way, one may be able to identify all possible human\r\nproteins. The next important task is to predict the properties of\r\nthese newly discovered proteins. Using the similar technique\r\ndeveloped in Yau's proposal, one may able to represent each\r\nprotein as a point in certain n-dimensional space.  Proteins\r\nwhich are closed to each other in this space should have similar\r\nproperties. In this way, one can predict some properties of newly\r\nfound proteins. Biologists can do experiment to verify these\r\nproperties.\r\n",
