 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\nThis project focuses on the scientific and cultural production of knowledge at archaeological sites\r\nthrough an ethnography of archaeologists working in Pompeii, Italy. The exacting \"scientific\" nature of\r\narchaeology has played a pivotal role in the construction of cultural and national identities. This project\r\nseeks to understand the micro-processes by which artifacts become scientific objects and how, as\r\nscientific objects, artifacts become objects of signification:  of \"Italian-ness\", \"European-ness\" and finally\r\n\"World Heritage\".  Italy is a country fraught with a continual crisis of cultural and/or national identity\r\nbut the narrative of a shared Roman ancestry became important in attempts to generate \"Italian-ness\". \r\nHistorically archaeology helped establish and legitimize this \"common\" identity. \r\nIntellectual Merits \r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research is to examine how archaeology is currently being enrolled\r\n in the project of identity formation. As one of the most important sites in Italy, Pompeii offers the best \r\nopportunity to examine these processes at work. In 1997 Pompeii was \"inscribed\" by UNESCO and \r\ndesignated a \"World Heritage\" site. As such it is a particularly interesting place to potentially locate the\r\nformation of a new yet not fully defined European or world identity. This project not solely concerns the \r\nuses that archaeology has been put to in the social and political arena, but also with the practice of \r\narchaeology itself and how these practices construct scientific objects that are then employed to make \r\nlarger truth claims. While general conclusions have been offered as to the work of archaeology as a \r\nnation-building tool, this project seeks to understand how archaeology as science is a \"sign producing\" \r\nactivity and exactly how it is that the archaeological sign comes into being and circulates to produce\r\nnarratives of heritage, identity and nation.\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nUNESCO's declaration of Pompeii as a \"World Heritage\" site points to the broader impacts of\r\nthis study. Archaeological artifacts have long been caught up in important and contentious policy debates\r\nover the disposition of such objects: not just who owns them, but who can use them for proprietary and\r\nnarrative projects. This study will contribute to those policy debates, as well as the broader discussion in\r\npolicy circles in Europe: the Council of Europe explicitly stated in its Forward Planning Project of 2001\r\nthat archaeological heritage would be used to \"Europeanize\" Europe. This project will thus have broader\r\nimpacts in addressing the policy and scientific debate about the interface between the science and the\r\npolitics of archaeology in the new Europe. Finally, Italy has recently passed legislation allowing the\r\nprivatization of Pompeii. How can privatization be reconciled with the larger collective projects of\r\nUNESCO and the Council of Europe (which themselves may be at odds)? The data collected through the\r\nproposed research will be useful to scholars and policy makers attempting to navigate this increasingly\r\nfraught legal and proprietary terrain.\r\n\r\nThis award is being co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering\r\n",
