 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fruit flies exhibit versatile and sophisticated capabilities of stimulus discrimination and\r\n\"attention\"-like behavior. They are particularly attuned to recognizing novelty. This proposal\r\noutlines a plan to delineate the network and neural principles underlying the fruit fly's ability to\r\nperform these information-processing functions, and then to employ them as the basis for a\r\ncomputational device. This multi-step program will be begun by defining the circuitry in the fruit\r\nfly subserving its recognition, selective attention, and novelty responses, analyzing the\r\ncontributions, connections, and interactions of these circuit elements both behaviorally and\r\nphysiogically, and then introducing this neural architecture as the basis for the computer-simulated\r\nbrain in a brain-based device capable of displaying novelty recognition.\r\nWe will use techniques of gene targeting that we have developed previously to identify\r\nthe parts of the brain contributing to recognition, selective attention, and novelty responses. We\r\nwill map the sites in the nervous system mediating the effect by manipulating neural activity.\r\nThis will be achieved in two opposing ways: one way by blocking activity and the other by\r\nincreasing activity. These perturbations will be targeted to different, restricted parts of the brain\r\nby means of a set of genetically engineered fly strains we have developed and used over the\r\nyears. In this manner, we will map the funcitonal circuitry mediating a fruit fly's novelty\r\nresponse by increasing or decreasing excitability in restricted brain regions.\r\nAim 1: Analyze the complex, organizational architecture by which the fruit fly's nervous system\r\nachieves behaviorally the recognition of novelty.\r\nAim 2: Map the distribution of the 20-30 Hz LFP response in various brain regions, and the role\r\nof coherence between these brain regions in the generation of the fruit fly's novelty response.\r\nBrain-based devices provide the groundwork for the development of intelligent machines\r\nthat follow neurobiological rather than computational principles in their construction. As is the\r\ncase with animals, the behaviors of brain-based devices emerge solely as a result of internally\r\ngenerated activity of their nervous systems rather than of responses to any programmed\r\ninstructions from computer software. Such devices are particularly useful in situations of novelty\r\nwhere computation is not possible in principle or in cases of great local complexity where\r\nprogramming proves infeasible. Such a device must confront novel situations and complex sets of\r\nparameters that must be dealt with rapidly. Our goal is to implement principles from the fruit fly\r\nsystem into such a device, using as our platform an existing brain-based device developed at The\r\nNeurosciences Institute.\r\nAim 3: Introduce a simulated neural architecture based on the functional network for novelty\r\ndetection defined in Aims 1 & 2 into a brain-based device.\r\nThe long-term goal of this work is to understand the principles upon which the nervous\r\nsystem of the fruit fly operates as the basis for neurobiologically inspired computational devices.\r\nThe principles underlying nervous system function hold promise for developing a new generation\r\nof devices that would be more capable of adaptive behavior than current systems. The most\r\nsophisticated behavior seen in either biological or artificial agents is shown by organisms whose\r\nbehavior is guided by a nervous system. The fruit fly offers the requisite complexity to be of\r\nvalue in this endeavor, while being simple enough (i.e., small enough in neuron number) to be\r\namenable to analysis. Most importantly, it offers sophistication afforded by a multi-disciplinary\r\nexperimental approach (genetics, anatomy, physiology and behavior) to be followed by computer\r\nsimulation and device implementation.",
