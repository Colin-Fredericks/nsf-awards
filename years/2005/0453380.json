 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Mountain Lake Biological Station (MLBS, University of Virginia) offers ten students a summer opportunity to conduct independent, self-motivated, interdisciplinary, and original research in experimental, field-based ecology, evolution, and behavior.  Under the close supervision and guidance of a research mentor and the program coordinator, students design, execute, analyze, interpret, and present a self-contained research project within the ten weeks of the program.  Many student projects are published in leading peer-reviewed journals.  Students participate in weekly seminars on the design and conduct of research, scientific ethics, writing and presentation techniques, and other matters of scientific and academic life.  Students prepare written and oral proposals and final reports.  Participants also take advantage of the rich, varied, and stimulating intellectual and social life at Mountain Lake Biological Station.  MLBS hosts two formal research seminars per week, which include both in-house and invited speakers.  All Station residents eat meals together in the common dining hall, and most daily activity revolves around the central lab building where all research programs are housed.  Since field sites are often within walking distance, interactions among all Station users occur constantly, resulting in a supportive and collaborative environment.  Each summer, some 60-80 scientists, faculty, post-docs, and students are in residence at the Station.  Students from under-represented groups and those with limited opportunity for research are especially encouraged to apply.  Four Historically Black College and University (HBCU) member institutions are active partners in the program.  Program information are available at http://mlbs.org/REU.html, or by contacting the REU Coordinator at mlbs-reu@virginia.edu.\r\n\r\n",
