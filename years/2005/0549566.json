 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models of landscape evolution in the face of repeated glaciation incorporate\r\nassumptions about glacial sliding that are in need of field verification. Temperate glaciers slide\r\nwhen water pressures are high. As primary subglacial erosion mechanisms are attributable to\r\nsliding of the glacier over its bed, the spatial and temporal pattern of sliding, and of the\r\nsubglacial drainage network that control it, are important to understand. The proposed research\r\nacts upon hypotheses generated in two recently completed NSF-supported grants in which 1) the\r\nsliding field on the small Alaskan Bench glacier was carefully documented using continuous\r\ndifferential GPS, reaching its maximum speed at times of highest water storage within the\r\nglacier, and 2) the annual outburst flood of Hidden Creek Lake beside the much larger Kennicott\r\nglacier was shown to greatly perturb the hydrologic system. The 400 m thickness of the\r\nKennicott Glacier allows much more rapid collapse of the subglacial drainage network than on\r\nthe 150 m thick Bench Glacier during times of low snowmelt input to the glacier surface. As the\r\nsnowmelt input increases again, the subglacial plumbing system must re-grow, during which\r\ntime it should re-pressurize, promoting another period of sliding. If this is the case, then glacial\r\nthickness emerges as a primary control on the total annual sliding of a glacier, and therefore on\r\nthe ability of a glacier to erode the landscape. The proposed research takes advantage of the\r\naccessibility and size of this Kennicott Glacier to investigate in detail the sliding history of this\r\nlarge temperate glacier and its association with both the seasonally-evolving water storage and\r\npressure fields, and the inevitable annual Hidden Creek outburst flood.\r\nIn this pilot project, the following hypotheses will be tested, in the hope that the data\r\ngenerated will serve as proof that the work is both tractable and productive of insight into the\r\nsystem.\r\n* Short-lived sliding increases will occur during ice dammed lake outbursts.\r\n* Sliding anomalies at the Kennicott Glacier occur in association with synoptic variations in\r\nmelt inputs.\r\n* Long, thick glaciers, like the Kennicott glacier, will experience both more total sliding than\r\nthin glaciers, and multiple sliding events within a single melt season.\r\nThe data to be collected include time series of: glacier surface motion, using multiple GPS\r\nreceivers on the glacier run in differential continuous mode; water inputs by snowmelt and\r\noutputs from the exit river to constrain evolution of the water balance; englacial water pressures\r\nat several locations along the subglacial flood route that take advantage of side-glacier lakes and\r\nmoulins; water chemistry at the outlet stream. Taken together, this data will directly test an\r\nexisting model of linked glacial dynamics and subglacial network evolution.\r\nBroader Impact. As the research will be accomplished near the Wrangell St Elias National\r\nPark's primary entrance near McCarthy, the research on the Kennicott Glacier is ideally situated\r\nto allow direct communication of both our scientific methods and results to the public. As in\r\nprior work, public talks will be given to national park visitors in formal seminars. Activities will\r\nbe coordinated with the Wrangell Mountains Center, a private non-profit institute dedicated to\r\neducation and research, through their Alaska Wildlands Studies, a 7-week field course accredited\r\nfor college students through UC Santa Barbara. Guest lectures on principles and field techniques\r\nof glaciology and glacial geology will be given, and opportunities for involvement of its these\r\nstudents in the field work will be offered. The research will employ and train one Ph.D. student\r\nfrom CU, and at two undergraduate students.",
