 "awd_abstract_narration": "Upper Midwest food industry giants are world leaders in the biosciences, but skills required by their workers have become more demanding. In contrast, typical urban students struggle to pass basic skills math tests, and become disengaged from advanced STEM coursework as they are forced to enroll in remedial classes. This project bridges urban students to advanced technology education and to careers in the growing food-related biosciences.\r\n\r\nA Food Technology Associate's degree program is being created at Dunwoody College of Technology, along with a public school feeder system and transition services to four-year degrees. Existing food science and technology courses in Minneapolis Public Schools are being refined and a career educator is working alongside the food science teachers to prepare interested students for more advanced science and math coursework in high school, and then on to advanced coursework at Dunwoody or the University of Minnesota.  \r\n\r\nThe Dunwoody program is based on a comprehensive Competency Analysis, employer surveys and student/family market research. Model curricula, lab exercises and field learning experiences have been adapted from approved Bachelor's programs, industry training programs, and NSF-funded projects like AgKnowledge and Biolink. The new degree integrates lecture and lab work, promotes regular contacts with industry and university representatives, and provides internships and student support services.\r\n\r\nThe project evaluation is examining the impact of the programs on the attendance, retention, achievement, graduation, post-secondary credit/degree attainment, and employment of under-represented students. The evaluation also assesses the quality of professional and curriculum development activities, and provides a basis for dissemination of adaptable educational resources.\r\n",
