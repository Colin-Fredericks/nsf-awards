 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative study between seismologists, mineral \r\nphysicists and geodynamicists at UC Berkeley and at the Univ. of \r\nMichigan, the goal of which is  to combine observational constraints \r\nand theoretical tools from their respective\r\nfields and investigate large scale 3D variations in temperature and \r\nmajor element chemistry in the earth's upper mantle directly from the \r\ninversion of seismic waveforms.  At the heart of this proposed study \r\nis the conjecture, supported by theoretical\r\nconsiderations, that the one step inversion of seismic waveforms for \r\nphysical parameters such as composition C and temperature T, should \r\nyield more stable results than the standard approach of first \r\ninverting for velocity and attenuation structure separately, and then \r\ninterpreting the obtained maps in terms of physical  parameters. The \r\nlatter is currently inhibited by the poor resolution in 3D upper \r\nmantle attenuation, Q, due to contamination of amplitudes by largely \r\nunmodelled, but\r\nsignificant, effects of focusing and scattering. The coupled \r\ncharacter of the equations in the one step approach, combined with \r\nthe strong sensitivity of amplitudes to T (through anelastic terms) \r\nshould offset the approximate character of the available mineral \r\nphysics partial derivatives as well as the errors due to inadequate \r\ntheoretical treatment of focusing.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will: 1) invert a global collection of long period \r\nseismic waveforms for T and radial anisotropy, using recent\r\nexperimental contraints on dispersion and attenuation in the \r\nuppermost mantle; 2) starting from the model obtained in (1), they \r\nwill test their ability to invert for lateral variations in \r\ncomposition (as expressed in terms of basalt depletion).  Partial \r\nderivatives with respect to C and their uncertainties will be \r\nevaluated and provided by the mineral physicists in the team using a \r\nself-consistent formalism  which incorporates results from \r\nexperiments and first principles calculations.  At this point, they \r\nwill also incorporate geodynamical constraints  to increase \r\nresolution of the compositional component of the inversion.  An \r\niterative procedure will be required at each step in the inversion \r\nprocess, because of the dependence of various partial derivatives on \r\ntemperature, due to the presence of strong attenuation and phase \r\nchanges, as well as the large uncertainties remaining in the \r\nestimation of these partial derivatives.  The project includes \r\nfunding for two students and a post doc, who will be trained using a \r\ncross-disciplinary approach.\r\n",
