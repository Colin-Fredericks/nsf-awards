 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project, which focuses on engineering and computer science and includes both a pre-college recruitment and STEM faculty development effort, is working to produce a 15 % increase in graduates in these disciplines.  The pre-college effort is a seven-day program that provides 11th grade high school students and their teachers with an overview of the many varied careers computer scientists and engineers can pursue and connects the high school curriculum with engineering application. Part of each day is devoted to joint sessions enabling students and teachers to explore engineering and computer science fields and to engage in exploratory laboratory activities.  During the rest of the day, separate sessions expose students to the undergraduate academic and social community making up campus life and provide teachers with professional development intended to connect traditional course material to engineering and computer science applications.  The second component, professional development for the University's STEM faculty is helping them learn, develop, and incorporate effective instructional strategies that provide active learning for their students.  These efforts are focusing on concept mapping, the learning cycle, and problem-based learning.  The results will be evaluated using surveys and interviews with participating high school students, high school teachers, and computer science and engineering faculty members.  The results will be disseminated through interactions with partnering school districts and local companies and by direct contact with other universities.",
