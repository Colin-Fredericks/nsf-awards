 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award provides funds for a Chapman Conference on Radiated Energy and the Physics of Earthquake Faulting. This conference will provide a forum for Earth scientists who are working to resolve fundamental questions involving the understanding of earthquake energy budgets. The physics of fault rupture related to the radiated seismic energy that is often associated with damaging ground motion is an important question to address. The topics of seismology, geology, laboratory rock mechanics, geophysics, geochemistry and the numerical modeling of earthquakes will be emphasized at the conference. A critical goal is fostering better communication among these groups of scientists to advance the understanding of how earthquakes work and the various energies involved in the seismic source processes.\r\n\r\nChapman Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and are designed to promote opportunities not normally available through the format of larger meetings. Funds in the amount of $18,900 are requested for travel expenses of some graduate students, young scientists, program committee members and others who require support to participate in the conference.\r\n",
