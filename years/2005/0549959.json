The proposed IAQ sensor network consists of sensors that supply long-term continuous measurements for indoor gas pollutants, particle pollutants, and bio-aerosol pollutants.  The design and evaluation methodologies for a comprehensive IAQ sensor network will be explored.  The data collection and analysis methods will be examined.  The innovation of the proposed study include: 1) systematically examine how to design and evaluate the next generation comprehensive IAQ sensor network; and 2) construction and implementation of a smart IAQ sensor network which includes large variety of IAQ sensors in a real building to supply long-term real time IAQ measurements for the relevant research society and to demonstrate the next generation IAQ sensor network concept.  The research undertaken would provide guidance to the industry about how to design, implement, and evaluate next generation IAQ sensor network.  The collected field data would further assist the research society in the following areas: 1) Next generation building ventilation/decontamination system design and control strategies; 2) IAQ model validation; 3) Human health and productivity related research; and 4) Multi-hazard mitigation, emergency response and disaster preparation.  The proposed research involves international collaboration between the United States and China. \r\n\r\nThis is a SGER project.\r\n",
