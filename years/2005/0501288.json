 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at modeling the effects of various environmental factors on reliability of distribution feeders to identify parts of the system with high probability of failures and to provide comparative analysis of actual performance with expected performance.  Specific steps of the project are: 1) detailed study of all the environmental factors that influence failures on distribution feeders, 2) investigate and seek models to represent the effects of these factors on failures on distribution feeders, 3) investigate methodologies to identify feeders that have high probability of failures due to exposure to environmental factors, 4) investigate methodologies to compare actual performance of the feeders with expected performance based on selected models, 5) use Westar Energy distribution system as a test bed to validate the models and methodologies, and 6) develop modules based on the research for inclusion in three courses. \r\n\r\nInnovative methodologies for accurate reliability evaluation of distribution systems will be investigated, which will advance the frontier of knowledge in the field of reliability evaluation.  This research addresses an important problem with significant broader relevance to society. Specifically, this work could lead to improved reliability of distribution systems, where most electric power interruptions arise. The collaboration between university and industry will facilitate enhancement of the research infrastructure.  The project will introduce new multi-disciplinary perspectives to the participating students.  \r\n",
