 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will bring together a diverse group of researchers from the United States and Hungary with expertise in probabilistic combinatorics who will interact with students and scientists from other disciplines to identify pressing problems of large-scale random graphs and structures. The organizers are Robert Kozma and Bela Bollobas of the University of Memphis with Hungarian partners Tamas Vicsek of Eotovs Lorand University and Peter Erdi and Gabor Tusnady, from Institutes of the Hungarian Academy of Science.  Their goal is to establish a link between two major areas of large-scale graph models.  One is fundamental graph theory inspired by neurobiology called neuropercolation.  The other is based on statistical physics and involves empirical studies of large-scale real-world networks such as small worlds and scale-free networks. The collaboration benefits from the expertise of the U.S. group in random graphs, percolation theory, and neurocomputing, and is complemented by Hungarian strengths in biophysics and statistical physics of large-scale graphs.  Workshop results are expected to define new random graphs to model complex real-world networks such as brains, biological and physical memories, computer systems, and communications.  \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary workshop fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   Broader impacts include early career introduction of U.S. graduate students to leading theorists and mathematicians in the international research community.",
