 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests NSF support for a limited scope NSF workshop on this topic, in the style of\r\nother NSF workshops in targeted areas of emerging interdisciplinary research. The goal of the \r\nproposed NSF workshop on Programmed Self-Assembly will be restricted to study (rather than conduct \r\nnew research) the research challenges, applications, and opportunities to NSF in the areas of Self-Assembly with respect to Self-Assembly methods that allow for Programmability.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nSelf-assembly is a key emerging interdisciplinary topic of essential importance to\r\nexisting programs within NSF, and would be very positively impacted by a workshop\r\ncentering on the (largely until now unexplored) topic of Programmed Self-Assembly. The\r\nproposed workshop will consider scientific challenges to developing Self-Assembly\r\nmethods that relate to or utilize computational methods, provide programmability and are\r\napplied to scales ranging from molecular to micro to even larger scales.\\\r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\nThis NSF workshop will be interdisciplinary at its core, with participants from\r\nChemistry, Biochemistry, Physics, Material Science, Electrical Engineering, Computer\r\nScience, and Mathematics. It will impact both the research community in Nanoscience as\r\nwell as other disciplines engaged in the study of self-assembly at larger scales. It will also\r\nbenefit the NSF to allow for the identification of targeted research opportunities and\r\nchallenges. To insure involvement by graduate students, a number of their travel and\r\nlocal expenses will be supported. The PI and his institution Duke University purely as a\r\nservice make the proposal to the community - there will no overhead charged on any\r\naspect of this Workshop.",
