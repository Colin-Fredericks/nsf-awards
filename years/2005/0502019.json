 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore new paradigms for engineering research, education, and practice that address the needs of a 21st century global, knowledge-driven society. A multi-stakeholder team of technology leaders will be used as a guidance group in the development and assessment of new visions for the future of engineering, using a combination of workshops and interviews.  The project will evaluate recent efforts both in the United States and abroad to rethink various aspects of engineering research, education, and practice, both to inform the visioning effort, and to harvest those aspects that align most clearly with new visions for engineering in America. In particular, it will link an action agenda to recent efforts such as the NAE's Committee to Assess the Capacity of U.S. Engineering Research and the Engineer of 2020 study and the Council on Competitiveness's National Innovation Initiative. A road-mapping framework will be developed for moving toward these visions, coordinating closely with parallel efforts from other groups such as the National Academies, the federal government, higher education, and industry.  Initial steps will be taken to build the necessary awareness and support among leaders in government, industry, and education sectors. Particular attention will be paid to developing bolder and more effective efforts to attract broader segments of our population into careers in engineering. \r\n \r\nThis project will explore at the most fundamental level the changing character of engineering research and practice that is likely to drive a revolution in engineering education.  This project will address one of the most critical issues facing our nation: how to generate the new engineering knowledge and human resources necessary to sustain the nation's leadership in technological innovation so key to our future prosperity and security.\r\n",
