 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the acquisition of a high-resolution, high-field 500 MHz NMR spectrometer that is equipped with pulsed field gradient, cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS), and variable temperature accessories, as well as a multinuclear observe, an inverse broadband, and a CPMAS probe.  The specific aims of the project are to (i) expand the research opportunities of ten faculty members in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, their research students, and laboratory personnel in two of the focus areas central to the research and teaching mission of the Department, namely structure/function relationships of biomolecules and materials chemistry, and open up new lines of investigation;  (ii) enhance and facilitate collaborative research with Ph.D. granting institutions or the private sector; and (iii) increase the research activities of a diverse undergraduate and graduate student population through access and training in the practical applications of liquid and solid state NMR spectroscopy at high field.  In the area related to structure and function of biomolecules, the NMR spectrometer will allow new insights to be obtained in the (i) study of porphyrinic and metalloporphyrinic pigments incorporated in model membrane systems; (ii) synthesis of structurally complex alkaloids; (iii) understanding of structure/function relationships of metalloenzymes, of metallopeptidase inhibitors, and of enzyme substrate analogs involved in DNA and RNA biosynthesis; (iv) study of gas-phase salt complex substitution and elimination reactions emphasizing chiral recognition; and (v) study of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial complexes I and II.  In the materials or environmentally relevant materials chemistry area, solid and liquid state NMR spectroscopy will facilitate research on (i) novel zeolite intercalation compounds, (2) the cycling and fate of organic matter in the environment, (iii) reactions of arsenic on mineral, metal oxide, and remediation material surfaces, and in silicon tetraazaannulene complexes that are studied in collaboration with the private sector.  \r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this instrument will provide unique opportunities to a diverse student body in both the research and instructional programs to acquire hands-on training in modern aspects of NMR spectroscopy.  Acquisition of this instrument will jumpstart the research careers of recently hired minority and women faculty members and empower them to pursue new lines of biomolecular or materials chemistry research, or to establish themselves as role models in the applications of solid-state NMR spectroscopy to the fate of organic matter in the environment.  As a minority-serving campus, SFSU is proud to be a leader in the education of a student body that is comprised of 68% non-white ethnicity students and 61% women.  Thus, the training in modern high-field NMR applications combined with the collaborative student-faculty research focus will prepare the Department's diverse student body for the challenges awaiting them in Ph.D. programs and the workforce.   \r\n\r\n",
