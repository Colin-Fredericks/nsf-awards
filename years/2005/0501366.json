 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-speed fiber optics plays a key role enabling high bandwidth communications.  In light of impressive commercial advances, new effects have become key limiting factors for continued growth in the bandwidth of lightwave systems.  One such impairment, viewed as a key roadblock for future high-speed systems, is an effect called polarization-mode dispersion (PMD).  PMD arises due to small random variations along the lengths of optical fibers, which lead to scrambling of polarization states and pulse spreading in the time domain.  The latter effect can cause errors in digital communication systems. This problem is especially acute in the embedded fiber base where many fibers exhibit strong PMD.   This proposal describes a university-industry collaborative project which aims to demonstrate a novel and advantageous method for compensation of PMD.  The concept is to exploit and extend technology developed in the field of ultrafast optics for wavelength-parallel sensing and compensation of wide-band optical signals. This improves on current approaches that only allow compensation of so-called first order PMD for a single wavelength and which do not apply to situations with wide-band optical signals where the distortion caused by PMD varies substantially across the optical bandwidth.                                                                                                                 \r\nThis research has the potential for broad societal impact by supporting advances in the high-speed communications infrastructure that has become pervasive to our economy.  The participation of two industrial organizations as co-PIs in this proposal should catalyze rapid transfer of research results to practice.  This research project should furnish excellent opportunities for broad student training in areas of cutting-edge technology, while providing teaming opportunities, including industrial research visits, that will enrich the students' educational experience.  \r\n",
