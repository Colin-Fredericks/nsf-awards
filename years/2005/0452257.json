 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Undergraduate Institute in Physics-Research Experiences for Undergraduates (UnIPhy-REU) at Hampton University is an eight-week residential summer research program for undergraduate students. The program offers research opportunities to eight physics, science, or engineering students in the areas of nuclear, particle, atmospheric, medical, and optical physics. The UnIPhy-REU site program is located 15 miles from the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) and 10 miles from the NASA/Langley Research Center (NASA/LaRC). The intent is to make effective use of this location to enhance the cooperative spirit present between the institutions and thus provide unique opportunities for students. UnIPhy-REU provides a strong REU site for students from groups under-represented in physics. Students conduct research under the guidance of a mentor; they are in daily contact with the mentor, researchers, and graduate students. Additionally, students participate in seminars and social activities. Some of these activities are conducted jointly with the REU group from the College of William & Mary. At the conclusion of the program, students give a thirty-minute oral presentation and submit a written research report.",
