 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n1\r\nAward Abstract and Statement of Broader Impacts of Planned Research\r\n\r\nAfter a long period of empirical and intellectual stagnation, many of the century-old paradigms about the\r\ninitial phases of the diversification of angiosperms are in the midst of being rewritten. It is now evident\r\nthat the earliest phases of angiosperm evolution may have been characterized by a very high degree of\r\ndevelopmental experimentation and structural lability. In contrast to concerted efforts to study the\r\nevolution of floral morphology, vegetative anatomy and ecophysiology among ancient angiosperm\r\nlineages, little attention has been paid to reconstructing the early diversification of embryological features\r\namong flowering plants. It is the explicit goal of the planned research to study the basic and highly\r\ninterrelated processes of female gametophyte development, double fertilization, and endosperm formation\r\nfrom an evolutionary developmental perspective in a set of species specifically chosen to represent the\r\nbreadth of diversity among basal clades of flowering plants.\r\n\r\nThe following four interrelated questions will be addressed: 1) Did the earliest flowering plants possess a\r\nprocess of double fertilization, and have some ancient angiosperm lineages lost this process? 2) What was\r\nthe developmental pattern and mature structure of the ancestral angiosperm female gametophyte? 3) Are\r\nthere additional and previously undocumented developmental patterns and mature structures of female\r\ngametophytes among basal angiosperm lineages? 4) How has ploidy and genetic constitution (e.g. the\r\nmaternal to paternal genomic ratio) of early angiosperm endosperm evolved? Beyond establishing\r\ngeneral developmental principles that can explain the diversification of female gametophyte structure and\r\nendosperm genetic structure and ploidy, the planned research will make a significant contribution to\r\nunderstanding more general aspects of the tempo and mode of character evolution during the earliest\r\nphases of the evolutionary diversification of flowering plants.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will contribute significantly to the development of human resources in the\r\nsciences. Members of the Friedman lab (undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctorals, technicians)\r\nhave the opportunity to grapple with some of the most basic and longstanding questions in evolutionary\r\nbiology, and to develop independent intellectual skills. All members of the lab are charged with\r\nsignificant scientific responsibility. One Ph.D. student, Eric Madrid, is a member of an underrepresented\r\ngroup in the sciences (Hispanic). He will be directly supported by the proposed research grant. Eric is\r\ncommitted to outreach efforts to improve the level of participation of minorities in the sciences and\r\nalready has had a major impact in serving as a role model for other members of underrepresented groups\r\nin the sciences.\r\n\r\nCurrently, most of the members of the Friedman lab are women and aspire to careers in the life sciences\r\nas educators and/or practicing scientists. One technician, Kirsten Ryerson, who will be supported by the\r\nproposed research grant, plans to enter a career in public school science education. She will begin\r\nworking towards a teaching certificate for the state of Colorado next fall. Her direct engagement in\r\nresearch in the Friedman lab should directly benefit her future biology students. Another technician who\r\nwill be supported by the planned research grant, Amanda Redford, is keen to pursue research\r\nopportunities that will lead to graduate study. Finally, through the REU program, undergraduates will be\r\nsupported to gain first hand research experience in the laboratory of the PI, William Friedman. In\r\nessence, while the vast majority of funds associated with this proposal will go to support the solution of\r\nbasic and longstanding scientific questions, these funds will play a critical role in supporting the\r\ndevelopment of members of the next generation of life scientists and educators.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is anticipated, that the basic findings derived from the planned research will, as has been the\r\ncase in the past, be covered in college level textbooks. Thus, the research should have an impact on\r\nundergraduate and graduate curriculum development throughout the U.S.",
