 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on Lycopersicon - the species group that includes the domesticated tomato - to identify the genetic basis of hybrid pollen and seed sterility, two of the strongest reproductive isolating barriers among species in the Solanaceae, the tomato family. Using comparative genomic trait mapping between five different Lycopersicon species, in combination with classical genetics and phenotyping, the research will: 1) identify the number, individual effect, and location within the genome, of genetic regions that cause pollen and seed sterility among species; 2) determine the phenotypic consequences of interactions among these different genetic regions; and, 3) develop the groundwork to identify individual genes directly responsible for interspecific reproductive barriers among Lycopersicon species.\r\n\r\nReproductive isolation barriers are a substantial obstacle to agricultural exploitation of wild germplasm and are fundamental to the origin of biodiversity. Nonetheless, very little is known about the genes responsible for reproductive isolation, especially among plant species. This research will provide detailed insight into the genetic basis of hybrid sterility among multiple species in an economically important plant group. Research products will include genomic data and resources that may increase the accessibility of agriculturally useful traits found in wild species, and thereby aid the development of new crop resources. Due to their close relationship, this work may also help in identifying genes responsible for hybrid sterility in other economically important plants, including potato, eggplant, and pepper. The research will also provide a diverse training environment for undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers, in plant breeding, genomics, and evolutionary biology.\r\n",
