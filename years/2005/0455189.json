Organized by Prof. Herve Moulin of Rice University with Prof. David Cantala, Centro de Estudios Economicos, El Colegio de Mexico in Mexico City, and Prof. Francisco Sanchez, Departamento de Matematicas Basicas, Centro de Investigacion en Matematicas, Guanajuato, the researchers intend to develop scientific collaborations between several academic institutions in Mexico, where strong research in the area is on the rise, with colleagues in the US as well as South America and Europe whose research is complementary to that of the Mexican participants.\r\n\r\nOver four days, the meeting will bring together around 30 scholars, divided in three approximately equal contingents from Mexico, North and South America, and Europe. In addition, up to ten graduate students mostly from Mexico but also from the U.S. will be involved.  The meeting will focus on recent research on the formation of coalitions and networks, cost and surplus sharing, assignment, matching and other allocation mechanisms. In particular, new applications of the classic techniques of cooperative game theory, e.g., to fair division, matching and cost sharing, and on new modeling approaches to the perennial question of coalition formation, e.g., networks, hedonic coalitions and incomplete information, will be discussed.  It is expected that the meeting will reinforce academic ties between U.S. universities and the best institutions for economic research in Mexico. This will facilitate the movement of graduate students and junior researchers on both sides of the border.\r\n\r\n0455189\r\nMoulin\r\n\r\nThis U.S.-Mexico award will support a research workshop in the field of mathematical economics and game theory.
