 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\n\r\nThis project is providing a real service to the community while preparing science students for the long-term, interdisciplinary problems they will encounter as professionals.  Building on teaching theories and models developed at the University of Maryland and Oxford, the project is coordinating classes in four disciplines (geography, biology, chemistry, and geology) to study a new storm water treatment wetland at Radford University.  The students themselves are monitoring the plant and animal life and evaluating the effectiveness of the water treatment ecosystem as it develops year by year.  Project findings are being reported to the university and the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Students are learning methods of long-term data collection and analysis using industry standard technology, and are developing research skills Students are learning about the interdisciplinary nature of ecosystem studies by sharing ideas, data, and research conclusions with students in other disciplines in an annual wetland symposium.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Radford University has a relatively high proportion of women and students from Appalachia who are the first in their families to attend college.  The program is trying to recruit, retain and better prepare these students for careers in science.  In addition, the program also maintains a web site for the project database, making both scientific results and the instructional materials being developed available for educators across the country.  Participating faculty are also presenting results in state and national disciplinary meetings.\r\n",
