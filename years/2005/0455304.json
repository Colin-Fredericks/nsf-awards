 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of Hilbert schemes and vector bundles is a fundamental problem in \r\nalgebraic geometry. Their connections with physics and representation theory \r\nwere pioneered in the work of Atiyah and Penrose.  The Hilbert schemes of \r\npoints on smooth surfaces together with its relation to representation theory \r\nof infinite dimensional Lie algebras is a particularly beautiful subject in \r\nalgebraic geometry, which is related to other areas including Gromov-Witten \r\ntheory, Donaldson-Thomas theory, the McKay correspondence, the S-duality \r\nconjecture, integrable systems, orbifold cohomology, and the n!-conjecture \r\nin algebraic combinatorics. In this project, Professor Qin intends to study \r\nseveral problems concerning Hilbert schemes and moduli of vector bundles in the \r\ngeneral context of algebraic geometry and its interplay with representation \r\ntheory and string theory. The main tools are techniques of vertex algebras, \r\nquantum cohomology, the virtual localization formula, derived categories of \r\nsheaves, and stable bundles on surfaces as well as on Calabi-Yau 3-folds. \r\nThis project also involves the participation and training of graduate students \r\nand postdoctoral associates.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry studies geometric objects described by polynomial equations.\r\nIt has been at the central stage of recent confluence between mathematics and\r\nphysics. Many of these interactions have led to profound improvement in the \r\nunderstanding of both mathematics and physics. Professor Qin's research helps \r\nto strength these interactions, and has many of its roots in mathematical \r\nphysics\r\n",
