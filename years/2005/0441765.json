 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes development of a distributed optical fiber sensor using computationally designed fluorescent proteins.  Surface plasmon coupled emission (SPCE) has been shown to be an excellent means to enhance fluorescence sensing technology.  With our innovation, grating-assisted SPCE (GASPCE), the fluorescence emission can be coupled into optical fibers with great efficiency.  The integration of the GASPCE and existing optical fiber networking technology, such as spectral/time domain multiplexing, provides a robust infrastructure to perform distributed real-time resource monitoring.  The core sensing technology is based on computationally designed proteins (CDPs), proteins containing a ligand-specific engineered binding site and conjugated fluorophore.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed system will address urgent needs related to homeland security and national defense.  Further, it will have numerous industrial and scientific applications.  The proposed enhancements have applicability across a wide range of fluorescent detection methods.  The low cost and adaptability of CDP approach promises the expansion of detection systems into areas that were previously impractical to address.  \r\n",
