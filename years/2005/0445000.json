 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beech bark disease (an introduced disease complex involving a scale insect and a pathogenic fungus) initially was introduced into Nova Scotia in 1890 and has been spreading south and west.  This research focuses on beech bark disease influences on forest tree community composition and on carbon and nitrogen cycling in northeastern U.S. forests (Catskill Mountains of New York State and the White Mountains of New Hampshire).  Replacement of beech by sugar maple has the potential to influence forest carbon and nitrogen cycling because of substantial differences in litter quality between the two species.  Sugar maple, in particular, has unique qualities of carbon and nitrogen cycling.  Sugar maples compete better on soils of moderate to high base status, and the base status is largely determined by the underlying geology of the forest.  The principal hypotheses in this project are: 1) geologic substrate will strongly influence the response of the tree community to BBD, and 2) the changes in tree community composition will have a significant effect on the carbon and nitrogen dynamics of the forest ecosystem.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project are numerous.  The research involves collaboration between two mid-career scientists, one of whom is female, and a young scientist.  All investigators will train undergraduate and graduate students over the course of this study.  The lead investigator is well poised to take advantage of the NSF-sponsored Research Experiences for Undergraduate Programs in place at his institution. This research has clear connections to policy, conservation, and management concerning the effects of exotic species introductions.  This connection is strengthened by collaborations with the Nature Conservancy and the Northeastern Research Cooperative. The relationship between the investigators and TNC and NERC increase the probability of broad dissemination of the results to policy makers and NGO's to ultimately benefit and inform society's conservation of public resources.\r\n",
