 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nOCE-00450658\r\n\r\nThe  Irminger  Sea  a  particularly  complex  area  of  the  western  North  Atlantic  where  a  host  of  important processes  occur.  It  is  where  the  final  transport  of  the  dense  water  overflow  from  the  Nordic  Seas  is established, it is a site of intermediate mode water formation, and it is where freshwater of Arctic origin gets fluxed off the boundary into the open Atlantic. All of these things impact the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, with ramifications for the global overturning circulation. Understanding how each of these processes work, and their relationship to one another, will enable us to better understand an important piece of the North Atlantic climate puzzle. \r\n\r\nIn  2001-2004  an  NSF-sponsored  field  program  was  carried  out  in  the  Irminger  Sea  to  document  the occurrence of open-ocean convection in mid-basin, and investigate the evolution of the boundary current system from Denmark Strait to the southern tip of Greenland. The experiment included moored conductivity/temperature/depth  profilers  in  the  interior,  and  high-resolution  shipboard  hydrographic/ADCP surveys  of  the  boundary  current  system.  From  the  initial  analysis  of  these  unique  data , together  with historical measurements and the use of oceanographic and atmospheric models, a variety of new and important ideas have emerged with respect to this important area of the ocean. This includes new modes of ocean-atmosphere interaction leading to interior convection, and heretofore undetected boundary current processes leading to shelf-basin exchange. This proposal seeks funds to carry out the analysis phase of this project. A set of studies is described, each with its own hypothesis, that will significantly advance our  understanding  of  convection  and  subpolar  mode  water  formation,  as  well  as  the  mechanisms  and dynamics governing the offshore flux of mass and properties into the western North Atlantic. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: New and important means by which the atmosphere interacts with the subpolar ocean  will be elucidated in this project, as well as the dynamics of coastal and shelfbreak currents that link the  Arctic and sub-Arctic domains and help dictate the lateral transfer of properties from shelf to basin.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: This project will help us understand the important role that the Irminger Sea plays in the ventilation, stratification, and freshwater budget of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. This in turn has important ramifications for the global meridional overturning circulation, including the manner in which this system might respond to climate change.  \r\n \r\n",
