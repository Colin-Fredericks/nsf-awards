 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harmonic analysis on sets is an area that has been under intensive development\r\nsince the 1980's. The first results concerned the behavior of singular integrals \r\non sets in terms of the geometry of the sets. The model operator, and \r\nimpetus to the theory, was the Cauchy integral with the model geometric \r\nsetting being a Lipschitz curve. This theory has witnessed an explosive \r\ngrowth in terms of understanding the relation between L2 estimates in \r\nterms of the multiscale geometry of the underlying set. One of the \r\nrealizations of the 1990's was that there is an L2 theory of geometry \r\nin terms of so-called Beta numbers, and that there is a \"dictionary\" \r\nthat translates theorems on geometry of sets into theorems on wavelets, \r\nand vice versa. While the theory of Beta numbers also gave a good \r\nunderstanding of the multiscale structure of e.g. a data set, it only \r\nprovides a certain framework for the understanding of the geometry, and \r\ndoes not encompass a theory analogous to Fourier series or the study of \r\nheat flow. It is the development of such a theory, along with its \r\nrelations to the already understood multiscale aspects, that is now \r\nrequired to provide a deeper understanding of harmonic analysis on sets. \r\nFor example the problem of building local coordinates that capture most \r\nof the statistical behavior of (mostly) lower dimensional subsets has \r\nnot been well developed mathematically, though many proposed methods \r\nhave been studied. We propose to relate the top down methods (e.g. Beta \r\nNumbers and corresponding geometry) to bottom up methods of diffusion \r\ngeometries.\r\n\r\n  This new method of studying harmonic analysis on sets is based on the \r\nuse of certain eigenfunctions related to the set. These eigenfunctions, \r\ncoming from naturally defined matrices, allow the introduction of \"local \r\ncoordinates\" on the set by picking the n largest eigenvalues, and \r\nusing the corresponding n eigenfunctions as coordinates. The method \r\nproposed has a close relation to the theory of so-called prolate \r\nfunctions, as the resulting eigenfunctions have similar properties. This \r\nis in sharp contrast to the method of Coifman, Jones, and Semmes for \r\ndefining Haar type L2 frames on sets resembling Lipschitz curves. \r\nThe method of the proposal gives different functions with which one can \r\nnaturally define local coordinates and study (approximate and correctly \r\ndefined) heat flow on sets. Professors Jones and Coifman propose to \r\nstudy these methods and develop a theory that can be combined with \r\nprevious results to relate top down behavior to bottom up behavior. This \r\nis done from the point of view of computational efficiency and the \r\ndevelopment of fast algorithms. They also propose to study the various \r\ngeometrical descriptions to provide new methods of attacking older \r\nproblems in harmonic analysis. In doing so, they aim to break new ground \r\nand broaden the applicability of other earlier methods.\r\n",
