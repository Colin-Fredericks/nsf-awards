 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal concerns research by Prof. Ted Chinburg on arithmetic geometry\r\nand Galois theory.  The first goal of the proposal is to study equivariant Riemann \r\nRoch theorems.  This subject concerns Euler characteristics associated to actions \r\nof groups on objects arising from arithmetic geometry.  New methods for \r\ndetermining coherent Euler characteristics will be developed and applied to \r\nstudy modular forms and conjectures about L-series.  In particular, some \r\npredictions about the Mordell-Weil groups and Tate-Shafarevich groups of\r\nJacobians of modular curves will be considered.  The second goal of the proposal\r\nis to study equivariant Weil-etale cohomology and its generalizations, along\r\nwith invariants in derived categories arising from group actions on schemes.\r\nThe third goal of the proposal is to continue work on a fundamental finiteness\r\nproblem concerning how finite groups of automorphisms act on the homogeneous\r\ncoordinate rings of varieties in positive characteristic.  The final goal of\r\nthe proposal is to study the liftability of group actions on curves in positive\r\ncharacteristic.  In particular, a conjecture about those groups for which lifts to \r\ncharacteristic 0 always exist will be considered.\r\n\r\nThe broader context of this proposal is the study of symmetry as it pertains to \r\nalgebra and number theory.  Symmetry has been a guiding principle in algebra\r\nsince the work of Galois on the solvability of equations by radicals in the 1830's.\r\nBy studying the symmetries which solutions of algebraic problems must have \r\nit they exist, one can in many cases show that no such solutions exist, or that \r\nthe solutions are strongly constrained.  This proposal will develop this principle \r\nin some new directions.  The goal is to apply the principle to prove some \r\ncentral conjectures about L-series and the relation between being able to solve \r\nsystems of equations modulo prime numbers and being able to solve them \r\nexactly with integers or with whole numbers.  The study of solutions\r\nof equations in integers and modulo prime numbers has been of practical \r\nsignificance to cryptography and to the construction of error correcting codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
