 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER award, co-funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Condensed Matter Physics Program of the Division of Materials Research, Prof. Thomas G. Mason of the University of California, Los Angeles and his graduate and undergraduate research students produce macroscopic quantities of microscopic, colloidal particles of defined geometry, using lithographic methods.  The behavior of these assemblies of particles will be studied, using a variety of techniques, with an eye towards answering important outstanding questions about the phase behavior, non-equilibrium glassy behavior, and assembly of systems of interacting nonspherical particles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his research activities, Prof. Mason will develop a new, interdisciplinary, undergraduate laboratory course in colloidal dynamics.  This laboratory course will use a significant number of instruments donated by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company.  Prof. Mason will also participate in programs sponsored by UCLA's Center X  to do outreach to disadvantaged K-12 students in the Los Angeles area, many of these students coming from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.\r\n",
