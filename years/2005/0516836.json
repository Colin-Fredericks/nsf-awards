 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation Research project studies the role of religion in the development of democracy. While scholars, policymakers and journalists assert a strong relationship between religion and democracy, most focus on the type of religion prevalent in a country rather than on the processes through which religion affects political outcomes. This project outlines and tests a  theory that identifies organizational and societal factors; rather than religious doctrine and ideology; as the main mechanisms that connect religion to political\r\naction in support of democratic transition. It uses a mixed methodological approach,\r\nincluding quantitative analysis of national-level empirical data and qualitative analysis\r\nof interviews and observations obtained in the course of field work in the Eurasian\r\nRepublics of Armenia and Georgia.\r\nQuantitative analysis of data on the structure of religious organizations and the\r\nreligious composition of societies will be used to uncover trends regarding the impact of\r\nreligion on democratic transition and consolidation. An original data set is constructed\r\nthat contains variables from over 120 countries across Europe, Asia, Latin America, and\r\nAfrica. To supplement the data analysis, interviews of religious leaders, government\r\nofficials and lay observers from the field will attempt to uncover the motivations behind\r\npolitical action by religious groups and the aspects of religious beliefs, practices, and\r\norganization that are most relevant to politics.\r\nThis study will contribute to scholarship on democratization by focusing on components of\r\nreligion and the paths through which they influence the processes of democratic transition\r\nand consolidation. It will focus on theory-building in an area of scholarship that lacks\r\nestablished and tested theories. It will serve to unite fields of inquiry based on the\r\nexamination of ideology, mass political behavior, political values, group organization and\r\ngroup competition as they relate to regime change and stability. The study will also\r\ncontribute qualitatively to the field of religion and politics by compiling data on\r\nEastern Christianity and Islam that other scholars can use to perform comparative studies\r\nwith other religious traditions. Examination of restrictions on religious practice and\r\ncompetition among religious groups will aid in understanding the role of foreign-based\r\nreligious groups and the rise of religious extremism in developing democracies. Finally,\r\nfocusing on former communist societies will allow for study of the effect of the easing of\r\nrestrictions on religious practice and other forms of expression on the political\r\nactivities of religious groups.\r\nBroader Impact:  This project will have a broader impact outside of the field of political science, as democratization and the rise of religious movements are currently relevant issues in politics and important to the international community. The data that this study will\r\ncompile will have particular significance for policymakers, consultants and NGOs involved\r\nin promoting democratic development, human rights, and civil society in both the Eurasian\r\nregion and other areas of the world. The actions of religious groups affect the peace and\r\nstability of regimes in the region specifically, and transnational religious movements\r\ngaining popularity in these areas impact Eurasia;  neighbors and the international community.\r\n",
