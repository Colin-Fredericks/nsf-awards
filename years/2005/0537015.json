 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction of an electromagnetic field with an\r\ninhomogeneous material is a pervasive problem arising in a broad\r\narray of applications.  Often a wave interacts with a random or\r\nstructured medium, and one is interested in the effective behavior\r\nas the wave propagates through or is localized by the medium. \r\nMoreover, systems as varied as photonic crystals and band gap\r\nstructures, random resistor netorks, sea ice and other porous\r\nmedia, and electrorheological fluids exhibit critical behavior in\r\ntheir effective electromagnetic properties as some parameter is\r\nvaried.  The investigators conduct fundamental, mathematical\r\nstudies of the interaction of electromagnetic fields with such\r\ncomposites, in conjunction with state of the art numerical\r\nexperiments on model problems.  In particular, a method based on\r\nspectral theory and analytic continuation has been developed to\r\nobtain rigorous bounds on the effective complex permittivity in\r\nthe quasistatic limit.  More recently, this approach has led to\r\nthe finding that the effective transport properties of\r\ntwo-component media share the same analytic properties as the\r\norder parameters in statistical mechanics, such as the\r\nmagnetization in an Ising model.  These powerful relations have\r\nonly been exploited in the static case and raise many important\r\nquestions, yet the ideas of statistical mechanics form a natural\r\nframework for analyzing critical behavior of wave phenomena as\r\nwell.  Much of the analytic structure displayed in the static case\r\ncarries over to the Helmholtz equation in a composite.  This\r\nobservation, as well as its implications for using statistical\r\nmechanics in this context, is investigated analytically and\r\nnumerically.  These investigations may yield fundamental advances\r\nin the mathematics, computation, and physics of electromagnetic\r\nfields and their interactions with composite systems.  Graduate\r\nand undergraduate students are involved in key projects combining\r\nmathematical and computational analysis. \r\n\r\n     In a broad range of problems across many disciplines,\r\nelectromagnetic fields such as light, radar, or microwaves\r\ninteract with inhomogeneous materials such as semiconductors,\r\noil-filled rocks, bone or heart tissue, radar absorbing coatings,\r\nor shipping containers.  Examples arise in physics, materials\r\nscience, electrical and bio-engineering, chemistry, biology,\r\ngeophysics, and astrophysics, and are central to communications\r\nand medical technologies.  The investigators conduct fundamental\r\nmathematical studies of electromagnetic fields interacting with\r\ncomposite media, in conjunction with state of the art numerical\r\nexperiments on model problems.  In many important examples, the\r\neffective electromagnetic properties depend critically on some\r\nparameter in the system.  For example, whether or not a wave can\r\npropagate through some types of structured media, called photonic\r\ncrystals, depends critically on the ratio of the wavelength to the\r\nscale of the structure or other properties of the medium. \r\nRecently it was found that the mathematics underlying electrical\r\ntransport in composites is almost identical to the mathematics\r\nunderlying statistical mechanics.  Statistical mechanics deals\r\nwith phase transitions such as the freezing of water at the\r\ncritical temperature of zero degrees Centigrade, and provides a\r\nnatural framework for posing key questions about these systems. \r\nThe investigators develop and apply the ideas of statistical\r\nmechanics to electromagnetic systems using mathematical analysis\r\nand sophisticated computations.  They seek fundamental new\r\ninsights, as well as novel ways of understanding and predicting\r\nhow electromagnetic fields interact with composites.  The project\r\nactively involves graduate and undergraduate students engaged in\r\nanalytical and computational projects that are central to the\r\noverall goals.  Results, particularly concerning critical\r\nproperties, could potentially affect a broad range of application\r\nareas, including media structured on the nanometer scale. \r\n\r\n",
