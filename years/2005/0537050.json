The present proposal outlines some activities intended to continue this support to new performers and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) with the hope they will be eventually represented in the TPC portfolio.  \r\n\r\nThree activities are outlined: \r\n\r\n1) a one-day follow-up workshop for MSIs which have submitted a preliminary proposal to the TPC program and who participated in the May 6, 2005 workshop;\r\n\r\n2) the preparation of a report on teacher education programs at other government agencies, and at major philanthropic foundations which have tried to attract the participation of MSIs. \r\n\r\n3) a seminar for NSF program officers on the findings in the report (2). \r\n",
