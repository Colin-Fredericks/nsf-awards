 "awd_abstract_narration": "This integrative systems proposal focuses on the development of a novel intelligent textile technology and its application for continuous respiratory sound monitoring.  To overcome the conflict between the flexibility of the textiles and the rigidity of the sensing and computation components, a novel approach is proposed by integrating textiles with flexible transducers/circuits that are fabricated with a unique 'flexible-skin' technology. The uniqueness is that the flexible skins are fabricated based on silicon wafers.  Various MEMS devices and circuits can be fabricated on silicon wafers first using existing technologies, then be made flexible, and finally be woven into textiles.  Therefore, the existing mature technologies can be directly borrowed and significant R&D efforts can be saved by avoiding re-invention.   The proposed research will lead to intelligent textiles, which are as flexible and comfortable as the regular fabrics and able to perform a vast variety of functions, for the first time.  The proposed intelligent textiles will serve as a generic platform for various integrative systems and open the door to numerous new applications.  Simultaneously, the research will be effectively integrated with education through a new education program in intelligent textiles.  Special programs will be developed for high school students and undergraduate students.  As evidence of the broader impact of the proposed activities, efforts will be made to include the participation of underrepresented groups.  The proposed research also has the potential to establish a new technology-intensive industry that helps to create new job opportunities inside the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
