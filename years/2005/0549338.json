This project aims at conducting basic research into strain sensing mechanism and sensor microfabrication and to develop a novel low-cost wireless and powerless strain sensor. The proposed sensor will employ a planar inductor-capacitor resonant circuit with strain sensitive coating of a poled polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) thick film. The power will be sent to the sensor by electromagnetic coupling between the sensor and remote antenna, and strain information will be interpreted by reflected impendence in the remote reader.  The sensor is proposed to fabricate on Dupont Kapton flexible thick film substrates, which makes the sensor very suitable to be built-in or mounted on mechanical components and embedded smart structures to detect the change of structural health and monitor machine condition in real-time.\r\nThis project will also benefit the University of Puerto Rico (UPRM), a minority school, by reinforcing existing research and educational programs, provide research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and enhance its competitive research capability. The project will also impact the society by disseminating the new scientific knowledge, technical innovation, and educational course materials through conferences, journals, and project website. Since most students participating in the proposed project will be of Puerto Rican origin, the requested funding will lead to an increase in the number of Hispanic minority and women students pursuing advanced degrees and professional career in science and engineering.\r\nThis is a SGER project supported by the CMS divisiom.\r\n",
