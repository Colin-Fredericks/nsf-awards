The workshop will take place from June 18-July 1, 2005. The U.S. organizers are Dr. Marleigh Sheaff, Senior Scientist Emerita, University of Wisconsin, Madison and member of the International Committee on Future Accelerators (ICFA) and Dr. Muzaffer Atac of Fermilab and UCLA. The Turkish counterpart is Dr. Mahmut Hortacsu of Istanbul Technical University, Director of the Center. Dr. Atac is the Scientific and Technical Advisor for the Center. \r\n\r\nTechnical Merit: The Center for Instrumentation is a permanent facility where lecture courses and lab exercises are offered on a regular basis to graduate students mainly from Turkey but also from other nearby countries including those in the Africa, Near East and South Asia (ANESA) region.  Students from the U.S. A. and some from the ANESA countries will be supported to participate in the workshop.  The goals are to encourage increased participation by young physicists from developing countries in elementary particle physics (EPP) experiments, to foster future initiatives in detector development at their home institutions and to encourage future collaborations in experimental EPP involving the physicists from these countries.  Support for the center is provided by the ITU and by TUBITAK, the Turkish science agency.  For this Workshop, more of the laboratories will be organized locally, as The Turkish organizers are taking on more of the responsibility for running the schools/workshops at the Center.  Several other Turkish Universities are expected to participate in the center.  This school/workshop will have a very similar program to the ICFA Schools/Workshops held every two years in a different location.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project helps US graduate students to participate in training with graduate students from several foreign countries, in important aspects of physics that require international collaboration.  The host country is carrying a significant part of the cost of the workshop.  Turkey is a suitable host for this workshop because of its location between Europe and Asia, and the proximity to Africa, from which it is especially desirable to attract students. The center will provide physicists working throughout the region on physics instrumentation, many of them in isolation, with a place they can turn to on an ongoing basis for further training and online help with questions.  The first workshop was well received by the students, and has resulted in Turkish physicists taking on more and more of the responsibility of running the schools at the Center.  There are sociological benefits for US students traveling to and working with students from developing countries during this training workshop. This activity benefits not only the student participants but also the broader physics community. There are always a number of local physicists in addition to the students registered for the workshop in attendance at all the lectures and talks.  Five students from the ANESA region are currently furthering their physics education in the U. S. as the result of contacts made with the U. S. PI's at the First School at the Istanbul Center.\r\n",
