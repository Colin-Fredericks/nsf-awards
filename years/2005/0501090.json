 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on an \r\ninterplay between deterministic combinatorial structures and\r\nrandom combinatorial structures. \r\nSzemer\\'edi's regularity lemma, a\r\ncentral component in this interaction, asserts\r\nthat every graph \r\ncan be decomposed into constantly many random-like subgraphs.  From\r\nthis random-like behavior provided by Szemer\\'edi's lemma, \r\none may find and enumerate subgraphs\r\nof a fixed isomorphism type, culminating in what is known as the regularity\r\nmethod for graphs.  \r\nThis method\r\nhas proved useful in graph theory, combinatorial geometry, \r\ncombinatorial number theory and theoretical computer science.  \r\nRecent work of the PI and collaborators developed the so-called \r\nhypergraph regularity method which extends the regularity method\r\nfor graphs to uniform hypergraphs, and in turn, provides alternative proofs to some well-known\r\npartition theorems originally due to Szemer\\'edi, Furstenberg and Katznelson.  \r\nThe hypergraph regularity method should prove useful to many extremal combinatorial problems.\r\nThe PI will investigate such applications.  The PI also aims to develop structural and algorithmic\r\nextensions of the hypergraph regularity method.    \r\nSuch extensions would deepen our understanding of quasi-random hypergraph theory\r\nand further the reach of the current hypergraph regularity method\r\nas an applicable tool in combinatorial mathematics.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCombinatorics provides a principle mathematical foundation for\r\ncomputer science, and in particular, theoretical computer science.  \r\nMany difficult problems in computer science, in turn, seek efficient algorithms for solving or estimating solutions to combinatorially-based problems.  \r\nThe algorithmic version of Szemer\\'edi's regularity lemma  (developed more than 10 years after Szemer\\'edi proved the original) transforms many existential results proved by the graph \r\nregularity method into constructive solutions to corresponding algorithmic questions.\r\nIn particular, graph regularity methods have proved invaluable to the \r\narea of property testing, important in theoretical computer science. \r\nA fully algorithmic version of the hypergraph regularity method would\r\nprovide an important tool for solving algorithmic questions\r\nconcerning hypergraphs. The PI will investigate such an algorithmic extension and will\r\nconsider some of its applications to problems in computer science.  \r\n",
