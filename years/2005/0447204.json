The Laboratory carries out experimental studies that provide information on the processes and time scales of chemical differentiation within the Earth and terrestrial planets.  Studies involve both phase equilibrium and kinetic investigations.  Projects include: experimental studies of the formation and chemical evolution of the Earth's continental crust, studies of the processes and Pressure - Temperature conditions of mantle melting in the Earth, moon and Mars, studies of the processes of core formation on Earth and Mars and of chemical differentiation and core formation on meteorite parent bodies.  The upgrade will replace critical components that are necessary for the laboratory to continue productively and remain state-of-the-art.  Funds are requested to carry out upgrades in three areas.  1) Upgrade outdated and failing temperature control equipment for furnaces used for externally heated gas pressure vessel, one-atmosphere and piston cylinder experiments.  This equipment is failing and needs to be replaced with modern electronics.  2) Replace aging hydraulic equipment used to pressurize our three piston cylinder devices and upgrade the hydraulic systems.  3)  Replace antiquated analytical balances and microscopes that are used in sample preparation and examination with up-to-date instrumentation.   The acquisition of this new instrumentation will ensure continued efficient operation of the MIT experimental petrology laboratory, will allow the lab to sustain a high level of productivity and will allow us to continue to produce high-quality experimental results.\r\n\r\n",
