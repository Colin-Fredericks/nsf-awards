Cook\r\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\r\n\r\nIntegrating Programming Languages and Databases \r\n\r\nPrograms that use databases are central to our information infrastructure.  But building efficient and maintainable data-oriented systems is difficult because procedural languages and relational databases are based on different semantic foundations and optimization strategies. In addition, databases and programming are taught separately so that developers trained in one domain may not be expert in the other domain. Finally, there has not been sufficient evaluation of the performance of different integration approaches. The goal of this project is to create methods, languages and tools which enable application programmers to readily develop efficient and well-structured programs for applications that integrate database processing\r\ninto procedural programs. Programming languages will be extended to specify modular and type-safe database operations, while leveraging database query optimization and concurrency control. Near-term research will focus on defining queries as type-safe classes within the context of existing systems. Longer-term research will focus on extracting database queries from procedural programs. In additional to traditional performance benchmarking, open-source applications will be used to test the effectiveness of proposed solutions. The project will also explore ways to integrate database and programming courses. Taken together, these results can significantly improve the development of software systems that combine procedural programming with\r\nrelational databases.",
