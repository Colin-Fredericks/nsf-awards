 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: \r\n\r\nThe PI plans to study the geometry of convex bodies using\r\nmethods of harmonic and functional analysis. One direction\r\nis to express different properties of convex bodies in terms\r\nof the Fourier transform and then use methods of Fourier\r\nanalysis to solve geometric problems. This approach will lead\r\nto new results on sections and projections of convex bodies,\r\ncharacterizations of different classes of bodies, new results\r\nof the Busemann-Petty type. Another direction of research is\r\nrelated to a new connection between convex geometry and the\r\ntheory of L_p-spaces, which has recently been found by the PI\r\nand allows to get new geometric results by extending different\r\nfacts about L_p-spaces to negative values of p. Particularly\r\ninteresting is the question of whether intersection and polar\r\nprojection bodies are isomorphically equivalent. A solution to\r\nthis problem will represent a big step in understanding the\r\nduality between sections and projections, which remains one\r\nof the most intriguing mysteries of convex geometry. The PI\r\nalso plans to apply these methods to several open problems of\r\nasymptotic geometric analysis, including the central limit\r\nproblem for convex bodies.\r\n\r\nThe study of geometric properties of convex bodies based on\r\ninformation about sections and projections of these bodies has\r\nimportant applications to many areas of mathematics and science,\r\nfrom the classical theory of x-rays and geometric tomography to\r\ndifferent problems of engineering and medicine. A new approach to\r\nsections and projections of convex bodies, based on methods of\r\nFourier analysis, has recently been developed by the PI. This\r\napproach has already led to several results, including a Fourier\r\nanalytic solution of the Busemann-Petty problem on sections of\r\nconvex bodies asking whether bodies with uniformly smaller central\r\nsections necessarily have smaller volume. The proposed research\r\nwill lead to better understanding of the geometry of convex bodies\r\nand will further relate methods and results of convex geometry to\r\nharmonic analysis, functional analysis and probability. New techniques\r\nfor computing the Fourier transform, developed in this project, will\r\nhave independent value and can be applied to signal processing and\r\nstatistics.\r\n\r\n",
