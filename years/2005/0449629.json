 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Manish A. Mehta of Oberlin College and his undergraduate research students will investigate the secondary structure of small model peptides as a function of salvation with solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods coupled with x-ray diffraction measurements and ab initio quantum chemical calculations on Oberlin's new 64-node Beowulf cluster.  The stated goal of the research is to develop techniques and methods that will be useful for determining peptide structure in a variety of research areas.\r\n\r\nBesides the potential broader impact of the proposed research on other scientific areas, Prof. Mehta will provide his undergraduate research students with significant hands-on experience with Oberlin's high-field NMR spectrometer.  Besides participating in undergraduate research, Prof. Mehta is developing research collaborations with a local community college, and he is establishing  a new outreach program with local high schools, centered around the theme of NMR.\r\n",
