 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the problem of finding groups in data\r\n(\"clustering\"). Most existing clustering methods make implicit or\r\nexplicit assumptions about the shapes of the groups, for example that\r\nthe groups are roughly spherical or Gaussian, and they will fail if\r\nthese assumptions are violated. The goal of the project is to develop\r\n(i) nonparametric clustering methods capable of finding groups of\r\narbitrary shape; (ii) methods for assessing the statistical validity\r\nof the clusters; (iii) tools for visualizing the results. Clustering\r\nis cast as a statistical rather than a purely algorithmic problem. The\r\nobserved data are regarded as a sample from some underlying\r\npopulation, and the goal is to estimate a well defined target\r\ncharacteristic of the population - the cluster tree - from the\r\nsample. Adopting a statistical view of clustering has two benefits:\r\n(i) it allows comparing the performance of different methods; (ii) it\r\ngives meaning to the notion of \"cluster validity\". Without a sampling\r\nmodel and a target characteristic of the population the question\r\nwhether clusters are valid or spurious is meaningless. The proposed\r\nmethod for estimating the population cluster tree is based on\r\nanalyzing a graph over the sample but, unlike most other graph-based\r\nclustering methods, it is motivated by the underlying statistical\r\nestimation problem. Assessing cluster validity - determining the\r\nnumber of distinct groups, with \"one\" as a possible answer - has\r\nproven a vexing problem, especially in the absence of prior knowledge\r\nor assumptions about group shapes. The investigator proposes a novel\r\napproach to this problem based on resampling.\r\n\r\nFinding groups in data is a problem that occurs in many areas, from\r\ngenomics (identifying groups of genes with similar function based on\r\ngene expression levels measured by DNA microarrays) to information\r\nretrieval (spotting topics in document collections) to marketing\r\n(determining distinct groups of customers with similar\r\ncharacteristics). Clustering is an exploratory tool, and there\r\ntypically is little or no prior information about the shapes or the\r\nnumber of groups. It is therefore important to have methods that\r\nautomatically determine the number of groups and do not rely on\r\nassumptions about their shape, and visualization tools that help in\r\nunderstanding the shapes of the groups, their arrangement in feature\r\nspace, and the influence of parameters of the clustering method on the\r\nresults. \r\n",
