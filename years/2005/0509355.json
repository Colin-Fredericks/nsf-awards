 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pervasive computing systems are on the brink of revolutionizing our world - computation will be embodied in everyday objects, not  'traditional' computers, and will seamlessly enhance our lives. This  embedding, and cost considerations, suggest that pervasive computing  applications will consist of a dynamic set of system components (smart  objects) executing on a distributed fabric consisting of shared  storage, computing, and sensing resources, adapting to environmental  changes, and opportunistically cooperating and exploiting third party  services. At the same time, RFID technologies continue their fast paced evolution towards enabling cost effective embedding of tags, storage  (i.e., read/write memories) and thus context within the environment and 'space' of objects. As such, these technologies provide a concrete  setting in which to explore the system-level challenges unique to pervasive computing. This research lays the foundations for novel system-level technologies and design methodologies for next generation pervasive computing applications. It includes three key thrusts. First,  it addresses the organization and management of novel RFID-based  distributed memory subsystems. The key idea is that these might be used  as a public asset, shared by multiple applications, leveraging a  collective of anonymous mobile smart objects to gather and efficiently  disseminate in situcontextual information. The second thrust focuses on maintaining data integrity and consistency across such RFID-based  distributed memory subsystems. The last thrust investigates how to  \r\ngenerate and store context for novel pervasive computing applications,  involving a formal study of the characteristics and scaling properties of different policies to generate and capture distributed space-time  \r\ncontextual data.\r\n",
