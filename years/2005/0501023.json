 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe study of the absolute Galois group of a number field F or, from a \r\nTannakian point of view, of its abelian category of continuous finite \r\ndimensional representations (let us say over a p-adic field) has long been \r\nrecognized as one of important challenge in  pure mathematics. Among \r\nthose representations, the ones that are geometric, in the sense of Fontaine \r\nand Mazur, are especially of arithmetic significance, and their category\r\nshould be equivalent to the (still conjectural) category of mixed motives \r\nover F. It is important to understand the first Ext groups in that category\r\n(higher Ext groups should be zero) and Bloch and Kato have made precise \r\nconjectures relating the dimension of those groups to the order of \r\nL-functions at integers values of the variable. The project aims to construct \r\nas much extensions as possible in those Ext groups (hopefully as much as \r\npredicted by the conjecture, in the case corresponding to the center of the \r\nfunctional equation of the L-function) using p-adic deformations of \r\nnon-tempered automorphic forms. An important step should be the study of \r\nthe local geometry of the \"moduli space of p-adic automorphic forms\" called \r\nEigenvarieties around the non-tempered automorphic forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany old problems in arithmetic, some of them going back as far as \r\nDiophantes, as well as some new ones, fit well in the framework of Galois \r\ntheory: they often can be translated into questions about existence, or \r\nnon-existence, of certain Galois representations (that is representations of the \r\nabsolute Galois group G of the field Q of rational numbers, or of some open \r\nsubgroups of G) with prescribed properties. And then, sometimes, they can \r\nbe proven, as was Fermat's Last Theorem by Wiles. The study of Galois \r\nrepresentations splits up into two parts : finding irreducible Galois \r\nrepresentations, and then determining extensions between them. Even if the \r\nfirst problem is far from being solved, precise conjectures about the second \r\none were made by Bloch and Kato. The projects aims to give partial answers \r\nto those conjectures, by constructing some interesting extensions. The method \r\nuses the theory of automorphic forms, which was once quite a different topic, \r\nbut which is now  strongly tied to the theory of Galois representations by the\r\nLangland's program. The idea is that one can obtain interesting extensions of \r\nGalois representations by looking at (p-adic) deformations of some very \r\nspecial automorphic forms, the so-called non tempered forms. The more \r\ndeformations there are, the more extensions one should be able to construct. \r\nThose deformations are encoded in the geometry of a (p-adic) variety, known \r\nas the Eigenvariety, and developing tools to study that geometry is an important \r\npart in the project. \r\n",
