 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this proposal is to discover whether a family of brain peptides found in cockroaches, A-type allatostatins (ASTs), occurs in termites and to determine what role these peptides might have in modulating the production of the juvenile hormone (JH) that is thought to have a role in termite caste determination and reproduction.  The presence of AST-like peptide will be determined with antibody against a cockroach AST and these A-type ASTs will be tested for ability to inhibit JH production by termite glands.  Extract of termite brains will be tested on termite glands, and the termite ASTs will be purified and identified by biochemical (chromatography and mass spectroscopy) methods. Because termites are close relatives of cockroaches it is expected that these peptides will be effective regulators of JH production in termites.  This discovery has potential for application to biological control of this economically important group of insects. The study will involve the training of undergraduate research students, and the results will be disseminated in journal publications, talks at national and international meetings and will be incorporated into courses taught at the University of Iowa.  \r\n",
