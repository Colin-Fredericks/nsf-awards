 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0507140\r\nButa\r\n\r\nGalaxies classified as \"S0\" are one of the great unsolved problems in astronomy, even after decades of detailed research.  This is probably because the path of galaxy evolution to an S0 comes from several directions, and no single route can account for all of the special properties of S0s. Bars are an especially promising tool for studying S0s, because bars are a major disk feature that spiral galaxies and S0s have in common.  This project will derive the distribution of bar strengths in S0 galaxies, using the new gravitational torque indicator, developed with prior NSF funding, as a quantitative measure of bar strength.  By carrying out a new near-infrared imaging survey of galaxies, this work will investigate the origin of bars in S0s, determine any evolutionary relation between spirals and S0s, and compare the actual structure of bars in S0s with those in spirals.  Sophisticated N-body simulations will be used to model the distribution of bar strengths once the survey has been completed.\r\n\r\nThe project will continue a successful international cooperation with researchers in South Africa, the UK, Finland and France.  The work will also build on a good track record of providing stimulating and successful student experiences.  The survey database will be made publicly available.\r\n",
