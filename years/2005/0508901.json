The technical \r\ndifficulty of using sound or electromagnetic waves in sensing micro- or \r\nnano-structured media is the complexity and fine scale of \r\nthe microgeometry. The length of the \r\napplied sound waves is much larger than the variations of the \r\nmicrostructure, so that only an effective or homogenized response of the  \r\nstructure is present in measured data. The proposed \"inverse \r\nhomogenization\" method derives microstructural parameters from effective \r\nmeasurements. The method is based on the Stieltjes analytic representation \r\nof the effective properties of a randomly microstructured medium, and a \r\npossibility to reconstruct the spectral function in this representation \r\nfrom the effective response of the homogenized material. The approach ties \r\ntogether properties of the medium\r\non different scales: Complex permittivity on the coarse scale provides data \r\nfor microscale inversion. Computationally, the problem is ill-posed and \r\nrequires regularization to develop stable numerical algorithms. The recovered \r\nmicrostructural information can be used for characterizing other \r\ntransport and physical properties of the medium, such as permeability, \r\ndiffusion, thermal and hydraulic conductivity, etc.\r\n\r\nThe  project develops a novel approach to reconstruction of micro- and \r\nnano-structural information from measurements of effective properties of \r\ncomposite materials. It brings together results recently obtained in two \r\ndifferent fields: homogenization, and inverse and imaging theory, which \r\nmakes possible to formulate new applications for both research areas. The \r\nproblem is to find a composite material's structure from its known \r\nresponse to the applied acoustic or electromagnetic field. When the \r\nwavelength of the applied field is much larger than the microstructural \r\nscale, then fine scale features of the structure cannot be resolved, and \r\nthe microgeometry is  homogenized. The project develops an \"inverse \r\nhomogenization\" method that utilizes acoustic or electromagnetic \r\nmeasurements over a range of frequency to recover information about \r\nthe microstructural parameters of the medium.\r\n\r\nThe results of the proposed work are useful in designing artificial micro- \r\nand nano-structured composites. They also have applications to osteoporosis \r\nthrough ultrasound evaluation of bone structure and density and to \r\nnoninvasive monitoring of blood clots and evaluation of their age and \r\nstructure. \r\n",
