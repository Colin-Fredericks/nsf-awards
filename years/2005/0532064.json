 "awd_abstract_narration": "Claremont Graduate University (CGU) and Claremont colleges (Pomona College, Harvey Mudd, Claremont McKenna, Scripps, and Pitzer) are providing scholarships to recruit and credential undergraduate science and mathematics majors through the Teacher Education Internship Program (TEIP), which specializes in preparing teachers to teach in secondary schools in poor urban districts. Specific project goals and objectives include: sustaining a central Claremont Colleges Mathematics and Science Collaborative that promotes teaching as an exciting career for exceptional STEM graduates; developing strategies, including undergraduate courses, to attract an increased number of qualified and diverse students from the Claremont colleges STEM disciplines to teaching careers; developing opportunities for public school collaborative activities with poor urban school districts; integrating effective pedagogical methods and strategies for highly skilled interns to engage a diverse student body; and with small student-faculty rations, continued support to graduates beyond their credentials, and professional opportunities for graduates, providing optimum support for beginning mathematics and science teachers through a proven, highly effective internship model.  The project is leading to an annual production of ten new science and mathematics teachers.",
