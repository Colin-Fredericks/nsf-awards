 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies two topics concerning the analysis of mixture distributions which are relevant for the analysis of flow cytometry data. The investigator develops a rigorous \r\ntheoretical basis for the inference on the mixture complexity, i.e. the number of subpopulations in the mixture. This understanding allows to develop new methodology that provides finite-sample confidence statements, is more powerful than existing techniques, yet at the same time is more generally applicable.  The second topic addresses the quantitative characterization of \r\ndifferences in two multivariate distributions, based on samples from these distributions. The research develops methodology to detect regions where the two distributions differ, provides scientifically meaningful and interpretable descriptions of these regions, and provides confidence statements for the corresponding differences. The underlying methodology is also applicable to other problems, such as the detection of spatial clusters of disease cases.\r\n\r\nFlow cytometry instruments are among the most widely used biomedical\r\ninstruments in the world, but the lack of appropriate statistical methodology\r\nfor analyzing the data generated by this instrument is a roadblock\r\nto harnessing its full potential. The investigator studies\r\ntwo topics that arise in the analysis of flow cytometry data,\r\nbut which are also important for other applications.\r\nThose data are comprised of various subpopulations, and the investigator\r\ndevelops rigorous methodolgy to determine how many such subpopulations\r\ncan be distinguished, and how to characterize differences in two\r\nsamples that may have different numbers of subpopulations. These\r\nare important tasks for the anlysis of flow cytometry data which to date\r\nhave not been satisfactorily resolved. Advances in the statistical methodology\r\nmethodology for the above topics have the potential of a significant\r\nimpact in biomedical research and in the clinical setting, and have\r\nfurthermore important applications in the detection of spatial clusters\r\nin bio-surveillance, ecology, astronomy, and medical imaging.\r\n",
