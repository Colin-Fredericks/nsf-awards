In the presentations being organized by Dr. Matsui's group, the topics are centered around bionanotechnology. Specifically, the group plans to explore biomaterials applications as they relate to computers, sensors and data storage, as well as relevant research applications such as tissue engineering and drug delivery.\r\n\r\nThe symposium as a whole, will have  3 sessions focused on nanomaterials in biology, the interface between biology and nanoscale systems, and biological polymers. This\r\nsymposium will focus on how to utilize biological macromolecules as building blocks to\r\nsynthesize inorganic nanomaterials, the interface between the biological world and\r\nnanoscale systems, and use of biological macromolecules as building blocks for\r\npolymers.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe goal of the symposium is to provide a forum for direct interaction between polymer, materials, and biological researchers in order to explore new interdisciplinary research activities in nanoscience.\r\n\r\nThe invited speakers include a diverse array of intellectual backgrounds, to include\r\nindustrial, academic and  government laboratories, male and female researchers, and\r\nestablished as well as young investigators.\r\n\r\n",
