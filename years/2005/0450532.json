 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR) Phase II project aims to  commercialize lightweight, flexible, affordable solar cells and modules that efficiently generate electricity from sunlight or indoor room light. These cells are based on dye-sensitized titania which is coated on a flexible substrate at high speed in a continuous coating, laminating process. The overall objective of Phase II is to raise the cell efficiency from its current 7% to 10% or higher, thereby raising the module efficiency from 5% to over 8%.  To accomplish this, the ability of the sensitizing dyes to harvest a much larger number of available photons and convert them into electrons must be increased.  In Phase I of this program, a new class of sensitizing dyes that cover a larger portion of the solar spectrum, have larger absorptivity than the currently used ruthenium-based dyes was discovered. In addition, materials that have similar molecular \r\nstructures to those of the new sensitizing dyes,  and act as  co-sensitizers by boosting  electron injection from the dye to the titania, are co-adsorbed with the dyes on the surface of the titania.  It is anticipated that the combination of these materials  will bring the cell and modules performance to the desired level.     \r\n\r\nCommercially, the  project  will  result  in  an  inexpensive,  efficient,  flexible  photovoltaic (PV) technology  that  can be  integrated into  consumer products.  Therefore a renewable source of energy could be used to power products, minimizing the battery capacity and disposal requirements, and ultimately  delivering  power  to  building  structures,  avoiding  emissions associated with fossil fuels.    Security is a broad benefit on two levels.  First, grid instability demonstrated by widespread blackouts in 2003 emphasizes the need for distributed power in our national grid.  Secondly, growing homeland security concerns underscore the importance of wireless networks of sensors, cameras, and other monitoring systems for building and border security.  Photovoltaics are uniquely suited to serve these distributed applications. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
