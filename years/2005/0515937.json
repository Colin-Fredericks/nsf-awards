 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists have become increasingly aware of reports from around the globe indicating declines in pollinators. Pollinators are critical for plant reproduction, and humans depend on pollinator activity for the production useful plants including those used for food, fiber and medicine. Ecologists agree that more research and monitoring are necessary to understand pollinator declines and avert a pollination crisis. This project will provide information on the status of pollinators, and the environmental factors essential for maintaining pollinator richness in grassland and urban habitats.\r\n     One of the likely causes of pollinator declines is the changing landscape caused by urbanization. Over 50% of the world's population lives in urban areas that continue to grow. Development of cities and suburbs changes vegetation patterns such that previously intact landscapes become mosaics of pavement, buildings, parks, gardens and small remnants of native habitat. For pollinators, urbanization means a change in the availability of nesting sites, and quality and accessibility of food plants, resources that must generally be located within close proximity. \r\n     Changes in community composition related to urbanization are known for many species. A set of grassland Biodiversity Plots has been established on public lands in Colorado. The effects of urbanization on other types of organisms has been studied in these plots. This study uses these Biodiversity  Plots plus remnant grassland fragments to assess how pollinators respond to different levels of urbanization, habitat fragmentation, vegetation changes, and other land uses. Bee species present today, will be compared with records of species present roughly 100 years ago.\r\n",
