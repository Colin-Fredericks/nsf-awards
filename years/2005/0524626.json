 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-0524626\r\nWang, Wanjun\r\n\r\nThis Integrative Systems proposal focuses on design, analysis, microfabrication, and test of a micro flow cytometer that can be used for highly efficient cellular/modular analyses. The proposed cytometer consists of a truly 3-D hydrofocusing unit and an integrated free-space micro optical measurement unit. \r\nThe intellectual merits of the project include: \r\n(1)\tA novel new type of micro flow cytometer with a truly three-dimensional hydrofocusing unit will be developed for a wide range of biological or medical analyses and tests. It may also be integrated with some other bio-MEMS modular devices under development in our group for rapid and high efficiency cellular/molecular analysis.  \r\n(2)\tThe proposed free-space optical measurement unit for cytometer with integrated ball lens and other microfabricated components represents a novel approach for such measurement problems. No mechanical actuation or assembly is needed. The technology developed may also be used in other measurement applications for improved signal to noise ratio and better sensitivity.\r\n(3)\tThe multiple layer lithography process and the integration of the system are also challenging. The knowledge obtained may also contribute to the general efforts of developing other micro systems in general.\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe micro flow cytometer to be developed can be used to replace the conventional cytometers in many biological and medical applications. It may also be integrated other bio-MEMS modules for on-chip, highly efficient cellular/molecular analysis systems. \r\nThe educational component will be integrated with the coordinated educational outreach program in the Center for Bio-Modular Microsystems Center (CBM2) of LSU (Supported by NSF-EPSCoR and BoR of Louisiana). An education micro-optic module will be built for use in G9-12 science education.  The module will include the following components: 1) Educational objectives consistent with state and national GLE's  (grade level expectations); 2) Lesson plans: methods, equipment and materials required for the activity; 3) Detailed instructions on the activity protocols; 4) Assessment mechanisms to qualify how well the objectives are met.\r\n\r\n",
