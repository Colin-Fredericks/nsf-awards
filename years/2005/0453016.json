 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a research experience for undergraduates (REU) site that provides 10 advanced undergraduate psychology majors from underrepresented groups a full year of research training into issues of psychology and the law.  The University of Nebraska-Lincoln hosts the students for their junior year.  Students work 10-12 hours per week in a research team, participate in an intensive graduate school preparation course, and take a full course load at UNL.  Intellectual Merits- REU participants join one of four ongoing research teams.  Topics include: legal decision-making; jurors, witnesses and litigants in the real world; cultural and social group influence on attitudes and beliefs about the justice system; and legal competencies.  In conjunction with faculty mentors, students develop their own project designs, data collection, and analyses.  The ultimate goal is to have students produce publishable papers and/or present their research at professional conferences.  Broader Impacts- The project targets students from underrepresented groups in the Midwest.  It prepares them for advanced graduate training in psychology through an intensive research experience in a team-based environment and a special graduate school preparation course.  The focus is on exposing students early on to a number of professional development activities all aimed at preparing them for research careers in academic and applied settings.  The project also includes a comprehensive evaluation plan.",
