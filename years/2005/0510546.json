Goldfarb\r\nMechanical Engineering Department\r\nVanderbilt University\r\nNashville, TN 37235\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n  This proposal presents new approaches to the design and control of above-knee prostheses.  The proposed work will require, and thus will result in, new theoretical frameworks for both the interactive control and the power regeneration of such systems.  Major intellectual contributions will include the design of regenerative actuation systems; optimal control methodologies for energy recovery; the development of an interactive control framework of prosthetic lower limb joints; and the development of adaptive and robust controllers for prosthetic joint impedance modulation during locomotion. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will provide the above-knee amputee population with significantly greater functional capabilities.  Specifically, the proposed work will enable more natural, stable, and adaptable prostheses via the interactive control approach, and will enable the ability to climb stairs and ramps via the regenerative actuation structure.  Additional significant benefits of this work include fostering a broader awareness and increased sensitivity of young engineers and educational institutions to disability issues.   The proposed work includes several outreach activities that will provide educational opportunities and encouragement to primary and secondary students, and to underrepresented segments of the population.\r\n",
