 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation award to Case Western Reserve University provides funds to acquire a versatile high-resolution imaging, manipulation and characterization tool to fully develop a Scanning Electron Microscope Integrated Nanolaboratory capable of coupled mechanical and thermal or electrical measurements of individual nanostructures. The proposed research instrumentation comprises a high resolution Field Emission Gun SEM with in-situ nanomanipulators and a micro-delivery gas injection system that will facilitate transportation, positioning and assembly of nanoscale structures. Moreover, the proposed SEM will be integrated with specialized loading/testing apparatus that will allow nanomechanical straining while simultaneously measuring thermal or electrical properties. To grip the nanoscale specimens an electron beam induced deposition (EBID) process will be used in conjunction with the requested micro gas-injection system.\r\n\r\nThe proposed ESEM Integrated Nanolaboratory consists of a unique suite of tools with unmatched capabilities and represents a fundamental upgrade to the current manipulation and diagnostic resources and will support a myriad of research and development activities at CWRU. In line with the goals of the MRI program, the instrumentation will (1) result in the increased use of modern research instrumentation focused on nanoscale characterization by scientists, engineers and students at CWRU and our partner institutions, (2) enable integration of nanoscience research into student projects and theses, laboratory courses and an \"Encyclopedia of Nanotechnology;\" and (3) lead to partnerships between researchers and private sector instrument developers with regard to future nanoscale characterization device development.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed activity: The acquisition of the ESEM Integrated Nanolaboratory will bring the scientific community a capability that does not currently exist: the ability to accurately position and grip samples and conduct measurements of the coupled mechanical and thermal or electrical properties of nanostructures and certain biological materials while simultaneously performing high resolution imaging. Improved characterization methods for these materials is expected to lead to a better fundamental understanding of the underlying physics involved and is critical to further developments in the field of nanomaterials and nanotechnology. Enabling the PIs and their collaborators to perform this unique research, will undeniably put CWRU and its partner institutions in a position to continue well-established programs on cutting-edge research.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of proposed activity: The acquisition of the proposed instrumentation is expected to lead to significant advances and expand the current scope of research and training. In particular, the SEM Integrated Nanolaboratory stands to support research teams whose efforts intersect more than one traditional discipline. Bringing together multi-disciplinary teams at CWRU from the science, engineering and medical disciplines will significantly accelerate research progress, foster integration of research and training, and hasten the transition of research findings to practical applications. Moreover, availability of the unique integrated nanolaboratory will open new lines of communication with researchers at our industrial partners, our partner academic institutions within the state of Ohio and several National Laboratories. This will encourage exchange of senior personnel, and post-doctoral and graduate students as well as researchers for departmental and university seminar series, leading to a further dissemination of research ideas and results. The proposed SEM Integrated Nanolaboratory will also provide an opportunity for laboratory experience and training for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students. Additionally, the proposed instrumentation will be integrated into the laboratory courses for imaging experiments and for nanoscale mechanical or transport measurement projects. Through lectures complemented by hands-on experience, the students will learn about the workings of the proposed SEM Integrated Nanolaboratory and will develop an understanding of the unique characteristics of nanoscale structures. Moreover, the equipment will be made available to students and researchers at the Department of Arts and Sciences at Ursuline College, Pepper Pike, OH, which is an all women's college, and to summer interns and exchange students from the Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics at Fisk University, Nashville, TN, a predominantly African American university.\r\n",
