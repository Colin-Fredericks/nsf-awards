 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and Chemistry, supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities for the summers of 2005-2007.  The program director is David Thomas. Twelve students per summer will be involved in this project at the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. The focus of the project is the application of computational approaches to the mathematical and physical sciences. The program's purpose is to stimulate the interest of participants in pursuing careers in research that involve the application of computer science and advanced computation to cutting-edge problems in physical sciences and mathematics. The selected interns will be supervised and advised by active faculty researchers at the Supercomputing Institute and work closely with the faculty members and their research groups. They will prepare a written report on their work and make a presentation about their research at the end of the program. Students will be recruited nationally, including those from institutions with high enrollment of women and minority students. Students with interests in computer science, scientific computation, visualization, physical or biological science, or engineering are the focus of this program.",
