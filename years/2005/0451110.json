 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding to renew the support for the Central Coordinating Office (CCO) for the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE) currently based at the Consortium of Oceanographic Research and Education (CORE). Central Coordinating Office activities supported by this award will include planning and coordinating annual PI conferences, National Advisory Board meeting and specialty workshops focused on the interests and needs of the network. In addition, the CCO will expand its role dramatically to include marketing and outreach activities designed to raise the national profile of both COSEE and ocean sciences education. \r\n\r\nOther partners in this effort are the National Sea Grant Program (NSGO) office, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) and the Office of Program Evaluation (OPE) at the University of South Carolina. VIMS will expedite internal network communications and design a comprehensive, nationally recognized web portal integrated with NSF's Digital Library for Earth Systems Education (DLESE) and the Bridge website for educators. Evaluation of the effectiveness of network activities will be handled by the OPE. As the lead institution, CORE will manage the office and its activity and oversee website and evaluation activities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe very nature of the COSEE program is about broader impacts. The potential impact of the CCO could be unprecedented if successful as it will start putting the ocean on the learning map of Americans and their government. CCO and COSEE has enormous potential to enhance the infrastructure for both research and education. As researchers start to realize the enormous pool of expertise and support that COSEE provides, we will start to see more and more collaborations. This will enhance the educational content and experience for teachers and students.\r\n",
