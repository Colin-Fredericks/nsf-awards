 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this project is to create a micro-manufacturing workcell that integrates atomic force microscopy and robotic micro-manipulation with recently invented miniature plasma source technology to perform localized materials treatment, etching and deposition on the micrometer scale. The micro-scale output beams of ions, free radicals and ultraviolet light from the miniature plasma sources will be characterized and the interaction of these beams with surfaces for doing materials processing will be studied. Using this integrated workcell the research will explore methods to model and plan various micro-manufacturing processes, and then sense and provide real-time feedback during and between each micro-manufacturing step. The approach is to design and build small plasma sources that have a specially constructed plate or grid on the end of the plasma source for the extraction of ions, neutral radicals or ultraviolet light. The end plate or grid design needs to be robust and strong so thin diamond films with micrometer-sized apertures will be investigated to produce processing areas that can be as small as one square micrometer. The substrate to be processed will be mounted on a robotic positioning stage that has submicrometer precision. An atomic force microscope unit will be incorporated in the micro-manufacturing workcell so that the local area materials processing can be iteratively examined during the materials processing steps. Models of the micro-manufacturing process will be investigated for use in planning the tool path for the steps in the manufacturing process. Techniques for sensing and imaging the process during and between processing steps will be investigated using a computer-integrated approach.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefit of this research will be the establishment of engineering principles for the design and utilization of processes and associated equipment for adding, removing, and assembling materials and parts in the microenvironment, thereby realizing reliable and efficient manufacturing methods for micro devices and systems. The type of processing that can be done with the micro-scale plasma source includes surface activation, etching, ion milling/sputtering, plasma-assisted deposition and light activation of surfaces and processes. Such micro-manufacturing techniques will benefit the fabrication and assembly of microsystems where very different materials and fabrication processes are involved for systems that integrate electronic, fluidic, chemical/biological sensing and mechanical subsystems. In addition, the research will establish tools for the automation of processes in micro-manufacturing workcells.",
