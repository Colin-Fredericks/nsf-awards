 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this Workshop is to highlight current and future multidisciplinary\r\nresearch on structural mechanics of deformation and fracture processes in nanostructured\r\nmaterials, multi-scale mechanics of fracture in solids, and structural mechanics of materials\r\nfor hydrogen economy. Particular emphasis will be placed on developing close interactions\r\namong Russian and US scientists and engineers, and fostering future transdisciplinary and\r\nmulti-institutional collaboration in these new and rapidly growing areas. Such interactions\r\nand collaborations are expected to have broad and long-lasting impact on the research field\r\nand on the Russian-US cooperation.\r\nThis workshop aims to assess the current status and identify future priority directions\r\nof collaborative research in mechanics of advanced materials with unique mechanical\r\nproperties for structural applications and hydrogen economy, thus enhancing the science and\r\ndevelopment of these novel materials. It is also the intention of the organizing committee to\r\npromote the diversity among the participants, in terms of recruiting some minority/women\r\nattendees and a mix of junior and senior scientists.\r\nThis is a unique forum for promoting Russian-US collaborations and there has been\r\nno such meeting in the past in this subject area.\r\nThe Workshop will be held at Palace of Scientists, St. Petersburg, Russia, May 17-19,\r\n2006.\r\nThe results of the meeting will be disseminated through the publication of the MAM\r\n2006 Proceedings volume as a topical issue of Reviews on Advanced Materials Science.",
