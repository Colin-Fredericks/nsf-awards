 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop nanodevices based on liposomes exhibiting a programmed triggerable function. The approach to these systems is based upon the effect produced by lipophilic ionophores on content-specific liposomes. Once applied to liposomes, these ionophores will alter the balance of electrolytes across the bilayer membranes, causing a subsequent change of the membrane properties and ultimately triggering the nanodevice into its active state.  Three independent models will be considered: a content-specific fusogenic model, a flippase model that allows the unidirectional translocation of cationic lipids and a stepwise content-release model.\r\n The broader impacts of these novel liposome-based devices lie in the improvement of currently existing gene and drug therapies. Specifically, the flippase model has promise for the efficient non-viral gene delivery; the fusogenic model provides a new approach to biocompatible reactors; the stepwise content-release model can serve as a drug delivery system and as means of accurate time-resolved dosing of substrates into the reaction medium. This research will also serve as an efficient educational tool through the engagement of undergraduate and graduate students in an interdisciplinary project. The emphasis will be placed on the development of kinetic assays de novo, materials characterization and utilization of various spectroscopic techniques. Underrepresented minority and female undergraduate students will be actively involved in the research. An additional educational component consists of the development of a new course in Applied Supramolecular chemistry which will be offered to upper level undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n",
