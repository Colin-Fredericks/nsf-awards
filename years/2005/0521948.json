 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project  will involve quantum confining a single atom in 2 to 5 nm size nanocrystal of ternary semiconductor, from which new and efficient nanophosphors will be developed. The band-gap engineering of nanophosphors allows improvement in the luminescence characteristics such as absorption and emission spectra, half-width, efficiency, life-time, etc. Indeed the role of conventional activators (rare-earths and transition metal impurities) in nanophosphors can be re-evaluated for different applications. Specifically, ternary wide band gap semiconductors such as ZnCdS with dopants like Ag, Cu, Mn offer very efficient broad-band visible spectra that is close to white light. The possibility of band-gap engineering in nanocrystals of ternary semiconductors, similar to that catapulted the optoelectronic devices from III-V semiconductors, opens the door to design of new nanophosphors that match well with the excitation spectra of LED's and compact fluorescent lamps. This development would lead to a new class of white light sources in this Phase II project.  By developing different nanophosphors that can be excited by blue/UV LEDs, it successfully demonstrates that nanophosphors can significantly enhance the performance of not only white LEDs but also can improve the performance of compact fluorescent and arc lamps. \r\n\r\nCommercially this technological breakthrough of engineering of nanophosphors when used with current efficient lamps, is expected to enhance the efficiency of LED's by 40% and lamps by 15%, respectively. These improvements in overall power efficiency of these lamps, will significantly lower the cost of energy used and it is projected will help to save energy costs equivalent to $25 billion by 2025.\r\n\r\n",
