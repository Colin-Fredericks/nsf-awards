 "awd_abstract_narration": "This department level reform project in a department of Microelectronic Engineering proposes to institute major reform to: (1) offer a semiconductor processing minor for non-microelectronic science and engineering programs promoting access to state-of-the art semiconductor fabrication facilities to students from other programs; (2) develop a concentration program in nanotechnology and MEMS; (3) craft a five course elective sequence within the existing microelectronic curriculum by eliminating legacy material and course consolidation (4) build outreach programs for targeting larger and diverse participation, particularly from women and underrepresented minority students, in preparing the workforce for the nation's future high tech industry; and (5) enhance student learning through co-op employment and multidisciplinary projects that include service learning component.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The incredible shrinking transistor has revolutionized the science and technology of miniaturization and enabled applications not only in electronics but also in mechanics, photonics, biology, magnetics and chemistry. This project will provide students with the foundation and vision needed to apply their knowledge to new frontiers. The hands-on nature of the RIT program, with its strong laboratory component and integrated industrial cooperative experience, stands out among U.S. universities. RIT's department of Microelectronic Engineering has a proven track record and has sustained a unique program over nearly a quarter-century, all the while keeping current with the latest technological advancements. The proposing team consists of multidisciplinary academic faculty with strong prior experience in curriculum development and integrating research with education. The coop program coordinators with this program have over twenty years of progressive experience in industrial co-op placement, career counseling and advisement, training delivery, and personnel recruitment.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact. Conventional microelectronics is extending into new frontiers that include MEMS, nanotechnology and flexible electronics. The development of the necessary workforce for the future will require students to access various courses outside their discipline. The proposed implementation grant will result in non-microelectronic students taking five courses outside their discipline, thereby expanding their career opportunities and providing industry with engineers having current and relevant skills. The implementation will also produce well-qualified students for graduate research in new frontiers that will be critical to maintaining our nation's innovation edge. The courses in the proposed semiconductor processing minor have a significant laboratory component that will allow greater student access to labs in the state-of-the-art fabrication facility that the department has developed over the last 23 years. The initiatives proposed in this proposal will target larger participation of women and minorities.\r\n",
