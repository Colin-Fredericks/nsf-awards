 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nHere  we propose to use  our solid-state oxidative crosslinking process to rapidly micro  pattern \r\ninherently conductive polymer lines and to prepare inherently conductive polymer nanostructures.  \r\nSince our solid-state oxidative process involves the use of a processible precursor polymer, we \r\ncan fabricate polymeric  structures from the macro to  the nanoscale.  Furthermore, the \r\npolymerization process  we utilize, namely ring-opening methathesis polymerization (ROMP)  is \r\nliving with the capability of the facile preparation of random copolymers.  Therefore, we can vary \r\nthe amount of conductive  polymer ultimately ending  up  in our solid-state crosslinked inherently \r\nconductive polymers allowing for us to attain a given optical density and conductivity.  We have \r\nalready found that electrochromic devices prepared from our nanostructured polymers have \r\ntremendous potential for achieving submillisecond response speeds.  With the ability to prepare \r\nmacro, micro, and nano lines of inherently conductive polymer, we will be able to study solid-state \r\noxidative crosslinking kinetics (crosslinking propagation rates),  and ion  diffusion upon redox \r\nswitching of the polymers across all size scales.  Through ion diffusion studies with our Spanish \r\ncollaborator, Professor Toribio Otero,  Director  of the Center for Electrochemistry  and Smart \r\nMaterials (CEMI) at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, we  will understand the switching \r\ncapabilities of our crosslinked inherently conductive polymers and learn strategies to optimize the \r\nswitching speeds and to test their potential in application areas that Otero is an expert in, namely \r\nmembranes and artificial muscles (actuators).   \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nDue to the high processibility of our precursor polymers, we have the ability to fabricate inherently \r\nconductive polymers via our novel  process of solid-state oxidative crosslinking  into  a  variety  of \r\nmacro, micro, and nanostructures potentially by numerous techniques. This work could ultimately \r\nlead to a procedure by which to mass produce flexible displays, wearable displays, nanodevices, \r\npolarizing  electrochromic lenses and  windows, fast switching electrochromics for laser  eye \r\nprotection, and potentially  ion selective membranes and actuators.  With the ability  to  precisely \r\nload a  given amount of conductive polymer  within an insulating polymer through our solid-state \r\ncrosslinking process,  we  could  potentially have  a  way to put the material  at the percolation \r\nthreshold in order to generate micron and nanosized on/off switches.  Collaborative efforts with a \r\nworld expert, namely Professor  Toribio Otero, on ion diffusion studies of these conductive \r\npolymers could allow for  us to design and further  optimize the next generation of inherently \r\nconductive polymer devices with extraordinarily rapid response times for charge/discharge cycles.  \r\nIn addition to laser protection electrochromic goggles and polarizing filters, this work could lead to \r\na new generation of polymeric capacitors and batteries. \r\n \r\nCollaboration: \r\nInterchange of students with our  Spanish collaborators is proposed.  Two students from the \r\nSotzing group  will spend  3  months/yr in Spain  learning about the study of ion diffusion and \r\nsimulations while also involved in their research. Two students from Spain will spend 3 months/yr \r\nin the U.S. studying nano and micro fabrication of inherently conductive polymers and the study \r\nof crosslinking kinetics while also carrying out their expertise of research.  Within the collaboration, \r\nall of the researchers  involved in the collaboration  will be  involved in a two  week intensive \r\ncollaborative effort in Spain for the first year and a two week concerted effort in the U.S.A. for the \r\nsecond year.  During these two weeks, we will hold biweekly presentations and intensive training \r\non instrumentation in the respective laboratories, and short courses in both Professor.s areas of \r\nexpertise. \r\n \r\nDiversity: \r\nThis collaboration between the U.S. and Spain will provide an excellent opportunity for Mexican-\r\nAmerican and Puerto Rican-American underrepresented minorities, considering these type \r\nstudents would be fluent in both languages of this collaboration.",
