 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's distributed systems are fragile and easily broken. As a result, \r\ntotal cost of ownership is no longer dominated by capital costs. \r\nCommodity OS's, middleware, and other software building blocks are being \r\nused even to create critical applications such as finance and banking, \r\nyet the complexity of the resulting systems is often beyond our \r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nWe propose to build on our prior successful argument that system \r\nfailures are not problems that will be decisively solved, but ongoing \r\nfacts of life to be dealt with. Hence, our approach centers on \r\nsystematic fast automatic detection and recovery from many kinds of \r\nfailures so fast that failure and recovery will become a form of \r\nadaptation, and we will be able to leverage the well-tested ideas of \r\ncontrol theory, resulting in a new basis for the design of dependable \r\ndistributed computing systems. Hence we call our approach RADS: Reliable \r\nAdaptive Distributed Systems. We will develop RADS design guidelines and \r\nprototypes for creating controllable systems by leveraging existing \r\ntechniques from Statistical Learning Theory (SLT) and Control Theory \r\n(CT). This will enable much wider applicability of SLT + CT to \r\ndependable computing and establish a concrete venue for collaboration \r\nwith those research communities. Although CT and to some degree SLT have \r\nbeen applied in limited ways for monitoring and optimizing performance, \r\nto our knowledge ours is the first attempt to use these analytical tools \r\nto monitor and control for dependability and high availability.\r\n",
