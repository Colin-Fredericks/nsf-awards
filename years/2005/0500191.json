 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n    (mathematical)\r\n   This proposal is concerned with the analytic theory\r\nof automorphic forms. Specifically the study of the size\r\nof a general  automorphic L-function on the critical line\r\nand the size of an eigenfunction on an arithmetic locally symmetric\r\nspace .In both cases the main goal is to establish a subconvex\r\nestimate . In the first case the sharpest form of such an estimate\r\nwould follow from the Grand Riemann Hypothesis .However many of the\r\ndesired applications of such estimates only require subconvexity.\r\nThe applications are varied ,one such being the recent subconvex\r\nestimate by Cogdell,Piatetsky-Shapiro and the proposer which allows\r\nfor the resolution of Hilbert's 11th problem on the representation\r\nof integers by quadratic forms in a number field.Other applications\r\nare to problems in mathematical physics ,specifically the behavior\r\nof quantum states in quantizations of classically chaotic systems. The\r\nsecond problem of the size of an eigenfunction on such locally\r\nsymmetric spaces is closely associated with the first and the proposal is \r\nconcerned with understanding this more difficult problem.It constitutes a \r\ngeneralization of the Ramanujan conjectures. \r\n\r\n(general):\r\n   The proposal is concerned with the study of special types of geometric \r\nspaces  which  are defined via arithmetic and number theoretic \r\nconstructions. This has been an active area of investigation for the last \r\n60 or so  years ,primarily since it carries some of the most powerful tools \r\nthat we know in number theory (to diophantine problems\r\nas well as ones  associated with prime numbers).  Specifically the\r\nseemingly technical issues that are being investigated have applications\r\nto resolve some  simple well known problems in number theory. One such is\r\none of Hilbert's problems from 1900 concerning which numbers are sums of\r\n3 integer squares in an extention of the ordinary whole numbers to\r\nintegers in a number field. Other applications of this theory are perhaps\r\nless traditional and are to Mathematical Physics,specifically Quantum\r\nChaos. These spaces provide one of the few (in fact the only one) classically \r\nchaotic Hamiltonian systems whose quantization can be satisfactorally studied \r\nmathematically. The techniques to do so are number theoretic and the results \r\nare often quite surprizing.\r\n",
