 "awd_abstract_narration": "his project aims to study interior-point methods for conic\r\nprogramming problems. Improvements will be considered \r\nto allow these methods to easily detect when \r\nsuch problems are infeasible or unbounded, as often happens when\r\nnew models are developed.  The most efficient interior-point methods \r\nin most cases are primal-dual methods, but in certain cases, dual \r\nmethods are expected to be faster as long as a suitable barrier function\r\ncan be found: the project will study ways to construct such\r\nefficient barrier functions. These two themes can be studied in a\r\nunified way by considering a general conic problem \r\nand a related problem associated with unboundedness. \r\nSeveral topics will be investigated from this viewpoint:\r\nthe relationship between optimal solutions, central paths,\r\nand Newton steps for the two formulations,\r\nand the development of so-called self-concordant barrier\r\nfunctions for faces and recession cones of convex sets for\r\nwhich such barriers are known.\r\n\r\nThis project will continue investigations into interior-point\r\nmethods for conic optimization problems. These methods have proved the\r\nmost efficient for solving truly large-scale linear programming problems,\r\nas arise in resource allocation problems in industry, government, and the\r\nmilitary. More recently, they have been extended to a range of\r\nnonlinear problems, in particular to second-order cone and\r\nsemidefinite programming, which have applications in structural\r\noptimization, antenna array design, filter design, \r\nand portfolio optimization, and in obtaining tight\r\nbounds for hard combinatorial optimization problems.\r\nThe project will extend the capabilities of these methods to\r\ndetect when such problems have been poorly formulated\r\nso that optimal solutions do not exist.  Improved methods \r\nfor very large-scale problems will be investigated.\r\nAdvances will be tested in the software package SDPT3 developed in\r\na previous NSF project with two former graduate students, and\r\navailable to other users over the internet. Improvements\r\nin the code will be made available to practitioners and other code\r\ndevelopers. Graduate students will be trained to become experts in \r\nthe modelling and computational power of conic programming.\r\n",
