 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon Public Broadcasting is requesting funds to produce three one-hour nationally broadcast television programs, a project website, community-centered outreach coordinated by AAAS in 7 U.S. cities, a seminar discussion guide and a series of 90-second programs as part of the \"Earth &Sky\" radio series.  The subject and purpose of the project is to attract public interest in nanotechnology by examining the social, ethical, legal and environmental issuers surrounding its application.  The television programs will be produced by Fred Friendly Seminars (FFS) and broadcast on PBS.  Two science museums, Boston Museum of Science and the South Carolina State Museum, and the University of California, Berkeley, will host the FFS panels.  The format of the Seminars is designed to produce thought provoking and nuanced discussions of contemporary issues.  Collaborative partners in the project include AAAS, Lawrence Hall of Science and ICAN Productions.  The outreach initiative includes outreach to \"targeted stakeholders\" in 7 US cities, four 90-second radio spots as part of Earth & Sky, a project web site and a Seminar discussion guide.  Inverness Research Associates and Edu, Inc. will conduct both formative and summative evaluation of the project components.",
