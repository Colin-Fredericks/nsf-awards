 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Genetics, Biochemistry and Life Science Studies (GBLSS) at Clemson University (CU) will offer a residential 10-week REU program for twelve students. The participants, to be recruited nationally, will include those with a background in any of the disciplines considered to be \"life sciences\": genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, etc. and will be matched with ongoing research projects that best fit their interests and academic background.  Students from institutions with limited research opportunities and from groups under-represented in science are particularly encouraged to apply.  The Program offers research in many areas of contemporary genetics and biochemistry including, but not limited to, protein structure-function relationships, basic developmental processes in plant and animals systems, signal transduction, plant and animal pathogens and high-throughput genomics.  During the course of the program, students will 1) engage in an intense, hands-on research experience involving interactions with faculty, postdoctoral associates, graduate students and other undergraduates; 2) learn about the application of a large variety of instrumentation and contemporary methodologies in life science research; 3) attend seminar presentations by faculty members in the REU program and other active research labs at CU; 4) present a formal mid-term progress report in the form of an oral presentation; 5) prepare a final poster for presentation at a concluding Research Symposium.  In addition to the research component of the program, students will participate in workshops and discussions about the ethical conduct of scientific research.  Students interested in applying to the program should visit http://www.clemson.edu/gblssreu.",
