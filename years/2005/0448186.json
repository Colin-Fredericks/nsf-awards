 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in the Levin laboratory seeks to understand how bacterial cells integrate external and internal signals to determine when and where to divide. The focus of this work is a protein called FtsZ that is found in most bacteria. When a cell is ready to divide, FtsZ forms a ring that establishes the location of the nascent septum. During division the FtsZ ring constricts, like a drawstring, ultimately splitting the cell in two. This project seeks to characterize the signals that tell FtsZ to form a ring initiating the process of cell division, and the guideposts that direct FtsZ to midcell ensuring daughter cells are of the appropriate size and shape. The impact of this work is two-fold. Mechanistically, the process of cell division is conserved across evolutionary boundaries. Thus, dissecting the regulatory networks that control division in a simple bacterium, should reveal general principles that coordinate cell division with growth and differentiation in all organisms. Moreover, because cell division is an essential process, FtsZ and the factors governing its activity hold promise as potential targets for antibiotic development. The educational component of this project is directed towards developing a sequence analysis module for students taking Microbiology at Washington University. In addition to reinforcing concepts covered in lecture, this module will provide the means to introduce a significant number of undergraduates (~65 to 70 per semester) to key aspects of basic research, an essential component of a well-rounded education in biology.",
