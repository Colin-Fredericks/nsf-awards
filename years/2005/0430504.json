 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear programming (the minimization of a smooth nonlinear function subject to smooth\r\n(possibly) nonlinear constraints) is a touchstone problem in optimization. The problem continues\r\nto excite strong interest among optimization researchers for many reasons, among them new\r\ndevelopments in algorithms and software (especially of the interior-point variety), the study of\r\nmathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), and the discovery of new application\r\nareas.\r\nThe broad scope of the nonlinear programming paradigm admits a great many pathologies in\r\nthe geometric nature of the problem and in its algebraic speci.cation. It is impossible to design\r\nalgorithms that converge reliably in all circumstances. Local convergence theory for most algorithms\r\ndepends on regularity and strict complementarity assumptions, and problems for which\r\nthese assumptions are not satis.ed (degenerate problems) are the cause of undesirable and awkward\r\nbehavior in most algorithms and codes.\r\nThis project will investigate some approaches to nonlinear programming, related to approaches\r\ncurrently in use, that have the potential for improved performance on degenerate and large-scale\r\nproblems. These techniques will be theoretically rigorous and practical, in that the marginal\r\ncomputational cost of handling degeneracy will not be too great and in that they will behave well\r\neven when implemented in .oating-point arithmetic. Particular attention will be given to MPECs,\r\nwhich exhibit degeneracy of a speci.c type. Extensions to degenerate complementary problems\r\nand variational inequalities will also be investigated. Special attention will be paid to the numerical\r\naspects of implementing these algorithms, an important issue because of the ill conditioning that\r\nmay be present in the subproblems at each iteration. All this research will be carried out in a\r\ncoordinated manner, coupling theoretical advances with computational experiments using both\r\nprototype software and modi.cations to production software.\r\nWork on applications of nonlinear programming, performed in collaboration with domain scientists\r\nand engineers, will be the second key contribution of the proposal. Interdisciplinary research of\r\nthis type plays a key role in any research program in algorithmic optimization. The PI has ongoing\r\ncollaborations in such areas as engineering control, statistics, and cancer treatment planning.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in improvements to our understanding of\r\nnonlinear programs and of the algorithms that solve these problems, in the construction of better\r\nalgorithms and software that are robust in the face of degeneracy, and in the impact of these\r\nadvances on many application areas including those described in the proposal.\r\nThe work will have a wider impact on users of optimization technology, ultimately bene.ting\r\nmany of those who use optimization software packages to solve problems in an extremely wide\r\nrange of applications. Domain scientists and engineers in the areas highlighted in the proposal will\r\nbene.t especially.",
