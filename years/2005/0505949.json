 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies three broadly based areas of inquiry \r\ninvolving dependent observations. In the first area he develops \r\naccurate probabilistic tools for the study of self-normalized  \r\nestimators in dependent variables. In particular he explores the \r\nintrinsic properties of long range dependence on the basis of \r\nthe observed data. In the second area he develops copula based \r\nestimators for the probability of rare events in dependent data \r\nand introduces an approach for assessing the quality of models\r\nused in the prediction of these events. In the third area he \r\ndevelops a (probabilistically based) historical approach to \r\nboundary crossing under imperfect information and  develops \r\nestimates for the expected time it takes a process to hit a boundary.\r\nThe general nature of his approach provides estimates on ``average \r\ntimes'' rather than ``actual times''. Sensitivity studies are being \r\nperformed to quantify the robustness of the estimates. The \r\nmethodology is being calibrated by using extensive data banks on \r\nnatural phenomena as well as by the use of computer intensive general \r\ncirculation models.\r\n \r\nThe investigator is developing tools to aid in the understanding of \r\nthe connections between historical information and the average time \r\nfor the occurrence of natural events. He works closely with regulators \r\nin the development of  general quality control tools with particular \r\napplication to banking. His work is enriched by close interactions \r\nwith graduate students contributing to the training and mentoring of a \r\ndiverse group of scientists knowledgeable in the new approaches and \r\nable to formulate, develop and solve the problems they will encounter \r\nthroughout their academic, public or industrial careers. His work has \r\nthe potential of  improving public confidence in banking and financial \r\ninstitutions as well as in  enhancing the understanding of the role of \r\nhistorical data in the management of natural resources and risks. \r\n",
