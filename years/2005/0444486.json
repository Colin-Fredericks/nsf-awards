 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to address the issue of inadequate software support for High Performance \r\nComputing by improving two widely used standard libraries, LAPACK and ScaLAPCK, both \r\nof which provide numerical linear algebra kernels. \r\nBy a combination of algorithmic research, an on-going user and vendor survey (at \r\nicl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-survey.html), and anticipation of the demands and opportunities of new \r\narchitectures and modern programming languages, the following key improvements to the \r\ncurrent versions have been identified. \r\n \r\nThe use of novel, improved algorithms. \r\nImproved ease of use. \r\nPerformance Tuning. \r\nImproved reliability and support. \r\n \r\nFirst, new state-of-the-art algorithms will improve speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency.  \r\nSecond, improved user interfaces that exploit features of modern programming languages are \r\nimportant for better ease of use and also hide some of the underlying complex, possibly \r\ndistributed, data structures.  Third, the performance of both libraries crucially depends on a \r\nnumber of machine-dependent parameters whose setting can benefit from automatic tuning \r\ntechniques developed very successfully in the ATLAS project.  Last, there is a huge demand for \r\nongoing support and maintenance of both LAPACK and ScaLAPACK, and there is a need for \r\ninstalling a formal mechanism for user feedback, for tracking bugs, for version management, \r\nand facilitated installation.  \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nLAPACK and ScaLAPACK have been adopted by many vendors as the basis of their own \r\nlibraries: SGI/Cray, IBM, HP-Convex, Fujitsu, NEC, NAG and IMSL, and the Mathworks \r\n(producers of Matlab).  For this reason, the proposed changes will have a large impact.  \r\nFurthermore, recent origin of most of the algorithms described in this proposal means that there \r\nare not yet any easily accessible descriptions suitable for education.  As part of the project \r\ndocumentation, tutorial material will be developed that is suitable for classroom instruction and \r\nwide educational outreach. \r\nThe development of LAPACK and ScaLAPACK is part of a long and successful history of \r\ncollaboration between the PIs.  In addition, for the current improvements, numerous outside \r\ncollaborators have offered support ranging from software and ideas to help in programming \r\nand development.",
