 "awd_abstract_narration": "A foliation F  of a manifold M is a regular decomposition of the space \r\ninto connected submanifolds, usually with some assumptions that the \r\ndecomposition is smooth, and the decomposition is uniform -- either \r\nthere are no singular strata, or the singular strata themselves have a \r\nfoliated structure.  The breadth of the study of foliations includes \r\nall dynamical systems, an immensely broad topic in itself, so truly \r\nclassifying all foliations is quite impossible. The goal of this \r\nproject is to investigate three approaches to classification: 1) \r\nclassify foliations via categorical (in the sense of Lusternik and \r\nSchnirelmann) decompositions and other  \"foliated cell\" structures;   \r\n2) classify foliations up to homotopy of their transverse Haefliger \r\nstructure;  3) classify foliations in terms of the ergodic theory and \r\nasymptotic properties of their leaves.  The PI's study of the relations \r\nbetween the second and third of these topics -- dynamical systems and \r\nergodic theory, and geometric and  topological invariants of group \r\nactions and foliations -- has been ongoing for more than 20 years with \r\nsupport of the NSF, and resulted in many publications and advances in \r\nthe field.  In the past three years, there have been further decisive \r\nadvances in each topic. The study of Lusternik and Schnirelmann \r\ncategory of foliations, and its related ideas, is a very new field, \r\nwith great potential for advances.  The fundamental connections between \r\nLS category theory and Morse theory, motivate the study of the \r\nconnections between their foliated versions, and the classification of \r\ntransverse Haefliger structures. Success with this part of the proposed \r\nresearch  would result in truly fundamental new understanding of the \r\nstructure of foliations.\r\n\r\nThe study of foliations of manifolds began as a subject approximately \r\nfifty years ago.  The concept arises very naturally in many geometric \r\nand topological problems, so it is not surprising that understanding \r\nproperties of foliations  has become a fundamental aspect of the study \r\nof many other subjects in geometry, topology,  dynamical systems,  \r\nanalysis and   various areas of  applied and theoretical physics.  The \r\nintellectual merit of the proposed activity includes advancing our \r\nunderstanding of the structure of foliations,  and  developing new \r\ntechniques with broad applications in many fields. Success with this \r\nresearch project will not just be measured by solving the proposed \r\nproblems, but also in opening the field up with new questions. The \r\nbroader impact resulting from the proposed activity includes enhanced \r\ntraining of undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, \r\ncollaborative research projects with postdoctoral investigators, and \r\ninternational collaborations promoting research in mathematics.   The \r\nPI intends to continue working with graduate students and postdocs on \r\nprojects related to this proposal, and to promote the field via \r\nconference talks and via the internet.\r\n",
