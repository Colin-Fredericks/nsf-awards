Hoffman and M. Weber,\r\nhopes to prove the existence of embedded helicoids of arbitrary\r\ngenus, following up on their existence result in genus one but\r\npursuing a different approach that is already known to simplify\r\nthe genus-one argument.  A basic uniqueness question on minimal\r\nsurfaces is also going to be studied: In how many ways can one\r\ndesingularize the intersection of two planes?  The principal\r\ninvestigator has studied harmonic maps onto the hyperbolic plane\r\nfor several years, leading to a natural conjecture on extensions\r\nof quasi-symmetries of the circle to the hyperbolic disk.  The\r\nplanned work on projective structures on Riemann surfaces will be\r\npursued jointly with a postdoctoral fellow, David Dumas, and aims\r\nto develop fine asymptotics for such structures.\r\n\r\nA minimal surface is the mathematical idealization of a soap\r\nbubble spanning a wire.  A stable soap bubble ordinarily assumes\r\nthe least area of all possible surfaces spanning that wire, and\r\nthe mathematical statement of the fact that varying the surface\r\nmust increase its area translates into a partial differential\r\nequation.  Versions of these problems have been studied intensely\r\nsince the 19th century and before, for both physical and\r\ngeometric reasons.  The helicoid referred to above is a surface\r\nshaped like a corkscrew or parking ramp, and the genus-one\r\nversion of the helicoid could be described as a parking ramp with\r\nan airshaft -- some interesting and appealing pictures of these\r\nand other minimal surfaces are available on M. Weber's Web pages,\r\nhttp://www.indiana/edu/~minimal.\r\n",
