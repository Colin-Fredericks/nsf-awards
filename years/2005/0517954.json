 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth of multiple microorganisms in environments containing a mixture of growth-limiting substrates is a problem of fundamental ecological importance. Although the literature is abundant with mathematical theories of competition in mixed environments, many mathematical models fall short of directly addressing the dynamics of physiological adaptations exhibited by microbial species in response to environmental fluctuations. In our previous work, we have laid foundations for developing a comprehensive mathematical theory that fulfills this modeling niche. We have shown that predictions of these models are in close agreement with experimental data. In this project, we will provide a solid mathematical background behind the physiological theory of microbial adaptation and further extend the modeling framework to include the key physiological variables and intracellular processes that we did not consider previously. This work will provide the molecular basis for understanding extinction, coexistence, and physiological heterogeneity in complex microbial communities. This project will also address the impact of environmental perturbations on adaptive microbial ecosystems.\r\n\r\nMany of the modern biotechnologies including food processing and waste water treatment are based on the controlled growth of microbial cultures, an adaptive process that is sensitive to environmental perturbations.  This project will contribute towards our understanding of the key factors that drive the physiological adaptation of microorganisms and greatly enhance our ability to control and optimize the performance of industrial bioreactors. In addition, this work will have an educational impact on graduate (and possibly undergraduate) students both through direct involvement, and through the set of research-based educational materials in microbial growth kinetics and adaptive population dynamics developed at the University of Florida.",
