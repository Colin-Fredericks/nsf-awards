 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Noyce Scholarship Program at SUNY Stony Brook is recruiting and supporting undergraduates majoring in STEM fields, as well as post-baccalaureate STEM professionals, into strong teacher preparation programs.  The Noyce program is built around a successful campus organization known as LIGASE (Long Island Group Advancing Science Education), which acts as an umbrella organization for science education programs at the university. Science and math majors are being recruited from among Stony Brook undergraduates and from area community colleges.  In addition, career-changing STEM professionals in the private sector are being recruited as Noyce Scholars through newspapers, web sites, and career day activities.  Forty-three scholars are being supported with substantial scholarships, 12 of whom are undergraduates completing their teacher certification program and 31 who are STEM professionals returning to Stony Brook to complete the MAT degree.  The emphasis of the program on post-baccalaureate students reflects changes in the New York State licensure laws requiring a Masters degree within 5 years of beginning teaching.  Through partnerships established by LIGASE, successful Noyce Scholars are being placed in high need secondary schools in Long Island and New York City school districts.  During the critical first years of teaching, new teachers are supported with workshops, seminars, and discussion sessions held monthly at Stony Brook.  The program addresses fundamental issues in teacher education by providing excellent science content and pedagogical preparation for future teachers.  The program is having a broad impact on the quality of science teachers on Long Island and in New York City.",
