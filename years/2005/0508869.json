 "awd_abstract_narration": "For hyperbolic manifolds there are postulated connections between\r\ngeometric, representation-theoretic, and quantum based invariants of\r\nmanifolds.  The PI will work towards specific conjectures relating\r\nthese invariants; in particular, he will investigate a scissors\r\ncongruence approach to the volume conjecture and he will continue work\r\non his conjecture relating the A-polynomial with variation of Bloch\r\ninvariants. The research on these connections involves invariants that\r\nare related to number theory and algebraic K-theory, and machine\r\ncomputation has been an important component of the research. The main\r\ntool is the program Snap, and another important aspect of the project\r\nis further development of this program. The PI will also continue his\r\ninvestigation of commensurability properties of 3-manifolds.\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses some long-term open questions concerning\r\n3-dimensional space forms. These questions involve invariants that\r\nspan different areas of mathematics, creating interactions of low\r\ndimensional topology with algebra, number theory, and theoretical\r\nphysics.  Links between disparate areas provide much of the power of\r\nmathematics, and strengthening these links increases the power. The\r\nproject will also lead to a major enhancement of powerful 3-manifold\r\nsoftware, originally developed in a project led by PI and C. Hodgson,\r\nthat is an important tool for the research of this proposal and is\r\nalso widely used in the mathematical community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
