 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) This project is undertaking three inter-related tasks to support the use of Flash software for the development of learning materials for mathematics and science. First, a library of classes (a suite of reusable, self-contained blocks of software code) commonly needed for mathematics and science applications and applets is being written. These include a set of open-source demo applets utilizing those classes. Second, the investigators are developing online training materials on using Flash and the new classes for creating web-based teaching aids. Materials include interactive narrated videos produced using the \"Captivate\" software that creates files in the native format of the Flash Player. Third, a community of educators interested in using Flash for creating interactive web-based teaching aids is being supported under the auspices of the NSDL Math Gateway. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its ability to open the door for many educators to develop interactive, engaging, web-based materials in Flash using the library of basic classes and training. The project is exercising broader impact by establishing a network and forum for a community of educators interested in developing materials in Flash to exchange ideas and build upon each other's work. The materials resulting from the project are being broadly disseminated through the NSDL Math Gateway.",
