 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developing a diversified router platform to enable networking researchers to more easily construct experimental networks, explores new and disruptive architectural innovations. Networking diversification is an emerging concept that envisions multiple diverse networks co-existing on a reconfigurable substrate. Enabling the creation of systems that demonstrate new network architectural innovations in a form that permits systems to be deployed and used to carry live traffic (even in settings that demand high performance levels), this diversified router allows multiple diverse routers to share a common hardware platform, using a flexible architecture built around a pool of processing engines that can be allocated to different routers as needed. The platform leverages the Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA), a rapidly developing industry standard for telecommunications equipment. To simplify overall architecture, whenever possible, the platform uses standard ATCA components and distributed switching. It is expected to support link speeds up to 10Gb/s with typical configurations supporting 4 to 6 links and 8 to 10 processing engines of various types. Designed flexible enough for use in support of a wide range of activities, the platform is expected to serve as a compelling demonstration of the feasibility of diversified networking. Moreover, the platform appears well-suited for improvements to the current internet protocol suite that require modifications to the router data path.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Through Washington's University's Open Network Lab, the systems will be made directly available for experimental use by others. The diversified networking concept has the potential to transform the Internet, enabling new network technologies to be introduced at any time, stimulating competition among competitive alternatives, and preventing the recurring problem of network ossification that now plagues the Internet. New courses will be created and students will benefit, particularly the graduate students working on the project.\r\n",
