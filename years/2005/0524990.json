 "awd_abstract_narration": "Red colobus monkeys (subfamily Colobinae, genus Procolobus, subgenus Piliocolobus) are distributed across equatorial Africa in over 14 different forms and display a complex pattern of variation. They currently rank among the most endangered primates in Africa, and their classification remains one of the longest-standing problems in African primate taxonomy. Using molecular techniques, this research will build a phylogeny and classification for red colobus monkeys, representing the most comprehensive molecular study of African leaf monkeys to date. Specifically, this research has the following objectives; 1) establish relationships among red colobus populations, 2) develop a taxonomy that accurately reflects the diversity within the group, 3) provide distributional information on red colobus populations, and 4) further our knowledge concerning colobine evolutionary history. Fecal, tissue from museum collections, and hair samples from numerous red colobus populations have been collected and will be subjected to DNA extraction and sequencing; GPS data collected in the field will be used to map geographical distributions; and molecular phylogenetic methods will be employed to estimate nuclear and mitochondrial DNA gene trees, which will be used to address questions concerning colobine systematics and the timing of vicariance events within the group. The results will lead to a better understanding of the behavioral ecology, morphology, and evolutionary radiation of the leaf monkeys, and allow the testing of hypotheses concerning African primate biogeography.  \r\nAmong the most important broader impacts of this project are the conservation implications. When there is no universal agreement on species-level classification, identification of endangered species becomes problematic, making the designation of conservation priorities difficult. Because one of the goals of conservation is to preserve genetic diversity, and taxonomy is meant to reflect phylogenetic relationships and genetic distinctiveness, well-resolved phylogenies are essential for effective conservation. Since red colobus relationships are currently poorly resolved, this study has implications for effective species-level conservation, biodiversity analysis, and designation of conservation priorities. Also, while in the field collecting samples, the student Co-PI collected distributional information for endangered red colobus populations, and hired and trained local field assistants. This Co-PI will also be instrumental in the tutelage of undergraduates in a molecular anthropology laboratory. The results of this research will be published in scholarly journals and presented at academic conferences, and sequences will be submitted to the publicly accessible GenBank database hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Furthermore, this research will foster the professional development of a doctoral student.\r\n",
