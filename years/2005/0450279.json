 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed SEAGEP Program includes The University of Florida (UF) as lead institution and \r\ntwo primary partners .  Clemson University  and The University  of South Carolina.  SEAGEP \r\nunites three Research Extensive institutions that combined offer PhD degrees in over 50 STEM \r\nfields offering unparalleled opportunities for graduate studies.  In 2002, the total STEM graduate \r\nenrollment at these institutions was over 400. Secondary partners are the Florida-Georgia Louis \r\nB. Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP), the South Carolina Louis B. Stokes \r\nAlliance  for  Minority  Participation  (SCAMP)  and  the  University  of  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands.  \r\nSEAGEP will also provide international opportunities for students through a collaboration with \r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions (LACCEI) and other \r\nLatin American  and worldwide  projects.  SEAGEP  will  organize  and  deliver  a  comprehensive \r\nprogram that successfully guides STEM graduate students from underrepresented groups toward \r\ndoctoral degree completion and entry into academic careers. The components of the program will \r\nbe  guided  by  the  design  principles  suggested  by  the  Building  Engineering &  Science  Talent \r\norganization  and  will  include  targeted  recruitment  activities,  bridging  activities  that  prepare \r\nstudents for the graduate school experience,  retention activities that include faculty and peer \r\nmentoring, professional preparation activities for entry into academic careers, and post doctoral \r\nopportunities.  The objectives of the program are to: \r\nIncrease the number of minority STEM PhD students from underrepresented groups and \r\nprepare them for successful entry into productive faculty careers,  \r\nDevelop synergistic partner relationships for institutionalizing changes that will continue \r\nto promote diversity in STEM graduate education \r\nIncrease the pool of undergraduates from underrepresented groups who are prepared for \r\nentry into graduate STEM fields,  \r\nDevelop a model to evaluate the effectiveness of the partnership. \r\nThe SEAGEP program will be evaluated throughout the five years of the program- using \r\nboth qualitative and quantitative methods, including formative evaluation of the program \r\nactivities as they are implemented, as well as summative program impact evaluation. \r\nThe intellectual merit of SEAGEP is evident in that this Alliance includes a diverse team \r\nwell qualified to serve as PIs and facilitators of the activities designed to address the preparation \r\nof doctoral students in creative and innovative ways, thereby increasing the numbers of \r\nunderrepresented scholars that earn doctoral degrees in STEM disciplines and enter the \r\nprofessoriate.  SEAGEP has been developed from a thorough understanding of the challenges \r\ninherent in this mission as reported in the literature.  Each partner has unique strengths to \r\ncontribute and benefits to realize.  Through this synergy, SEAGEP will result in national models \r\nfor cultural and institutional change, and partnership effectiveness. \r\nThe Mission of SEAGEP is to create a regional partnership for enhancing diversity in \r\nhigher education by developing innovative and sustainable graduate education programs to \r\nprepare and train students to enter STEM fields and to foster models of institutional cultural \r\nchange. When realized, it will provide a direct impact by increasing the number of minority \r\nPhDs and will also result in broader impacts by establishing a model partnership and proven \r\nstrategies that will be widely disseminated.  SEAGEP will contribute to the development of a \r\nmore inclusive, skilled, and versatile technical talent pool, strengthening the diversity of the \r\nNation.s workforce, particularly academia, thereby contributing to the fields that are critical to \r\nthe Nation.s economic strength, national security, and quality of life.",

The Biological Sciences also saw large increases; 167% increase in PhD enrollees, a 153% increase in advance to candidacy, and a 116% increase in URM PhD degrees awarded.  A study of the first 29 SEAGEP PhD recipients found that SEAGEP grads were diversifying the technical workforce with 15 in academia (including postdoc positions), 5 in industry and 9 in government positions. \n\nThe AGEP program produced institutional change through outreach and recruiting, networking with minority serving undergraduate institutions, proactive mentoring through the PhD program, and professional development activities.  Students became part of a peer support group that students highly valued.  This provided a venue for more senior students to help new students navigate their program.  Travel awards that allowed new students to attend professional meetings helped them integrate into their field early in their program.  Regular meetings with program administrators ensured that students continued to progress. Professional development activities, such as teaching and grant writing workshops, rounded out their preparation.  Evaluation results indicated that SEGEP students reported a high degree of satisfaction with the program as well as with the guidance and mentoring they received from their departments. \n\nWhen asked how the AGEP program differed from other programs and how their experience differed from their colleagues who were not in AGEP, participants felt that this program helped them (a) to become more involved in the life of the school and not to remain isolated, (b) by providing a supportive environment, and (c) by giving them the opportunity to succeed academically.  These were illustrated in students\u00c6 comments:\n\n&bull; I\u00c6ve had other programs I\u00c6ve been affiliated with and this by far outshines the other programs.&hellip;the monthly meetings are great because you get to know the students, stay constantly involved rather than be isolated.
