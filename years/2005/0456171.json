Moench] is a logical complement to Oryza (rice), a distant relative that will be the first grass genome to be completely sequenced. Sorghum also serves as a bridge to several economically important large- genome crops including maize and sugar cane. Because of advances in both science and technology, it is an opportune time to convene an international planning session to advance sorghum as a candidate for genome sequencing that will provide cost-effective information of use to both basic and applied researchers.\r\n\r\nThe goals of workshop are: \r\n\r\n1) to obtain a status report on the development and accessibility of sorghum genome research information, technologies, and infrastructure, \r\n2) to identify future priorities and needs for sorghum genomics research, and \r\n3) to better organize the sorghum community and more closely link basic and applied research. \r\n\r\nThe meeting will span one full day, and be organized into several sessions including: \r\n\r\n(1) status and needs for sorghum genome map resources, \r\n(2) status and needs for databases, \r\n(3) approaches and status of sorghum gene and genome sequencing, \r\n(4) status and needs for sorghum germplasm and population\r\ndevelopment, \r\n(5) rationale, support, and coordination of sorghum genomics research, and \r\n(6) planning for the future.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will include representatives from academia, government, and the private sectors coming from (but not necessarily limited to) the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, France, India, and key countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Mali and Niger). Most of these countries and international programs have active genomics research activities focusing on sorghum improvement. In addition to individuals actively working on sorghum, we also will invite representatives from other plant genome sequencing projects so that they might provide insights and advice into to the planning, organization, and execution of joint efforts. The workshop will last one day and will result in a summary document that will be distributed to all participants as well as others interested in advances in sorghum genomics.\r\n\r\n",
