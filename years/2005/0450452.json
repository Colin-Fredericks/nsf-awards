 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will apply an optoelectronic detection system into an integrated high-speed manufacturing system aimed at commercial identification and sortation of aluminum scrap by alloy type - particularly aluminum alloys containing various alloying elements such as silicon and perhaps magnesium. The goal of the program is to commercially sort mixed aluminum alloys from an automobile shredder. Commercial technologies in existence today sort automobile shredder nonferrous metals based on density, but there are no technologies in commercial operation that sort the metals into 1) cast and wrought alloys, 2) various aluminum alloy series (100, 200, 3000, 7000 etc.), or 3) into individual alloy types. Sorting aluminum alloys based on chemical composition is the objective of this SBIR Phase II program. A very sophisticated, proprietary sensor and detection system has been developed and demonstrated in Phase I in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the technology. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts (commercial potential) of this proposed technology has the potential to transform the efficiency and utilization of scrap metal in the U.S. In 2001, the aluminum industry consumed nearly 800 trillion Btu, was responsible for 1.8% of the total manufacturing energy consumed, emitted 43.5 million tons of CO2, and consumed 1.6% of all U.S. electricity - mostly from primary production. Secondary production is much more efficient - economically and environmentally. Recovering aluminum from scrap consumes only about 6% of the energy required to produce primary aluminum and requires only 10% of the capital. In spite of efficiencies in making aluminum from scrap, exports in 2003 were 562,090 million tons because the industry could not utilize much of its low-grade scrap. This technology will allow utilization of this scrap in existing U.S. plants because the scrap will be converted from low-grade to high-grade scrap which is more consistent with U.S. consumption and needs. The result will be job preservation, reduced emissions, reduced energy needs, reduced raw material imports, and a better balance of payments. \r\n",
