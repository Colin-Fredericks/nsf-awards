US PI Alexander Mathews of Kansas State University will travel to the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi to confer with collaborator T.R. Sreekrishnan, a professor of biochemical engineering and biotechnology.  They propose to investigate ways to develop biodegradable plastics and polymers from renewable resources such as agricultural crops, crop residues, and wastes from food.  They will hold a series of discussions with senior researchers to develop research protocols on processes for the utilization of renewable resources.  The discussions will result in the development of a multi-year program of cooperative research including the exchange of students.    \r\n\r\nScope: This research deals with an important scientific problem and has potential for broad social and educational impacts.  It will initiate international collaborative research that can help conserve nonrenewable energy resources, and minimize environmental pollution from the use of synthetic plastics and polymers that are not biodegradable.  The project will include graduate and undergraduate students in the project discussion, inquiry and discovery process.   Results will be disseminated to industries and government agencies through presentations and publications in both countries.  \r\n\r\n",
