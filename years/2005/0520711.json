The projects that will be enhanced with this equipment focus on increasing our understanding of how land use change alters nitrogen and phosphorus transfer, and leveraging that understanding through education and outreach.  The research activities involve existing collaborative arrangements between the Center for Watershed Science and Education laboratory (CWSE) and citizen associations, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations.  The research activities acquire and evaluate data, and then develop outreach materials.  This approach simultaneously advances our basic understanding of nutrient transfer and also provides information to engaged audiences.  Through these collaborations, undergraduate students and graduate students become part of project teams.  Working with CWSE staff and collaborators, they receive research experiences through study design, data acquisition, evaluation, preparation and presentation of findings and recommendations.  \r\n\r\n",
