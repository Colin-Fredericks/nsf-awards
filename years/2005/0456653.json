 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator's research combines a number of diverse areas in\r\nmathematics: logic, set theory, algebra, topology, and analysis,\r\nas well as some automated reasoning techniques from computer science.\r\nIn topology, the investigator focuses on properties of scattered spaces,\r\ncompact homogeneous spaces, and Bohr topologies.  Topology and analysis\r\nare integrated in this research, especially in the area of Bohr topologies,\r\nsince the subject involves the standard cardinal functions of general\r\ntopology (such as weight, character, etc.), but is studied via the\r\ntheory of group representations, which is part of harmonic analysis.\r\nAlso, compact homogeneous spaces are often constructed with the aid\r\nof measures on the spaces.  Logic and set theory are relevant because\r\nstatements about topology and measure theory are frequently independent\r\nof the usual axioms of set theory; when a result is proved independent,\r\nthe methods used are those of formal logic.  For example, the notion of\r\nthe Cantor-Bendixson sequence and scattered spaces is 100 years old,\r\nbut there are still questions about the cardinals which can arise\r\nin the sequence of Cantor-Bendixson derivatives; part of the\r\ninvestigator's research studies how this sequence varies in different\r\nmodels of set theory.  In algebra, the investigator works on algebraic\r\nsystems such as quasigroups and loops.  Automated reasoning tools\r\nare very useful here.  These algebraic systems are described by\r\nfairly simple axioms, and a computer search can often reveal\r\ninteresting new consequences of these axioms.  However, the\r\ninvestigator combines the computer use with classical arguments\r\ninvolving combinatorics and group theory.\r\n\r\nThe investigator's research studies a number of topics in pure\r\nmathematics which arose naturally in an attempt to generalize\r\nproperties of the physical universe.  For example, topology arises\r\nnaturally in an attempt to generalize the geometry of physical space.\r\nMeasure theory is a natural extension of the notion of probability.\r\nThe research also studies algebraic properties of loops, which naturally\r\ngeneralize the concept of groups, which arise in the study of symmetry.\r\nThere is also a computational component to this research, especially\r\ninvolving loops.  Frequently in this area, one wants to know\r\nwhether one equation implies another.  A proof of such an implication\r\ninvolves symbolic manipulation which can be performed by a computer program.\r\nIn recent years, the hardware and software have become powerful enough\r\nto discover new implications and to solve problems which had been\r\nintractable without computer assistance.  The investigator's\r\nresearch here is of interest both for the mathematics itself,\r\nand for the advancement of the computer tools used.\r\n",
