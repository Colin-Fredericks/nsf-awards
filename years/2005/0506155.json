 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bennett College HBCU-UP project will strengthen STEM teaching and learning, through the development and implementation of effective and innovative teaching and learning strategies with a thematic focus on Computational Science.  Since Computational Science involves the appropriate use of a computational device to apply a suitable algorithm to solve a scientific problem, this project will bring together the Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, and Computer Science disciplines into an integrated curriculum and instructional program. The project objectives are to: 1. Increase the recruitment, retention and graduation rates of STEM majors; 2. Enhance the scholarly productivity and technological expertise of STEM faculty; and 3. Revise the STEM curriculum to better prepare graduates to enter graduate and professional schools, and to assume productive careers in new interdisciplinary fields. Student access to STEM programs will be improved by engaging high school and college students in Computational Science focused activities such as \"take it on the road\" exhibits and a summer enrichment program featuring Computational Science rotations. Computational Science will be infused throughout the curriculum with relevant course and lab modules and undergraduate research experiences. In preparation for and continuation of the curricular enhancements, STEM faculty will participate in on-going developmental activities and interdisciplinary research. Faculty research collaborations will be encouraged and supported. A cadre of partners, including STEM graduate programs, will be cultivated. A refereed undergraduate research journal with a focus on Computational Science will be published. Submissions will feature student and faculty research articles, outstanding interdisciplinary class modules, research on STEM student learning, and effective scientific pedagogy on student research training. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Infusing Computational Science throughout the curriculum will help students better understand the global importance of the STEM disciplines and how they are interrelated. It will equip the students to effectively work on teams and make contributions in the workplace. STEM student learning and faculty training will be enhanced through the use of innovative pedagogies.  Best  practices will be employed and the effect of new creative approaches will be investigated and documented. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Societal benefits will include the production of highly-qualified STEM professionals and leaders and the inclusion of minorities and women, producing a more diverse and nationally representative workforce. The project will directly impact underrepresented groups in terms of gender, ethnicity given the mostly African American female student enrollment at Bennett College.  Students who are served will become future role models, thus, building additional capacity of gender and racial diversity in the scientific work place.  Faculty development activities focused on Computational Science will allow the faculty to engage in interdisciplinary and collaborative activities to up-date their teaching strategies and research directions.  The cultivation and strengthening of our academic, industry and government partners will enhance the education, research, and career planning infrastructure at Bennett.  Results of connecting our partners with our students and faculty will be an increase in graduate program acceptances, an increase in research collaborations, and the generation of ideas and production of innovative products in the scientific workplace.  In addition to the publication of a scholarly journal, other dissemination activities planned include conference presentations, research publications, and a Best Practices link on the Bennett web page.  \r\n",
