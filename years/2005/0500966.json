 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposal is to investigate various\r\nproblems in Geometric Analysis with the theory of Sobolev\r\nspaces as a main tool. As the theory of Sobolev spaces has\r\nan impressive range of applications, the proposal\r\ndoes not focus on a narrow problematics but rather, it\r\naddresses a number of problems from a broader range of areas in\r\nGeometric Analysis. That includes study of:\r\n(1) boundedness of maximal functions in Sobolev spaces;\r\n(2) Sobolev extension domains;\r\n(3) interplay between isoperimetric inequality, Sobolev inequality\r\nand the truncation method in the vectorial case related to Korn's\r\ninequality and the Sobolev inequality of Strauss;\r\n(4) geometric properties of Sobolev mappings between domains in the\r\nEuclidean space (this research is related to problems in nonlinear\r\nelasticity);\r\n(5) bi-Lipschitz embeddings of metric spaces;\r\n(6) Lipschitz approximation of Sobolev mappings between manifolds,\r\npolyhedra and metric spaces with connections to the topology of spaces.\r\n(7) degree theory of mappings in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces in the case\r\nin which the target space is a rational homology sphere;\r\n(8) the Hardy space regularity of Jacobians of mappings between manifolds\r\nwith applications to the regularity questions in the calculus of\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nTheory of Sobolev spaces was one of the greatest discoveries in\r\nthe XXth century mathematics. This theory is the most important single\r\ntool in studying  nonlinear partial differential equations, both in its\r\ntheoretical aspects and numerical implementation.\r\nAlthough the theory of Sobolev spaces has been created in the late\r\nthirties,in recent years, there have been major breakthroughs in the theory, by\r\nexpanding the applications to new areas of pure mathematics\r\nlike analysis on metric spaces, geometric group theory or algebraic\r\ntopology as well as to areas in applied mathematics, like for example to non-convex\r\ncalculus of variations. The aim of the proposal is to continue this\r\ninvestigation in its various aspects. The PI has intention to advise PhD\r\nstudents on problems closely related to the proposal.\r\n",
