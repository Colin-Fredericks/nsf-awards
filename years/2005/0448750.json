 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT for CAREER proposal DMS-0448750:  Rational points on\r\nvarieties and non-abelian Galois groups\r\n\r\nPrincipal investigator:  Jordan S. Ellenberg\r\n\r\nInstitution:  University of Wisconsin\r\n\r\nThe investigator proposes to address an ensemble of problems in\r\narithmetic geometry, centered on the problem of describing the\r\ndistribution of rational points on varieties over number fields.  The\r\nstudy of rational points is, on the one hand, passed down to us from\r\nthe very beginning of number theory; on the other hand, the present\r\nstate of the art in this extremely active area involves ideas from a\r\nwide variety of subjects, including etale cohomology, methods of\r\nanalytic number theory, and the complex algebraic geometry of moduli\r\nspaces of morphisms.  In the first project, the investigator and his\r\ncolleagues will continue their investigation of well-known conjectures\r\non distribution of rational points and distribution of discriminants\r\nof number fields.  In the second project, the investigator will study\r\nthe arithmetic of towers of curves; rational points in such towers\r\nseem to be intimately related with objects of non-abelian Iwasawa\r\ntheory, a subject which has enjoyed an explosion of interest in the\r\nlast five years.  The proposed projects will involve a great deal of\r\ncollaboration with researchers from every part of number theory and\r\nalgebraic geometry, and should provide many opportunities for graduate\r\nstudents and postdoctoral fellows.\r\n\r\nThe foundational problem of number theory is this: find all solutions\r\nin rational numbers to an equation.  For instance, one can ask for\r\nsolutions of the Pythagorean equation: for which rational numbers x,y,\r\nand z is it the case that the square of x plus the square of y equals\r\nthe square of z?  The Pythagorean equation has been well-understood\r\nfor centuries; but many others, like Fermat's equation, present -- to\r\nsay the least! -- more serious difficulties, and most equations are\r\npresently beyond our current ability to analyze.  In recent years, the\r\nsubject of \"rational points\", or the analysis of solutions of\r\nequations, has been taking shape as a subject of its own, drawing\r\nideas and techniques from many different parts of mathematics.  The\r\ninvestigator proposes several research projects in the area of\r\nrational points.  Because this area of research combines classical,\r\neasy-to-state problems with advanced methods and opportunities for\r\nexperimentation, it is very well-suited for fledgling mathematicians.\r\nThe investigator will launch a research program for students at\r\nMadison Memorial High School, and will expand the scope of the\r\nWisconsin Talent Search; the aim will be to develop in Wisconsin an\r\ninfrastructure for mathematical exploration, enrichment and research\r\nin secondary school, which will have enough momentum to continue\r\nbeyond the duration of the present award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
