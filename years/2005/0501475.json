 "awd_abstract_narration": "Materials Technology (58) \r\n \r\nThis project is creating an ATE National Resource Center for Materials Technology Education. The program is based on the needs of industry for qualified and trained technicians who understand the basics of materials technology.  This is especially important relative to new developments in nanotechnology and composites technologies as well as in more traditional areas of metals, plastics, and composites manufacture. The program builds on prior ATE projects in materials and manufacturing technology education, and has been developed by an experienced team from colleges, universities, \r\nprofessional societies and industry. \r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this project is to develop a clearinghouse of teaching  materials for the broad field of materials technology as it applies to manufacturing and engineering technology, and to provide the mentoring support needed for instructors to adequately treat the subject of materials technology in their courses. The focus is on enhanced education for manufacturing and engineering technicians who handle materials in the wide range of structural and electronics manufacturing. The expected outcomes include enhanced curricular modules aligned with industry-based core competencies to provide student training aligned with industry needs, and model programs on how to insert these modules into manufacturing and engineering technology courses. Also expected are a set of well-trained instructors at high school and community college levels, and a growing alliance of colleges, schools, and industry working to further develop these outcomes. The development of new roles for professional societies and industry in delivering courses and providing mentoring is also included.  \r\n  \r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this Center is based on the collection and development of curricular resources for faculty to enhance their current courses with basic materials principles that involve the interrelationship between materials processing, properties and structure. With the mentoring program, faculty are better able to meet the needs of industry for skilled technicians who understand that changes in processing parameters change performance of a part. The Center build on the wide base of curricula collected in prior ATE and related projects in materials technology as a result of past and current programs, providing a set of categorized and reviewed curricula in the broad area of \r\nmaterials technology.  Strong institutional support provides for sustainability of the Center program.\r\n \r\nThe Broader Impacts focuses on the current and future needs of manufacturing technicians as related to the materials they use.  It also includes the development of enhanced partnerships between industry and academic institutions through its interactions with professional societies, which provide mentoring, internship and networking opportunities for students and faculty with professionals.  The Center's curricular programs have a strong focus on addressing the needs of groups underrepresented in technology.  Broad dissemination of the products of the Center through professional societies and educational organizations enhance student enrollment in manufacturing, engineering and materials programs and the numbers of students available to enter the workforce in this critical area. \r\n\r\n",
