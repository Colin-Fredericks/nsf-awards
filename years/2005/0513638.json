 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Twenty Third Fungal Genetics Conference, considered by many to be the pre-eminent meeting in the area of Fungal biology, will be held at the Asilomar Conference Center at Asilomar, California on March 15-20, 2005. The conference focuses on the molecular biology, genetics, genomics, biochemistry and cell biology of filamentous fungi. Approximately 750 scientists and students from around the world who are interested in medical pathogens, plant pathogens, saprobic fungi and symbiotic fungi, will attend. Fungi are model eukaryotes that have aided in our understanding of biological processes and disease in animals and plants, beginning with the demonstration by Beadle and Tatum in the 1940's of the relationship between genetics and biochemistry. \r\n\r\nThis meeting places a strong emphasis on the participation of young scientists and students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, allowing many their first opportunity to attend a major conference and present their research findings.  This is an important part of their training and professional development.  Funds from NSF will be used to help defray the travel and participation costs of students, and postdoctoral researchers. Funds are distributed on a need basis to financial aid applicants.",
