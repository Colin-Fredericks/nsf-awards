 "awd_abstract_narration": "This purpose of this project is to help support attendance of four graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the 2005 Gordon Research Conference on Temperature Stress in Plants, to be held January 30-February 4, 2005, in Ventura, California.  The organizers are Jian-Kang Zhu, Director of the Institute for Integrative Genome Biology at the University of California, Riverside, and Tapio Palva, a faculty member in the Department of Biosciences at the University of Helsinki.  The purpose of this high-profile conference is to foster interactions and exchange among the world's top leaders in the area of plant temperature stress.  The meeting's modest size (no more than 135 participants) will be conducive to fostering these sorts of interactions.  Student and postdoctoral participation will be encouraged, offering them an unparalleled opportunity to interact with one another and with leaders in the discipline.  In addition to advancing knowledge in the field and contributing to student education, another broader impact is that the Conference will sponsor two special initiatives: a Diversity Initiative and an Early Career Scientist Initiative to encourage the participation of plant scientists from 1890 and other predominantly minority institutions, as well as early career scientists.  NSF support will help fund these initiatives.",
