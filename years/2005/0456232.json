 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Focused Research Group project the investigators\r\nstudy the behavior of a class of soft materials characterized by\r\nstrong coupling of electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. \r\nSuch materials, which include some liquid crystals and elastomers,\r\ncan be used to develop ultra-fast switches for video display --\r\nbased on electro-optical coupling -- and miniature sensors and\r\nactuators -- based on the electro-mechanical coupling.  One goal\r\nis to determine the conditions that enhance the combined effects\r\nof the soft-elasticity modes of elastomers and their ferroelectric\r\nresponse by application of external electric fields.  In these\r\nstudies the investigators combine mathematical analysis, modeling,\r\ncomputer simulations, physical experiments, and application of the\r\nthree-dimensional visualization techniques.  These mathematical\r\nproblems are analytically modeled by highly nonlinear elliptic,\r\nparabolic, mixed hyperbolic-parabolic and stochastic systems of\r\npartial differential equations, including the equations of\r\nnonlinear elasticity, viscoelastic flow, and Maxwell's equations\r\nof electrodynamics.  Partial differential equation methods for\r\nphase transitions, modeling, and numerical tools such as spectral\r\nmethods and adaptivity to simulate the solutions are among the\r\ntechniques employed. \r\n\r\n     The project is a comprehensive effort towards modeling and\r\ndevelopment of soft matter actuator and sensor devices used in a\r\nvast array of applications, including ultra-fast optic and video\r\nswitching, artificial muscles, biological membranes, and\r\nfilaments.  Increase of switching speeds and size reduction of the\r\ndevice are two relevant technological goals at the heart of the\r\ninvestigation.  One type of materials to investigate, liquid\r\ncrystal elastomers, can be thought of as rubber networks that\r\nrequire very little energy to be deformed along special\r\ndirections.  This property, coupled with the efficient response of\r\nthe material to electric fields, may offer optimal ingredients for\r\ndeveloping high speed devices able to provide very large\r\nmechanical deformations with the application of electric or\r\nmagnetic fields of small magnitude.  These are highly desirable\r\nproperties, for instance, in the design of artificial muscles for\r\nrobots.  The investigators carry out the studies by combining\r\nmathematical analysis, computer simulations, and physical\r\nexperiments.  Use of three-dimensional visualization techniques is\r\nimportant in both conducting the work and disseminating the\r\nresults.  Many of the problems present modeling challenges that\r\ncall for a synergistic effort of mathematicians and physicists.  A\r\ncentral principle in this endeavor is close cross-disciplinary\r\ninteraction among the applied and numerical analysts and the\r\nphysicists of the group.  A major component of the project is the\r\ninterdisciplinary training of post-docs and graduate students,\r\nincluding the organization of a summer school, development of new\r\ncourses, and summer research opportunities for undergraduate\r\nstudents.  Interdisciplinary conferences, group workshops, and\r\nseminars devoted to the FRG project at each institution are also\r\nplanned.",
