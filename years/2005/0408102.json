 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to have the PI participate in the development of a novel data assimilation system that will be applied to numerical global weather prediction models at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).   With colleagues at the University of Maryland, the PI has implemented a preliminary version of a data assimilation scheme that applies the Kalman filter to a sequence of local regions.  In this project, the PI will spend 11 months in residence as a full-time visiting faculty member in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Maryland at College Park, where he will study atmospheric science and satellite data analysis. This visit will allow him to apply his existing skills in dynamical systems, high performance computing, and data analysis to make substantive contributions to the data assimilation project.   The PI expects to develop a graduate course in data assimilation as part of the ongoing development of a graduate Certificate in Atmospheric Sciences. The latter program is an interdisciplinary collaboration between the departments of mathematics, mechanical and aerospace engineering, chemistry, geography, and physics at ASU.\r\n\r\nThis IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).\r\n",
