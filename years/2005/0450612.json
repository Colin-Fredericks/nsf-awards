 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a robust, generic, front-end,  bio-sampler that when combined with either a wet or dry biological detector, will result in more accurate and rapid detection of hazardous airborne biological agents.  While most current systems require samples to be delivered in a fluid for analysis, emerging dry detection technologies facilitate near-real time detection, reduce sampling errors and allow for unattended operation.  The prototype bio-sampler developed in Phase I demonstrated very high efficiency in the dry collection mode.  This Phase II project has the following objectives:  (a) to optimize sampling performance for particles at the low end of the range (<2 micron), (b) to maintain high bio-viability of collected organisms, (c) to function efficiently in the wet or the dry mode, (d) to demonstrate self-cleaning / decontamination features, (e) to evaluate scalability to larger air volumes and, finally, (f) to demonstrate enhanced overall performance in an integrated biological detection system.  \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will be in the area of homeland security and public safety. The proposed technology will enhance the performance of both the detection systems that are presently deployed and that of the advanced biological detectors that are currently under development.  Additional applications will be in the monitoring of the environment and of industrial air quality.\r\n\r\n",
