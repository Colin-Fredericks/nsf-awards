 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to further the understanding of the\r\nrelation between vertex algebras and the geometry of manifolds.\r\nThis relation, discovered relatively recently, is an infinite\r\ndimensional version of the classical relation between theoretical\r\nphysics and mathematics. Indeed, quantum mechanics of a particle\r\non a manifold is a part of analysis on manifolds. Similarly,\r\nsuper-symmetric  quantum mechanics is essentially equivalent to\r\nthe study of the de Rham complex on manifolds. Attempts to carry\r\nthis over to the case of the space of loops on a manifold have\r\ncreated an entirely new Universe of mathematical and physical\r\nconcepts. One such concept, vertex algebra, a child of string\r\ntheory and infinite dimensional representation theory, has already\r\nproved indispensable in areas as remote form mathematical physics\r\nas abstract finite group theory. Relatively recently, thanks to\r\nwork of Gorbounov and Malikov among others, vertex algebras have\r\nbeen fruitfully applied to several chapters of geometry including\r\nelliptic genus and mirror symmetry.\r\n\r\nString theory, a part of quantum field theory and the only\r\nexisting candidate for the \"theory of everything\", while having\r\nnot yet achieved its ultimate goal, has enriched modern\r\nmathematics and physics with a dazzling array of new concepts and\r\nnew relations among old concepts. Vertex algebra, a concept that\r\nsimultaneously generalizes the notions of Lie and commutative\r\nalgebra, is one conspicuous example. It has long since found\r\napplications in areas as old and diverse as representation theory,\r\ngroup theory, combinatorics, and number theory. The present\r\nproject is devoted to the exploration of a recently discovered\r\nrelation to geometry of higher dimensional spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
