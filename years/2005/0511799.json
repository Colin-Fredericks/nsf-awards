 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2005. The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in US science. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Exploring establishment of gene silencing using comparative genomics in yeast.\"  Silencing is a mechanism of gene reglation that is  capable of reversibly inactivating regions of chromosomes for several generations.  This research explores the evolution of the silenced state.  The yeast S. cerevisiae contains one SIR1 gene that is required for silencing, while another closely related species contains four SIR1 genes.  These multiple Sir proteins from S. bayanus may represent a division of labor that is consolidated into one protein in S. cerevisae.  \r\n\r\nThe training goals are to prepare for an independent research career that combines genomics, genetics, and molecular and biochemical methods. \r\n",
