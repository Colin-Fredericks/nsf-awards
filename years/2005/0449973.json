 "awd_abstract_narration": "Applications throughout computational science require the solution\r\nof large-scale linear systems and eigenvalue problems, tasks that\r\nare often accomplished using Krylov subspace projection methods.\r\nNonsymmetric matrices pose a particular challenge, with accurate \r\nsolutions often requiring a combination of restarted iterations \r\nand effective preconditioning.  This project seeks to develop an \r\nimproved understanding of the convergence of restarted Krylov \r\nsubspace algorithms for linear systems and eigenvalue problems.  \r\nThe behavior of such methods depends not only upon the eigenvalues \r\nof the matrices involved, but also on nonnormality and properties \r\nof starting vectors.  These latter issues complicate analysis and \r\ncan lead to algorithm failure; new insight into the mechanisms \r\nthat spawn such failure will inform the design of improved \r\nrestarted methods.  The project will also consider the important \r\nrole of preconditioners.  Projection methods for dimension reduction \r\nof large-scale problems raise related concerns.  Reduced-order models \r\nmay capture salient eigenvalues of the original system, yet miss \r\nimportant transient features of the solution that are of physical \r\nsignificance, especially if the model derives from a nonlinear system.   \r\nThroughout this project test cases will be drawn from applications\r\nsuch as fluid dynamics.\r\n\r\nLarge-scale linear algebra problems play a central role in many areas\r\nof computational science and engineering, with applications ranging \r\nfrom fluid dynamics and circuit simulation to neuroscience and data \r\nmining.  Though the efficient solution of such problems is essential to \r\nhigh-fidelity mathematical modeling and the nation's fastest computers \r\ndevote many cycles to this challenge, several of the most important \r\nalgorithms are unreliable and not yet understood.  This project seeks \r\nanswers to fundamental questions concerning the behavior of such methods, \r\nwith the goal of gaining insights that will lead to more rapid and \r\nreliable algorithms.  Given the many fields that rely on these \r\ntechniques, such improvements will have broad application \r\nthroughout the scientific computing community.  To complement the \r\nresearch program, this project includes an important educational \r\ncomponent comprising the mentorship of graduate and undergraduate \r\nstudents, the development of a graduate course, and the broad public \r\ndissemination of educational material for numerical analysis, a core \r\ndiscipline for students preparing for careers in computational science \r\nand engineering.",
