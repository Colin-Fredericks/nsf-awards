 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is to develop two innovative nano-stereo lithography (nSL) techniques: two-photon nSL and near-field nSL with the resolution down to 50nm. Both methods promise 3D nanofabrications with computer-aided design/modeling capabilities. Preliminary numerical simulations suggest that a spatial resolution down to 60 nm can be achieved with near-field nSL. Techniques, such as electrical force controlled nano stereo lithography, will be investigated and employed to further enhance lithography resolutions. Through this project, not only novel nSL processes will be developed, but intriguing fundamental mechanisms of nano-stereo-lithography will also be studied to intensify our understanding on fundamental science on molecular-scale photon-material interactions, for instance self-focusing, radical diffusion, thermal transport and viscous effects, and their influences on the resolution. Upon the success of the development of proposed nSL techniques, a set of specific nano devices will be designed and fabricated. \r\n\r\nViable three dimensional nanomanufacturing technologies and its applications developed in this project will have important impacts in human society from biomedical diagnostics to optical communications. The research outcome will also benefit the emerging high technology industries in United States in competition with foreign countries. Another important aspect of this proposed project is the integration of research and edcuation through summer undergraduate research. Armed with solid knowledgements, state-of-art techniques and innovative ideas, students, especially minority and women students will be ready to serve industry needs in the nanomanufacturing arena. \r\n\r\n",
