 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to optimize and commercialize the manufacturing of all natural biobased composites from renewable resources. Phase I research demonstrated the technical feasibility of fabricating soybean oil based composites using a selected fiber/resin polymer composite combination.  The Phase II project will focus on optimization and scale-up of the fabrication approach and process to improve the performance of the biobased composites. Further, with  the help of commercial partners, Phase II work will develop a number of  full scale prototype products with the following features: (1) the products contain 80% or more natural fibers and resins; (2) the products rely on economical and environmentally friendly tooling and manufacturing processing; and (3) the products comply with performance, safety, durability, and cost requirements set by end-users.\r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project will be in a number of areas, including low cost building materials for industrial and household furniture, packaging materials, piping for remote areas and aquaculture systems. The proposed biobased composites are expected to have  higher value-in-use industrial applications than their petroleum counter-parts (that is, to be available at a lower cost while offering the same functionality).\r\n",
