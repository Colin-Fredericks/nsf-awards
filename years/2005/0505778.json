Topics in symplectic geometry aim to both apply and\r\nextend the ideas and theorems of the Symplectic Field Theory as\r\ndeveloped by Eliashberg, Givental and Hofer. The main application\r\nso far is to the classification up to Hamiltonian diffeomorphism\r\nof Lagrangian spheres in symplectic 4-manifolds, there is ongoing\r\nwork aimed at establishing similar results for higher genus\r\nsurfaces. In symplectic topology such classification results at\r\npresent only exist in dimension 4. Nevertheless the proposal will\r\nalso strive to increase our understanding of higher dimensions.\r\nOne route to such an understanding is provided by work of\r\nDonaldson showing that, after a blowing-up operation, every\r\nintegral symplectic 6-manifold can be realized as a Lefschetz\r\nfibration in which the fibers are symplectic 4-manifolds and the\r\nvanishing cycles Lagrangian spheres. Regarding the underlying\r\ntheory, Symplectic Field Theory allows us to split a symplectic\r\nmanifold along a hypersurface and apply holomorphic curve methods\r\nto study each part separately. This is a very powerful idea, the\r\nresults above rely heavily upon it, but it is fundamentally\r\nlimited in that it may not be possible to split a symplectic\r\nmanifold along such hypersurfaces into pieces which are\r\nsufficiently small to be completely understood. Therefore the\r\nproposal will also work to generalize the Symplectic Field Theory\r\nto allow more general splittings, for example along hypersurfaces\r\nwith corners. In complex geometry the proposal plans to continue\r\nwork of Burns and Hind studying complex manifolds canonically\r\nassociated to real analytic Riemannian manifolds, focussing\r\nespecially on the case when the Riemannian manifold is a\r\nsymmetric space of the noncompact type. Then we have a class of\r\ncomplex manifolds which gives a nice generalization of the\r\nclassical bounded symmetric domains.\r\n\r\nSymplectic geometry originated as the modern mathematical\r\nlanguage of classical and quantum mechanics. This proposal will\r\naddress basic mathematical problems in the area, in particular it\r\nwill apply and extend the powerful new techniques known as\r\nSymplectic Field Theory. The Symplectic Field Theory is an\r\nexciting new development which promises to help us move rapidly\r\ntowards our goal of describing the global nature of symplectic\r\nmanifolds and Hamiltonian systems. As the problems are global in\r\nnature often they initially appear intractible, but the new\r\nmethods offer the prospect of breaking down our analysis into\r\nmore manageable local pieces. Eventually it should be possible to\r\ndevelop algorithms to solve typical problems in symplectic\r\ngeometry. This will have immediate applications to theoretical\r\nphysics and dynamical systems.\r\n",
