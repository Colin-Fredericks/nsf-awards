 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to harness the special resources at Stony\r\nBrook to train students and post-docs in geometry and its\r\ninteraction with mathematical physics. The plan involves a\r\nradical shift from standard curricula and should be broadly\r\nappealing to young people who are considering the possibility of a\r\ncareer in mathematics.\r\n\r\nStony Brook has a large, highly active (and interactive) group\r\nof geometers representing  nearly all aspects of the field\r\nfrom algebraic geometry to string topology.\r\nA substantial part of the research of this group is related to and/or\r\ninspired by modern physics, and there is a long tradition of\r\ninteraction between Stony Brook's mathematicians and physicists. This is\r\nrepresented in collaborations, seminars,  joint students, and\r\nconferences, as well as two major programs in mathematics and\r\nphysics, funded  outside the NSF.  This is a proposal to use these\r\nresources in new, effective ways for the training of young researchers.\r\n\r\nThe proposal aims at: (1) incorporating the high-level seminars and\r\nworkshops into the training of students at an early point by close\r\nmentoring, (2) bringing students more quickly and effectively to the\r\nresearch level, (3) training students and post-docs in the dual cultures\r\nof geometry and physics, (4) giving undergraduates a taste of\r\nmathematical research at the interactive level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf successful this could lead to an adoption of new models for\r\nundergraduate development and graduate education.  It should produce\r\nmore effective researchers and therefore lead to better careers\r\nin mathematics. A fundamental outcome would be the attraction of more\r\nU.S. citizens into mathematics in general and these fields in\r\nparticular,  because  this program offers  close personal supervision,\r\n  an interactive and challenging environment   and strong intellectual\r\nappeal.  Another important outcome would be a new generation trained\r\nfrom the beginning in the dual cultures of mathematics and physics.\r\nThis should lead to even greater communication between these fields in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n",
