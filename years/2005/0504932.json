 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI studies automorphism groups and moduli spaces, using techniques \r\nfrom homotopy theory and geometric group theory. The goals of the project \r\nare to determine the homotopy type of the classifying space of the stable \r\nautomorphism group of free groups, to prove homological stability theorems \r\nfor new families of groups, to adapt the tools of Waldhausen's K-theory of \r\nspaces to the mapping class groups and automorphism groups of free groups, \r\nand finally to obtain a better understanding of exotic infinite loop space \r\noperads.\r\n\r\nTo study a large collection of objects, it is useful to classify the \r\nobjects, that is to arrange them into meaningful classes. This is very \r\nmuch like classifying books by subject in a library and corresponds in \r\nmathematics to finding invariants, or common properties of the objects \r\nconsidered. One can consider a finer type of classification which moreover \r\ntakes into account the notion of neighborhood, also called the topology. \r\nSuch a classification remembers which objects or classes of objects are \r\nclosely related to each other. The collection of objects is then \r\nclassified by a topological space, not just by a set. This space is called \r\na moduli space for the objects. It encodes a lot of information about the \r\nobjects. In particular, the symmetries of the objects, also called \r\nautomorphisms, play an important role in the topology of the moduli space. \r\nThe PI studies moduli spaces of geometric objects like graphs, surfaces \r\nand higher dimensional manifolds.\r\n\r\n",
