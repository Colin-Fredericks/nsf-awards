 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the synthesis and crystal growth of new platinum group metal oxides belonging to several different structural families. The synthesis of new materials will be approached from several directions, including solid state reactions for powder synthesis and the use of high temperature solution reactions for crystal growth.  Great strides have been made in the development of new preparative approaches for platinum metal group oxide phases.  These new methods will be applied toward the synthesis of new chemical compositions and help explore the composition-property-space of these oxides.  To accomplish these tasks, undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained in cutting edge synthetic and characterization techniques, such as flux growth of crystals, magnetic measurements on oriented single crystals, and structure determinations of new compounds using state of the art equipment, including high-temperature high-pressure reaction vessels, SQUID magnetometers and CCD based single crystal diffractometers.  \r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nMany important physical properties that enable the functioning of new electronic devices, data storage materials, battery components and superconductors are found in oxide materials containing transition metal elements.  This is a versatile group of chemical compounds that can be selectively modified to exhibit desirable physical properties that will lay the groundwork for new devices and applications of the future.  Advanced methods are being developed for synthesizing oxides containing selected transition metal elements from the platinum group, either as powders or as single crystals, in order to determine the atomic structure of these materials, to investigate their electronic and magnetic properties, and to enable their utilization in a variety of applications.  To accomplish these tasks, undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are being trained in cutting-edge techniques for synthesizing and characterizing these materials using state of the art instrumentation.  The educational aspect of this research assures that highly trained men, women and underrepresented minorities can enter the workforce and meet industry's need for scientists.\r\n\r\n",
