 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator applies various mathematical methods\r\nto extend the range of application of saddlepoint\r\napproximation techniques and exact enumeration techniques\r\nin statistical inference.  These techniques are applied to\r\nmulti-dimensional conditional inference, achieved primarily\r\nby developing new approximations to multivariate tail\r\nprobabilities for some component of a vector of sufficient\r\nstatistics conditional on the remaining components, and\r\nmethods for calculating these tail probabilities exactly.\r\nParticular attention is paid to probability models\r\nwhose sufficient statistics have lattice distributions,\r\nsince standard asymptotic techniques frequently fail\r\nin this context.  These models, including logistic and\r\nPoisson regression and contingency table models, are\r\nvery frequently used in applied biostatistical work.\r\nSpecifically, this research includes the application\r\nof multidimensional saddlepoint approximations to\r\norder--restricted hypotheses.  It extends existing\r\nApproximations applicable to continuous distributions to\r\ngeneral non-lattice distributions.  It develops guidelines\r\nfor tuning approximate conditional inferential methods to\r\nobtain higher power.  Computational algorithms developed\r\nas part of this work are publicly available.\r\n\r\nMany current statistical techniques rely on mathematical approximations;\r\nthe accuracy of these approximations ranges from very good to inadequate.\r\nThis research involves approximations known to be almost always of high\r\naccuracy, and applies them in some statistical contexts that are widely\r\nused by scientists in a variety of disciplines.  This research allows\r\ninvestigators to draw valid conclusions from smaller data sets,\r\nparticularly in cases when important research questions are phrased in terms\r\nof a number of quantities that must be accounted for.  This situation occurs \r\nin a wide range of areas, from finance to political science to medicine.\r\nFor example, a new medical therapy might be expected to lead to improvements,\r\npotentially measured in a number of ways.  The investigator wishes to\r\ndemonstrate that individuals receiving the new therapy at least as well \r\naccording to all of the potential measures, and better on at least one\r\nmeasure, than do patients on the original therapy.  Standard statistical\r\nmethods do not handle such situations in an efficient way; the current\r\nresearch represents a significant improvement.\r\n",
