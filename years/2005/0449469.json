Using non-linear optical methods such as sum frequency generation spectroscopy, interfacial structures and interactions between polymers and model elastomers are evaluated.  Correlation between structural information and adhesion tests determine how segregation, alignment, ordering and bonding of molecules at the interface affect the adhesion interface.  This information will be useful in the rational design of adhesion promoters and polymer systems with a wide range of applications.  This Career award serves as an integrated training ground for multi-disciplinary graduate students and postdocs, and for outreach to middle school and high school science students.\r\n\r\nVibrational spectroscopy using sum-frequency generation methods provides high quality structural information about solid interfaces.  When combined with adhesion testing, this structural information provides a fundamental understanding of adhesion between polymer materials with wide applicability.  Professor Chen and his colleagues at the University of Michigan are studying this important interfacial process with the support of a Career Award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  This research area is an ideal interdisciplinary training ground and vehicle for outreach to young scientists.  \r\n",
