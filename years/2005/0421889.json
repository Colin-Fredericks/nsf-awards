 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transcription and mRNA processing are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, which consists of tandem repeats of a YSPTSPS heptapeptide. Previous studies showed that members of the plant CPL (CTD phosphatase-like) protein family differentially regulate osmotic-stress- and ABA-responsive transcription in Arabidopsis thaliana.  Among the CPL genes identified in the Arabidopsis genome, CPL1 and CPL2 represent a novel CTD phosphatase, which exhibits unique position specificity for phosphorylated Ser 5 in the CTD repeat, and contains double-stranded RNA binding domains.  This project aims to identify the molecular network that regulates stress-responsive transcription through CTD phosphorylation.  The in vivo function of each domain of CPL1 will be determined by expressing mutagenized CPL1 in a CPL1 null mutant strain (fry2-1).  Proteins interacting with CPL1 (CIF: CPL-interacting factor) will be identified using the yeast two-hybrid system, and will be further characterized by testing genetic interactions of cpl and cif mutant alleles.  Functionality of CPL-CIF interaction during stress response will be analyzed by testing physiological stress responses, as well by analyzing stress-inducible transcriptional activation.  Through the project, junior scientists (postdocs, graduate/undergraduate students) will be trained for integrated studies of core transcriptional machinery using molecular genetic and biochemical strategies.  The data/materials/mutants generated by the project will be deposited in the public domain as they become available.",
