 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic Geometry Summer Institute (Proposal DMS-0456683.)\r\n\r\nA large scale summer institute in algebraic geometry, three weeks in\r\nduration, will be held during July-August 2005 at the University of\r\nWashington, Seattle. Organizational support will be provided by the\r\nAmerican Mathematical Society and the Clay Mathematics Institute. Each\r\nweek will have a general topic as a focus and at the same time will\r\ninclude a component of core \"classical\" algebraic geometry. The foci \r\nwill be: Mathematical Physics in Algebraic Geometry; Combinatorics, \r\nCommutative Algebra and Classical Algebraic Geometry; and Arithmetic Algebraic\r\nGeometry. Three plenary morning lecture series will be held in each \r\nweek, lecturers having been selected as leading researchers who are at the \r\nsame time exemplary expositors. In addition, leading specialists will be\r\ninvited to serve as seminar leaders, and will select high impact \r\nlectures given by the best lecturers for afternoon seminars.  Additional \r\nactivities will include the CMI distinguished lectures and an evening graduate\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry, the study of geometric shapes defined by polynomial\r\nequations, is a vast generalization of the high-school topic \"analytic\r\ngeometry\". It has enjoyed much cross-fertilization in past decades with\r\nareas in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, computing and \r\ntheoretical physics. One way American algebraic geometers have maintained the \r\nvibrancy of the field is by holding a large scale, NSF-funded summer institute\r\nabout every decade, an institute which aims to bring participants up to\r\nthe forefront of research in the salient direction the field has taken \r\nin the previous years, and to project directions which the field is \r\nexpected to take in the following years. These institutes have had a crucial\r\nformative role on the subject, with enormous impact especially on the\r\nemerging careers of young researchers. This summer institute project \r\naims to follow in their footsteps.\r\n\r\n",
