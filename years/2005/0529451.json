A typical drive train includes an actuator (electrical motor), a set of gears, bearings and an inertia load (link), which may be connected to another drive train or an end effecter. The technical objectives of the research are to 1) study sensing of various signals in the drive train, in particular, those not utilized in conventional practice such as acceleration signals, force signal in the drive train and end effector's position, 2) develop signal processing and decision making algorithms that take advantages of the sensed signals for betterment of performance and other mechatonic advantages, and 3) demonstrate these benefits experimentally. New signal processing and decision making algorithms will handle nonlinearities and uncertainties in drive train mechanisms as well as the environment in which drive trains and entire mechanical systems operate.  This will bring advantages to both producers and end users of mechanical systems, e.g. robots, assembly machines and other manufacturing equipment.  The broader impacts will be from education, outreach and international collaboration.  The project team includes the Principal Investigator, graduate student researchers and undergraduate researchers. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project through participation in experiments and mechatronics design.  \r\n\r\nThis is a sensor award under the solicitation NSF 05-526.\r\n",
