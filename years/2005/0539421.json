Landsberg\r\nTitle: Geometric applications of exterior differential systems\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nDr. Landsberg will work on two projects: the dual defect conjecture\r\nand the classification of Legendrian varieties and contact Fano manifolds.\r\nThe second project originates with a question in differential geometry,\r\nthe classification of compact quaternionic-Kahler manifolds, which, thanks \r\nto work of LeBrun and Salamon, is essentially equivalent to the \r\nclassification of contact Fano manifolds. Inside the tangent space of a \r\ngeneral point of  a contact Fano manifold is an immersed Legendrian \r\nvariety and knowledge about such varieties is important for the contact \r\nFano problem. The Salamon conjecture is that all contact Fano manifolds\r\nare homogeneous.  \r\nThe first project is to show that the dual variety of a \r\nsmooth variety of codimension less than half its dimension is a \r\nhypersurface. This question is of importance in algebgraic geometry as \r\npart of the investigations motivated by Hartshornes's conjecture on complete \r\nintersections. The techniques that will be developed to solve this \r\nproblem are  as important as the problem iself- a combination of exterior \r\ndifferential systems and representation theory  that will be useful for \r\nother problems in geometry and other areas of science such as \r\ncomputational complexity and algebraic statistics (Baysean networks).\r\n\r\nDr. Landsberg will use techniques from partial differential equations\r\n(more precisely, exterior differential systems) and representation\r\ntheory (of simple Lie algebras) to study two problems in geometry\r\nrelated respectively  to dual varieties and contact Fano manifolds. In \r\naddition to the importance of these questions to the mathematical \r\ncommunity, the techniques that will be developed will be applicable to \r\nproblems in other fields such as computational complexity and algebraic \r\nstatistics (Baysean networks).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
