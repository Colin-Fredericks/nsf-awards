In combination with Teichmuller theory, cone\r\nmetrics have been applied to existence and classification problems of\r\nmimimal surfaces. Noded surfaces are natural limits of  Riemann\r\nsurfaces under conformal pinching of curves. They have been used to\r\nconstruct families of minimal surfaces that degenerate to a suitable\r\nnoded limit, using the implicit function theorem. We aim for a\r\ndescription of the noded limits of minimal surfaces as geometric\r\nlimits of flat cone metrics. This adds a third type of limit to the\r\nformerly considered geometric and conformal limits. The conformal\r\nlimits ignore the minimal surface information and consider only the\r\nRiemann surface limit, while the geometric limit retain the minimal\r\nsurface nature but loose conformal and topological information by\r\nrescaling the surfaces in space. The new cone metric limit will\r\nincorporate both types of information. We hope that this description\r\nwill lead to new examples and classification results. This research\r\nwill be backed by numerical and graphical experiments based on a\r\nminimal surface library currently under development.\r\n\r\nMinimal surfaces are mathematical abstractions of 2-dimensional shapes\r\nthat arise at different scales in nature: We are all familiar with\r\nsoap film experiments, but such surfaces also have been observed at\r\nthe nano scale as interfaces between block copolymers. Their\r\nmathematical properties are important for understanding the physical\r\nnature of new fabrics. The physical goal to minimize surface tension\r\ntranslates into a mathematical equation which has been of interest for\r\nover 250 years: The minimal surface equation is just at the border\r\nbetween what we understand by general theory and what we only can\r\nanalyze numerically. Any advance at this point will most likely have\r\nits effects on other equations from mathematical physics and\r\nengineering. The methods which are being used to investigate  minimal\r\nsurfaces range from geometric analysis to numerical mathematics.\r\nRecent theoretical advances from partial differential equations and\r\nTeichmuller theory allow us to study 'extreme' minimal surfaces which\r\ncomparable to soap films that nearly break under deformations.\r\nUnderstanding these extreme surfaces not only helps us to analyze the\r\nexamples we have by breaking them apart into simpler pieces but also\r\nallows the construction of exciting new surfaces by putting suitable\r\npieces together. The computer experiments we conduct require elaborate\r\nsymbolic manipulations of the formulas involved, high-precision\r\nnumerical computations to get accurate 3-dimensional surface data, and\r\nhigh performance computer graphics to visualize the actual surfaces.\r\n",
