 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kapranov proposes to study infinite-dimensional spaces such as spaces of paths\r\nby using algebro-geometric techniques. The traditional analytic approach to such\r\nspaces leads to many difficulties. The algebro-geometric approach has the\r\nadvantage of bypassing these difficulties and at the same time preserving  and\r\nin fact emphasizing the main conceptual results of the study. He proposes to\r\ndevelop an approach to Floer cohomology based on the algebro-geometric\r\n concept of an ind-scheme. In fact, the very definition of an ind-scheme (known for\r\nsome time) is not far removed from Floer's ideas about cycles of  ``semi-infinite\"\r\ndimension. Kapranov proposes to apply this approach to various spaces of\r\nformal paths and loops in finite-dimensional varieties. Among other things, he\r\nproposes to understand the elliptic cohomology theory by using these spaces,\r\nin particular to relate the elliptic cohomology and the derived category of\r\ncoherent sheaves, two objects of recent interest.\r\nBy studying various \"anomalies\" on such infinite-dimensional spaces, Kapranov\r\nproposes to prove a new Riemann-Roch type theorem involving  families of\r\nreal, not complex varieties. \r\n\r\nThe motivation for study of infinite-dimensional spaces comes from physics\r\n(string theory) where the fundamental object is not a punctual particle but \r\na string propagating in the space-time. The number of degrees of freedom of\r\nsuch a string is clearly infinite.  But working with infinite-dimensional spaces\r\nis difficult. The usual problems of convergence familiar from multivariable calculus become\r\nin many cases overwhelming when the number of variables becomes infinite. \r\nThe algebraic approach proposed by Kapranov\r\ncan capture the essense of many problems while maintaining the mathematical rigor and\r\nthus preventing one from making mistakes. One example of such a problem is the\r\ndeterminantal anomaly: determinants of infinite matrices do not behave as expected\r\nfrom the finite-dimensional case but obey different rules.\r\n This leads to a wealth of consequences for\r\nthe topology and geometry of infinite-dimensional spaces. The algebraic approach\r\nallows one to arrive at and generalize  these consequences while minimizing the\r\nconsiderable effort needed to even define the infinite determinants. \r\n",
