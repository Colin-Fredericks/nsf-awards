 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAbstract: Nonparametric location and scatter functionals\r\n\r\nGiven n independent observations, each with distribution P, one\r\ncan form an empirical measure by taking the average of point masses\r\nat the observations. For a functional T  of P, evaluating T at the\r\nempirical measure gives an estimator of T(P) which will converge\r\nto it almost surely if T is suitably continuous at P. The project \r\nwill continue a search for functionals continuous at as many P's as \r\npossible, which may be all P in one dimension, but in higher \r\ndimensions an open dense set. Then if T is also differentiable at \r\nP in a sufficient sense, the estimators will be asymptotically\r\nnormal and converge to T(P) at a rate of 1 over square root of n.\r\nFunctionals of location include the mean mu when it is finite. \r\nIn one dimension, another location functional is the median m,  \r\nand scale functionals include the standard deviation sigma and \r\nmedian absolute deviation. The classical mu and sigma can be \r\nundefined or infinite at laws decreasing too slowly at infinity. \r\nFor some laws P there is an interval of medians, whose midpoint \r\ngives a unique choice of m, but m is discontinuous at such P. \r\nSimultaneous maximum likelihood estimation of location and scale \r\nfor t distributions with degrees of freedom nu larger than 1 extends \r\nto location and scale functionals defined and continuous at every \r\nprobability distribution on the line, and infinitely differentiable \r\nat distributions having no atom as large as nu over nu plus one.\r\nOn multidimensional spaces, the square of a scale parameter\r\nis replaced by a scatter matrix analogous to a covariance\r\nmatrix, and the continuity and differentiability will be sought on\r\na dense open set of distributions, via t functionals and by other\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nLocation and scale or scatter functionals are some of the most basic \r\nin statistics. But by far the two best known functionals of location, \r\nthe mean and median, each have serious drawbacks. Using the mean, one\r\nassumes in effect that all data are correct. The mean can be overly \r\ninfluenced by outlying, extreme observations such as gross errors. \r\nUsing the median, on the other hand, guards against the possibility\r\nthat nearly half the data may be incorrect. If a distribution \r\nhas more than half its probability in an interval, the median must be \r\nin that interval and may very poorly represent the rest of the distribution. \r\nFunctionals combining some of the advantages of the mean and median while\r\navoiding the worst drawbacks of either can and should be more widely studied \r\nand used. Then one can have kinds of averages that guard against a more\r\nrealistic possibility that some small fraction of the data may be\r\nincorrect.\r\n",
