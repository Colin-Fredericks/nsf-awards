 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is estimated that by the year 2010 more than 10 billion wireless sensors will be deployed for use in applications as diverse as environmental monitoring, surveillance, and medical monitoring.  For these sensor networks to last for years unattended, it is vital to make them energy-efficient while ensuring they provide the data necessary to meet application needs.  While much research has focused on the design of individual protocols to meet these goals, much less attention has been paid to the optimization of network operation at the system level.  One such approach is a cross-layer system design that integrates many of the protocol functions into a high level sensor management protocol that assigns roles to each sensor; these roles include sensing the environment, routing other sensors' data, fusing the data locally, and controlling neighboring nodes.  This project develops models that allow for global optimization of sensor management, and it develops distributed techniques that jointly optimize the use of sensor and network resources in all possible roles.  The optimization models highlight the potential limitations of existing techniques, the distributed architecture provides a feasible solution for long lifetime sensor networks, and a sensor network testbed implementation shows the efficacy of this cross-layer architecture for real systems.  The potential of this research for high societal impact combined with the innovative techniques being employed provide ample opportunities for attracting students, from junior high school up through graduate school, to the field and for training the next generation of engineers in this exciting area.",

However, such networks, which consist of battery-powered devices, require extremely energy-efficient operation while simultaneously meeting the requirements of the application. My research in this project focused on transforming the use of wireless sensor networks through the design of protocols, architectures, and middleware that provide users with the desired quality of service while efficiently utilizing available resources.\n\nIn order to support the important applications of wireless sensor networks, my research has intensively focused efforts on squeezing every possible bit of use out of the limited energy supplied by the batteries of the sensors.  To do this, we must first determine what is really important to the application (and hence the user), and then ensure that energy is not wasted on any tasks that are not necessary to support the needs of the application.  Additionally, we must learn when there are changes to the network or to the application goals and adapt the network behavior accordingly.  We accomplish these goals using the following innovative approaches:\n\nresource-aware decision-making processes, a novel approach that considers the importance of individual devices when making role assignment decisions, in order to conserve the energy of critical devices;\ncross-layer architectures to provide information about network conditions and application requirements to the protocols;\nadaptation of the protocols to alter network behavior when there are changes in application requirements and/or the network itself; and\ncross-layer optimization techniques to determine how best to use resources in the device to support functions such as sensing, processing, and communication. \n\n\nTogether, the approaches developed in this research provide innovative tools for determining how best to use limited resources while providing the required network services to run the application. Using analytic models together with large-scale simulations, we were able to optimize the use of these techniques to ensure long lifetimes for these emerging networks, which are sure to become a vital part of our information infrastructure in the near future.\n\nAdditionally, this project has impacted the education of both graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Rochester.  Specifically, this research supported the thesis work of six Ph.D. students, one master\u00c6s student, and four undergraduate students, several of whom were from traditionally under-represented groups.
