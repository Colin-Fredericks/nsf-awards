 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to create two professional development courses, with both on-site and online versions to build capacity of middle school teachers of mathematics and special educators and their administrators to enable students with disabilities to be successful mathematics learners. During the five years of the project, one eight-session course for classroom teachers and their special education colleagues and a six-session course for school administrators will be developed, tested and disseminated.  Training Institutes for course facilitators will be developed to prepare cohorts of facilitators to teach these courses locally and nationally and to receive ongoing support through a Facilitaros online learning community.  A dissemination strategy is planned with an anticipated target of 6,000 teachers and an initial cadre of 172 facilitators.",
