 "awd_abstract_narration": "Member institutions of the Alliance for the Production of African American \r\nPh.D.s in the Mathematical Sciences. (APAAPMS) will carry out several \r\nprojects which will lead to an increase in the number of African Americans \r\nwho enroll in doctoral programs in the mathematical sciences as well as an \r\nincrease in the number of these students who obtain the Ph.D.  The Alliance, \r\nwhich consists of mathematics departments at four Historically Black \r\nColleges and Universities (HBCUs) together with departments in the \r\nmathematical sciences at the three Iowa Regents universities, will expand \r\nactivities that they are presently undertaking in this area.  The first of \r\nthese projects, the Alliance Scholar's Program, identifies eight students at \r\neach participating Alliance HBCU and provides these students with close \r\nmentoring by teams consisting of HBCU and Iowa Regents mathematics faculty. \r\nA second project, the Alliance Summer Research Experience, provides an eight \r\nweek intensive research experience for Alliance Scholars as well as for \r\nselected undergraduate mathematics majors from other institutions.  A third \r\nproject, the Alliance Curriculum Project, provides for a careful analysis of \r\nthe similarities and differences of undergraduate mathematics courses taught \r\nat participating institutions with an eye toward building seamless \r\ntransitions between undergraduate mathematics programs at Alliance HBCUs and \r\ndoctoral programs at majority institutions.  A fourth project, the Alliance \r\nHigh School Math Circle, involves Alliance Scholars in outreach activities \r\nin the communities in which their schools are located.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) enroll approximately \r\n20% of all African Americans who attend four year undergraduate \r\ninstitutions; they account for approximately 30% of all African Americans \r\nwho graduate from these institutions.  Yet, with the exception of three or \r\nfour elite HBCUs with an established tradition of excellence, it is \r\nextremely rare for graduates of HBCUs to enroll in doctoral programs in the \r\nmathematical sciences or, indeed, in any doctoral program which leads to a \r\nposition in the professoriate.  The reason for this is not hard to \r\nascertain: in fact, with few exceptions, African Americans were simply not \r\nwelcome among the ranks of the professoriate until quite recently.  As a \r\nresult, HBCUs have tended to focus on producing professionals - doctors, \r\nlawyers, teachers and religious leaders who have historically provided \r\ncritical infrastructure to a community at risk due to segregation and overt \r\ndiscrimination.   Less than 2% of all Ph.D. in mathematics awarded at US \r\nuniversities each year are awarded to African Americans, a percentage that \r\nhas remained more or less stable over the last twenty five years.  It is the \r\ngoal of this project to ease the transition to graduate programs in \r\nmathematics for students attending HBCUs with an eye toward improving these \r\nnumbers.\r\n",
