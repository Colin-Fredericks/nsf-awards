 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study will address two problems in solid Earth dynamics: \r\n(I) How to reconcile the geochemical distinctions between mid-ocean \r\nridge basalts (MORBs) and hotspot ocean island basalts (OIBs) which \r\nare widely interpreted in terms of a chemically layered mantle, with \r\ngeophysical evidence for whole mantle (i.e., single layer) \r\nconvection.  (II) Determining the origin of the geographic variations \r\nin lava geochemistry observed at hotspots.  The hypothesis is that \r\nvariations in melting and ductile flow of a compositionally \r\nheterogeneous mantle cause many of the key geochemical \r\ncharacteristics of OIBs and MORBs. This hypothesis will be tested \r\nusing numerical models that simulate the three-dimensional viscous \r\nflow, heat transport, and melting in the upper mantle. Models will be \r\nconstructed based on the assumption that hotspots are formed by \r\nbuoyant upwellings, or mantle plumes, interacting with the base of \r\nthe lithosphere. The melting calculations will incorporate laboratory \r\nexperimental data on the pressure-temperature conditions for melting \r\nof materials with different compositions. Computational results will \r\nquantify the relationships between specific physical conditions and \r\npredicted geographic variability of trace-element and Sr, Nd, Pb, and \r\nHe isotope geochemistry in erupted magmas at three tectonic scenarios \r\nwhere adequate data sets exist for comparisons:  an intraplate \r\nhotspot (Hawaii), a hotspot centered on a mid-ocean ridge (Iceland), \r\nand a hotspot off of, but near a mid-ocean ridge (Galapagos). \r\nProblem (I) will be addressed by determining whether models do or do \r\nnot require mantle plumes--which could come from the lower mantle--to \r\nbe compositionally distinct from the upper mantle.  Problem (II) will \r\nbe addressed by determining the physical conditions needed to explain \r\nthe nature of spatial geochemical variability observed at the above \r\ntypes of hotspots.  The origin of hotspot islands and the question of \r\nwhole- versus two-layer mantle convection are of broad scientific \r\ninterest, as evidenced by their treatment in high school and college \r\ntextbooks.  The investigators have given, and will continue giving, \r\nlectures and extracurricular seminars on these topics to local high \r\nschool and undergraduate students. Most of the requested budget will \r\nsupport a Ph. D. student, providing funds needed for a comprehensive, \r\ncross-disciplinary dissertation. \r\n",
