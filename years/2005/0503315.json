The specific objectives are:\r\no To prepare bone-like carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA)/ fibrous polymer composites with\r\nYoung's modulus and mechanical strength matching that of cortical bone using novel\r\npolymer-braid constructions.\r\no To obtain excellent biocompatibility and osteoconductivity of the composite by biomimetic\r\nformation of bone-like CHA on the surface of polymer fibers.\r\no To explore the possibility of using the novel constructions proposed in the study as a more\r\nsophisticated drug delivery system.\r\no To understand the interrelationship between the composite mechanical properties and the\r\nfiber composition, fiber surface modification, formation of trans-crystallinity, and CHA\r\nloading by conducting systematic experimental work and comparing the data with the\r\npredictions of theory.\r\no To gain an in-depth knowledge of the effect of the composite composition, construction,\r\nand geometry on the bone formation rate on the composite using a series of cell culture\r\nassays.\r\n",
