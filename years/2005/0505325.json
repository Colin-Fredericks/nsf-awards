 "awd_abstract_narration": "M. Gross plans to study the geometry of mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau\r\nmanifolds. This will be done from the perspective of an algebro-geometric\r\nversion of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture introduced by M. Gross\r\nand B. Siebert. Associated to certain sorts of large complex structure limit\r\ndegenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds one can define a dual intersection\r\ncomplex, which is an affine manifold with singularities. Conversely,\r\ngiven an affine manifold with singularities, it is possible to build\r\nthe degenerate fibre of such a degeneration, along with the structure\r\nof a log scheme. Gross first plans to complete\r\nthe correspondence between affine manifolds with singularities\r\nand large complex structure limit degenerations of Calabi-Yau varieties\r\nby showing that these log schemes can be smoothed. Furthermore, Gross\r\nplans to compute invariants of these smoothings in terms of structures\r\non the affine manifolds. One expects Hodge numbers, and more importantly,\r\nvariations of Hodge structure, can be calculated directly from computations\r\non the affine manifold. The ultimate goal will be to compare these results \r\nwith calculations of Gromov-Witten invariants for the mirror, thereby\r\neventually providing an explanation for mirror symmetry.\r\n\r\nThe work proposed by M. Gross lies at the intersection of string theory\r\nand geometry. String theory replaces the traditional notion of \r\nthe point particle with a small loop of string, moving through space-time.\r\nTo make string theory compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must\r\nbe ten-dimensional. Since space-time appears four-dimensional, one expects \r\nsix of these dimensions to be a very small `curled up' geometric object. \r\nThese geometric objects are called Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the early\r\n1990s, string theorists proposed a remarkable association between\r\ncompletely different Calabi-Yau manifolds: certain calculations extremely\r\ndifficult to perform on one Calabi-Yau manifold could be completed\r\nby performing completely different, and much easier, calculations on\r\na different Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as mirror symmetry.\r\nSince this time, many geometers have been trying to understand \r\nthe mathematics behind this miraculous observation. The work of M. Gross\r\nhopes to give mathematical insight and explanation for the phenomenon\r\nof mirror symmetry.\r\n",
