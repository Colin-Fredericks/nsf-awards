 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis integrative systems proposal focuses on the optimized design of focal-plane arrays in the 100-300GHz range, with an integrated design methodology of hardware and image processing. \r\nIntellectual merit of the proposal: In many applications of sub-millimeter and millimeter-wave imaging it is critical to acquire high-resolution images in real-time, and remove noise and distortions. New nonuniform sampling of the focal surface coupled with efficient image reconstruction algorithms will be investigated. Dual-polarization antennas coupled with optimized image processing algorithms will be designed. Noise removal and deconvolution algorithms specific to the limitations of FPAs will be studied.\r\nMethods for designing low-loss quasi-optical components tailored to FPAs will be investigated. Antenna aperture efficiency will be improved using microlens-coupled antennas. Dual polarized antenna arrays with low polarization coupling; and multi-band nested antenna arrays with nonuniform periodicities will be designed. Design and fabrication methods will be investigated.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the proposed work: This research will lead to the design of fast imaging techniques for the detection of non-metallic concealed weapons, and will have an impact on public safety. The technology developed will also have direct applications to astronomy, and medical imaging. This project will foster multidisciplinary collaborative research spanning areas of high-frequency analog quasi-optical techniques and image processing. The proposed research will be complemented by educational activities that will transfer the findings into a course. The investigators will disseminate their results in journals, through a regularly updated interactive web site and through a workshop that brings together all areas needed for millimeter-wave imaging. \r\n",
