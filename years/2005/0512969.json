 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to develop and rigorously analyze new efficient and\r\nhigh-order accurate integral equation methods for acoustic scattering in\r\ntwo and three dimensions, with the longer-range goal of developing methods\r\nfor full electromagnetic scattering (by inhomogeneous and even anisotropic\r\nmedia) in three dimensions.  These methods combine an existing FFT-based\r\nmethod for integrating over smooth regions of the inhomogeneity, with an\r\naccelerated, high-order accurate integration scheme, for small regions\r\nnear scatterer discontinuities.  The PI also proposes to develop\r\npreconditioning strategies through two distinct lines of investigation:\r\n(1) preconditioning by means of a perturbation expansion about a simple,\r\npiecewise-constant, radially layered inhomogeneity and (2) preconditioning\r\nby means of the infinite frequency limit of the problem, i.e., geometrical\r\noptics.  To pursue a preconditioner based on geometrical optics, an\r\neffective method for computing the multi-valued solution to the eikonal\r\nequation in inhomogeneous media (capturing the reflection and refraction\r\nat discontinuous interfaces) will be developed by building on a recently\r\ndeveloped phase-space-based level set method, which combines a spectral\r\nrepresentation in the phase variables with a discontinuous Galerkin\r\nfinite-element discretization in the spatial variables.\r\n\r\nThe use of numerical methods to evaluate the scattering of waves by\r\ncomplex material structures plays an important role in an enormous range\r\nof scientific and engineering technologies.  Examples include radar and\r\nremote sensing, medical and biological imaging (e.g., CT-scans,\r\nultrasound), laser-plasma interactions (e.g., in laser-driven fusion),\r\nphotonic crystal design, nondestructive testing, neutron and electron\r\ndiffraction, and exploration seismology.  At the same time, the ever\r\nincreasing size and complexity of material structures of practical\r\ninterest place many problems beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art\r\ncomputational methods, thus requiring new and innovative mathematical\r\napproaches.  The PI proposes to develop new efficient and highly accurate\r\ncomputational methods for such problems to enable the treatment of larger\r\nand more complex scattering structures.\r\n",
