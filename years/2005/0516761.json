 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study uses experimental methods to study the conflict between a leader and a set of subordinates in a collective resistance game (CR game) that has been influential in the political economy literature and has important applications in organizational economics. This\r\ngame captures the idea that the leader's decision regarding whether to transgress against\r\nsubordinates' rights depends crucially on his expectation of whether subordinates will  succeed in challenging his power when transgression takes place, and how a successful challenge requires the subordinates to solve a coordination problem. \r\n\r\nThe project first studies simple variants of this CR game to understand empirically how well subordinates can solve this coordination problem. It then embeds the CR game in different environments to understand how differences in social contexts-for example, the existence of particular communication opportunities, different types of repeated play, and prior interactions between the players which can potentially foster trust between them-can\r\naffect the subordinates' abilities to solve their coordination problem and the incidence of\r\ntransgression. It also represents a serious attempt to develop controlled methods for increasing trust and social capital in the laboratory to better understand how these factors influence later social interactions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. The research has important implications for practical policy conclusions and prescriptions. Results should provide insights useful for understanding how political and social institutions can affect the incentive and ability of a political leader (\"sovereign\") to violate citizen rights and expropriate surplus from less powerful members of society. Another important application will be the deterrence of opportunistic behavior by the leader in organizational economics. The leader (such as a CEO) has the power to define the rules of the game that govern interactions within the firm, which leads to a \"managerial dilemma\" and interests of firm owners to prevent the organizational leader from violating rights of subordinates or otherwise altering the rules of the game to his advantage.\r\n\r\nThe study is also projected to have a broad impact for teaching, learning, participation by\r\nunderrepresented groups and for building partnerships. The project will employ over 800\r\nundergraduate student subjects drawn from a large and diversified student population at Purdue University and will provide these students with important exposure to modern research methods. Many of these subjects, drawn from economics and management classes, will be non-science majors. Engaging undergraduate students in economics experiments will hopefully motivate their curiosity and it may even stimulate sufficient interest in some of them that they will choose to pursue a research career in the discipline. [It was the introduction to experiments in his undergraduate studies that inspired the principal investigator to make such a career choice.] The VSEEL laboratory at Purdue has an excellent record of involving members of underrepresented minority groups at both  the undergraduate and graduate levels and this project is expected to continue this tradition. \r\n\r\n",
