 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal, theoretical models will be used to study heavy \r\ncollisions at various energies as well as nuclear reactions induced by \r\nphotons and other elementary particles. Using an improved \r\nisospin-dependent transport model, that includes different dynamics for \r\nprotons and neutrons, collisions of rare isotopes at current \r\naccelerators and the proposed Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) will be \r\nstudied in order to find the dependence of experimental observables, \r\nsuch as the two-nucleon correlation functions and the yield of light \r\nclusters, on the properties of nuclear matter with different proton and \r\nneutron numbers. With a refined multi-phase transport model, that \r\nincludes both initial interactions among quarks and gluons and final \r\ninteractions among ordinary hadrons as well as the transition between \r\nthese two phases of matters, ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at \r\nthe Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) will be studied in order to \r\nidentify the signatures of the produced quark-gluon plasma and to study \r\nits properties through observables such as the collective dynamics of \r\nproduced particles, the electromagnetic radiations, the abundance of hadrons consisting of \r\nmulti-strange or heavy charm quarks, the suppressed production of \r\nenergetic particles, and the even-by-event fluctuations.  Also, \r\neffective hadronic models will be extended to study exotic pentaquark\r\nbaryons from photo- and hadron-nucleon reactions in the experiments \r\ncarried out at the Jefferson National Laboratory (JLAB) and elsewhere \r\nin order to determine their properties and structures. The proposed \r\nresearch will not only have direct impact on the research\r\nprograms at RIA, RHIC, and JLAB but also adds greatly to our \r\nunderstanding of astrophysical phenomena such as supernova explosions, \r\nneutron star properties, and of how matter is formed from the \r\nprimordial quark-gluon plasma during the evolution of the early \r\nuniverse. It further offers young students and postdoctoral researchers \r\na broad research experience that includes methods ranging from quantum \r\nfield theory to statistical mechanics and involving both analytical \r\nwork and numerical computation. These experiences will prepare them \r\nwell for careers in either nuclear science or other areas to continue \r\ntheir contributions to the scientific and technological advance in our \r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n",
