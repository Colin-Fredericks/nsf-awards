 "awd_abstract_narration": "All of the people over the world are deeply saddened by the devastation and suffering of the people in the areas affected by hurricane Katrina. Millions of people from the Gulf Coast are suffering from Hurricane Katrina's devastation. After the Hurricane Katrina, we have to execute a quantitative investigation of the performance of electric power distribution systems in the affected areas. As to the affected power distribution systems, the most sever disruption by Hurricane Katrina is the physical damages on power grids.\r\n\r\nAnother sever effects by Hurricane Katrina is the disruption of power quality during and after the Hurricane Katrina. Because of the outages and unreasonable load/generation pattern of the remaining electric power networks, customers have to suffer a power supply with poor power quality before the system is entirely restored.\r\n\r\nAlthough the disruption on power quality seems not as sever as the physical damages on power system components, and it is not easy to obviously relate the disruption of power quality to the monetary value, the estimate of disruption of power quality is also important because, no efforts will be made to minimize the disruption of Hurricane Katrina on power quality unless people realize its extent. The data collection and analysis will yield a chance for people to realize the disruption extent of Hurricane Katrina on power quality.\r\n\r\nThere are many factors, for example, hurricane-related winds, rainfall and spatial configuration of power systems, causing the faults which further lead to the disruption of power quality. In order to study the causes of the disruption of power quality by Hurricane Katrina, data regarding these factors need to be collected.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is aimed to collect the following two groups of data:\r\n1). Data of Disruption of Power Quality\r\n2). Data of Causes of Power Quality Disruption\r\n",
