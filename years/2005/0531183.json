 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF granted a HBCU Doctoral Capacity Building/RISE  grant to AAMU for three years starting in August 2002. The ongoing RISE has a significant impact in graduating doctoral students in physics. AAMU administration fully supports the theme of this program by contributing support toward project efforts.  The present award  further extends research and education in sensors with major emphasis on radiation, biological, temperature and chemical sensors, based on a number of achievements made during the existing NSF grant. The RISE project supports the development of research and educational capabilities of AAMU. This award supports enhancements in research training and research preparedness of graduate students in the physics department and on increasing the enrollment of doctoral students and graduates, particularly of underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its contribution to the knowledge about sensor development.  RISE supported research and education focuses on Radiation Sensors, Biological Sensors, Temperature and Chemical Sensors. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project lie in the expanded research and educational opportunities made available to students and faculty in the area of sensor research.  Project activities include a yearly one-week workshop/short course on sensors for undergraduate students and faculty from HBCU's and other universities. These research areas will provide topics for Ph.D. and MS degree dissertations and thesis for graduate students.\r\n",
