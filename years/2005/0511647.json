 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nBy adapting elements of Purdue University's Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) model, IIT is creating a formal service-learning pathway experience for student teams that are organized through the Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program. This project expands opportunities for students to engage in community service for non-profit organizations on a continuing basis through: (1) multi-year partner relationships, (2) focus on community, social service and other non-profit needs, (3) accommodation of organizations based on need, (4) methods for managing community service projects, (5) content for conveying principles of service learning, and (6) ways for students to remain on the same team over time. \r\n\tThe intellectual merit of this approach centers on establishing a four-part service-learning pathway through which students are: (a) developing a context and culture for participating in an extended community service learning experience, including insight from a \"service learning body of knowledge\"; (b) engaging in an on-going service learning team experience, working with non-profit organization partner; (c) reflecting on the lessons learned during this experience and providing valuable feedback to enrich the experience for those who follow; and (d) acting as service learning ambassadors, team leaders and scholars, and ultimately, alumni mentors. A service-learning pathway offers opportunities to achieving broad impact by virtue of IIT's central location in the Chicago metropolitan area, enabling the program to impact many urban organizations.\r\n\t\r\n",
