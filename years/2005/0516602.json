 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary project develops the science of designing and engineering the polymer crystal surfaces and interfaces needed for surface- and nano-technologies such as surface nano-patterns and responsive chemical sensors. The core idea of the research is to utilize lamellar single crystals of designed amorphous(A)-crystalline(C) di- and triblock copolymers to control polymer single crystal surface properties. A-C diblock copolymer single crystals will be used to determine the theoretically and technologically important onset of tethered chain overcrowding and stretching.  They will also be used to determine the affect of tethered chain density and defects on crystallization under nano-confinement.  Single crystals of A-A-C linear and \"Y\" shaped triblocks will be used to investigate near two-dimensional nano-phase separation, phase transitions, and morphologies. A-C-A linear triblock copolymers will be used to create switchable/tunable twisted and scrolled crystal morphologies for constructing supra-molecular structures with advanced optical or bio-mimetic properties. In addition to the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral training and course development, documentary archives of crystal structures and morphologies will be compiled and made available on the Internet.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project develops the science of designing and engineering polymer crystal surfaces and interfaces needed for surface- and nano-technologies such as surface nano-patterns, responsive chemical sensors, and supra-molecular structures possessing advanced optical or bio-mimetic properties. This task will be accomplished by utilizing specially designed polymers in conjunction with innovative crystallization techniques to create highly versatile and functional crystal templates on the nanoscale. These templates, along with the science derived from them, will form a foundation upon which an entire branch of nanoscience and nanotechnology will be conducted.  During the course of this research, graduate and post-doctoral associates will be trained in cutting edge synthesis and crystal growth techniques, while undergraduates will gain valuable research experience, and be encouraged to continue the pursuit of science. Additionally, published and unpublished crystal structures and morphologies from scientists world-wide will be collected, categorized, computerized, and made available to the public through the Internet. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
