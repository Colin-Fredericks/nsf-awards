 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to utilize an integrated analytical, experimental and numerical effort to attain a fundamental understanding of two governing physical phenomena - interlayer (fabric-fabric) friction and interconnected through-thickness and in-plane compaction.  Modeling of the in-service performance of thermoplastic-matrix woven-fabric reinforced structural composites - e.g., damage tolerance, crashworthiness, vibration - is currently inadequate for parts of any geometric complexity because of the inability of existing performance models to capture the true deformed material properties. The key to taking advantage of the reduced weight and potentially increased occupant safety that these composites can offer is to provide a direct link between part geometry, material selection, process conditions, process-induced local properties, and part performance, thereby allowing informed feedback to the design process. The capabilities of the predictive model will be demonstrated by considering a prototype part from design conception, to manufacturing under a set of prescribed conditions, through seamlessly examining its in-service performance.  This research is being cosponsored by the DOE Freedom Car Project.  \r\n\r\nThe availability of a predictive model that can be widely used by industry will facilitate the greater use of lightweight composite materials in the automotive industry, increasing fuel-efficiency without sacrificing safety. In coordination with the overall theme of processing-structure-performance interrelations, outreach efforts are planned to develop new sessions on \"Design, Fabrication, and Testing of Braided Composite Baseball Bats\" for grade 8-10 participants in the extremely successful UMass-Lowell Design Camp. A similar summer-session collaboration with Cislunar Aerospace, Inc. is planned for introducing girls to science and engineering through examples of aerodynamics in sports. In addition, all undergraduate and graduate students in this project will have the opportunity for extensive interactions with our industry (Ford, GM) and international (Belgium, UK, France) partners.",
