 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a highly integrated, comprehensive research and training program between the laboratories of Co-PIs Donald A. Bryant and John H. Golbeck. This research program includes the application of transposon mutagenesis and proteomic methods to the identification of biochemical factors that govern the bioassembly of membrane proteins, the application of magnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe the conformational dynamics encountered during the bioassembly of membrane proteins, the application of directed mutagenesis and spectroscopic techniques to discover factors that contribute to the redox potentials of organic electron transfer cofactors, and the construction of Photosystem I-hydrogenase chimeras. These aims are within reach because research in Photosystem I has achieved a level of sophistication that allows problems of global importance to biochemistry to be addressed. The studies in this project will be greatly facilitated by the recently completed genome sequence of the euryhaline, unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. The availability of this genome sequence, as well as a nearly complete transposon mutation library, will be exploited in searching for factors involved in the biogenesis of Photosystem I. \r\n\r\nThis project will have a significant and broad impact by providing unique opportunities to train undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in disciplines ranging from microbial physiology, molecular biology, genomics, biochemistry, to biophysics. This research will also present excellent opportunities for collaborative research between the PI's students and postdoctoral scientists with foreign scientists who are acknowledged experts in their fields. The PI and the co-PI will continue their efforts to involve faculty and undergraduates from predominantly undergraduate institutions in their research. \r\n",
