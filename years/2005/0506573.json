Thus, either problems remain with theories of high mass star evolution\r\n(important/unknown physical complications may have not be included), or with the spectroscopic\r\napproach (incorrect surface gravities, luminosities, distances, etc. may be being used). To resolve\r\nthe question and ascertain the source of the discrepancy, the masses of binary O stars will be\r\ndirectly measured from an analysis of eclipsing double-lined spectroscopic binaries (special\r\nattention will be paid to those with periods > 3-5 days which have therefore not interacted). In the\r\nfirst year, young associations and clusters in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds will be\r\nphotometrically surveyed to find eclipsing binaries. Radial velocities for candidates will be obtained\r\nin the second year. The third year will be used to find the orbit solutions, and to calculate\r\nspectroscopic and evolutionary masses for comparison with the results.\r\nThis project includes a significant outreach and undergraduate research component. The\r\nphotometric data (its acquisition for the northern fields and reduction for both northern and southern\r\ntargets) will be part of a key project of the National Undergraduate Research Observatory.\r\nUndergraduate students in Northern Arizona University Research Experiences for Undergraduates\r\nprogram and MIT field camp will help with the spectroscopic observations and orbit solutions.",
