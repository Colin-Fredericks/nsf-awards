 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Engineering Technology (58) \r\nThis proof-of-concept project is developing a scheduling edutainment prototype that engages students in both educational and entertaining experience that uses a Distributed Virtual Reality (DVR) environment. The process is coupling 4D CAD with interactive gaming pedagogy. The DVR is developing students' ability to do effective time sequencing (scheduling) in architecture, engineering and construction processes. The approach is supported by a number of recent reports in the literature as well as experiences of other institutions in the use of 4D CAD and DVR. The curriculum is being structured to meet the needs of women and underrepresented classes of students.\r\n\r\nJones County Junior College is engaging collaboratively in the project to coordinate the major meetings of the multidisciplinary research team, help develop a detailed implementation plan, prepare the set of drawings and specifications for the edutainment DVR prototype, assist in the development of the 3D models, implement the initial testing of the edutainment DVR at the JCJC campus and assess the effectiveness of the prototype in their classrooms, and prepare strategies and methods to disseminate the DVR prototype to high schools and other community colleges. \r\n\r\nAssessment strategies include using pre-post tests to determine students' conceptual understanding of the material and development of their higher order thinking skills. Results are being compared between students taking the traditional class and those using the DVR edutainment curriculum. Surveys are being used to assess student motivation and the usability of the DVR edutainment. The material is being disseminated through papers and presentations at a wide variety of professional conferences. \r\n",
