 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to combine surface sensitive infrared-visible sum frequency generation\r\nspectroscopy (SFG) with insitu friction and adhesion measurements. The experiments\r\nare motivated by results of Chaudhury and Brown using poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)\r\nlenses and Israelachvili using surface force apparatus; where they find a relationship\r\nbetween friction, adhesion hysteresis and mobility of the molecules at the interface.\r\nHowever, there is no information on how different relaxation processes are at\r\npolymer/solid or hidden interfaces in comparison to that in bulk. Recent experiments of\r\nglass transition temperature of polymer thin films indicate that the relaxation at the air\r\ninterface can be several orders of magnitude faster than in the bulk. The relaxation\r\ntimes of polymer chains are expected to be altered in contact with surfaces of different\r\nsurface energies. Furthermore, there is no direct information of the change in the\r\nstructure of molecules at moving or sliding interfaces. Understanding these properties is\r\ncrucial to understand friction. Recently, we demonstrated that SFG can be applied to\r\nstudy the contact interface between an elastomeric PDMS lens and a polymer or solid\r\nsubstrate. Here, we take advantage of this design to measure simultaneously the\r\nchanges in structure between two sliding surfaces, friction and adhesion. In addition, we\r\npropose to measure the relaxation dynamics at interfaces using SFG to understand the\r\nrelationship between mobility and friction coefficient. As a Director of District 5, I have\r\nbeen actively involved in organizing District 5 Science Day for students from K5-K12 for\r\nthe past five years. In addition to this outreach activity, this proposal offers research\r\nopportunities to two high school students from a local high school to work during\r\nsummer in my laboratory under the supervision of graduate students. The research of\r\nthese high school projects can be submitted as a part of their science project for\r\ncompetition in the Intel Science and Engineering Fair. This effort will be integrated with\r\nthe NSF-REU undergraduate program already existing at The University of Akron.                                   \r\nBroader Impact: Friction between two surfaces is of utmost importance in a variety of\r\ntechnological and biological applications. The understanding and control of these\r\nphenomena will have a tremendous impact in conserving and using precious energy\r\nresources. The advances in this field are limited by the lack of understanding of the\r\nstructure and properties of molecules at the interface. This proposal provides a new\r\nexperimental method to probe molecular motion or deformation taking place at the\r\ninterface and studies its relationship to friction and adhesion. This will broadly impact\r\nour design of surfaces, lubricants and micro or nano-actuators. The education and\r\noutreach activities target local schools in District 5 to promote an interest in science by\r\nencouraging students to undertake science projects and compete at district, state and\r\ninternational level.",
