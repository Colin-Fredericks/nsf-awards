 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nCAREER: Spectral Properties of Hot and Dense QCD Matter (Ralf Rapp) \r\n\r\nMore than 99% of the mass of matter around us is concentrated in atomic\r\nnuclei, which are made of protons and neutrons. The elementary building\r\nblocks of these (and other ``hadrons\") are believed to be (almost)\r\nmassless ``quarks\" and ``gluons\".  However, quarks and gluons have never\r\nbeen observed in isolation, and their strong interaction is responsible\r\nfor generating the masses of the hadrons. The origin of these phenomena\r\nis among the main questions in modern nuclear physics. Under extreme\r\nconditions of temperature and density, hadrons are expected to dissolve\r\ninto a new state of matter, the ``Quark-Gluon Plasma\", which probably\r\nexisted in the early universe a few microseconds after its birth. One of\r\nthe key objectives in Dr. Rapp's research plan is to investigate how\r\nhadrons change their spectral properties (such as masses and decay\r\nwidths) in hot and dense matter, and how this relates to phase changes\r\ninto a Quark-Gluon Plasma. His calculations will be applied to\r\nexperiments at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider at Brookhaven\r\nNational Laboratory, where gold nuclei are collided at high energy to\r\nrecreate, for a short moment, the Quark-Gluon Plasma. To meet the\r\nchallenge of identifying signatures of this transient state, Dr. Rapp\r\nwill evaluate decay products of unstable particles allowing access to\r\nmodifications of their spectral properties. He will pursue similar\r\napproaches to electron scattering experiments off nuclei at Jefferson\r\nLaboratory, as well as to cold dense quark matter which could prevail in\r\ncompact stellar objects, so-called neutrons stars.  In addition, Dr.\r\nRapp will build a vigorous educational program for graduate and\r\nundergraduate students, including continued engagement in the NSF-funded\r\nREU site at the Cyclotron Institute. He will endeavor to broaden the\r\ngeneral interest and education in modern nuclear science via a\r\n``Saturday Morning Physics\" program at Texas A&M University for high\r\nschool students from a greater area around College Station, which is\r\nparticularly suitable to enhance the involvement of minority groups, and\r\nto improve prospective undergraduate enrollment in physics.",
