The program director is Michael Pullin who is assisted by Barbara Austin. The site will bring 10 undergraduate students to New Mexico Tech for an eight-week summer research experience that focuses on cross-disciplinary studies of environmentally related topics.  The REU program will include five collaborative research projects, with each conducted by an interdisciplinary team of New Mexico Tech faculty, graduate students, and REU undergraduates (2 per project).  The REU site will bring together faculty and students from chemistry, biology, earth sciences, and physics. New Mexico Tech's REU program will specifically target students from Hispanic and Native American ethnic backgrounds.  Recruiting efforts will mainly focus on regional institutions in the southwest that do not have Ph.D.-level research programs.",
