 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective learning from social partners requires that children interpret other people's actions not as purely physical motions through space, but rather in terms of their underlying goals or intentions. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Woodward will investigate the origins of this foundational ability during infancy. Recent studies have developed a technique for using infants' patterns of attention as evidence about their understanding of the actions they observe. Results from this technique have revealed that infants understand the goal-directed nature of some actions, including grasping, tool use, and acts of attention (i.e., looking). The current studies will use the same technique to investigate the experiences and processes that contribute to infants' understanding of others' goals. In particular, the studies evaluate the possibility that infants' own actions provide a basis for the insight that others' actions are goal-directed. To address this issue, these studies examine the effect of experimentally induced experience on infants' action knowledge. Research questions concern the relative effects of first-person and observational experience, as well as the extent to which infants generalize what they have learned from these experiences to new situations. These studies will provide the first systematic investigation of the effects of learning to act on infants' understanding of others' actions.\r\n\r\nThis work will yield new insights into social knowledge and its dynamic emergence in early development. By situating infant cognitive development within the larger context of infants' emerging competence as agents in the physical and social worlds, this research will provide new insights into processes of cognitive development during infancy. More generally, this research is part of a growing movement to study the role of learning in infants' conceptual development. In addition, the findings will inform understanding of knowledge acquisition in social settings because concepts of intention support many aspects of social learning. This research is also relevant to understanding cases in which development goes awry. Deficits in social reasoning have been implicated in developmental disorders including autism, asperger's syndrome, and conduct disorder. Discovering the processes that create social understanding in typically developing children will inform scientific and clinical understanding of these developmental disorders.\r\n",
