 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lehigh University will acquire a new scanning electron microscope.   The instrument will have the following technical features: a Schottky field emission source; EDS and EBSD; remote operation; variable pressure and good low-voltage operation.  The state-of-the-art microscope will be used for research into a broad range of problems related to nanotechnology, among them: orientation mapping and the local measurement of strain in polycrystalline samples and their application to electromigration; the patterning of perfect crystal epitaxy on sapphire for improved GaN growth for LEDs; micromechanical testing of nanoscale materials; the detailed characterization of grain boundaries for studies of grain-boundary segregation and of metal forging; biomimetic fibrillar interfaces for adhesion; welding of superaustinitic stainless steels; the structures produced by laser engineered net shaping.  The microscope will also be used for an extensive set of outreach and educational programs.  The Lehigh Microscopy School, held each year provides the premier training in scanning electron microscopy and so brings the latest advances in the field to industrial microscopists.  Remote operation of the microscope will facilitate collaborative research with many other universities as well as bringing access to high-tech excitement to middle- and high- school students.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe electron microscope plays a very special role in contemporary science and engineering.   So much of our present technological strength comes from our understanding of the relation between structures on the nanoscale (roughly 1,000 times smaller than the diameter of a hair) and the properties of objects on the human scale.  The electron microscope is central to this since it is the most powerful instrument for investigating  such small structures.  The new scanning electron microscope at Lehigh University will greatly enhance what is already a major program in these areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology.   The microscope will also contribute greatly to outreach and education programs, especially through the Lehigh Microscopy School - the leading courses for basic and advanced training in scanning electron microscopy.  It will be possible to operate the microscope remotely, which will be important for research collaboration with other universities.  Lehigh will develop an outreach program in which middle- and high- school students are able to operate the microscope to view samples they submit.   Among many research programs using the new instrument will be programs leading to: better performance in computer chips; better light sources; better micro-machines; and the design of improved adhesion methods by imitating the structures on the feet of lizards.\r\n",
