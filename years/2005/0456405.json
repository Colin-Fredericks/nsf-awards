 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaboration between experimental petrologists at \r\nU.  Minnesota and analytical geochemists at Arizona State to address \r\ntwo of the chief goals of the CSEDI initiative:  (1) to understand \r\nthe Earth's deep water cycle and (2) to understand the influence of \r\nH2O on melting, phase transitions, and physical properties of the \r\nmantle.  Experiments to determine the H2O storage capacity of \r\nperidotite under upper mantle, transition zone, and lower mantle \r\nconditions will be performed using high temperature high pressure \r\ndevices at the University of Minnesota.  The storage capacity is the \r\nmaximum H2O that can be retained in solid peridotite at a given \r\ntemperature and pressure. Storage capacities constrain possible \r\nregions of H2O-rich mantle reservoirs and possible loci of hydrous \r\nmelting.  Owing to the large effect of H2O on mantle properties such \r\nas creep strength, elasticity, and conductivity, they also provide \r\ncritical constraints on mantle dynamics.  Experimental products will \r\nbe analyzed at Arizona State for trace quantities of H2O using \r\nnewly-developed low-blank secondary ion mass spectrometry techniques. \r\nFour related experimental problems will be addressed: (1) To \r\ninvestigate recent indications that the upper mantle has a larger \r\nstorage capacity than previously appreciated, experiments at 3-13 \r\nGigapascals will determine peridotite H2O storage capacities. (2) To \r\ndetermine the influence of H2O on deep melting beneath oceanic ridges \r\nand oceanic islands and the consequences for dehydration of the upper \r\nmantle, mineral/melt H2O partitioning will be determined at 3-8 GPa. \r\n(3) To better understand transport of H2O across the 410 km \r\ndiscontinuity, including the effect of H2O on melting and phase \r\ntransitions, inter-mineral partitioning of H2O and the storage \r\ncapacity will be determined at 13-15 GPa over a range of \r\ntemperatures. (4) To help resolve controversy about the storage \r\ncapacity of the lower mantle, experiments will be performed at 22-25 \r\nGPa, pressures relevant to in the region of the 670 km discontinuity.",
