 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Slavi C. Sevov, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Notre Dame University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for studies on the reactivity of homo- and hetero-atomic main-group deltahedral clusters (Zintl ions). The chemistry of such clusters is unique in that the constituting elements are in unusual negative oxidation states and have the potential to provide novel bonding, structures, coordination, and reactivity. The focus of the research will be on the solution and solid state chemistry and bonding of homo- and hetero-atomic anion clusters of germanium, silicon, tin, group II-V elements, and transition metals. The PI has already synthesized and characterized dimers, trimers, and tetramers of Ge9 clusters. These studies will be extended to larger oligomers of Ge and broadened to include Si, and the other elements mentioned above. A major effort will involve functionalizing the clusters through reactions with nucleophiles. This will allow addition of organic groups with various functionalities such as multiple bonds, aromatic rings, and heteroatoms, as well as various nucleophilic organometallic substituents.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the chemistry of these clusters will help in foreseeing new compounds and materials with unusual properties. Such clusters are of interest as potential precursors to new classical materials (intermetallics, extended structures) as well as nano materials (nanorods, thin films, surface grafting) with novel electronic and magnetic properties. The project has a strong educational component. The training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, that include women and minorities, will be undertaken. \r\n",
