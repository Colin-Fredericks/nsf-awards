 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on answering the question: How can the challenges that arise due to the multiplicity, diversity, and heterogeneity of access technologies, devices, networks, and content in future wireless data networks, be addressed effectively? The question is explored from a purely end-to-end standpoint, and more specifically through transport layer solutions. In particular, the project's goals are to make the following contributions: (i) Establishment of principles for the design of transport layer protocols that can address the unique challenges posed by the multiplicity (e.g. number of interfaces), diversity (e.g. content requirements), and heterogeneity (e.g. access technology characteristics) in future wireless data networks; (ii) Realization of the principles through mechanisms appropriate for the target environment; and (iii) Effective integration of the realizations through scalable approaches. \r\n\r\nThrough the above contributions, the project will achieve the eventual goal of a unified transport layer solution for future wireless data networks - a solution that comprehensively handles the multiple dimensions of heterogeneity, while seamlessly providing the mobile user with the most effective performance possible. In addition, other projected outcomes include: (a) Undergraduate curriculum development through two\r\nsenior undergraduate classes taught by the PI, (b) Undergraduate research participation through Georgia Tech's UROP program, (c) Graduate curriculum development through a Wireless Networking class taught by the PI, (d) Graduate research participation leading to master's and doctoral research, (e) Industry collaboration and experience for graduate students through ongoing joint projects with the industry, (f) Support for minority students, and (h) Pursuit of standardization efforts and technology transfer.\r\n",
