 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nSource coding plays a critical role in many modern digital systems.\r\nIndeed, as a research area, source coding is more important and\r\nfertile than ever, with a wealth of new opportunities and challenges\r\narising from the increasing pervasiveness of multimedia and sensor\r\ndata in a digital world.  This research pursues a set of particularly\r\ninteresting, novel, and timely directions in this realm, and aims to\r\nimpact the design of practical systems.  There are three complementary\r\naspects to the research: theory, algorithms, and applications.\r\n\r\nIn the theory area, the emphasis is on problems of distributed source\r\ncoding.  There has been strong growth in interest in such problems,\r\nmotivated by, for example, the need for resource efficient\r\nquantization and compression techniques in networks.  The\r\ninvestigation pursues a substantial but largely unexplored aspect of\r\ndistributed source coding theory: how distortion side information\r\n--- i.e., information about the relative importance of the signal\r\ncomponents to be coded --- can be exploited in such problems.\r\n\r\nIn the algorithms area, the focusses on turbo-quantization ---\r\nlow-complexity iterative source encoding techniques and their\r\nimplementation.  Over the past decade, there has been a tremendous\r\nsuccess in developing low-complexity iterative channel decoding\r\nalgorithms for use with error-correction codes.  The corresponding\r\nsource codes obtained via duality principles have the potential to\r\nsimilarly transform the practice of source coding.\r\n\r\nFinally, the research investigates important emerging\r\ndecision-system applications in which source coding and\r\ndistortion criteria play an integral role, but in nontraditional ways.\r\nSpecific examples being pursued include hashing systems for\r\nmultimedia databases and systems for authenticating multimedia\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n",
