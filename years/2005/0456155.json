 "awd_abstract_narration": "The works of Thurston and Jones revolutionized low dimensional\r\ntopology. Thurston established the ubiquity of hyperbolic structure in\r\nlow dimensions. Jones' work, via such physical notions as quantum\r\ngroups and path integrals, led to vast families of topological\r\ninvariants associated with diagrammatic descriptions of topological\r\nobjects. The investigators have striking experimental evidence for a\r\ndirect link between these disparate approaches. Establishing such a\r\nlink is of fundamental importance to low dimensional topology. This\r\nproposal aims to establish this link, with particular focus on the\r\ngeneralized volume conjecture, which relates the most important\r\ngeometric and quantum invariants: the hyperbolic volume and\r\nChern-Simons invariant, and the colored Jones polynomials of a\r\nknot. The theory of L2-invariants provides a combinatorial framework\r\nto study hyperbolic volume. Deforming this construction along the\r\ncurve of representations given by the A-polynomial involves the\r\ntwisted Alexander polynomial and the colored Jones polynomials. Tree\r\nentropy of graphs provides the bridge between L2-torsion and colored\r\nJones polynomials.\r\n\r\nThe volume conjecture relates classical geometric invariants of\r\nthree-dimensional spaces with topological invariants motivated by\r\nideas from quantum physics. This conjecture originated in the theory\r\nof quantum gravity, which cannot yet be verified experimentally.  The\r\nmathematically rigorous verification sought by this project of this\r\nand related conjectures will support the internal consistency of\r\nquantum gravity. Unifying quantum and geometric invariants is also of\r\nintrinsic mathematical importance, which will yield important new\r\ninsights in other fields. Computer programs to study geometric\r\ninvariants and tabulation of knots and their invariants are\r\nessential tools for this research. Undergraduate and graduate students\r\ninvolved in this project will be exposed to sophisticated mathematics\r\nand computer tools.\r\n",
