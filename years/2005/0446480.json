 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support of the work of Professor Victor Heasley of the Department of Chemistry at Point Loma Nazarene College in San Diego, CA.  The research will extend the PI's studies of the chlorination of organic contaminants in water during purification. In particular, chlorination of compounds, which are models for humic acid impurities, will be studied along with other organic compounds found in drinking water.  Analysis of the structure of the products of these chlorinations will provide mechanistic and theoretical insights into the pathways that lead to the production of contaminants during water chlorination.  \r\n\r\nThese investigations of the chemical reactions that take place during water purification are expected provide important information concerning the ways drinking water becomes contaminated during chlorination.  The identification of these contaminants may lead to ways to prevent their formation and allow their removal. Another important aspect of this project will be the introduction of undergraduate students to an important research area.  These students will be trained in the use of modern chemical instrumentation and experimental techniques in studies designed to foster a life-long interest in research.\r\n",
