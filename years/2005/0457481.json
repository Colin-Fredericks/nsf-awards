 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nElliptic curves are increasingly important not only in number theory \r\nand arithmetic algebraic geometry, but also in cryptography and related \r\napplications. Some of the most interesting and important open questions \r\nabout elliptic curves are the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and \r\nother questions about ranks, Selmer groups, and L-functions. In this \r\nproject the investigator and his colleagues plan to study how the rank \r\nof an elliptic curve varies in certain families of number fields, \r\nespecially the subfields of Iwasawa towers and the family of all \r\nquadratic fields. The investigation will make use of many different \r\ntechniques, including algebraic, p-adic, and analytic tools.\r\n\r\nElliptic curves play a central role in many parts of mathematics \r\nincluding its most applied areas. For example, elliptic curves are used \r\nin algorithms to encrypt data for transmission, and for efficient \r\ndigital signatures. In its most basic form, an elliptic curve is a \r\nspecial kind of polynomial equation in two variables. Historically \r\nnumber theorists are interested in finding solutions of these equations \r\nin which the variables take values which are either whole numbers, or \r\nfractions. The rank of an elliptic curve is a basic invariant which \r\nmeasures the size of the set of solutions. The investigator and his \r\ncoworkers study ranks of elliptic curves and their interrelations with \r\nother mathematical objects and concepts. These questions are related to \r\nthe cryptographic applications of elliptic curves, which come about by \r\nconsidering solutions in which the variables take values in finite \r\nfields.\r\n",
