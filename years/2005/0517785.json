 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rao\r\n0517785\r\n\r\nThis project entails harnessing a metallic thin-film optical effect that offers significantly enhanced emission intensities for use in biosensing applications. Initial target species for detection are an immunoglobin from a murine hybridoma line and the RNA associated with apoptosis (cell-programmed death). Significant initial characterization work has been performed that convincingly demonstrates the opportunity for enhanced excitation, surface-selective fluorescence emission enhancement, and spatial resolution of excitation and emission light. The detection of a monolayer of green fluorescent protein by the naked eye, which is presented as preliminary data, is viewed as an impressive accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe team aspires to not stop with just improving the understanding of the underlying optical phenomena. They will also develop a prototype device that could be the basis for a commercialized product.  Another positive aspect is the sensing device has a multitude of applications ranging for detecting bioterrorism agents to cancer research.  Additionally, the investigators have made a strong case for structuring the basic research such that the ultimate device would be low cost.  Thus, the net scientific and technological impact of this work will be both wide and high.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will receive exposure to different scientific and engineering disciplines, which will benefit their development as well as the development of human resources in engineering. \r\n",
