For organizations such as the military, government, and multinational corporations, this can be an enormous risk. Anonymous communications is a technology that can stop this kind of information leakage by mixing different traffic together as it goes through the Internet. Current systems, however, are vulnerable to long-term passive attacks, in which eavesdroppers or malicious operators can uncover the traffic patterns.\r\n\r\nThis exploratory research will examine potential solutions to these attacks. It will use in-depth simulations to explore defenses against timing analysis, by which the attacker uses the timings of messages to trace a user's traffic through the network. Attacks on longer-term traffic patterns will be combatted in two ways, both of which will be evaluated with analysis and simulation. First, ideas from peer-to-peer file-sharing systems will be used to secure the process of selecting nodes. Second, artificially-generated traffic based on other users' patterns will make it more difficult to single users out. Additionally, a testbed for exploring these ideas through experimentation will be constructed. The work will be at the forefront of creating a new, more secure generation of anonymous communications systems.",
