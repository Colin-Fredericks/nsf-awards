 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop took place November 19-20, 2004 at MIT. It served as the 14th in the ongoing series of Fall Workshops on Computational Geometry, which originated at Stony Brook in 1991. The workshop on computational geometry is a forum for reporting ongoing state-of-the art research in many areas of theoretical and applied computational geometry. The focus of this particular workshop is to highlight open problems and ongoing challenges to the field, with the intention that formalized statements of open problems will help form a catalyst for new investigations and innovative solutions, while motivating new researchers, particularly students, to engage in attacking some of the outstanding questions in discrete and computational geometry. A key focus of the workshop will be an Open Problem Forum in order to promote a free exchange of questions and research challenges.\r\n\r\nThe results of the workshop will be widely disseminated by means of the internet, with talk abstracts and a detailed list of open problems raised. Many of the open problems will be highlighted in The Open Problem Project (TOPP) web pages, a recently established open problem forum moderated by three of the workshop organizers (Demaine, Mitchell, and O'Rourke).\r\n\r\n",
