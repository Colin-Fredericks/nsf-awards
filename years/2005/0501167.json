 "awd_abstract_narration": "Slaman proposes to investigate the effective aspects of randomness. The central question\r\nto be answered is, \"How can we evaluate the random content of an infinite binary\r\nsequence?\" One case is well understood, that in which an infinite sequence X of 0's\r\nand 1's is random if and only if each digit is chosen independently and with equal\r\nprobability for the values of 0 and 1. In this case, X's being effectively random has\r\nbeen equivalently characterized by Martin-Lof in terms of X's having the properties\r\nof almost all infinite sequences and by Kolmogorov and others in terms of X's being\r\nunpredictable and indescribable. Slaman proposes to study the non-uniform case, its\r\nassociated criteria for effective randomness, and its possibilities for the sets of random\r\nsequences. Even the most basic questions are open. For example, for a given infi-\r\nnite binary sequence X, under what conditions does there exist a measure relative to\r\nwhich X is random? This is a classic mathematical problem, given an individual data\r\nset determine a distribution which would generate it. Qualitatively, a measure relative\r\nto which X is random concentrates on the nonrandom aspects of X and thereby separates\r\nthose from the random ones. Other ways to quantify X's random content include\r\nthe complexity of X's initial segments and X's ability to compute uniformly random\r\nsequences. The proposal is to investigate all of these and the relationships between\r\nthem.\r\n \r\n",
