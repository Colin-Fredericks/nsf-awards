 "awd_abstract_narration": "WGBH Educational Foundation is requesting funds to produce 20 new shows and new outreach and Web activities for \"ZOOM,\" which will be renamed \"Hot Seat.\"  \"Hot Seat\" is a daily half-hour PBS television series targeted to kids ages 8 to 11.  Uniquely by and for kids, the program gives its viewers a chance to explore, to experiment and to share their creativity.  The series, along with its far-reaching outreach, offers its audience an innovative curriculum that promotes the acquisition of basic math and science knowledge and the development of problem solving skills called \"Habits of Mind.\"  The intended impacts are to:  (1) establish a project that uniquely integrates television, the Web and outreach as a model for how media can teach science and math; (2) engage kids and teach them science and math content and process skills; (3) provide curriculum and professional development to organizational partners.  Innovation includes developing three new content areas for the series -- Invention, Space Science and Earth Science -- and evolving the project design by incorporating new production techniques that enhance the \"reality factor\" of the science programming.    Outreach for the project will include printed materials for kids, families and educators.  A new collaborative partnership is being developed with the American Library Association to help distribute the new afterschool curricula to librarians across the country.  \"Hot Seat\" will support the existing network of \"ZOOM\" outreach partners and convert the museum \"ZOOMzones\" to \"Hot Seat Spots.\"  \"ZOOM\" currently is carried by 269 public broadcasting stations and is viewed by 4 million children each week.  \r\n",
