 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0506845\r\nRauch\r\n\r\nCosmological simulations and observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) are now indicating that most of the baryonic matter throughout the history of the Universe has remained in the form of intergalactic gas and never made it into galaxies and stars.  Since the gas is very tenuous and spatially extended, changes in the metallicity, temperature, kinematics and ionization state of the IGM can persist for long periods.  Observations of the absorption caused by the IGM in the spectra of background quasars reveal the often-subtle signatures of the various astrophysical processes that cause such disturbances.  This project will study the general structure of the gaseous cosmic web at high redshift, with particular emphasis on the interactions between galaxies and the IGM.  High-quality, high-resolution observations of absorption systems will be used to search for the kinematic signature of interstellar and intergalactic winds, while data from closely spaced quasar lines of sight will be used to measure the small scale density field and to determine the turbulent energy and bulk motions.  A large part of the effort will be aimed at taking an image of the general distribution of neutral hydrogen at high redshift by seeing the glow from the IGM.\r\n\r\nThe project includes multi-level educational and practical experiences for students, with particular emphasis on undergraduates from colleges in the Los Angeles area.  Students will get first-hand experience of a working professional observatory, including observing trips with staff members to South America, and will be expected to complete a self-contained project.\r\n",
