 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Florida A&M University (FAMU) will sponsor a Research Experience for Undergraduates titled, the Florida A&M University Inter-Disciplinary Research Experience for Undergraduates (FAMU-IREU).  Participants will have the opportunity to conduct research in areas of economic, governmental, scientific, and societal interests that require substantial mathematical and scientific theory. They will use scientific computer software packages that are commonly used for academic and industrial research.   Participants will be chosen from the areas of chemistry, biology, physics, computer science, engineering, economics and mathematics.  Participants will work in teams or as individual investigators.   Each team will develop a research paper that includes computer simulations and analyses.  Professors from FAMU and practitioners from industrial or governmental organizations will serve as project directors.  The FAMU-IREU Program will be held eight weeks from June through July.  Each participant will receive $1,500.00 for housing, meals and travel to the University and a stipend in the amount of $2,500.00.  The point of contact person is Dr. Roselyn Williams, Department of Mathematics, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida 32307, PH (850) 599-3595, E-mail rwilliams3@famu.edu",
