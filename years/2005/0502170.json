 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project establishes a research training program in algebraic geometry\r\nand its boundary areas at the University of Michigan. Target trainees are\r\nrecent PhDs and advanced graduate students. The project is run by five\r\nsenior faculty members representing a wide swath of current research\r\ntrends in algebraic geometry, in consultation with an additional 14 senior\r\nfaculty at Michigan in related areas.  Activities include innovations in\r\nseminar structure offering trainees broad exposure to a wide variety of\r\nbasic and research level topics in algebraic geometry (broadly construed);\r\nan annual school (open also to young researchers outside Michigan)\r\ncovering a research topic of current importance taught by a prominent\r\nresearcher from outside Michigan; opportunities for post-doctoral\r\nresearchers to design and lead REU projects under the mentorship of a\r\nsenior faculty member; opportunities for advanced graduate students and\r\npost-docs to develop their technical lecturing and writing skills; and\r\nnumerous opportunities for post-docs and advanced graduate students to\r\nreceive mentoring on all aspects of a research career in mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry is one of the most central and active branches of\r\nmathematics today, with increasingly important connections to other\r\nbranches of mathematics and science.  Algebraic geometry also underlies\r\nmany applications of mathematics to technology and government, including\r\ncoding theory (bringing us, for example, the compact disc) and spline\r\ntheory (bringing us computer aided design and the computer graphics\r\nessential to certain medical applications and Hollywood movies), as well\r\nas important issues of national security pioneered by the National\r\nSecurity Agency.  The explosive growth of algebraic geometry at the end of\r\nthe twentieth century has made this a very exciting time to begin research\r\nin the field, but it has also made it difficult for young researchers to\r\nget started. This project will increase the flow of broadly trained\r\nresearchers in algebraic geometry and its boundary areas, therefore\r\nenhancing the training infrastructure and the research workforce in these\r\nvital areas of mathematics in the twenty-first century.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
