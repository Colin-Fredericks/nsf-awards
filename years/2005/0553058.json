 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nOne of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history is hurricane Katrina which made\r\nlandfall on August 29, 2005 at 7:10 a.m. in Plaquemines Parish, LA. Tragically, Katrina\r\ncaused widespread damage and loss of life in several states but has also provided an\r\nopportunity to collect data which may be useful for design engineers and building code\r\nofficials in order to design safe and strong buildings in the future. The objective of the\r\nproposed study is to gather and process perishable data on residential woodframe\r\nstructures in non-flooded regions of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi that can\r\nbe used by the research and design code development community to improve the\r\nperformance of woodframe structures to strong wind (lateral) loading.\r\n\r\nThis Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal is requesting funding to\r\nsupport the acquisition of perishable data on damage to and performance of woodframe\r\nstructures immediately following hurricane Katrina by a multi-institutional post-disaster\r\nteam made up of members from academia and industry. Such data is perishable in that\r\nonce repairs begin and clearing of woodframe debris is underway it is no longer available\r\nto the engineering community in order that we may learn how to improve the\r\nperformance of woodframe structures during very high winds. The vast majority of the\r\nresidential building stock in the U.S. is light-frame, or woodframe, construction including\r\nthe affected areas in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe funds requested for this SGER grant will be used for (1) travel to and around the\r\naffected area in mid to late September for the post-disaster team of structural wood and\r\nwind experts, and specifically to (2) record damage to residential woodframe structures\r\nfor 4 days systematically working from the edge of the hurricane path and inland toward\r\nthe coast. A small amount of support costs is also requested for materials such as film,\r\ngasoline, etc. No personnel time is requested, and only minimal travel-related\r\nexpenses for the university team members are being requested. All industry\r\npersonnel participating with the team have agreed to pay their own expenses. These\r\ninclude the \"APA-The Engineered Wood Association\" team organized by the APA Vice\r\nPresident Tom Williamson and Steven Pryor, the lateral force resisting systems manager\r\nat Simpson Strong Tie. Thus the proposed effort is a collaboration of academics, code\r\ndevelopers, professional engineers, and industry.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed SGER project will be mainly the use of real-time\r\nGIS applications, correlation of severe and moderate wind damage with NOAA wind\r\nspeed data, the later of which will help with development of performance-based wind\r\nengineering concepts.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research includes the dissemination of data that\r\ncan be used to improve the performance of woodframe structures through design code\r\ndevelopment, thus decreasing risk to families living in woodframe houses, as well as reducing damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
