 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Cincinnati for the summers of 2005-2007.  The program director is Bruce Ault who is assisted by co-PI Anna Gudmundsdottir.  Ten students will solve scientific problems that are from one of the five major areas of chemistry: analytical chemistry, biochemistry, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry and physical chemistry. These students will work closely with one of the 12 participating faculty members, individuals who have been carefully selected for their research accomplishments and successful experiences in working with undergraduate researchers. The projects will be planned in such a way as to permit tangible accomplishments in a ten-week period, yet be sufficiently open-ended that fresh research challenges will arise. Educational, activities will include hands-on enhancement of research skills, guidance in professional abilities such as resume' writing and interviewing, workshops on career options and planning, and discussions of issues of overarching importance in science. A focus on minority recruiting, combined with the involvement of a faculty member from an HBCU in the program, will expand and strengthen the pool of underrepresented minorities in the workplace. Interaction with on-campus groups, including the Chemical Engineering REU program, Project SEED students and students in the University's WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) Program will further broaden the perspectives of students in this REU program.",
