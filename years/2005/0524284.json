 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to initiate a joint research effort teaming the University of\r\nVirginia and Virginia Diodes, Inc. to develop a robust measurement infrastructure for the\r\nsubmillimeter region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This work will address major difficulties\r\nand challenges that are associated with measuring and characterizing systems and devices at\r\nsubmillimeter-wave frequencies. The two primary research activities to be undertaken during\r\nthis project are: (1) the design and prototyping of six-port ref;ectometer architectures suitable\r\nfor measurements at submillimeter wavelengths and (2) the development of integrated diode-\r\nbased sensors. These objects are aimed at producing integrated diode-based instruments\r\ncapable of measuring scattering parameters in the 295{320 GHz and 575{640 GHz frequency\r\nbands\r\n\r\n(1) The intellectual merit of this project lies in its potential to signicantly\r\nexpand and improve present-day measurement capabilities in the terahertz\r\nportion of the spectrum. The terahertz region of the spectrum remains\r\nlargely unexplored and the scarcity of reliable and robust instrumentation\r\nremains a major obstacle to the full use and scientific investigation of this\r\nspectral region.\r\n(2) The broad impact of this proposed work will be felt not only by the engi-\r\nneers focusing on developing high-frequency circuits and devices, but by a\r\nwide variety of scientists working in many different areas of fundamental\r\nresearch. Successful development of the instrument proposed here would\r\nhave a direct and signicant impact on radio astronomy, atmospheric re-\r\nmote sensing, molecular spectroscopy, and biological sensing fields that\r\nrely critically upon the availability of submillimeter components, devices,\r\nand instruments.\r\nThe program will team researchers from the University of Virginia and engineers at Virginia\r\nDiodes, Inc. focusing on the investigation, design, and prototyping of fully integrated sensor\r\narrays for measuring submillimeter scattering parameters using six-port reflectometer archi-\r\ntectures. The project will culminate with the fabrication and demonstration of compact,\r\nintegrated instruments operating in the 295{320 GHz and 575{640 GHz spectral regions, fre-\r\nquency bands that are important for a number of ongoing scientific research initiatives in\r\nastronomy, spectral sensing, and imaging.\r\nA-1",
