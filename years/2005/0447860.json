 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electron crystallography studies the structure of membrane proteins in the membrane-embedded state.  Two-dimensional crystals of the membrane proteins are imaged by cryoEM methods, and computer processing of the recorded data allows determining the high-resolution structure of the proteins.  The aim of this project is to provide a software system that will facilitate the processing of electron crystallography data, in order to transform the structure determination of membrane proteins into an understandable and accessible technology for biologists.  That is, a user-friendly and highly automated software system (an open-source MatLab toolbox) will be prepared which will allow structural biologists to perform efficient computer processing of recorded cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) images of 2D membrane protein crystals with the option of calculating the 3D structure of membrane proteins automatically.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: A bi-annual workshop on electron crystallography at UC Davis will accompany the creation of the image analysis software.  This workshop will offer lectures and hands-on experiments to learn the methods of 2D membrane protein crystallization, data collection by cryoelectron microscocpy, computer image processing, and 3D computer structure reconstruction using the created software system.  Transmission electron microscopy also allows imaging of non-crystalline biological samples and imaging of cellular structures at lower resolution.  The versatility of this instrumentation will be employed in various teaching, demonstration and outreach activities to introduce underrepresented groups, high-school scholars and university undergraduate and graduate students to the principles of life sciences.\r\n",
