U.S. scientists will partner with scientists in Africa (in Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe), as part of a broad initiative called AfricaArray, to image the African Superplume using data gathered during a 4-year passive seismic experiment in eastern Africa that will sample a critical region in the mid-mantle where there could be a connection between anomalous upper mantle under eastern Africa and anomalous lower mantle beneath central and southern Africa. Establishing an unambiguous connection between upper and lower mantle structure will place a first-order constraint on the origin of the Superplume by pointing to a buoyancy source (thermal and/or chemical) near the core-mantle boundary.  The primary partners in this project are Pennsylvania State University, North Carolina A & T University, and the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.\r\n\r\nBuilt around the core research program is a multi-faceted educational and outreach effort that strives to catalyze a cultural change in U.S. institutions by promoting a new model for how U.S. institutions can effectively run international education and research projects that are truly collaborative and sustainable, and that also contribute to the development of a diverse workforce. The basic elements of the model, as applied to this project are 1) developing e-education and field courses linked to the research for undergraduates at U.S. minority-serving institutions and in Africa, 2) involving undergraduates in international field work, 3) requiring graduate students to a) take a foreign language, b) spend one semester at a university in Africa, and c) develop tutorials covering a range of introductory geophysics topics for undergraduates, 4) faculty visits to Africa for collaboration with their colleagues at African universities, 5) weekly U.S.-Africa web-conference seminars, and 6) setting up a public-private funding partnership that includes academic and government agencies in the U.S., Europe, and Africa, and multinational mining and petroleum companies.  \r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Division of Human Resource Development and the Division of Earth Sciences.\r\n",
