 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports construction of a new building with space and AV equipment for meetings and classes at a field station located on the Central Plains Experimental Range in northeastern Colorado. Research at the site has been conducted since 1938. The Shortgrass Steppe (SGS) Field Station has been in existence at the site since the 1960's. Research at the Station has been recognized worldwide as a source of important findings in grassland ecology. SGS research has also provided important knowledge useful for land management in the region. The new classroom/meeting facility will contain a large room for groups of up to 60 individuals, a smaller conference room for 15-30 individuals, and an office. The building will support the multi-disciplinary needs of students, faculty and other researchers from Colorado State University, the University of Northern Colorado, and the Agricultural Research Service, and will facilitate use of the Station by visiting faculty and students from other institutions. The new facility will also support the needs of educators and natural resource interpreters in ongoing efforts to explain the biology and management of the shortgrass steppe to students at all levels from elementary school through college, individual ranchers, grazing associations, conservation groups, and the general public. The need for the new building was identified through a strategic planning process initiated over five years ago.  Construction of this building and of others identified in the strategic plan will be aided by substantial financial support from Colorado State University and the University of Northern Colorado.",
