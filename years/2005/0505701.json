Robin Graham\r\n\r\nThe investigator will carry out several research projects\r\nstudying various aspects of conformal geometry and asymptotically\r\nhyperbolic metrics.  These include analyzing a\r\nDirichlet-to-Neumann map for Poincare-Einstein metrics, studying\r\nthe boundary rigidity problem for asymptotically hyperbolic\r\nmetrics, and developing the theory of the ambient metric in even\r\ndimensions beyond the obstruction.  The main objectives are to\r\nfurther understanding of these geometries and their relationship.\r\nThe methods are analytic, geometric, and algebraic, with an\r\nintimate connection between these different aspects of the study.\r\n\r\nThis project will study the relationship between different\r\ngeometric structures: conformal geometry on the one hand and\r\nasymptotically hyperbolic geometry on the other.  Conformal\r\ngeometry is the study of properties of space which depend only on\r\nangles but not on distances.  Hyperbolic geometry involves spaces\r\nof negative curvature, in which the analogues of straight lines\r\nseparate more than in usual flat space.  Several projects will\r\nstudy the relationship between these geometries.  Apart from the\r\nintrinsic geometric interest, one motivation is the AdS/CFT\r\ncorrespondence in Physics, a proposed holographic correspondence\r\nfor certain physical phenomena.  The proposed activity will\r\nfurther enable the development of human resources through\r\neducationally oriented activities of the investigator, including\r\nadvising, mentoring and teaching graduate students, and\r\ncurricular development.  International cooperation and\r\npartnership will be promoted.  Ties between the mathematics and\r\nphysics communities will be enhanced.  The results will be\r\neffectively disseminated through attendance and speaking at\r\nmeetings and conferences and through posting and publication of\r\narticles.\r\n",
