 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI  proposes a novel approach for software pipelining multi-dimensional loops, called SSP\r\n(Single-dimensional Software Pipelining). SSP provides a unique framework where software pipelining can\r\nbe applied at any desirable loop level. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. \r\nThis research builds on the established collaboration and combined expertise of the\r\nPIs in software pipelining, register allocation, compiler optimization, architecture design, and experimental\r\nevaluation. The foreseen contribution to the society is a novel compiler framework for achieving the available\r\nparallelism in loop nests as well as for providing opportunities for exploring other objectives in compilation.\r\nThe main contributions of this research will be the following:\r\n* Development of the initial SSP methodology into a comprehensive framework for optimizing multi-\r\ndimensional loops able to effectively handle general forms of loop nests.\r\n* Development of register allocation techniques for multidimensional loops that are integrated with SSP.\r\n* Implementation and experimental evaluation of SSP, the register allocator, and modified loop trans-\r\nformation phases with experimental evaluation of such properties as performance, code size, and\r\ncompilation time.\r\n* Investigation of SSP and its relation to and interaction with high-level loop transformations, as well as\r\ncomparison with approaches that combine loop nest transformation and traditional software pipelining.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact.\r\n*The developed framework provides opportunities for exploring other optimization\r\nobjectives and implementation issues, targeted to specific architectures \r\n* Basis for exploring SSP for architectures such as multithreading cellular architectures, and streaming applications.\r\n* The PIs plan to organize an annual combined CIS and ECE undergraduate poster forum which will include the participating undergraduates and contain a strong mentoring component.\r\n*Small experimental study components of this research will be developed to be used as research projects in\r\ngraduate compiler courses in both CIS and ECE. \r\n*Since  a robust, open source infrastructure is being used in trhis work, the resulting compiler with our techniques is highly available and easily disseminated to large groups.",
