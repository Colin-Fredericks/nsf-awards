 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nRotating machines based on fluid-film journal bearings are susceptible to \r\nflow-induced instability, which are caused by the mechanical-fluid flow \r\ndynamic interaction in the rotor-bearing system. Although flow-induced \r\ninstability was discovered 80 years ago, it still remains an unsolved \r\nproblem. This is indicative that the two most fundamental questions remain \r\nwithout definite answers: Can operating conditions that cause flow-induced \r\ninstability be accurately predicted? How can flow-induced instability be \r\nmitigated? The essential difficulty of the problem is flow-induced \r\ninstability is a highly nonlinear, coupled phenomenon. The PI believes \r\nsystems & control researchers can bring a fresh perspective to the problem \r\nthrough a systems theory-based approach. To that end, the research \r\nobjectives of this project are: i) develop models that predict the nonlinear \r\nmechanical-fluid flow dynamic interactions, ii) exploit stability analysis \r\ntools for nonlinear systems to better characterize flow-induced instability, \r\niii) conceive an innovative sensor/actuator paradigm for controlling the \r\ninstability, and iv) synthesize nonlinear feedback controllers.\r\n\r\nLSU, like many schools, has systems & control faculty and students \r\nthroughout several engineering departments. However, LSU is unique in that \r\nits Math Department is one of the few in the nation whose main focus area is \r\nmathematical control theory. To take advantage of this strength, LSU is in \r\nthe process of creating a Systems & Control Group that will comprise four \r\nEngineering departments and the Math Department. The educational plan of \r\nthis project will be a key component in this effort. The plan will include \r\nfour activities aimed at engaging a diverse community of students, promoting \r\ncross-disciplinary interactions, and increasing the ethnic/racial diversity \r\nof students attracted to the field: i) development of a much-needed control \r\nlaboratory course, ii) development of a systems & control \"tune-up\" workshop \r\nfor graduate students, iii) involvement and mentoring of minority students \r\nthrough collaborations with a local HBCU, and iv) development of a systems & \r\ncontrol summer camp for middle and high school students.\r\n\r\nThis research will attract the interest of researchers in the areas of fluid \r\nmechanics, tribology, and systems & control alike. The proposed activities \r\nwill advance the state-of-knowledge within and across these fields by \r\nintroducing innovative bearing concepts and new control design tools for \r\nuncertain nonlinear systems and infinite-dimensional systems. The broader \r\nimpacts include opportunities for minority students; outreach towards \r\nsecondary education; broadening the accessibility of systems & control to \r\nstudents across campus and across the state; and dissemination and \r\ntechnology transfer via the activities and industrial partnerships of the \r\nCenter for Rotating Machinery under establishment at LSU.\r\n\r\n",
