However, Greenland is characterized by large spatial  variations in climate and its controlling factors. Notably, summit temperature shows little correlation, whereas southwest Greenland coastal temperature shows strong negative correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The Principal Investigator will construct new high resolution decadal-scale records of temperature and effective precipitation for the past 8000 years from the laminated sediments of three closed basin lakes near the head of the Sondre Stromfjord.   The study is an outgrowth of recent research that found unprecedented abundances of long chain alkenones in the sediments of these lakes. The molecular and D/H ratios of alkenones will allow quantitative reconstruction of temperature and effective precipitation, while biomarker abundances and isotope ratios will provide additional assessment of lake biogeochemical changes. Lacustrine alkenone producers have remained elusive to biogeochemists for over 20 years. These study sites offer a unique opportunity to study the identity, diversity and evolution of alkenone producers in lakes using genetic sequencing and laboratory culturing, building upon our initial results indicating excellent preservation of haptophyte DNA in the sediments.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merits:  This study will provide new insights into the Holocene variability of\r\nclimate, NAO and lake biogeochemistry in southern west Greenland. Identification of the\r\nlacustrine alkenone producers will allow accurate culture calibration of alkenone unsaturation ratios to environmental variables. Comparative sequence analysis of 18S rDNA preserved in sediments will establish the diversity and evolution of haptophyte algae in the Greenland lakes.
