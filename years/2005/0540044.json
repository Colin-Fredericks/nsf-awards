 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support a symposium entitled \"Integration of Structural and Functional Genomics\" at Iowa State University (ISU) to be held on 22-25 September, 2005. The symposium is part of a series of symposia held over the past 10 years at ISU in the areas of Growth Factor and Signal Transduction. The purpose of the symposium is to gather together a wide variety of researchers involved in investigation of genome structure/function using molecular and computational biology tools, and statistical methods. With recent, rapid advancements in genome sequences of many vertebrates, the time is appropriate for more broad comparative approaches in the study of genome structure and function. The PIs have recruited 18 outstanding researchers in functional genomic analyses for the plenary addresses including four well-regarded female investigators.  This symposium will open up discussion of current research in this field and will help to focus attention on important new directions for future research. There will be plenary talks, a poster session for associated work to be presented and time allotted for informal discussion sessions and workshops.  A significant effort is outlined to include participation of students from under-represented groups. The university will use its connections with New Mexico State University and with the Minorities in Agriculture, Natural Resources and Related Sciences (MANRRS) to ensure minority student involvement.  Travel grants funded in part by this award will be available to students and junior faculty with special efforts made to support applicants from under-represented groups.  Funds from this grant also will be used to defray travel costs for invited speakers.",
