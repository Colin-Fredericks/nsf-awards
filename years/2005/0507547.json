The goal is to better\r\nunderstand the relativistic jets from such systems - both how they form and evolve.\r\nSpecific project goals are:\r\n1) The magnetic bomb model will be further developed and extended based on the\r\nmicroquasar GRS 1915+105. Many multi-wavelength aspects (X-ray, infrared, and\r\nradio light curves, spectral evolution, quasi periodic oscillations, etc.) will be\r\nincorporated and tested.\r\n2) New infrared spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimitry will be obtained with The\r\nGran Telescopio and The Canarias Infrared Camera Experiment imager (first light\r\nexpected in Oct. 2005). These high time resolution observations will concentrate on\r\nGRS 1915+105, but also include other microquasars. The new observations will\r\nfurther constrain the models.\r\n3) Near IR-photometry with the Kitt Peak National Observatory 4-meter telescope and\r\nthe Florida image slicer for infrared cosmology and astrophysics imaging\r\nspectrograph will be used to explore the environments of microquasars and possible\r\ninteractions, including possible termination shocks.\r\n4) A search for new microquasar systems will be undertaken using Chandra X-ray\r\narchive observations combined with Two Micron All Sky Survey data. Possible\r\ncandidates will be confirmed using infrared spectroscopy from the Canada-France-\r\nHawaii Telescope and Gemini. An extension of the search to use The Florida Multiobject\r\nImaging Near-IR Grism Observational Spectrometer-2 to obtain spectra of\r\n~5000 infrared sources near the Galactic center is also planned. Some 200-300 new\r\nX-ray binaries are expected to be found, doubling the number of known systems.\r\n5) The origins of microquasars/compact objects will also be explored through searches\r\nfor extragalactic X-ray binaries (particularly in starburst galaxies) which can in turn\r\nbe correlated with properties of their parent clusters (age, metallicity, mass function,\r\netc.) to better understand the origins of compact objects.",
