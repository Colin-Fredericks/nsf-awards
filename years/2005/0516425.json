 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the historical and ecological processes underlying high species diversity in the tropics has been the subject of intense interest and led to the formulation of many diversity hypotheses. In particular, the role of tropical forest \"refuges\", river barriers and ecological gradients in promoting speciation has been the subject of much recent debate. This study will use a molecular approach to test for these potential mechanisms of diversification by comparing spatial patterns of genetic variation in a suite of forest antelope species. Data from this study will then be used to test predicted patterns of genetic variation associated with these different diversification modes and examine their relative importance. In order to achieve the intense geographical sampling required for this study, this project will use dung from natural populations as a source of DNA. \r\n\r\nThe implementation of such a project relies heavily on the participation of collaborating host institutions comprising the Centre International de Recherches Medicales in Franceville, Gabon (CIRMF), the Universite des Sciences et Techniques de Masuku in Gabon (USTM) and the Gabon Program of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), a conservation NGO based in New York.  Through this collaboration, this project will stimulate exchange of expertise between African and U.S. participants and provide opportunities for technology transfer between countries. This study will not only provide important information on the potential mechanisms of diversification in the Afro-tropics but will also provide a molecular inventory of species distributions and solid genetic database for informing long-term conservation management of central African forest antelope. This award was co-funded by both EPSCoR and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).\r\n",
