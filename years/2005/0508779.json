 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present proposal consists of two major topics: A) \r\nsemiclassical (small dispersion) limit of the focusing Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation \r\n(NLS) and related problems, and; B) persistence of integrable dynamics, \r\nincluding homoclinic/heteroclinic solutions, of a system undergoing a singular perturbation. \r\nA) Numerical experiments of Bronski and McLauchlin revealed the formation of a region of violent and disorganized oscillations in the small dispersion limit of the focusing NLS. \r\nUsing the method of Riemann-Hilbert Problem (RHP), we found a way to track the evolution \r\nof our initial data into the region of ``violent and disorganized oscillations\" through the evolution of a hyperelliptic surface associated with the problem. Changes of the genus of this surface correspond to phase transitions in the evolution of our initial data. The pure radiational case was \r\nstudied completely in the joint work with Venakides and Zhou. Here we propose to study \r\nphase transitions in the most difficult case that includes both solitons and radiation. \r\nB) It has been recently proved (Tovbis, Pelinovsky) that persistence of homoclinic/heteroclinic \r\nsolutions to singularly perturbed 5th Kortveg - de Vries (KdV) equation can be expressed in terms of the Stokes' constants of certain (leading order) rescaled system. The proposed \r\ngoal is to develop the corresponding technique to other types of solutions and \r\nsystems, including stationary and moving travelling waves on lattices for NLS \r\nand other models. \r\n\r\nIt is well known that only a tiny portion of nonlinear systems used to model real world problems \r\nallows for explicit form mathematical solutions, leaving approximate methods \r\nand computer simulations to be the most used tools. Asymptotic methods play a prominent \r\nrole among approximate methods, as it is often easier to study a system in some \r\nasymptotic limit (say, infinite time) and then to allow some ``small\" corrections for large \r\nbut finite values of time. This approach was used for centures, for example, in celestian mechanics. However, ``small\" corrections are not necessarily small if the original and the limiting \r\nsystems exibit qualitatively different behavior. For example, a weakly coupled system \r\nof 2nd order nonlinear oscillators generically has a chaotic behavior whereas the limiting system \r\nof uncoupled oscillators has no chaos. Such systems, called singularly perturbed, are the \r\nmost difficult subject in the asymptotic analysis. The current proposal is focused on \r\ntwo still developing methods for singularly perturbed nonlinear problems: the method of \r\nRHP and of asymptotics beyond all orders. The first method will be used to find small dispersion limit of the focusing NLS - the problem that was open for many years. The NLS is the most frequently used model for nonlinear waves phenomena in physics, engineering, etc. The second method will be used to find when travelling waves solutions to KdV, NLS and some other integrable models survive singular perturbations, including discretizations. Solitons and travelling waves on lattices (discretized models) are rapidly becoming a very important topic, for example, in fiber optics (including periodic optical structures), design of computational numerical methods, etc.",
