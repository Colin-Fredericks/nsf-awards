 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design and development of powerful mechanisms for managing and mining large datasets of moving objects is an emerging direction in science and engineering informatics.  The subject becomes increasingly important as the world, as well as national security threats, become more mobile.  This project is investigating the issues related to the design and development of innovative methods for querying, analyzing, and mining of spatiotemporal information to find typical characteristics of the moving objects' trajectories, and uncover suspicious motion in large datasets of moving objects.  The moving objects datasets are in the form of either stored data or transient data streams.  The project is designing and implementing the MotionEye system prototype which consists of four subsystems: MotionQuest(DB) and MotionQuest(Stream) for querying and hypothesis validation in moving objects databases and data streams respectively, and MotionMine(DB) and MotionMine(Stream) for data mining in moving objects databases and data streams respectively. The project is investigating efficient and effective approaches to the implementation of these subsystems.  The project is also striving to ensure that the developed technology will not sacrifice individual privacy.  The project will enable the development of more advanced information systems in homeland security, law enforcement, traffic control, and other domains that deal with moving objects.",
