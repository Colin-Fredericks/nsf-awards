 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins are fascinating macromolecules with unique three-dimensional structures that endow them with diverse life-sustaining functions. Exploiting these functions for applications that could benefit society is limited by various factors, such as the marginal kinetic stability of proteins, which makes them susceptible to degradation. The term \"kinetic stability\" is used to describe the property of proteins whose structures are trapped in their functional state, and are therefore resistant to degradation. Few proteins in nature are kinetically stable, and unfortunately the chemical and physical basis for this property is poorly understood. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the structural basis of kinetic stability. The project involves the development of a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis assay for the high-throughput detection and quantification of kinetic stability. This novel assay will be used to screen the proteins expressed by various microorganisms and should result in the identification of many kinetically stable proteins. Those proteins emerging from the assay whose three-dimensional structures are known will be used to create a database that will be analyzed using computational approaches to elucidate the structural basis of kinetic stability. An expected outcome of the computational analysis is the generation of an algorithm that can predict whether a protein of known three-dimensional structure possesses kinetic stability. Thus, by revealing how nature has endowed some proteins with high kinetic stability without compromising their function, this project may have a broad impact on society by enabling the rational engineering of proteins. If successful, the knowledge obtained through this project could be applied to improve and expand the use of proteins in many applications, including biomaterials, biosensors, and bioremediation.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: This project will have an impact on our educational infrastructure by providing training and mentoring to graduate and undergraduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities. Students will work together in an intellectually stimulating environment that integrates mentoring, research training, and learning. Learning through hands-on research is the most effective method for exposing students to science and its career opportunities. Students will work in independent but related research projects that require their frequent interaction and collaboration, and weekly group meetings will provide them a forum to present their research to the other members of the laboratory. Yearly participation at local or national meetings will give students an opportunity to disseminate their results through poster presentations, and will expose them to the broader scientific community and new areas of research.",
