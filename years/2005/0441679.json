 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the difficulties of authoring intelligent tutoring systems.  Intelligent Tutoring Systems have proven to be highly effective in delivering computer-based instruction, but have historically been expensive and difficult to build, requiring specialized skill in Artificial Intelligence and production systems programming.  This proposal describes a Software Development Kit (SDK) composed of four components:  Cognitive Model Authoring, Problem Authoring,   Tool Authoring, and Curriculum Authoring.  The proposed research activity centers on the first of these components:  Cognitive Model Authoring.  Cognitive Model Authoring is comprised of three separate steps:  defining an object hierarchy, defining the goal structure of the problem task, and representing the behavior of the instructional system.  The proposal is to define an object-oriented visualization of these steps, so that non-cognitive scientists can create cognitive tutors.  This tool will decrease the amount of time it takes to author the cognitive model portion of a tutor for an experienced cognitive modeler, and it also will decrease the amount of time it takes for a new person with no cognitive modeling experience to come up to speed with creating cognitive models\r\n\r\nThe Cognitive Tutor SDK will have two impacts: 1) easier production of new Cognitive Tutors, and hence the ability to bring them to market more quickly and 2) development of  a Software  Development  Kit that could be independently marketed, enabling other companies to produce intelligent tutors in other domains, languages, countries and markets.  There are four markets for the Cognitive Tutor SDK: internal developers, external users interested in adapting existing tutor materials for related markets (prisons, welfare-to-work programs), internal and external developers of tutors in related mathematical disciplines, and external developers of tutors in other domains.  The emphasis on accountability in education provides a strong market need for effective instruction, which should help drive the desire for proven technology like Intelligent Tutoring Systems.\r\n",
