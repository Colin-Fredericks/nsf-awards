 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education initiative, NSF 05-543, category NUE.  Through this award, funded by the Chemistry Division, Prof. Dean H. Johnston and Prof. Dave Robertson of Otterbein College will develop activities to expose large numbers of undergraduate students at Otterbein College in introductory Chemistry and Physics courses with hands-on activities in nanoscience.  In addition, they will develop integrated Chemistry/Physics courses for upper-division students around a common theme of nanoscience.\r\n\r\nOne broader impact of the proposed work comes from the efforts that this NUE team will make to expand Otterbein's existing nanotechnology partnerships with the Columbus, Ohio public school system.  Through this award, Prof. Johnston and his colleagues will develop educational materials and provide equipment to Columbus school teachers to help them introduce nanotechnology to their students.  In addition, portable scanning tunneling microscopes will be made available for use in the local high schools.\r\n",
