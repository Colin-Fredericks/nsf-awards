 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current project proposes research on three subjects: 1) tensor categories \r\nand Hopf algebras; 2) dynamical R-matrices and special functions, and\r\n3) Cherednik algebras, Calogero-Moser systems. In the first area, \r\nthe PI plans to construct new examples of finite tensor categories, \r\nboth semisimple and nonsemisimple, and classify module categories \r\nover given tensor categories. In the second area, the PI plans to \r\nstudy elliptic hypergeometric functions of Felder and Varchenko \r\nusing representation theory of quantum affine algebras and \r\ndynamical R-matrices, and to prove the De Concini conjecture about \r\nquantum Weyl groups and the Felder-Varchenko conjectures\r\non the properties of elliptic hypergeometric functions. In the third area, \r\nthe PI plans to study finite dimensional representations of symplectic \r\nreflection algebras, their large $N$ limits (double Yangians),\r\nhyperbolic analogs (Gan-Ginzburg algebras), and ``topological\r\nanalogs'' (Hecke algebras of various braid groups). He plans to prove \r\nalgebraic PBW theorems for deformations of group algebras which \r\nare similar to double affine Hecke algebras. He also plans to study \r\nthe connections of this subject with representations of quivers. \r\n\r\nThe current project is at the crossroads of several mathematical areas -- \r\nrepresentation theory, mathematical physics, theory of integrable systems, \r\nspecial functions. The theory of Cherednik algebras and Calogero-Moser spaces\r\noriginates from a remarkable family of orthogonal polynomials of several \r\nvariables called Macdonald polynomials. These polynomials are a very \r\nbroad generalization of the classical Legendre polynomials arising in \r\nthe study of the hydrogen atom, and they have an incredibly rich structure. \r\nSimilarly to this classical case, Macdonald polynomials are eigenstates \r\nof a quantum Hamiltonian (Macdonald operator), which defines an \r\nintegrable quantum-mechanical system, in the sense that one can \r\nexactly solve it. Representation theory allows us to use symmetry to \r\nunderstand the structure of Macdonald polynomials. Similarly to how the \r\nrotational symmetry of the hydrogen atom is instrumental in the study of its \r\nquantum-mechanical properties, the structure of Macdonald polynomials \r\nis uncovered using the quantum group and Cherednik algebra symmetry. \r\nThe theory of tensor categories, which is another subject of this proposal, \r\nis also instrumental in understanding quantum systems, since the \r\nrepresentation-theoretical structure expressing the symmetry of many \r\nsuch systems takes the shape of a tensor category.",
