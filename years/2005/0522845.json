The specific objectives are: \r\n1. Investigate and develop forward XY scanning MEMS devices for OCT and OCM imaging. Forward imaging devices enable high NA focusing and smaller device diameters. Novel, two-axis fiber and micro lens scanners that can perform arbitrary XY scanning will be developed. \r\n2. Investigate and develop MEMS focus tracking to enable high transverse resolution, 3D OCT/OCM imaging. Soft deformable lenses and mirrors will be investigated to enable full integration of lens actuation. \r\n3. Investigate and develop large MEMS mirrors for high-resolution and high-NA imaging. Large mirrors (3 to 5 mm) will be developed and can perform high-resolution beam scanning or high-NA focusing\r\n4. Investigate high-speed OCT imaging using spectral/Fourier detection. \r\n5. Investigate and develop a hand held OCT ophthalmoscope for retinal imaging. Vertically integrated research with validation in normal subjects and patients with retinal disease will be performed. \r\n6. Investigate high-speed OCT imaging using swept-source/Fourier detection. This technology will enable a wide range of new OCT applications, including in vivo 3D OCT imaging. \r\n7. Investigate optical coherence microscopy (OCM) for cellular-level imaging. OCM uses coherence gating in combination with en face scanning to achieve high transverse resolution. This technique can image with lower NA than confocal imaging and will enable cellular-level endoscopic imaging. \r\n8. Investigate and develop handheld OCT and OCM imaging probes. The combination of MEMS scanning with new OCT and OCM technology will enable the development of compact, handheld imaging probes. \r\n9. Develop GRIN rod needle imagine probes. Handheld probes with GRIN lenses will enable the development of imaging needles that can perform OCT or OCM imaging inside solid organs or tumors. \r\n10. Investigate and develop flexible endoscopes. MEMS scanning technology will enable the development of smaller-diameter endoscopes for intraluminal imaging. Validation studies will be performed in animals, and clinical feasibility studies \r\n",
