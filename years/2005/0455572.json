 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is submitted under category B (Resources for Professional Development) of the TPC solicitation.  The Dana Center of the University of Texas at Austin proposes to create a system of online and face-to-face support services to strengthen the teaching and learning of Algebra II.  The resources will make use of technology, will differentiate support for teachers in various stages of their careers and aim to serve teachers of under-achieving populations of students.  \r\n\r\nSupport will be provided for four critical aspects of a teacher's work:  Instructional planning, instructional delivery, instructional outcomes assessment and professional capacity development. \r\n\r\nA comprehensive work plan includes pilot testing, revision and field testing.  Dissemination will begin in the fourth year of the project with web publication of the materials.  In addition, presentations will be made at national conferences and articles prepared for publication.  \r\n\r\nEvaluation, both formative and summative, will proceed through structured surveys, interviews and site visits.  Materials will be reviewed by content experts.  Teacher learning will be assessed in a novel way, with the development of protocols for observing teachers in their analysis of student work.\r\n",
