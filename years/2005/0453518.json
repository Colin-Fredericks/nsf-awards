 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the U. of North Dakota. The REU Site will be affiliated with the Physics Department.  Research activities include projects in condensed matter physics, astronomy and astrophysics. Seven undergraduate students will be recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research experience.  Recruitment efforts focus on the Upper Midwest and the Native American student population. In addition to research activities, students will take part in professional enrichment activities such as seminars, workshops, and moderated discussion groups dealing with ethical, moral, ideological, and proprietary issues relevant to scientific research. Students will visit several federally funded research laboratories in the area, and will take part on group social activities. Students will present the results of their research at the North Dakota Undergraduate Research Symposium held each year in August.\r\n\r\nThe REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
