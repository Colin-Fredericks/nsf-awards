 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a US-Polish workshop on spatial and stochastic phenomena in gene regulation and signaling pathways.  The workshop will be held in Bedlewo, Poland in connection with the international conference in Mathematical Modeling in Biology, May 29-June 3, 2005.  The organizers of the workshop are Dr. Marek Kimmel from Rice University and Dr. Tomasz Lipniacki from the Institute for Fundamental Technological Research in Warsaw, Poland. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will be devoted to mathematical modeling of metabolic pathways of cellular and intracellular processes, particularly their stochastic and spatial aspects.  Its purpose is to explore novel aspects of both types of models, using biologically important examples of signaling pathways, including the NFkB and interferon pathways and pathways governing developmental processes of the organism.\r\n\r\nThis workshop on mathematical modeling fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.  Bringing together such experts could greatly enhance cross dissemination of recent research findings and help advance the state-of-the art.",
