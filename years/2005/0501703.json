ICONS offers an Associate of Science (A.S.) Degree in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and two certificate programs, one in Metropolitan Optical Networking and the other in Advanced Optical Networks, focusing on the growing fields of Internet Protocol (IP) convergence and fiber optic communications. ICONS curriculum is being developed in conjunction with industry representatives as well as the ICT Skills Standards produced by NSSB. In addition, ICONS provides faculty development in the fields of convergence and optical and network systems and assists other colleges in implementing technician training that focuses on this emerging discipline. \r\n\r\nThrough the ATE-funded National Center for Telecommunications Technologies (NCTT) at Springfield Community College in Massachusetts and the Institute for Telecommunications Technologies at Cuyamaca College, El Cajon, California, ICONS staff members are disseminating the ICONS model curriculum to community colleges nationwide.
