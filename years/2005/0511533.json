 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on the discovery of driving forces that support\r\nthe Kraichnan theory of 2-D fully developed turbulence.  In recent work\r\nthe investigators and their collaborators have identified critical wave\r\nnumbers expressed as averages of different norms of the solution to the\r\nNavier-Stokes equations (NSE).  These wave numbers provide necessary, and\r\nnearly sufficient conditions for the Kraichnan theory to hold.  This team\r\nhas also localized to some extent the global attractor of the NSE in a\r\nplane spanned by two of these norms (one being the energy), to help\r\nunderstand which driving forces produce these conditions.  The proposed\r\nwork will combine this analysis with computational optimization to zero in\r\non such forces, and then study in detail the turbulent features they\r\nproduce.  The mathematical treatment of turbulence is largely driven by\r\nthe heuristic theories of Kolmogorov, Batchelor and Kraichnan.  The\r\napproach taken in projecting the attractor however, seems to be entirely\r\nnew.  The information provided by this analysis will guide the\r\ncomputational component which otherwise would be confronted with a vast\r\nlandscape of possible driving forces to consider.\r\n\r\nTurbulence is readily observed in three-dimensional physical space\r\ndomains.  Most people think of a bumpy plane rides (in this case the\r\ndomain is the volume around the airplane).  Like the swirls generated by\r\nrocks in a stream, rapidly changing patterns form in the air around the\r\nplane.  Turbulence theories do not attempt to predict the precise\r\ndevelopment of these patterns, but rather find (a) consistent laws which\r\ndescribe how, on average, energy is transferred to smaller length scales,\r\nand (b) critical length scales at which this this phenomenon changes. \r\nTrue 2-D flows in nature are less prevalent.  The most prominent example,\r\nthe earth's atmosphere, is actually a thin 3-D domain, whose behavior\r\napproaches that of a 2-D flow.  The fate of energy over different length\r\nscales is more complicated for 2-D flow, though that of 3-D flow is in\r\nsome sense embedded into it.  Though 2-D experiments are difficult to\r\ncarry out in the laboratory, they allow for much finer study on a\r\ncomputer.  Of all 2-D flows, the one studied in this project is arguably\r\nthe most amenable to analysis and efficient simulation.  Yet it is\r\nfundamental, not only to 2-D and nearly 2-D flows such as the atmosphere,\r\nbut also to 3-D turbulence due to universality. \r\n",
