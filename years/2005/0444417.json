 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Framework for Next-generation Scheduling and Task Management \r\nfor Extreme-scale Computing\r\n\r\nKang G. Shin and Abhijit Bose\r\nThe University of Michigan\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research project is to develop efficient \r\nalgorithms and robust software for scheduling and resource management in \r\nsupport of extreme-scale computing. Such computations may involve tens \r\nof thousands of processors configured as a high-end computing system. \r\nMore efficient scheduling and resource management systems than those \r\ncurrently used are needed to address scalability and fault-tolerance for \r\nsuch large systems. The same argument also holds for the increasingly \r\ncomplex requirements of many emerging applications. The \r\ncurrent-generation schedulers primarily manage a cluster of CPUs that \r\nare configured statically for an application. An application is \r\nallocated a  fixed number of processors or nodes (for SMP systems), and \r\nis not expected to modify its resource requirement during the execution. \r\nThis may result in lower resource utilization. Furthermore, most of the \r\ncurrent schedulers do not provide transparent fault-tolerance to the \r\nrunning workload. One or more processor/node failures often terminate \r\nthe currently-executing task on these processors, resulting in wasted \r\ncycles. Fault-tolerant scheduling will be critical to the scalability of \r\nfuture HEC systems to an extremely large number of processors. The \r\nincreasing usage of high-end systems for both computation- and \r\ndata-intensive applications requires that future scheduling systems must \r\naddress the problem of co-scheduling CPUs, I/O and network resources \r\nwhen mapping tasks to appropriate resources. In some HEC architectures, \r\nthe placement of processes has an effect on the overall performance of \r\nthe application due to the underlying interconnection topology. Both \r\nco-scheduling and workload-aware scheduling will be important for future \r\nhigh-end computing systems.\r\n\r\nAn integrated software framework will be developed for scheduling \r\nand resource management for extreme-scale computing systems that \r\nprovides the following capabilities: (i) on-line workload \r\ncharacterization, (ii) predictive scheduling based on time-series \r\nmodeling and forecasting of resource utilization and queued workload, \r\n(iii) transparent fault-tolerant scheduling of applications that are \r\ninterrupted by one or more faults, and (iv) efficient heuristic and \r\nevolutionary algorithms that consider the workload and resource \r\ncharacteristics and forecasts as part of the scheduling decision.\r\nThis work represents a mix of scheduling theory and robust \r\nsoftware development. These algorithms and the software framework in \r\na production HEC environment at the Center \r\nfor Advanced Computing (CAC) at the University of Michigan. The CAC HEC \r\nfacility provides a testbed consisting of over 1400 CPUs representing\r\nmultiple processor families (AMD Athlons, Opterons, Apple Xserve/G5) and \r\nseveral interconnection systems such as Gigabit Ethernet and Myrinet.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research will be to advance the \r\nstate-of-the-art in scheduling and resource management for HEC systems. \r\nBy implementing and deploying the proposed framework at CAC, we will be \r\nable to collect realistic workload traces from a diverse array of \r\nend-users and applications. This research will serve as a catalyst for \r\nthe development of robust fault-tolerant scheduling algorithms and their \r\nimplementation software for such systems. We specifically address the \r\nscalability of fault-tolerance mechanisms such as checkpointing/restart\r\nand I/O that can scale across thousands of processors. Furthermore, our \r\nproposed integration of research, outreach and education activities will \r\nmake broader impacts to other HEC centers and the scheduling research \r\ncommunity. The framework developed as part of this project and our \r\nresearch results will be disseminated to industry and academia through \r\nopen-source software and high-quality publications.\r\n",
