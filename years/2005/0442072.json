To further enhance the usefulness of the method, theoretical tools involving computer-aided process design, the  thermodynamics  of  protein  adsorption,  and  bioinformatics, will be developed  and employed.  The proposed SDC method involves the formation of a self-generated, retained pH gradient consisting of a series of self-sharpening pH fronts, which propagate inside an ion-exchange column, which will use nanometer-sized particles as a packing material.  This project will address three prototypical  uses  in  the  field  of  proteomics:  (1)  its  use  as  an  efficient  prefractionation method prior in 2D gel electrophoresis, (2) its use as a rapid separation method for use in high-throughput proteomics, and (3) its use as a non-denaturing first separation dimension in a 2D zymogram  method  for  detecting  enzymatic  activity.  In terms of the broader impacts, the  work  has applications  in  several  areas  of  critical  national  importance,  such  as  in  the  search  for  new diagnostic markers for diseases and in the rapid identification of microorganisms for food safety and counter-bioterrorism. In addition, the proposed work is an interdisciplinary study  that  involves  aspects  of  chromatographic  process engineering,  bioanalytical  chemistry,  and  applied  biology, so that students working on the project will be well prepared to join the U.S. workforce in the biotechnology area.  Through the Meyerhoff scholarship program, students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels will be recruited to work on this project, which will help to increase the number minorities working in the U.S. biotechnology industry.\r\n",
