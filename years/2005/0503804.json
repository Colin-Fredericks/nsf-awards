 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe principal investigator intends to prove new subconvex bounds for \r\nautomorphic L-functions or improve on existing subconvex bounds. Such \r\nbounds reflect the arithmetic nature of their source objects as they cannot \r\nbe derived from simple analytic principles. In return, they provide the key to \r\nthe solution of several deep diophantine problems addressing equidistribution \r\nphenomena. Proving these bounds unconditionally also sheds light on the \r\nGeneralized Riemann Hypothesis as they are consequences of it. In the focus \r\nof the proposal are families of  GL(2) x GL(1)  and  GL(2) x GL(2)  type. The \r\ntechniques leading to subconvex bounds for these families have so far been \r\nrestricted to the field of rational numbers or holomorphic forms. The principal \r\ninvestigator will try to extend these techniques to totally real number fields and \r\nnon-holomorphic forms.\r\n\r\nThis proposal belongs to the theory of integers. Because of their fundamental \r\ncharacter, integers are at the source of many theoretical and practical \r\nconstructions including algorithms for secure communication through the internet \r\nor efficient communication through a noisy channel. Automorphic forms and \r\ntheir L-functions are among the mathematical objects that make the hidden \r\nsymmetries of integers visible. It has been observed, but not proved rigorously in \r\na single instance, that the zeros of every automorphic L-function are distributed \r\nin a very special way. This observation is the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis \r\nwhich implies many otherwise unknown properties of the integers. For various \r\nimportant questions a weaker hypothesis, concerning the size of L-functions, \r\nsuffices. The principal investigator intends to prove new instances of this weaker \r\nhypothesis.",
