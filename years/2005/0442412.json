 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenotypes of organisms (i.e., their morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits) vary enormously.  A central goal of biology is to understand how these different traits are produced (i.e., what physiological mechanisms produce them) and why these traits exist (i.e., what is their adaptive significance or why did they evolve).  In this CRUI program, the investigators will study two traits (adult body size and time to reach adulthood) in several neighboring Florida populations of lubber grasshoppers (Romalea microptera) that differ in mean body size.  They will use laboratory studies to determine whether these traits are determined by environmental effects, inherent genetic differences between the populations, or the interaction of environment and genetics.  They will use field studies to determine the effects of these traits on the survival and reproductive success of individuals in the local environment.  In short, these studies will enable scientists to understand both how these traits are produced and why these traits are adaptive. \r\n\r\nThis project will require a cross-disciplinary approach from the fields of evolutionary biology, ecology, physiology, chemistry and mathematics.  The project will integrate these fields using mathematical modeling methods (e.g., Artificial Neural Networks, Life Table Models).  These methods will be used to develop predictive models for the effects of environmental and genetic factors on adult body size and the time to adulthood and will help evaluate the adaptive significance of these traits in the field.  Thus, this cross-disciplinary program will merge math, biochemistry, physiology, and ecology to address issues of considerable biological importance.  \r\n\r\nThe educational goal is to foster the scientific careers of undergraduates through cross-disciplinary research. The investigators will guide undergraduates through proposal preparation, data collection and analysis, meeting presentations, and publication.  This program will train students in modeling and statistics, improving their understanding of quantitative methods.  The investigators will enhance opportunities for under-represented groups by recruiting students from the ISU Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and by providing research opportunities to students from predominantly Native American colleges near the Florida field sites.
