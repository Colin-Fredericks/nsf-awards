 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Leary will continue research on geometric group theory,\r\ngeometric topology and L2-cohomology, both alone and in collaboration.\r\nIn particular, he will construct groups for which the classifying\r\nspace for proper actions has surprising finiteness properties.  He\r\nwill also develop and study a functor that preserves homology but\r\nreplaces an arbitrary topological space by a space admitting a\r\nnon-positively curved metric.  This work should have applications to\r\ntopology, algebraic K-theory and group theory.  Thirdly, he will\r\ncontribute to the study of L2-cohomology, by computing this invariant\r\nfor a large class of topological spaces, including the complements of\r\nhyperplane arrangements.\r\n\r\nA group is the mathematician's abstraction of the notion\r\nof symmetry:  groups measure symmetry in the same way that\r\nnumbers measure quantity.  Some of the most interesting\r\ngroups arise from geometry, such as the collection of\r\nsymmetries of a tiling of the plane.  Professor Leary\r\naims to construct groups that share many of the properties\r\nof groups coming from tilings, but that cannot arise from\r\nany `tiling' of any space.  In a different direction, he\r\nhopes to show that some aspects of geometry can be modeled\r\n(in a certain precise sense) within the theory of groups.\r\nThis should lead to new insights within both geometry and\r\ngroup theory.\r\n",
