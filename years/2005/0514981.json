 "awd_abstract_narration": "National Geographic Television is producing a large-format, 3D film, \"Sea Monsters,\" about prehistoric marine reptiles.  The project will also include formative and summative evaluations, educational materials for home, after-school and classroom use, professional development for educators, an interactive website and innovative outreach to underserved youth.  The film will present the current scientific understanding of Mesozoic marine ecosystems and the biology and behavior of prehistoric marine reptiles.  The storyline of the films sets paleontological discovery into historical context, and reveals much about the scientific method and process of inquiry.  Innovative intercutting between live-action paleontology sequences and photo realistic 3D animation of the reptiles will bring the fossils to life and allow audiences to make connections between the remains that are uncovered and the reptiles' activities, all of which are driven by concrete evidence in the fossil record.  Sea Monsters will have a strategic impact on the field of informal science education by using groundbreaking computer-generated imagery technologies, and by demonstrating that a strong, dramatic storyline is a powerful and effective method for communicating scientific concepts.  Standards-based lesson plans for the classroom and informal activity guides for families will augment the impact of the film.  National Geographic has teamed with leading scientific experts and formal and informal education specialists to inform and advise the project.  Multimedia Research and Knight-Williams Research Communication, respectively, will conduct formative and summative research.",
