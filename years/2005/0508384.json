An Agency representative will introduce a Speaker on a particular topic of interest to the Metabolic Engineering Working Group.   The emphasis of this Conference will be on \"Strategies for Product Development\".  Five Speakers are scheduled to discuss the Metabolic Engineering associated with Industrial Chemicals, Plastics/Polymers, Pharmaceuticals/Nutraceuticals, Food/Seed Oils, and Fuels.  Three Speakers are from Industry and two from Academia.  A Panel Session is also scheduled at the end of the Conference and is to be interactive among the Conference Attendees and the Conference Speakers.  Proceedings from the Conference will provide important information that will enable the realization of the full potential of Metabolic Engineering. \r\n\r\nThe Conference is scheduled to be held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) on February 3, 2005.   Information generated at this Conference may be useful for planning purposes for MEWG and the Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology (BEB) Program in the Bioengineering and Environmental Systems (BES) Division of NSF, and will be distilled into a report for NSF and the MEWG.   This report is to be posted on the publicly available Metabolic Engineering Web Site (http://www.metabolicengineering.gov). \r\n",
