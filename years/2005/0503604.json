 "awd_abstract_narration": "Track 2:  Diversity in Geosciences: Development of a \"Pipeline\"\r\nfor Native American Students\r\n\r\nThe objective of the four-year \"pipeline\" is to develop geosciences research and educational opportunities for Native American students at both the secondary and college levels. This \"pipeline\" has three major components.  An education and research enrichment program for 7-12th grade Native American students will integrate indigenous knowledge into the geosciences and provide research experiences for teachers who work in schools with a high percentage of Native American students.  An introductory undergraduate geoscience course will integrate indigenous knowledge into the geosciences, use Native American Art as a vehicle of learning, and acknowledge the learning styles of Native American students.  An internship program will provide research internship opportunities in the geosciences to Native American students. \r\nThe enrichment program for 7-12th grade Native American students, operated cooperatively by the Native American Studies program and the College of Geosciences at OU, includes: a) a one-day geoscience workshop at OU for approximately 100 Native American students featuring group discussions, hands-on laboratories, a discussion of career paths, and a one-day science fair; b) geoscience education and outreach programs for schools, parents, tribal elders, community leaders, and the general public; and c) the Geosciences American Indian Math and Science Society's summer Research Institute for 15 to 30 participants in two one-week summer sessions. The introductory undergraduate geoscience course follows an Earth Systems Science approach and includes a \"connectedness with the planet\" theme. The research internship program provides opportunities for Native American students to work at the forefront of geosciences research with faculty in geography, geology, and meteorology.  The University will provide funding for an Outreach Coordinator for two years at 50% FTE after the grant has ended to sustain the project.  \r\n",
