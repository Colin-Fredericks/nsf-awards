 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sheldon Jackson College (SJC) proposes to increase the number of Alaska Native\r\nstudents matriculating in and completing its STEM programs by (1) adjusting its STEM offerings\r\nto more effectively meet the employment needs of the Alaskan economy , particularly the needs\r\nof resource-rich Alaska Native owned corporations, (2) preparing Native students for success in\r\nSTEM programs through a summer academic enrichment program and ongoing academic support\r\nonce students enroll in college, and (3) developing and implementing faculty development to\r\nenhance effectiveness in teaching Alaska Native students at Sheldon Jackson College with an\r\nemphasis on STEM faculty.\r\nCurriculum. GOAL: To strengthen the four degree programs requiring extensive\r\nSTEM preparation : Ecology; Fishery Biology & Culture; Marine Biology; and Secondary\r\nEducation - Science by providing graduates with emergent job-ready knowledge. While the panel\r\nfound these degree emphases generally responsive to employment needs within the Alaskan\r\neconomy, they identified the following gaps to be addressed as objectives under this goal:\r\nOBJECTIVES: 1) Establish and provide instructional capacity in the use of Geographic\r\nInformation Systems (GIS); 2) provision of a stronger theoretical orientation in ecology, fisheries\r\nand marine biology coursework; 3) establish and offer a course that comprehensively surveys the\r\nenormously diverse Alaskan environment, its natural resources, and its resource management\r\nneeds.\r\nStudent needs. GOAL: To strengthen Native student success in STEM coursework that\r\nleads to degrees in sciences and mathematics. Data compiled by the Alaska Department of\r\nEducation and Alaskan school districts reflect that Native high school students achieve far below\r\naverage in comparison to other Alaskan students, especially in math. SJC's experience indicates\r\nthat first-semester developmental coursework is insufficient to effectively prepare students for\r\ncollege level courses. Earlier intervention is required, and can be informed by data identified and\r\nquantified through High School Graduation Qualifying Exam and the No Child Left Behind Act\r\ntesting provisions.\r\nOBJECTIVES: 1) Establish and provide a summer academic enrichment program in\r\nmath and science for Native high school students in partnership with school districts. 2) Provide\r\ncampus-based academic support services wrapped around math and science course work.\r\nFaculty development. GOAL: To strengthen the effectiveness of SJC faculty in\r\nteaching and mentoring Native students in their STEM courses. Available literature indicates that\r\nintercultural classroom communications is complex and frequently counterintuitive, and yet,\r\npreparation for teaching in culturally diverse classrooms is seldom a requirement for college\r\nfaculty.\r\nOBJECTIVE: 1) To establish and provide pre-academic-year cross-cultural education\r\nfaculty workshops, and participation in ongoing workshops as opportunities arise. This will\r\ninclude 2) participation in school year-end assessment and refinement of the College's strategies\r\nin supporting Alaska Native student success, particularly in the sciences and math.",
