 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of the Conference on Nanoscale Devices and System Integration (NDSI) is a highly focused review of the latest progress in the development of nanoscale devices and component integration of nanoscale systems as well as to single out promising trends in the field as a whole. The conference has a single session format with the invited papers forming the body of the conference. The major topics related to nanotechnology including nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, spintronics, nanomagnetics, nanorobotics, nano/bio inspired systems, fabrication at nanoscale, advance lithography, and nanomaterials are showcased at the conference. The conference provides numerous opportunities for networking among the conference participant, thus promoting the generation of new ideas, striking new collaborations, and advancing the nanoscale science and technology as a whole.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The specific goal of this funding request is to facilitate student attendance of the Conference. The rationale for the funding request is a strong impact that the participation in such conferences makes on student education. The all-invited-speaker format of the meeting allows students to gain an insight into the technology trends as well as to rapidly educate themselves in a broad array of nanotechnology topics. A three-day conference will include approximately 45 invited talks (mornings and early afternoons) and 60 selected contributed poster presentations (evenings). Regular breaks between the sessions, the well received tradition of the past IEEE conferences led by the PI's, enable the students to have fruitful discussions and to network with the leaders in the field. \r\n\r\nA panel discussion \"Nanotechnology: present and future challenges\" will be held on the second day of the conference, April 5, 2005. The panelists from major funding agencies and leading nanotechnology groups will present their views and answer the questions about the trends in nanoscale science and engineering. We believe that participation in such activities is beneficial to the education and future careers of the student attendees.\r\n",
