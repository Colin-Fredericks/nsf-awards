 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  Ceramic materials have long been recognized as having electronic, thermal or physical properties with unique applications in science and technology.  Only recently however has it been shown that specially processed ceramics can acquire adequate transparency to meet the requirements for medical imaging, novel laser technology and other high intensity illumination sources.  Transparent ceramics have already achieved unprecedented performance in x-ray CAT scan detectors, energy-conserving metal-halogen lamps for consumer applications, and high average power solid-state lasers.  In this project, transparent ceramics are studied with sophisticated optical techniques to determine whether preparation by an American-patented technique that maintains ultra-fine grain structure in the processed material yields advantages or unique applications associated with the nano-structure.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:  This project utilizes spectroscopy based on second- and third-order optical nonlinearities in transparent nano-structured ceramics to provide a firm scientific foundation for understanding emergent optical ceramic technology.  It is designed to search for and examine (i) unexpectedly large nonlinear response, (ii) quantum size effects, and (iii) \"tunability\" between glass and single crystal material properties, that is expected to derive solely from the nano-structure of the ceramics themselves.  The experimental program relies on cutting edge techniques that provide excellent training ground for graduate students, and an international collaboration that is a much-needed step in the direction of worldwide cooperation in science as well as the diversification of American science.\r\n\r\nThis work is jointed supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Materials Research.\r\n",
