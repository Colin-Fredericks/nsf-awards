 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore two main themes: 1) the application of novel diffraction techniques to examine, with atomic-scale spatial resolution, solid surfaces and materials;  2) a real-time study of solvation in the condensed phase. The intellectual merit of these research activities stem from the development of novel experimental techniques and theoretical methods, both of which are aimed at defining concepts for the role of dynamics in functions.  Techniques to be developed and used in this research include femtosecond spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, electron diffraction (crystallography), and molecular biology.  The objectives include resolving and studying important features of the dynamics involved in the correlation of structure to function and to the transition from the mesoscopic to the condensed-phase limit. Studies of microscopic solvation, molecular recognition, and surface recognition and reactivity offer a unique opportunity to test, on a fundamental level, molecular interactions under controlled conditions of size, density, and distance, and with atomic-scale resolution.  These studies cover elementary and complex molecular systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, the goal is to examine the dynamical nature of matter and life molecules at the atomic scale of motion.  Only with femtosecond (a millionth of a billionth of a second) time resolution can we observe such motion.  The uncovering of the behavior of atoms and molecules is fundamental to our understanding of the properties of matter and to how life molecules do their function, and in turn, for our potential control of future materials and molecular behavior in, e.g., drug recognition by genes.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project will significantly influence three major areas:  First, the impact on other fields, in particular materials science, nanoscience, and bioscience; Second, the development of novel techniques for the advancement of new technologies, and vice versa, for this particular project, in ultrafast imaging and optics - one of these advancements, the development of ultrafast electron crystallography (UEC) constitutes, for its uniqueness, a national resource; thirdly, there is a significant emphasis on advancing educational objectives.  This group at Caltech has had over the years more than 200 graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and visiting associates, the majority of whom are now in leading academic, industrial, and educational positions. This project will assure a significant impact in preparing future leaders in science and technology for positions in industry, university, and national laboratories. This project is co-funded by the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
