 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the development of a more complete understanding of the\r\nprocesses that cause fractionation of 30Si and 28Si during soil development. Herein, measurements are\r\npresented that demonstrate interpretable patterns of change as unweathered minerals derived from basalt\r\nand granite are transformed during weathering. During the early stages of weathering d30Si values of soil\r\nsolids decrease whereas the d30Si values of soil solution increase relative to the parent material.\r\nEventually, secondary minerals begin to weather releasing Si that has lower d30Si that parent material and\r\ntherefore the d30Si signatures of soil solution and leaching water decreases. Globally, the results are in\r\nagreement with predictions based on the d30Si values of igneous rocks, large rivers and ocean water, but\r\nthey raise fundamental questions regarding the fate of Si isotopes as minerals weather, secondary\r\nminerals are formed, and dissolved Si is leached. The d30Si signatures of the reactants and products of\r\nweathering should be the most effective tracer of Si, but more needs to be understood about the behavior\r\nof Si isotopes in different aspects of this complex system.\r\nThe proposed research will develop a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of the\r\nprocesses that produce Si isotopic fractionations during weathering and soil formation. It will combine\r\nsystematic field- and laboratory-based experiments and measurement of the changes in Si-isotope\r\ncomposition in solid and aqueous phases in order to isolate the reactions that are most strongly\r\nresponsible for driving changes in d30Si values. The experiments target the following processes in which\r\nSi participates: 1) dissolution of primary and secondary minerals, 2) precipitation of secondary minerals,\r\n3) the combined impact of near-simultaneous dissolution and precipitation reactions, and 4) the integrated\r\naspects of weathering, leaching and clay synthesis. The first 3 of these experiments will be in-lab benchtop\r\nexperiments; and the fourth will utilize two ongoing experiments at the US Geological Survey, one\r\nutilizing leaching columns, the other a well-monitored soil chronosequence. The first 3 experiments\r\nsimplify soil processes to insure maximum interpretability whereas the column and field experiments\r\nmeasure the integrated results of complex soil forming processes. The chronosequence is in arkosic parent\r\nmaterial, and thus will add a useful dimension to an existing database on silicon isotopic changes\r\nassociated with progressive weathering in the Hawaiian basaltic chronosequence.\r\nChemical weathering unlocks elements from the lithosphere allowing them to participate in dynamic\r\nbiogeochemical reactions in terrestrial and ultimately marine systems. Silicon is the second most\r\nabundant element in the Earth's crust and the dominant solute in rivers that drain continents supplying at\r\nleast 80% of the dissolved Si entering oceans. The broader impact of this proposal lies in the importance\r\nof capturing the power of Si isotopes as a tracer for silicate weathering, and the subsequent participation\r\nof Si in Earth surface and ecosystem processes. Silicate weathering is critical for buffering acid rain, for\r\nlong-term regulation of atmospheric CO2, and is the ultimate source of dissolved Si in natural waters.\r\nSilicon's abundance, chemical reactivity, and the variation in the structural stability of its host minerals\r\nensure that it persists in soils even as its loss supports downstream ecosystems and as it accumulates in\r\nsedimentary deposits. The proposed research will augment understanding of the global Si cycle, and\r\nspecifically the weathering-controlled transfer of Si from continents to oceans.",
