 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on exploiting the unique chemical reactivity of organoruthenium complexes for the stereocontrolled construction of polycyclic heterocyclic compounds related to various alkaloid natural products. The chemistry of eta-6-arene ruthenium(II) complexes will be explored, with the aim of developing novel stoichiometric as well as catalytic synthetic applications. Spirocyclization reactions will be developed and expanded to chiral azaspirocyclic complexes, leading to general synthetic approaches to the spirostaphylotrichins, a subclass of fungal metabolites possessing lipid-lowering activity. Routes to tetrahydroisoquinoline-containing tricyclic ring systems related to a variety of biologically active compounds and the application of the new methodologies to Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, particularly of the crinane and methanomorphanthridine families, will also be explored.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor F. Christopher Pigge, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. Professor Pigge's research efforts revolve around the discovery, development, and exploitation of novel reactions effected by compounds containing bonds between carbon and metal atoms. Such organometallic compounds offer promise for efficient approaches for the synthesis of complex organic molecules as well as the preparation of molecules that are virtually inaccessible in the absence of metal atom intervention.",
