In spite of the fact that cementitious construction materials are mainly used on a large scale and in huge quantities, the mechanical behavior of these materials depends to a great extent on structural elements and phenomena which are effective on a micro- and nano-scale.\r\nThe objective of the workshop is to bring together international researchers and practitioners dealing with nanomodification of cementitious construction materials. The focus will on the identification of the key issues facing civil infrastructure that can be greatly affected by nano-engineering at the materials level.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the workshop will include the nano-engineering of cementitious materials,\r\ncharacterization and multi-scale modeling of nano-modified cementitious materials,\r\nprocessing of nano-modified cementitious materials, nano-modified admixtures and modifiers\r\nfor cementitious materials, and the development of new application of nanosensing technologies in civil infrastructure. Therefore, the intellectual merit of the potential outcomes of the workshop is significant. Besides the presentation of fundamental research findings, applications to civil infrastructure will be emphasized.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the introduction of nanotechnology into cementitious construction materials promises to change the image of these materials, allowing for high-performance, longer lasting, designer materials for specific civil infrastructure applications and needs.\r\n\r\n",
