 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eighth North American Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and \r\nProbability is a meeting of recent Ph.D. recipients in Statistics and \r\nProbability.   Anyone who has received a Ph.D. since 2000 or expects to \r\nreceive a Ph.D. by 2006 is eligible to attend.  The purpose of the \r\nconference is to promote the professional development of  new \r\nresearchers primarily by introducing them to each other's research in an \r\ninformal setting. All participants are expected to give a short, \r\nexpository talk or contribute a poster on their research.  Topics will \r\nrange across a variety of areas from theory and methods to \r\napplications.  This will provide a unique opportunity for junior \r\nresearchers to exchange ideas and initiate contacts amongst themselves \r\nas well as provide them an opportunity to interact with the invited \r\nsenior participants.  The meeting is to be held prior to the 2005 Joint \r\nStatistical Meetings in Minneapolis, MN. \r\n\r\nThe New Researchers conference series is explicitly aimed at training \r\nthe future leaders in Statistics and Probability.  At present, \r\nresearchers develop contacts with others in their field either through \r\ntheir own institutions or at meetings of professional societies. It is \r\noften the case that, at their own institutions, junior researchers have \r\nlimited contact with senior colleagues.  Also, meetings of professional \r\nsocieties are rather large and junior researchers often find them \r\noverwhelming. In helping to create networks of new researchers, the \r\nconference will lay the groundwork for future collaboration and the \r\ninformal exchange of ideas and knowledge.  It also assists in general \r\nprofessional development.  Knowing people outside of one's research \r\nspecialty area is critical for professional growth, assisting with \r\nmaking contacts at other universities and industries, and helping with \r\nprofessional service activities.  In particular, traditionally \r\nunderrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to attend.\r\n\r\n",
