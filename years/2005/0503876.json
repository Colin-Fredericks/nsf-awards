 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research proposal is to improve understanding of the\r\nthermodynamic, kinetic and structural properties of non-oriented bulk crystallized\r\nflexible chain polymers. Building on a foundation that established the important\r\nindependent structural variables that describe the crystalline state, and final properties, a\r\nresearch program is described to advance the understanding of the interplay between\r\nchain microstructure, phase structure, crystallization kinetics and morphology of the\r\ndominant class of crystalline polymers, the polyolefins. Emphasis is given to novel\r\nstudies of model branched polyethylenes that serve as control microstructures to establish\r\nthe connection between molecular architecture and the semicrystalline morphology that\r\nthey assemble. Two sets of model branched polyethyelenes will be studied. One set of\r\nprecisely spaced branched polyethylenes serve as a bridge between the crystallization of\r\nshort-chain molecules and the more complex behavior of industrial-like linear low\r\ndensity polyethylenes. The second set of model long chain-branched (LCB) random\r\nethylene copolymers will provide fundamentals for the effect of length and architecture\r\nof LCB on the crystallization behavior of these polyethylenes from isotropic melts,\r\nbefore additional effects intrinsic to flow, come into play. Details of the early stages of\r\nthe crystallization of these systems serve as a basis to describe the properties of H-link\r\nand other types of LCB poly(propylenes) also subjects of study in this proposal.\r\nThe work on model systems will provide an opportunity for faculty and students\r\nof the University of Florida and the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering to interact\r\nclosely toward integrating catalysis, macromolecular architecture and their path to the\r\nordered state beyond each group's laboratory boundaries.\r\nThe proposal also includes detailed work to substantiate a model of defect\r\nmicrostructure for Z-N based isotactic poypropylenes, derived from previous studies, as\r\nwell as a continuation of the crystallization behavior of metallocene random propylene\r\ncopolymers. In this venue emphasis is given to integrate the dynamics of the\r\npolymorphic behavior in the analysis of the overall crystallization and the linear growth\r\nrates of these copolymers.                                                                                                                                     \r\nThe FAMU-FSU College of Engineering is a jointly managed program of the\r\nFlorida State University, a Research I institution with an enrollment of 38,000 and\r\nFlorida A&M University, a historically Black University with an enrollment of 12,000.\r\nFaculty hold joint appointments at both institutions, and students from both universities\r\nenroll in the same engineering classes. The present enrollment at the College of\r\nEngineering consists of approximately 50% minority students and over 25% women,\r\nmaking it unique in a number of respects. The proposed work includes active\r\nparticipation of graduate and undergraduate students and training in current techniques of\r\ncharacterization of polymers. These activities parallel the commitment of the PI to\r\neducation of students in the area of Polymer Science and Engineering.",
