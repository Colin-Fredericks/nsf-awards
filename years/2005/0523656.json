 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to use light scattering and other optical techniques on organic polymers/molecules in order to decipher the local microstructure, which impact device performance, and to investigate surface-charge accumulation and charge transport in metal-organic interfaces using electric field-induced Raman scattering. The approach is (1) to grow thin films of organic polymers/molecules and nanoparticles for photophysical studies; (2) fabricate organic light-emitting diodes and organic spin-valve structures mainly as subjects for spectroscopic studies; (3) fabricate ordered organic light-emitting diode nanostructures. Vibrational spectroscopy from oriented films and nanofibers of organic materials in working light-emitting diode structures will probe structure-property relationships and their influence on both charge-transport and optical properties, and reveal the nature of polarons and bipolarons.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed work has several facets. The proposed project aims at establishing a collaboration between the Physics and Electrical Engineering departments at the University of Missouri-Columbia, in the field of organic optoelectronics. The overall goal is to strengthen the undergraduate and graduate Physics and Engineering programs by emphasizing the natural connection between the processes of learning and discovery. The two new proposed laboratory-based courses will provide more hands-on experience to graduate/undergraduate students relevant for 21st century science and technology, which will prepare them for employment in materials science and organic/inorganic semiconductor-based academic research or industry. The University of Missouri is committed to the recruitment and retention of minority students; both the PIs are women and thus excellent role models and mentors for female students in science and engineering. \r\n",
