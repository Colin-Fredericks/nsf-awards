The goals of the workshop are to enhance the proposal writing skills of the participants, to enable them to explore collaborations between participating institutions, and to prepare them to offer the workshop on their own campuses.   After the two-day workshop, each participating faculty member is expected to complete and submit a proposal to the CCLI program and to work with other participants from his or her institution and offer the proposal writing workshop on their own campus.  The Advancing Minorities Interest in Engineering (AMIE) organization is organizing the workshop.  Faculty from ten Historically Black Colleges and Universities, eight Hispanic Serving Institutions, and two native American Serving Institution will participate.",
