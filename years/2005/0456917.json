 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a well-integrated program of research and teaching in computational physics at Bowdoin College, a highly selective undergraduate institution located in Brunswick, Maine. The awarded funds will provide support for research in numerical relativity and computational astrophysics and for undergraduate students to participate in this research. The research goals, involving supercomputer simulations of neutron stars and black holes, are primarily motivated by the prospect of detecting gravitational radiation from such objects with the new generation of gravitational wave laser interferometers, including the now operational Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO.) To identify and interpret any observed signals, and to extract their astrophysical content, requires theoretical models of their sources. Likely sources such as binary neutron stars and black holes must be modeled within the framework of general relativity. This research is aimed at developing the necessary numerical algorithms, at numerically constructing such theoretical models, and at predicting gravitational wave signals for comparison with future observation. Undergraduate students will actively participate in a computational physics research group, providing them with a \"hands-on\" research experience and generating a research-enriched learning environment. The students will work on a variety of well-defined, manageable and meaningful projects, including, for example, the generalization and extension of previous results and the exploration of simple model problems. They will also have the opportunity to collaborate with scientists at other institutions and to present their work at conferences and in publications, making this research experience a very valuable preparation for graduate training and other future careers in the sciences and beyond.",
