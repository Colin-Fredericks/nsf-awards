 "awd_abstract_narration": "Based on information available in the literature about the frequency of computer-game use, the effects of computer games on learning and the possibility of existing differences in cognitive abilities or brain structure in today's students, research is being carried out on elements of game design that promote content learning, elements of game design that lead to motivation for continued play, and the use of these elements to develop instructional software, video and simulations targeted specifically at teaching chemistry concepts.  A test game environment that includes the critical game elements is being developed. The chemistry content of this game is chemical equilibrium, which is among the most challenging topics for students to master in first-year chemistry courses.  The performance of students is assessed by analyzing their actions during game playing, and by mapping their behaviors as they master measurable learning objectives.  This research is designed to help chemistry instructors communicate more effectively with their students, and to provide supplemental materials for these students to increase meaningful learning.  The ultimate goal of this research is to determine a data-driven design model for the effective use of game elements in computer instructional environments, resulting in high levels of content mastery, learning efficiency, and positive affective responses.",
