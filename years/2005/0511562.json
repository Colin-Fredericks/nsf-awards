There is some preliminary evidence that modeling-oriented, application-based college algebra courses that take advantage of modern computational tools may better-serve students than the traditional college algebra course. With professional development support provided through this project, eleven colleges and universities are developing and offering pilot sections of modeling-based college algebra courses and supporting a national study determining the impact of these courses on students by comparing student performance and success rates in subsequent courses to those of students in traditional sections.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nParticipating institutions have agreed to offer a total of 102 pilot sections over the two-semester implementation phase for this project, with at least as many control sections. Based on the evaluation of the pilot sections, successful practices are then being implemented in other college algebra sections. The MAA is committed to communicating the results of this project to the broader mathematical community, and encouraging all departments to review and make appropriate changes to their college algebra courses.\r\n",
