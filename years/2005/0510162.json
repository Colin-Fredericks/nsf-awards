 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will develop particle simulation techniques for vortex sheet motion in \r\ntwo- and three-dimensional fluid flows. Vortex sheets are weak solutions of the ideal fluid equations \r\nin which the vorticity is concentrated on a surface and they are widely used in fluid dynamics to \r\nrepresent thin shear layers in slightly viscous flow. Vortex sheet simulations encounter severe difficulties \r\ndue to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, singularity formation, and chaotic dynamics, but the investigator has \r\nshown that these difficulties can be overcome by regularizing the Biot-Savart kernel in the equation \r\ngoverning the motion of material points on the sheet surface. The present project extends the capability \r\nof these regularized particle simulations by developing an improved treecode algorithm for evaluating \r\nthe Biot-Savart integral, and adaptive quadrature and particle insertion schemes to maintain resolution \r\nas the sheet rolls up. In contrast to other approaches using spherical harmonics, the present treecode \r\nalgorithm uses Taylor approximations in Cartesian coordinates which provides more flexibility and enables \r\nthe method to be applied to nonharmonic functions such as the regularized Biot-Savart kernel. \r\nThe quadrature and insertion schemes to be developed will make essential use of the Lagrangian \r\nsheet parameterization. The investigator will perform particle simulations of vortex ring dynamics and will \r\ncompare the results to laboratory experiments and direct numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.  Other topics to be studied include high precision computation of spiral formation in the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem, and extension of the present techniques to density-stratified flow. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComputer simulation is a well established tool in basic and applied research in all areas of science \r\nand engineering. For example, automobile manufacturers, as well as pharmaceutical companies, \r\nroutinely use computer simulations in the design of new products. A successful computer simulation relies \r\non several components: a mathematical model of the physical problem, numerical algorithms for \r\nimplementing the model on a computer, and computer hardware to perform the simulation. \r\nThe present project focuses on the first two components by developing better models and algorithms \r\nfor the computer simulation of fluid flows which are dominated by vortices. Vortices in air or water are \r\nusually invisible, but they can exert strong forces on nearby solid structures. One example is the trailing \r\nvortex wake behind an airplane which is responsible for the lift of the airplane, but also poses a hazard \r\nfor nearby aircraft. In crowded urban airports with few runways, it is often necessary for an airplane to \r\nwait several minutes before taking off, to ensure that the wake of the preceding aircraft has dissipated \r\nto a safe level. The present investigation will contribute better algorithms for simulating the trailing wake \r\nwhich can be used by aeronautical engineers in designing methods to enhance wake dissipation \r\nand reduce takeoff delays. The algorithms developed in this project are also applicable to evaluating \r\nelectrostatic forces at the molecular level, a generic computational problem with many potential \r\napplications in areas such as chemistry and plasma physics. \r\n\r\n",
