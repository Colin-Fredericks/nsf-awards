 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2005 Gordon Research Conference in Nuclear Chemistry focuses on the most recent advances in our understanding of nuclear structure, the science of the glue that binds the constituent nucleons (protons and neutrons) of an atomic nucleus, and the elementary modes of excitation of this quantum system. A sampling of representative questions to be discussed this year include why some combinations of protons and neutrons are more stable than others, what the most unstable nuclei that we can synthesize are telling us, how many neutrons and protons can be lumped together before the binding glue gives up, how elements that are heavier than the heaviest can be synthesized, how the physics learnt from such studies help in understanding element formation in the stars, what we learn about fundamental symmetries in nature from studies of nuclear excitations, what are we learning from nuclei subjected to extreme stimuli, and what technical innovations are being planned in the twenty-first century towards answering these questions.\r\n\r\nThe Gordon Research Conference in Nuclear Chemistry has been bringing together researchers from around the world annually for over half a century. Its uniqueness lies both in its format and its goals. Beginning research students rub shoulders with the experienced scientists in an informal setting, with a few talks at the cutting edge followed by generous time for lively and spirited discussion, during and beyond the confines of the scientific sessions. The participants are encouraged and challenged to think beyond normal boundaries, being unfettered by any record-keeping of the proceedings, and many successful ideas in the field can be traced back to a discussion under the trees at this conference. The Gordon Conference in Nuclear Chemistry, in both its format and science, is consistently rated as one of the most stimulating coming together of researchers in the field. It is typically over-subscribed, and one of the more demanding tasks of the chair/organizer is to further the legacy through a healthy balance of youth and experience, so that the conference continues to inspire present and future researchers. \r\n\r\n",
