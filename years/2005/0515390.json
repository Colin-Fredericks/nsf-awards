 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funded research aims to provide practical tools for biologists who \r\nuse cross-species comparisons to identify significant functional, \r\necological, or historical factors shaping the patterns of diversity \r\namong species. For example: is the evolution of HIV virulence related \r\nto rates of transmission among hosts? Which environmental factors most \r\nstrongly influence the rate of evolution, and what are the strengths \r\nand directions of evolution? This broad class of questions all involve \r\nadaptive evolution (i.e., the direction and strength of natural \r\nselection). All existing methods share the significant shortcoming in \r\nusing a completely neutral model of evolution. That is, previous \r\nmethods fail to account for natural selection, despite the fact that it \r\nis the central feature of interest. The method developed here is the \r\nmost comprehensive to date. It simultaneously accounts for random \r\nevolutionary fluctuations (such as genetic drift), common ancestry, and \r\nnatural selection (under multiple adaptive regimes). Methods are \r\nprovided for formulating scientific hypotheses as explicit mathematical \r\nmodels, each of which can then be fit to the data. Modern \r\nmodel-selection theory is then to identify the best-support model or \r\nmodels. Because in this approach, the causal factors of interest are \r\nexplicitly modeled and tested directly against data, scientists will be \r\nable to use these methods to identify which aspects of the evolutionary \r\nprocess are most important, describe the relative strengths and \r\ndirections of these evolutionary forces, and understand how they have \r\ninfluenced the tempo and mode of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe comparative method is a fundamental tool in organismal, \r\nevolutionary and ecological biology. It is used to identify and study \r\nthe factors which have been important in producing the diversity of \r\nlife we see today. Understanding the significant environmental, \r\nfunctional, and genetic mechanisms operative in the past is critical \r\nfor planning conservation strategies for the future. It is also \r\nimportant in planning effective strategies to control human disease. \r\nFor example, two fronts in the battle against HIV, predicting the \r\nspread of drug-resistance and immune-escape mutations, rely on an \r\nunderstanding of how HIV evolves in response to natural selection and \r\nhow HIV evolution differs within and among hosts. Beyond the \r\nenvironmental sciences, it is now widely appreciated that studies of \r\nfunction (at the organismal, biochemical, or gene level) require the \r\napplication of the comparative method.The funded research will provide \r\npractical tools to enable comparative biologists to make stronger tests \r\nof their hypotheses.\r\n",
