 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to adapt and implement a prior successful CCLI pilot project developed at the University of Cincinnati (DUE 0127279) where hands-on laboratory modules and multi-media course materials have been used to introduce teams of undergraduate engineering students to molecular biology as a screening tool to track microorganisms in the environment.  The pilot project will be reproduced at four peer institutions with assessment performed both locally and a \"meta-assessment\" performed as an overall component of the project.  An advisory board with representatives from two- and four-year undergraduate institutions, an HBCU, and the National Academy of Engineering will provide independent feedback to the team.  Expected outcomes of the project include: four additional institutions offering an inquiry-based course where interdisciplinary teams of undergraduate students collaborate on open-ended group projects following the \"full-cycle 16S rRNA approach\"; a text book to be published by a nationally-recognized publishing house; and broad dissemination through presentations at conferences and publications in the peer-review engineering education literature.  The project will include successfully bridging the gap between environmental engineering research and undergraduate instruction to integrate molecular biology tools into the day-to-day practice of environmental engineering.  A two- and four-year institutions and an HBCU will participate in this project.\r\n\r\n",
