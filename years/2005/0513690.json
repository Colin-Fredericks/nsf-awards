In this study, several PZT ceramic slurries will be prepared via colloidal process and examined thoroughly. The possibility of preparing slurries in aqueous medium with high solid loading will be investigated using rheological measurements. Casting and gelation of the slurries will be examined. For comparison purposes, hot isostatic pressing (HIP) will also be used to produce the same objects in order to benchmark the effectiveness of the gel casting. This investigation will examine the possibility of applying the proposed forming technique to manufacture complex shape objects with full or near full density. The quality of the products will be evaluated through characterization of microstructure, and physical, mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. The results of this investigation will be analyzed and reported. In this program, the expertise of the two institutions will be integrated to develop suitable materials for gel casting and to fabricate complex piezoelectric actuators. In the past several years, the Rutgers team has developed processing and manufacturing capabilities for various piezoelectric sensors and actuators. The Egyptian team has expertise in developing slurries for various ceramics. The expertise of both teams is\r\ncomplementary and will enable them to reach the project objectives. \r\nBroader Impact: The proposed program is a collaborative effort between Rutgers and CMRDI and allows exchange of ideas and expertise between the American and Egyptian teams. This project involves support of a postdoctoral scientist. It also provides a good opportunity for the Egyptian partner to become more familiar with, and develop expertise in the field of piezoelectric materials and actuators. The finding of research work will be presented in local and international conferences and published to disseminate the information within the ceramics and ferroelectric communities.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.",
