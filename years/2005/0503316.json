 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Michigan, Western Michigan University, Michigan State\r\nUniversity and Wayne State University propose to establish the Michigan-Louis Stokes\r\nAlliances for Minority Participation (MI-LSAMP) in order to significantly increase the\r\nquantity and improve the quality of students earning science, technology, engineering and\r\nmathematics (STEM) baccalaureate degrees from our institutions, and increase the\r\nnumber of under-represented minority (URM) students interested in, academically\r\nqualified for and matriculated into graduate study programs. The MI-LSAMP partners are\r\nrecognized as isflagshipld institutions in the State of Michigan and represent the diversity\r\nof public Doctoral Research Extensive institutions in the nation. While the UM, MSU,\r\nWSU and WMU have demonstrated a deep commitment to increasing the diversity and\r\nexcellence of their student bodies and have had long-standing collaborations with one\r\nanother, they realize that the greatest gains will be achieved by formally allying. The\r\nmission of the MI-LSAMP not only supports the National Science Foundations strategic\r\ngoal to help create ira diverse, competitive and globally-engaged U.S. workforce of\r\nscientists, engineers, technologists, and well-prepared citizens,lr it supports goals set forth\r\nby the Michigans Cherry Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth.ln\r\nThe overall goals for the MI-LSAMP are to:\r\n1. Significantly increase the number of URM students earning baccalaureate degrees\r\nfrom MI-LSAMP partners. An aggressive but balanced plan has been devised to\r\nincrease the number of URM students earning baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields\r\nby 50% in 5 years, and 100% in 10 years. Programmatic activities focus on\r\nincreasing the recruitment of new and transfer URM students, and increasing their\r\ngraduation rates as a consequence of participation in Science, Engineering and Math\r\nPre-First Year programs, research projects sponsored by the Michigan Undergraduate\r\nResearch Consortium, internships and co-ops, and residential learning programs.\r\n2. Institutionalize MI-LSAMP strategies and practices. Programmatic activities will be\r\nevaluated and the most effective and efficient of these will be institutionalized in an\r\neffort to sustain, beyond the NSF funding period, growth in the number of URM\r\nstudents earning STEM degrees. In addition, MI-LSAMP offices, drop-in centers and\r\nlearning centers will become permanent fixtures on each of the alliance campuses.\r\n3. Contribute to a significant increase in the number of under-represented minority\r\nstudents earning baccalaureate degrees in the State of Michigan and nationally.\r\nSuccessful completion of project will result in nearly a 50% increase in the number of\r\nURM students earning baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields within the State of\r\nMichigan. iiBest practicesla of the MI-LSAMP will be attractive for adoption and\r\ncould significantly improve national efforts to increase production in the STEM\r\nfields.\r\n4. Increase the number of students pursuing advanced degrees in STEM fields. The MI-\r\nLSAMP will collaborate with the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA), a recently\r\nestablished partnership of the same institutions, to ensure that students earning\r\nbaccalaureate degrees are prepared for, and aware of opportunities to pursue\r\nadvanced studies in STEM fields.\r\nThe intellectual merit and broader impact of this project goes beyond increasing the\r\nnumber of URM students graduating in STEM fields and dissemination of effective and\r\nefficient MI-LSAMP programs. The MI-LSAMP will expand outreach to the pre-college\r\ncommunity, increase the persistence of STEM majors, increase faculty involvement in\r\nmentoring URM students, promote collaboration among faculty at Michigan institutions\r\nof higher education, and increase the diversity of our communities and workforce.",
