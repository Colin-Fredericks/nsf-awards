 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gene expression is the primary mechanism in which information encoded by the\r\ngenome is converted into developmental, morphological, and physiological phenotypes.\r\nThus, understanding the amount, structure, and patterns of gene expression variation is\r\nof fundamental importance. However, very little is known about how gene expression\r\nvaries within and between populations and how gene expression variation contributes to\r\nphenotypic variation. The goal of this proposal is to begin to bridge this critical lack of\r\nknowledge by using microarray technology to study gene expression variation in human\r\npopulations. To this end, gene expression levels will be measured in individuals from\r\ngeographically diverse populations and genes that are differentially expressed between\r\nindividuals within the same population and differentially expressed between populations\r\nwill be identified.\r\n\r\nThe successful completion of this project will have important practical benefits for\r\nsociety. For example, the data will provide the first systematic and global\r\ncharacterization of gene expression variation within and between geographically diverse\r\nhuman populations. In turn, this information will provide the foundation for making more\r\nprincipled inferences of phenotypic variation in humans, including the genetic\r\ncontribution to disease. In addition, this project will fulfill an important educational need\r\nby providing interdisciplinary training opportunities for the next generation of scientists,\r\nwhich will enable them to address and solve challenging biological problems.",
