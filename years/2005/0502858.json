 "awd_abstract_narration": "In June 2005, the seventeenth international conference entitled Formal Power\r\nSeries and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) will be held in Taormina, Italy.  \r\nThis FPSAC conference shall have a wide interdisciplinary breadth, with \r\nprincipal topics featuring algebraic and enumerative combinatorics and\r\ntheir applications and relations to other areas of mathematics, physics, \r\nbiology and computer science.  The interdisciplinary span is evidenced by the \r\nchoice of plenary speakers, including Christine Bessenrodt from Germany, \r\nSerge Dulucq from France, Ronald King from England, Corrado De Concini, \r\nRenzo Pinzani, and Claudio Procesi from Italy, and Vaughan Jones and\r\nJeff Remmel from the US.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe considerable span of this conference series is unique among international \r\nconferences with an emphasis on combinatorial mathematics.  This conference will \r\nlink leading researchers in combinatorics with strong researchers in allied \r\nfields drawn from pure and applied mathematics, theoretical computer science, \r\nphysics, and biology.  Another distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences \r\nis the concerted effort to recognize and encourage outstanding young scientists.  \r\nThis is accomplished in part by choosing at least one plenary speaker to \r\nbe an ``emerging'' star, and by ensuring that talented young researchers \r\nare well represented among the speakers selected for contributed talks.\r\nThe conference seeks to draw substantial participation from groups which \r\nhave been traditionally under-represented in the mathematical sciences.  \r\nFPSAC 2005 promises to be an excellent opportunity for young researchers to make \r\nboth domestic and international contacts that are likely to be of great value in \r\ndeveloping their careers.\r\n",
