 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light emission by the North American firefly Photinus pyralis is a familiar example of bioluminescence, the emission of light by a living organism.  This fundamental process by which living organisms convert chemical energy into light has many potential laboratory and medical applications, including the use of firefly luciferase as a reporter of gene expression and regulation. This research will address the relationship between the structure of firefly luciferase and its role in the catalysis of two sequential reactions that result in the emission of light.  Mutant luciferases will be made by recombinant DNA techniques and evaluated to examine the effects of mutations on each reaction.  This approach may also provide evidence to the occurrence and role of fundamentally important conformational changes in the luciferase structure. The results of this project should enhance the basic understanding of firefly bioluminescence, as well as the larger adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily, which includes firefly luciferase and many non-bioluminescent proteins.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This research will be carried out at Connecticut College, a liberal arts college with an established record of effective research training of undergraduate students.  Students will engage in collaborative research with faculty and those who make substantive contributions to the project will become co-authors of manuscripts and present their results at scientific meetings. All participants will be involved in modern mainstream bioluminescence research and will contribute positively to increasing the numbers of well-prepared graduates for entry into graduate programs and professional scientific careers. \r\n",
