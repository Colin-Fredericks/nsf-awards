 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pevtsova proposes to investigate aspects of the modular representation \r\ntheory of various finite dimensional algebras over a field of positive characteristic, and of the representation theory of related algebras over fields of characteristic zero.  Built upon earlier work of Pevtsova and others which employs local methods in modular representation theory, the proposed research aims to\r\ncreate new invariants and to achieve a better understanding of existing \r\nones. For example, Pevtsova proposes  in joint work with Friedlander to produce finer invariants than support varieties by considering restrictions of representations  to subalgebras isomorphic to group algebras of a cyclic group. In another project, joint with Witherspoon, Pevtsova will seek a representation-theoretic description of\r\nsupport varieties for representations of a restricted quantum Lie \r\nalgebra at roots of unity. In a baby sisterof this  project, Pevtsova and Witherspoon propose to develop a new description of the rank variety for a class of local algebras over fields of characteristic zero, and define rank varieties for certain non-cocommutative Hopf algebras, identifying the new varieties with the existing geometric constructions which use Hochschild cohomology. In a third project, Pevtsova proposes to establish a geometric correspondence between certain triangulated module categories associated to reduced enveloping \r\nalgebras of a Lie algebra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed research begins with the philosophy of understanding a difficult, complicated algebraic structure by studying a family of simple structures embedded in the original. The simple objects are well understood so that the challenge is to combine this understanding to gain some information about the original, difficult structure. This idea is applied to the study of formal algebraic objects arising as symmetries of familiar structures. In the process, the interplay of two different mathematical fields, geometry and algebra, is used extensively, revealing beautiful connections and enabling applications to both areas. A second aspect of this proposal includes the mentoring of female undergraduate students, participation in a popular mathematical program for advanced high school students, and the editing of a special volume of amathematical journal.\r\n\r\n",
