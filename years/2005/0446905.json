 "awd_abstract_narration": "All plant and animal life requires that genes are replicated and sorted with high fidelity as cells divide. In order for a cell to divide, its chromosomes, the physical entities housing the genes, must be faithfully replicated and the two copies of each chromosome must be precisely separated and sorted into the new cells. Failures in chromosome segregation are deleterious to an organism because an intact genome is essential to normal cellular function. Two cellular machines, the spindle and the kinetochore, are largely responsible for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. Prior research suggests that spindles and kinetotchores are engineered with internal back-up systems to insure that chromosome segregation can proceed accurately in the face of genetic and environmental perturbations. This research project focuses on identifying the molecular components of the spindle and the kinetochore and understanding the mechanisms by which these two machines operate and interact. The research project has three phases. First, a sensitive and specific genetic approach is used to identify genes encoding components of the spindle and the kinetochore. This genetic approach is designed to identify genes necessary for both the primary and back-up systems of chromosome segregation. Next, mapping of these genes will identify the actual molecular components of the spindle and kinetochore. Finally, functional analysis of these molecular components will elucidate the mechanisms that drive accurate chromosome segregation. Functional analysis will include characterizing the dynamics of individual molecules and the interactions between different molecules that participate in cell division. Accurate chromosome segregation is one of the most fundamental processes shared by plant and animal life, and this project directly investigates the ways in which cells ensure accuracy as they divide.  The project is being done at an undergraduate institution, so many undergraduate students will be involved in the research.  The PI plans to have the students present their results in research publications and at conferences.",
