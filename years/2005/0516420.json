 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Phoridae is an extremely large group of small, poorly-known flies,\r\nsome of which are pests of agriculture, and others of which have\r\npotential for biological control of pest insects. There are about 3,500\r\ndescribed species in this family, but actual totals for the world fauna\r\nare closer to 35,000, meaning that only about 10% of them have been\r\ndescribed by scientists. These flies are among the most biologically\r\ndiverse insects, with some being scavengers, herbivores, predators, and\r\nparasites. Some have become associated with ants and termites, and have\r\nbizarrely modified females that lack wings and have a beetle-like\r\nprotective structure. There has been sharp disagreement about the\r\nclassification of the most primitive groups of phorid flies, which has\r\nhampered the understanding of their relationships and diversity. The\r\nprimitive phorids will be studied on a worldwide basis using body\r\nstructure as well as DNA sequences by a team of a museum-based\r\nmorphologist and a university-based molecular expert. Molecular\r\ncharacters will include about 4000 base pairs of both mitochondrial and\r\nnuclear genes. Field expeditions will be carried out in Europe, North\r\nAmerica, South America, New Zealand, and southeast Asia to collect fresh\r\nspecimens for analysis; additional specimens from Africa will be\r\nprovided by collaborators. Additionally, we will revise the New World\r\nspecies of the largest genus of primitive phorids, Dohrniphora. This\r\ngenus is currently known from 85 described species, but we will describe\r\nthe approximately 100 further new species that exist, adding\r\nconsiderably to our knowledge of tropical insect biodiversity.\r\n\r\nPhorid flies are a highly significant part of the world's biodiversity\r\nthat has been barely addressed by scientists. Study of the morphology\r\nand genes of primitive phorids will allow us to understand how traits\r\nlike parasitism or herbivory have arisen within this group, and perhaps\r\nin other insects as well. It will provide a robust framework for the\r\nclassification of these flies that will foster better communication\r\nabout their relationships. A firm understanding of the species of\r\nDohrniphora will allow these small, easily collected insects to be used\r\nin conservation assessment in tropical rain forests, and will allow us\r\nto learn more about diversification of tropical insect faunas. Projects\r\nwill include undergraduate students, who will gain valuable expertise in\r\nboth field and laboratory work.\r\n",
