 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nNanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have promising applications in information and biotechnology, e.g., MEMS optical switches in telephone switching equipment and implantable MEMS drug delivery devices. Unique capabilities of MEMS and NEMS devices can also be developed for micro-fluidic chip technology used for biological detection, toxin identification, and DNA analysis. The challenging issues in the realization of NEMS and MEMS include the optimization and control of these devices for high performance and reliability.  This requires a comprehensive understanding of the physical behavior of materials in the microscale and the incorporation of this information in the design of these devices.\r\nThe investigator proposes to investigate the contact adhesion of small-volume structure by using surface force techniques, such as nanoindentation that is capable of directly testing small-volume structures. The goal of the proposed work is to achieve a fundamental understanding of the effect of the scaling-dependent material properties on the contact behavior of small-volume structure and to improve the design methodology for the rapid introduction of advanced nano- and micro- fabrication technologies.  The principal research objectives of the project are: 1) to determine the effect of the scaling-dependence of material properties on the contact adhesion of small-volume structure, and 2) to establish a relation between material properties and contact deformation. The fundamental mechanism controlling the contact deformation in the microscale will be studied through physical modeling of the relationship between material properties and the contact deformation of small-volume structure. The proposed research work will add to the knowledge base of nanomanufacturing and nanomanipulation and provide valuable engineering data for the development of nanofabrication techniques.\r\nThe proposed work will advance the field of micromechanics of advanced materials. It will also advance discovery and understanding in the nanoworld while promoting teaching, training and learning. \r\n",
