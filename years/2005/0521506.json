The fundamental and unique characteristic of the equipment is the capability of measuring 3D dynamic motions of nano-, micro- and meso-scale structures under varying environmental conditions with unparalleled accuracy, frequency span, speed, and simplicity of operation. As such, the proposed equipment enables transferring full capability of vibration and modal testing from macro- to micro/nano-scale systems, and facilitates experimental investigations and model validation activities for micro/nano-dynamics, including multi-physics phenomena. \r\nThe equipment can be utilized in multiple disciplines, including nanotechnology systems, micro/nano-robotics, biomechanics, micro/nano-manufacturing, and MEMS/LIGA systems. The projects enabled by the use of this equipment, such as determination of elastic properties of nanotubes from dynamic experimentation, and assessing biological changes to cells by the changes in dynamic response, exploit applications to new horizons not seen to date. \r\nBy introducing the equipment in undergraduate and graduate courses, and by extensively using it for innovative, student-centered research projects, the PIs will significantly advance the understanding and research education of micro/nano-scale phenomena. We hope to excite and attract the students from underrepresented groups by publicizing the use of the proposed state-of-the-art equipment for research and education. Each project enabled by the equipment will include both graduate and undergraduate students to enhance their research experience and expertise on micro/nano-scale phenomena. The equipment, including creative applications, will be announced to industry, government and academia (internally and externally) using newsletters, a dedicated webpage, personal contacts, seminars and conferences. We believe the equipment will be pivotal in transforming the micro- and nano-scale systems and associated phenomena to commercial products to obtain cleaner environment, more efficient products, and significantly enhanced capabilities in the areas of communications, data storage, sensors, biotechnology, medical, defense, and consumer products. \r\n\r\n",
