The meeting will generate scientific exchange among them student participants, promote international collaborations among young scientists within the North American continent, expose graduate students to sub-disciplines in physics beyond their individual research areas, and promote interdisciplinary research within the sub-disciplines.  The meeting's  organization is carried out by the students.  The conference theme is \"Physics without borders\" and it will emphasize to the students the growing importance of viewing science in the international perspective.  Overall, it will provide excellent training for next generation researchers in the U.S.",
