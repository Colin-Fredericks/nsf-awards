 "awd_abstract_narration": "My main goal in this project is to use the homotopy theory of pro-spaces\r\nto prove non-existence theorems for sums-of-squares formulas over\r\narbitrary fields.  This is a question of primary interest in the study of\r\nquadratic forms, but it is also closely linked to a variety of other\r\nfields of mathematics, including the existence of finite-dimensional\r\ndivision algebras, counting independent vector fields on spheres, and\r\nimmersions of projective spaces into euclidean spaces. There is a long\r\nhistory of applying cohomological methods to sums-of-squares formulas over\r\nthe real numbers. My goal is to adapt these methods so that they work for\r\nother fields. This involves the use of generalized etale cohomology\r\ntheories (such as but not limited to etale K-theory) of algebraic\r\nvarieties instead of generalized cohomology of topological spaces. The\r\ncorrect definition of generalized etale cohomology involves some subtle\r\naspects of the homotopy theory of pro-spaces. Motivic homotopy theory is\r\nanother useful tool in studying sums-of-squares formulas and more\r\ngenerally quadratic forms.  I intend to work on specific problems that\r\nfurther elucidate the relationship between motivic homotopy theory and the\r\ntheory of quadratic forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCohomology was a key unifying concept in the study of topology throughout\r\nthe twentieth century.  The basic principle of cohomology is to turn a\r\ndifficult problem in topology into a computable algebra problem. Many of\r\nthese cohomological methods work also in algebraic geometry (i.e., the\r\nstudy of geometric objects that are defined by polynomial equations), but\r\nthe technical details tend to be much more complicated. Traditional\r\ncohomology can be used to prove theorems about the real numbers because\r\nthe real numbers are a topological space.  Cohomology in algebraic\r\ngeometry allows us to generalize these theorems to other number systems,\r\nsuch as finite fields.  The basic goal of my project is to establish some\r\nof these generalizations. In short, the point is to use ideas from\r\nalgebraic topology to think about problems in algebra in new ways.\r\n",
