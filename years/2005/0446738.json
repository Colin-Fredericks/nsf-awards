 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is a preliminary investigation of the role of devotional values in cultural conflicts. The focus is on interviewing operatives from Islamic Jihadist organizations that sponsor suicide attacks in order to evaluate the contribution of devotional values (DVs) in motivating suicide terrorism. The hypothesis is that devotional values - which encompass aspects of what political scientists, sociologists, anthropologists and psychologists call non-instrumental, sacred or protected values - are critical in generating and sustaining seemingly intractable cultural conflicts. Interviews with captured and freely-operating militant Islamic Jihadists in Israel / Palestine, Turkey, Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia will probe the nature of extreme devotional values. The interviews will elicit information that permits a more comprehensive and longer-term study, involving a more a pointed set of questions that can be analyzed for patterns showing tradeoff reluctance, quantity insensitivity, immunity from free rider concerns, framing effects, evidence of moral outrage and, more generally, which sorts of cognitive entailments make a suicide terrorist action difficult to carry out and perhaps even not worthwhile to do at all. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. This research helps to provide the theoretical framework and empirical information needed to understand the point at which commitment becomes absolute and non-negotiable, in order to find out what is needed to reach people before they come to it. It furnishes a cross-cultural methodology for eliciting devotional values from Jihadist militants, which can be readily transferred to other populations of religiously and ideologically-driven actors. It informs how cognition and emotional judgments interact in devotional values to affect decision making and risk. More generally, the work makes clear how important understanding the mental and motivational structure of players in a given situation is for predicting and understanding their behavior. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. Current risk assessment approaches for resolving ethnic conflicts, or for countering religiously motivated terrorism, often assume that adversaries model the world through rational choices that are commensurable across cultures. Such assumptions are prevalent in conflict and risk modeling by U.S. diplomatic, military and intelligence services. This research suggests that culturally distinct value frameworks constrain preferences and choices in ways not readily translatable across frameworks. This research enables a better of assessment of the motivations of religiously-motivated suicide terrorism - the most deadly, destabilizing and rapidly developing form of terrorism. The results will be of immense interest to policy makers, officials and members of the public seeking to better understand the nature of homicidal political acts. \r\n",
