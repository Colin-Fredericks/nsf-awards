 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores methods to synthesize magnetic nanoscale objects directly on surfaces. Synthesizing and organizing magnetic materials directly where they are needed is the most efficient way to produce nanoscale magnetic films.  These investigations are used to educate the next generation of materials chemists and to prepare them to be competitive in materials chemistry related high-technology professions.  Ph.D. students are trained in cutting edge synthetic methods and use of state of the art fabrication, analysis and measurement equipment, including facilities at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and the Advanced Photon Source.  Undergraduate students are exposed to the same exciting technology as they prepare for scientific careers.  The research will be used as the basis of a series of web-based tutorials on chemical routes to thin films.  \r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nMany of the promised applications of molecule-based nanostructures will require positioning structures at interfaces.  An attractive alternative to the multistep process of synthesis-isolation-deposition is to fabricate nanoscale objects directly at the site of use.  Magnetic information storage is a billion dollar industry that will ultimately benefit from procedures to fabricate thin films of nanoscale objects.  This project aims to train the next generation of materials chemists and to prepare them to be competitive in related high-technology professions.
