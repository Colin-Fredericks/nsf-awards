MREs can function not only in high frequencies (kilohertz) and go through large deformations, but can also provide field-controllable storage and damping characteristics. Theoretical and experimental studies will ba carried out to establish a fundamental understanding of the behavior of a new class of MREs with superior characteristics over the state-of-the-art materials.  Novel surface treated magnetic particles will be utilized.  New MREs will be synthesized with various blends of thermoset and thermoplastic elastomers and synthetic rubber with various particle sizes in random or field-oriented arrangements.  One very useful and practical application of MREs is to utilize them as harmonic TSVA/sensor devices to sense and isolate vibration in counter unbalanced rotating shafts. MREs could be utilized for health monitoring and civil infrastructure protection exposed to natural hazards.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include establishing an infrastructure in MREs research in Nevada, a collaboration between mechanical and chemical engineering departments and industry, educating graduate and undergraduate students in this multidisciplinary area, and attracting high school students to summer training at the University through various demonstrations of the technology on and off the campus.  \r\n\r\nThis is a GOALI project supported under sensor initiative NSF 05-526.\r\n",
