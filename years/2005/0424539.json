The aims are to make CCNY a center of excellence in cutting-edge research and a national urban model for minority education in the fields of robotics and computer vision.  The planning tasks include: 1) fostering collaborative research in perceptual robotics among faculty members; 2) introducing new courses and outreach activities to attract and retain minority undergraduates and to prepare them for graduate education; 3) studying methods to enhance faculty involvement in mentoring activities; 4) developing an evaluation plan with research achievement metrics and educational effectiveness metrics; and 5) organizing an advisory committee. The project includes cooperation with the NYC-LSAMP (Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation) program and New York Academy of Sciences Summer Research Training Program (SRTP).  In particular, the center will serve as a research-training site for high school interns in the SRTP program and will provide mentored research experiences to LSAMP scholars.  The planning project supports visits to leading research institutions as well as institutions with successful MII implementation models. Other planning activities include the launch of a robotics and computer vision lecture series at CCNY, the reform of senior capstone design courses, the initiation of a student robotics club, and the participation of students in international robotics design competitions. \r\n\r\n",
