 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on the development of new synthetic methodology exploiting the reactivity of siloxyalkynes in a range of new catalytic reactions. Specific reactions to be studied include (i) cycloisomerizations; (ii) diyne carbocyclizations; (iii) condensations with carbonyl, nitroso and aza compounds; (iv) tandem, sigmatropic and electrocyclic processes; and (v) direct intermolecular catalytic functionalization of arenes and alkenes. In activities designed to inspire undergraduates to pursue careers in chemistry, and to raise awareness among the general public of the critical role of basic research, a Chemistry/Biochemistry Discussion Group will be organized, an Honors Organic Chemistry sequence will be refined, and a new exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry will be developed, highlighting the value of basic research in the fight against cancer.\r\n\r\nWith the support of this CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Sergey A. Kozmin, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago, is developing new methods for the synthesis of complex organic molecules. These studies offer significant impacts in diverse areas, including catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and chemical biology. Professor Kozmin's activities are also expected to have broad impacts in the scientific education of the general public. His new exhibit planned for Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, \"Chemistry, Biology and Medicine in the Fight Against Cancer,\" is expected to attract a highly diverse group of millions of viewers in the years to come. The exhibit will provide an ideal platform for demonstrating the impact of basic research on improving our quality of life and raising the awareness and popularity of chemical research within the general public.",
