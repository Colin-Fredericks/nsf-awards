The program will focus on the characteristics of iron phos-phate-based glasses and melts.  These glasses are of interest for high-level nuclear waste fixation, bioresorbable medical implants, and several other uses.  Cooperative research will investigate the resistance to crystallization, corrosion resistance, and response to irradiation of these glasses.  The program will also involve the interchange of American and Brazilian students, who will conduct research at both institutions as well as partici-pating in educational opportunities.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: At UFSCar, the crystallization kinetics of these glasses will be measured, using a series of new thermal-analysis techniques developed at UMR and UFSCar.  At CNEA the corrosion resistance of these glasses will be measured in a variety of fluids, and the glasses will be irradiated.  The impact of irradiation on glass properties will be assessed at UFSCar (crystallization kinetics), UMR (structure), and CNEA (corrosion, structure).  At UMR, an investigation of phase equilibria in these systems will de-termine liquidus temperatures and equilibrium crystalline phases.  The exchange of personnel will allow students and faculty alike to learn research techniques developed at each institution.\r\n\r\nThis work is jointed supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Materials Research.\r\n",
