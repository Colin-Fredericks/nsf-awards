Awareness building activities include an \"Earth Explorations\" newspaper insert distributed to the general public and all local high schools. This insert educates students and the general public about different aspects of the geosciences, career opportunities, salaries, and steps needed to explore a career in the geosciences.  Recruitment activities targeting high school and university students include development of a collaborative program with the local Chattanooga school district for an after-school program at a minority high school.  This project entails up to 13 activities, including field trips and speakers.  University recruitment efforts include development and distribution of promotional materials and a departmental open house for prospective or undeclared minority students.  Training activities for students include a water quality monitoring program conducted by the students that will involve sampling streams and waterways in the Chattanooga area and analyzing data using research techniques. \r\n",
