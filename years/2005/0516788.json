 "awd_abstract_narration": "To maintain the security of rapidly changing computing systems, information assurance professionals require extensive ongoing education and practical training. This project is meeting the need for practical, hands-on instruction by establishing a state-of-the-art laboratory to support ongoing efforts at Stevens Institute of Technology in building capacity in information assurance and computer security education. The main objective of this project is the creation of a hands-on laboratory where students are engaging in learning by doing, experimental security research projects are being carried out, and students are exploring innovative educational ideas. In particular, a primary use of the lab is an undergraduate security lab course involving experimentation with specific security solutions, vulnerabilities, and exploits. The lab is augmenting new interdisciplinary cybersecurity degree programs at Stevens. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The project is advancing the state of the art in comprehensive cybersecurity education. In particular, the laboratory is enabling students to obtain the best possible practical training in security and information assurance in order to better prepare them to meet the challenges of protecting and securing our nation's information infrastructure. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. The laboratory is helping to increase the number of IT professionals educated and trained in not only theoretical but also practical aspects in information assurance and security. As such it is enhancing their capabilities to better secure critical infrastructures both in the governmental and the private sectors and providing significant economic and social benefit to society. Moreover, the project is integrating research and education, and through K-12 collaborations, is providing Stevens students with the opportunity to educate the next generation. \r\n",
