 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Science and Technology Dissertation Improvement Grant requests NSF funds to support ethnographic fieldwork in China (January-June 2004) based at the Chinese Academy of Science's Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences.  Through ethnographic interviews and participant observation, the study will work to answer one main question: Since 1979, how has China's scientific and technological capacity to monitor and model its urban environment developed, and in turn shaped policy initiatives and directives?  An answer to this question will be derived from the following three sub-questions: 1) How have international agreements, pressures and collaborations influenced China's capacity and expertise in environmental information systems?  2) How have local political, social, and cultural needs structured development and use of environmental information systems in China? 3) How have scientific and technical developments shaped the design and use of environmental information systems in China?  The intellectual merit of this project is its contribution to Chinese area studies, to the history of technology, to anthropological studies of the environmental field, and to policy analysis of environmental governance.  It will produce original empirical material and theoretical perspectives on the dynamics of the environmental field, and on how development of information systems both support and are driven by policy concerns. The study will have a broad impact through the circulation of results among pollution researchers and regulators as the study progresses. Feedback from pollution researchers and regulators will enable validation and refinement of findings while also influencing how pollution researchers and regulators do their work.  The significance of China as a key site of environmental governance in the 21st century is widely acknowledged both within and outside China. \r\n\r\n",
