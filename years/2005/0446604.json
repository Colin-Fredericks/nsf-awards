 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preconditioners comprise a range of techniques for transforming a system of\r\nlinear equations Ax=b into a related system that is somehow ``better''.  For\r\nexample, a solver may take less time to compute the solution to the new system,\r\nit may compute a more accurate solution, or it may do both.  Although a good\r\npreconditioner can be critical to computing an accurate solution efficiently,\r\nchoosing a good preconditioner from the many that are available can be\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is the development of tools to help users choose from\r\nlarge families of preconditioners one that is likely to be well-suited to their\r\nparticular application; the initial focus will be on preconditioners that are\r\nbased on reordering the rows and/or columns of a matrix, and those that compute\r\nan incomplete factorization of the matrix.  In the process of developing these\r\ntools, the PI, undergraduate researchers, and other collaborators will work on\r\ndeveloping better heuristics, improving theoretical knowledge about specific\r\npreconditioners, creating an extensible framework for evaluating different\r\npreconditioners, and making the results of extensive experimentation available\r\nin a user-friendly form.  All work will help lead to a better understanding of\r\nthe performance of specific preconditioners on sparse systems from specific\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nAs a professor at a liberal arts college, the PI's primary plans for broader\r\nimpact include: supervising undergraduate and postbaccalaureate research,\r\nseeking opportunities for students to present their work outside of the local\r\ncommunity and more generally preparing them for graduate work; outreach to\r\ngroups traditionally underrepresented in computer science through mentoring and\r\nthe formation of support networks; and the development, refinement, and\r\ndissemination of courses that emphasize the role of mathematics in computer\r\nscience, as well as of courses that give a basic understanding of computing to\r\nstudents who are not computer science majors but whose education will\r\nnevertheless be enhanced by such knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
