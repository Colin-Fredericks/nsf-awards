 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n0529104\r\nLUO\r\n\r\nThis project will systematically explore a thinning and trimming approach to the production of silicon nanowires (SiNW) from silicon microwires using a combination of theoretical, numerical and experimental investigations. The thinning and trimming approach will be used to generate SiNWs of diameters down to 20nm. Subsequently, two types of new suspended-SiNW-based sensors of ultra-high sensitivity will be developed to detect nontoxic and toxic targets of interest, respectively. \r\n\r\nOne-dimensional nanostructures have attracted great attention recently because of their potential applications as excellent components in micro/nanodevices. SiNWs in particular have received much attention since silicon is the most widely used material in integrated-circuit and microfabrication processes and has unique mechanical and electrical properties. However, due to the shortcomings of the existing fabrication approaches, new methods are needed to produce SiNWs that cannot only be massively fabricated but also batch integrated to functional devices. The proposed thinning and trimming approach is believed to be such a method, and would permit precise control of the structure, size and positions of SiNWs. Furthermore, this method may be used to break through the limitation of lithography in the sense that silicon features fabricated by any lithographic methods can be further miniaturized using the approach. Compared with microbeam-based sensors, the two types of sensors are expected to be several orders higher in sensitivity. The project will contribute to nanotechnology education through new teaching modules and presentations for undergraduate and graduate students, and the animation of nanotechnology concepts on a website for K-12 students and teachers. \r\n",
