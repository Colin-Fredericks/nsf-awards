 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nProfessors Arhangelskii and Eisworth will focus on open problems regarding\r\nthe interaction between compactness and topological homogeneity. The project\r\nis loosely organized around a famous question of van Douwen: Does there\r\nexist a homogeneous compactum containing a family of disjoint open sets of\r\nsize greater than the continuum?\r\nPrior work has yielded a meager supply of techniques for building\r\nhomogeneous compacta, all of which have fallen short of answering van\r\nDouwen's question. Similarly, research over the past twenty years has\r\nprovided a few techniques for proving that a space is not homogeneous, but\r\nstill general methods are lacking.  Work of Arhangelskii has started to\r\nilluminate the connections between various counterexamples, and the project\r\nuses this work as a springboard toward attacking more fundamental questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Topology is one of the great unifiers of modern mathematics, and its\r\nlanguage and ideas are ubiquitous throughout the mathematical canon.  The\r\nsubject is concerned with finding general ideas and structures that are\r\ncommon to diverse areas of mathematics, and two of the most fundamental such\r\ngeneral ideas are homogeneity and compactness.  Loosely speaking, a\r\nstructure is homogeneous if it \"looks the same everywhere\", while\r\ncompactness is a property capturing \"completeness\" properties of the unit\r\ninterval [0,1].    The interaction between these two topics is not\r\nwell-understood ---  known results have demonstrated that the relationship\r\nis complex, but the subject resisted the development of general techniques\r\nfor constructing examples and counterexamples. Recent work of Arhangelskii\r\nhas begun to shed light on some of these problems, and the project\r\nintegrates this together with Eisworth's work on applications of set theory\r\nin topology.\r\n",
