 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to explore the use of cutting edge instrumentation at the active site of Cerro Negro volcano, Nicaragua. The redox relationship between H2S/SO2 and H2/H2O has been highlighted several times in the literature as vital in determining the speciation of gaseous emissions, and likely reflects the subsurface environment. This study is to undertake further development of the DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) system currently beginning to proliferate in SO2 emission rate experiments in active volcanoes.  As part of this field experiment, the team will combine DOAS measurements with thermal infrared imaging to allow mapping the fumarole field of this volcano for temperature and sulfur redox variations. The relationship between exit temperature and oxidation state has the potential to yield new knowledge on how interaction between magmatic gases and groundwater occurs at Cerro Negro. This new methodology will be validated using direct measurements of concentration of gas species and temperature fluctuations at this volcanically active site. \r\n\r\nThis proposal involves young researchers from three different institutions within the US and Canada, two of whom are from underrepresented groups (female minorities). It involves the training of a female minority student by leading experts in a field environment, while enhancing interaction between young faculty, industry and Nicaraguan scientists, allowing linkages and partnerships to be forged that are likely to promote further interaction, both within the universities and internationally. Local scientists, and the student, will be trained to use several new instruments over the three week field experiment, during which time much could potentially be discovered about a young, and unusual volcanic setting. At the conclusion of the field campaign, the mini-UV spectrometer will be left with the trained Nicaraguan scientists to use in future volcano-monitoring efforts in Nicaragua. The results from the experiment will be disseminated through both publication and the Internet in a timely manner. The potential benefits to society include developing the ability to remotely monitor outgassing in an automated fashion, more insight into subsurface processes and the potential hazard mitigation these advances provide. The involvement of local scientist is crucial as they will be responsible for generating educational products for the local populace, who can still remember the evacuations of the mid 1990s. This proposal also begins what can hopefully become a fruitful relationship with an industry partner. \r\n",
