 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is combining multidisciplinary expertise in engineering and dentistry to create a 3D surface model of the human jaw from optical imaging. The instrumentation system for generating the model is intended to be simple and inexpensive. This model will change a number of dental practices to be more precise and less time demanding, and will lead to reduction in cost. Using a small-size CCD camera, a sequence of calibrated 2D images is generated which spans the jaw. Geometrical computer vision methodologies are employed to extract 3D information from the sequence of images, which are then registered together to construct the jaw.  Characteristics of the jaw are exploited in the registration. The 3D surface model is in itself very useful for basic studies of tooth alignments and in a number of orthodontic practices. However, when root and bone information are fused to the surface model, a comprehensive 3D model is obtained which will render great benefits to dentistry. Even partial information about the bone and root structure will be leveraged in the modeling by incorporating modern approaches of geometric modeling.  \r\n\r\nThe jaw model will form the basis for biomechanical studies for proper description of tooth movement, which will be very useful for alignments, implants and numerous craniofacial procedures. The model will also be an enormous tool in the teaching and training of future dentists.  A number of dental students will be included in evaluating the model in various stages of developments, and a small set of volunteers will participate in a study to validate the resulting models.\r\n",
