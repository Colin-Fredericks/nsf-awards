 "awd_abstract_narration": "International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications\r\n\r\n\r\nThe International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications\r\n(IWOTA) has met biannually since 1981 and annually in recent years (starting in 2002) rotating among ten countries on three continents. The IWOTA conferences offer a rich program on a wide range of the latest developments in operator theory and its applications. In a combination of plenary lectures by eminent mathematicians and parallel sessions of invited and contributed talks, the plan is for this year's conference (to be held July 24-27, 2005 on the campus of the University of Connecticut in Storrs (CT) is to cover a wide range of topics, including operator/system theory, operator/scattering theory, operator theory/structured matrices, operator theory/numerical analysis, operator theory/wavelets and signal processing, operator theory/harmonic analysis as well as topics in Krein space operator theory and core engineering. These topics form a core of the basic science behind a variety of applications, including control of industrial processes, tomography and image reconstruction, data compression and reconstruction, coding theory.\r\n\r\nThe original concept of IWOTA was as a satellite conference for operator theorists to the broader based international symposium on Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS). While this concept is still in place, the scope of IWOTA has broadened considerably in recent years and IWOTA has now attained an independent identity as a world-wide conference for recent developments in core operator theory and its applications. IWOTA's primary objective is to bring together major researchers in the area of operator theory and related fields. These meetings provide opportunities for all participants to present their own work in contributed talks, to interact with other researchers from around the globe, and to broaden their knowledge of the field by hearing the invited lectures of eminent mathematicians. In addition IWOTA emphasizes cross-disciplinary interaction among mathematicians, electrical engineers and mathematical physicists. In addition, IWOTA encourages and financially supports the participation of young researchers, i.e., advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients, for whom the opportunities offered by expert conferences are particularly important.\r\n\r\n",
