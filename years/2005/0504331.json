 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanomedicine is a new interdisciplinary paradigm emerging from the timely convergence of two parallel recent developments - the decoding of the human genome that has led to greater understanding of the molecular basis of medicine and biology, and nanotechnology, which offers the means to control molecular interactions. IGERT Nanomedical Science and Technology is a new integrated doctoral education program that emphasizes interdisciplinary research training in diverse areas including nanostructured materials, nanomagnetism, cell biology and trafficking, optical microscopy and imaging, sensors and diagnostic systems, drug and gene targeting and delivery, and synthesis and surface functionalization and characterization of nanostructures, and theoretical computational modeling. Significant research breakthroughs are anticipated in cellular biosensors, magnetic bio-control, drug delivery, mitochondrial gene therapy, bio-nano machines and nanomanufacturing. Interdisciplinary pedagogical coursework is integrated with practical real-world experience through graduate internships in biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device companies and research hospitals, with co-mentoring by industrial and medical research scientists. A key feature is a strong diversity component, incorporating significant involvement of women and minorities in the student body and the teaching, mentoring, and administrative aspects of the project. The program aims to educate the next generation of scientists and technologists with the requisite skill sets to address scientific and engineering challenges, with the necessary business, ethical and global perspectives that will be needed, in the rapidly emerging area of applying nanotechnology to human health. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",
