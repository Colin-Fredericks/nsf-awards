Training new scientists requires a strong emphasis on creating a student-learning environment that focuses on research-based exercises. This project integrates research-based teaching into the biochemistry laboratory sequence, enhancing the training of several groups of science majors and utilizing contemporary methods, such as liquid chromatography and spectrophotometry. Course materials for two semesters of biochemistry laboratories are being adapted from the biochemical education literature and modified so that the components of experimental design and data analysis are gradually transferred to the students over the first semester of the course. Then, in the second semester, the students are immersed in a research-based environment. The first semester focuses on using a single protein in the context of a semester-long research project to motivate student learning. In the second semester students are empowered to design, execute and analyze their experiments. Both semesters result in training students in the use of sophisticated instrumentation for data acquisition and analysis while utilizing advanced web-based technology including video and audio streaming of instructional materials. The progress of the program is being assessed through several mixed-method evaluations. A biochemistry education specialist is making additional assessments. Project outcomes are being disseminated at regional and national professional meetings and through development of a dedicated web site.\r\n\r\n",
