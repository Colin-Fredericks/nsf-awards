 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe focus of this research will be on metal-mediated Diels Alder chemistry.  As one goal, the preparation of 2-main group element-substituted 1,3-dienes followed by tandem Diels-Alder/cross-coupling reactions will be carried out.  Another goal will be to develop methodology to facilitate the tandem transmetallation/Diels-Alder reactions and sequential transmetallation/Diels-Alder/cross- coupling reactions of main group substituted-dienes. Also, using the Diels Alder approach, the core structures in the cis-clerodane terpenes, compounds having interesting biological properties, will be synthesized.\r\n \r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Mark E. Welker in the Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest University.  Professor Welker will focus his work on the development of Diels Alder methodology using main group substituted-dienes.  When this methodology is employed in combination with transmetallation and cross-coupling reactions, products that are core structures for natural product synthesis result. The work has potential for broader impact in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and the project serves as an excellent venue for the training of undergraduates and graduate students. \r\n",
