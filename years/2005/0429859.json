 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key component of their performance is automatic memory management (garbage collection) which frees programmers from explicit memory management,  easing the programming burden and eliminating a source of many errors.The growing need for high performance collectors has sparked a resurgence in garbage collection research.\r\nGarbage collection provides a number of software engineering benefits such as preventing two\r\ncommon programmer errors which are among the most difficult to diagnose and fix: (1) prematurely \r\nfreeing memory that the program later references, and (2) systematically never freeing which can cause\r\nmemory consumption to grow without bound.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis project will explore (1) dynamic optimizations and policy tuning applicable to a variety of collectors;\r\n(2) new basic mechanisms for attaining locality and flexible heap organizations, and (3) adaptive algorithms\r\nto match applications to policies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact. The research impact from this project will be high performance garbage collectors that play to the strengths of modern architectures and that adapt to the phases of modern applications. High performance will in turn enable higher productivity programming, i.e., programmers will be able to solve new, more difficult, and larger problems. The publicly available research artifacts, MMTk and architecture simulators, will add to the national research infrastructure for exploring memory management algorithms and performance, and the influences on total application performance for modern languages. The educational impact will include training graduate and undergraduate students in this key language system component. Outreach to under-represented groups will include summer research experiences for undergraduate women.",
