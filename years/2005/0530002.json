 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe planning proposal is to enable the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at Rice University to connect concepts in engineering courses to critical practices in the communities in which engineers work and live. The objectives are: 1) to provide a rigorous, coherent curriculum that enables students to gain a strong understanding of biological, physical, and social systems that affect engineering research and practice; 2) to increase students' understanding of and hand-on experience with emerging and leading-edge technologies and engineering practices; 3) to provide all students with opportunities for international service learning experiences focusing on complex engineering problems that occur in diverse cultural and social situations; 4) to increase students' understanding of and experience with complex engineering projects involving sustainability; 5) to improve students' written, oral, visual, and interpersonal communication strategies and skills, especially in collaboration and teamwork; 6) to provide a department culture that is gender balanced and demonstrates cultural as well as racial/ethnic diversity; 7) to integrate teaching and research in ways that benefit both students and teachers; 8) to provide innovative assessment opportunities, including an Engineering and Communication Portfolio and strategies for self- and peer assessment. As a result, students will develop superior technical skills that go hand in hand with social and environmental responsibilities.  Faculty will design an innovative program that integrates emerging technologies, international perspectives, sustainability, communication, and culture into engineering.  Learning, teaching, research, and workplace practices will be treated synergistically.\r\n\r\n",
