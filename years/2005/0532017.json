 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Texas is partnering with urban and rural school districts in the North Texas region to prepare high quality mathematics and science teachers. A combined total of 56 Noyce scholarships and stipends are being awarded to undergraduate or post-baccalaureate students seeking teacher certification in mathematics or science, resulting in the preparation of approximately 42 new secondary teachers with science and/or mathematics certification. Selection is based on a combination of academic preparation, teaching potential, membership in a traditionally underrepresented group, and financial need. Each scholarship recipient is assigned a master teacher mentor in her or his subject area and is part of a community of science teachers and science teaching candidates in the North Texas region. This program brings together an established and ongoing collaborative partnership to recruit and prepare secondary science and mathematics teachers. Scholarship recipients participate in traditional, fast track, or innovative post baccalaureate master's programs that include 50% online instruction in an effort to facilitate the career changer's transition to teaching. The program includes the development of a sustainable cohort of exceptional mathematics and science teachers who provide mentoring and leadership in Texas schools. Evaluation activities include ongoing data collection from program participants that is being used to study the relationship between quality teacher preparation and student academic success. Program outcomes are disseminated via the web, professional conferences, and professional journals.",
