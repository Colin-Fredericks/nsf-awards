 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mantle composition plays an essential role in understanding\r\nevolution, mantle dynamics and phase transitions of the Earth's\r\nmantle. With increasing amounts of experimental data, chemical\r\ninteractions of various phases can be explored between different\r\nsubsystems, and seismic velocity and density profiles can be\r\ncalculated based on compositional models. The ability to\r\nquantitatively calculate seismic profiles based on compositional\r\nmodels makes it possible for compositional models to be directly\r\ntested and constrained using seismic data. The investigators will\r\nperform a joint modeling of seismic and mineral physics data to\r\nconstrain compositional and thermal models in the Earth's\r\ntransition zone. The collaborative research also investigates\r\nregional variation of seismic structures, as well as its cause,\r\nusing seismic data sampling various tectonic regions. The intellectual\r\nmerits of the collaborative research include quantitative and\r\nintegrative studies of seismic structures, wave propagation,\r\nmantle composition and mantle mineralogy in the Earth's transition\r\nzone. This research has broad impacts on training of\r\na graduate student in both seismology and mineral physics, and\r\nproviding seismically-constrained compositional and thermal models\r\nwhich would serve as a basis for a quantitative understanding of\r\nthe effects of mantle mineralogy on the dynamics of the descending\r\nslabs and ascending mantle plumes, and for a quantitative link\r\nbetween seismic velocity perturbations, mantle temperature,\r\nand density buoyancy in large-scale geodynamical modeling.",
