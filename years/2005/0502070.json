 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and his collaborators will address\r\nseveral groups of problems  in areas of algebraic geometry,\r\ncombinatorics, and computational algebraic geometry, with emphasis\r\non syzygies and their relevance in geometry and combinatorics.\r\nAlgebraic geometry at large deals with geometric objects\r\ndescribed by systems of polynomial equations. The area is central to\r\nmathematics since such geometric objects include certain\r\nfundamental examples in the most diverse disciplines\r\nof mathematics.Its importance in the applications\r\nof mathematics comes from the fact that such algebro-geometric\r\nobjects provide models often used when representing fundamental\r\ngeometric forms via equations and also on a computer.\r\nThe investigator will study the geometry and algebra\r\nof polynomial ideals in close relation to their complexity,\r\nwill investigate several combinatorial aspects related to\r\nhis proposed complexity bounds, and will extend the use of\r\nexterior algebra methods to projective geometry.\r\nThe principal investigator's activity will also include the\r\ndevelopment of various fundamental algorithms in computational\r\nalgebraic geometry and their implementation in the Macaulay2\r\npackage written by Grayson and Stillman.\r\n\r\n",
