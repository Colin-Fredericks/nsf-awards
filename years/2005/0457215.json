 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe proposed research involves several interrelated areas in\r\nspectral graph theory, extremal graph theory and random graphs.\r\nA main goal is to deduce the fundamental properties and structures of\r\na graph from its graph spectrum (or from a short list of easily\r\ncomputable invariants). Various combinatorial, geometric\r\nand probabilistic techniques are being developed for examining\r\nthe relations and behaviors of various graph invariants and properties. \r\nThe proposed research project includes:  \r\n(1) Research in spectral graph theory, including spectral Tur'an theorems,\r\nquasi-randomness, random walks in directed graphs, Cheeger's inequality\r\nfor directed graphs,  \r\n(2) Research in random graphs with emphasis on random graphs with given degree distributions,\r\nand examining various aspects including giant components, average distance, diameter\r\nand eigenvalues distributions,\r\n(3) Mathematical models for information networks that generate\r\nrandom power law graphs, including the growth-deletion models of preferential\r\nattachments,  generalizations of Polya urn's model, duplication models for \r\nbiologic al networks and the development of tools such as generalizing martigale \r\ninequalities for rigorous probabilistic analysis of large networks.\r\n\r\nAlthough graph theory has more than 250 years of history, it is only been very \r\nrecently observed that many realistic networks arising in numerous arenas have\r\nastounding coherence --- similar shapes (power law degree distribution) and\r\nhaving the so-called \"small world phenomenon\" (small distances and clustering).  \r\nExamples include WWW graphs, call graphs, biological networks and numerous\r\nsocial networks. The study of the graph models for various information networks \r\nhas led to exciting new directions for research in graph theory. In the other direction,\r\ngraph theory provides tools for analyzing and utilizing large complex networks.\r\nThe primary objective of the proposed research is to advance our understanding \r\nof the intrinsic characteristics and underlying principles that govern large \r\ninformation networks.  Such principles are quite effective and essential in dealing \r\nwith problems in computation and communication involving massive information networks \r\nthat arise in Internet computing and massive data sets.\r\n\r\n",
