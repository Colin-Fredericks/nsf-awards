Located at an excellent site 72 km east of San Diego, the Mount Laguna Observatory (MLO) is operated by SDSU under Special Permit from the U.S. Forest Service. \r\n\r\nAs a result of this award, the facilities at MLO will be modernized and enhanced, making them more scientifically productive and available to a wide range of qualified astronomers and students. The refurbishment of the MLO 1-m will address and correct the problems that result in poor image quality. Upgrades to the 0.6-m telescope will provide an additional user-friendly facility to the community for education and research. Specific examples of the many scientific projects that directly benefit from the proposed upgrades include research on variable stars, star clusters, extragalactic novae, AGN variability, and compact-object binaries. The MLO enhancements will provide a robust, high-quality research facility serving the astronomical community. \r\n\r\nMLO serves SDSU faculty, students, and guest observers. A greatly expanded Guest Observer Program will allow many more visitors to use the MLO facilities, both in person and via service observing. An allocation of 20% time on the 1-m and 25% on the 0.6-m will be available for Guest Observers. Priority will be given to astronomers in the regional community (CSU system and local San Diego colleges) but Guest Observer proposals from all over the world will be accepted. SDSU graduate and undergraduate students will be a vital part of the Guest Observer Program, being hired to provide night assistance, remote observing assistance, or service observing. \r\n\r\nMLO has facilities dedicated to public education/outreach; the Summer Visitors Program held in cooperation with the Forest Service, and other MLO events, host approximately 2500 guests annually. SDSU astronomers also share their research with the public through their classes (approximately 2000 non-science major students per year) and their associated field trips to MLO, and via on-campus public outreach events. \r\n\r\nThis award is funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. \r\n",
