 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on the design, synthesis, and solid-state reaction of multicomponent core-shell nanoparticles and their applications as precursors for making ordered nanocomposites.  The products are  expected to have superior electronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties over their single-phase counterparts.  A specific goal is to create ordered exchange-coupled magnetic nanocomposites from self-assembly of monodisperse core-shell nanoparticles.  Such magnetic nanocomposites can have higher energy product than the single-phase materials.  A series of multi-component nanoparticles containing materials of high magnetocrystalline anisotropy such as alloys of iron and platinum (FePt), cobalt and platinum (CoPt), and samarium and cobalt (SmCo5 ) will be synthesized through the sequential synthetic method.  Polymeric coating on the surface of nanoparticles will be generated as an additional modulating layer using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).  The chemical stability of these nanoparticles can be improved upon the carbonization of polymeric layers, which can affect the properties of nanocomposites.  This project will make contributions to the area of ultra-hard permanent magnets useful in high-power density and lightweight electric drives, efficient motors for aerospace and automobile applications, and ultrahigh density data storage media in microelectronic industry.  Students will be trained on this project to use various cutting-edge research techniques.  The principle investigator will work with the University administrations and local organizations, such as American Chemical Society, to recruit and prepare high school students, minorities, women and economically disadvantaged students in particular, to become a skilled work force in the interdisciplinary fields of nanotechnology.  \r\n\r\nThe advancement of nanotechnology relies heavily on our ability to create multifunctional and complex nanomaterials.  To this end, precise control of element distribution in an ordered nanostructure is crucial.  This research program focuses on the development of new approaches to the production of core-shell nanoparticles and nanocomposites with multiple components that interact with each other and subsequently lead to new properties which do not exist in single-component materials.  These magnetically active novel nanomaterials can be expected to have potential applications in high-power density and lightweight electric drives, efficient motors for aerospace and automobile industries, ultrahigh density data-storage media in microelectronics, and biomedical imaging and hyperthermia cancer therapy in the health industry.  The platinum-alloy nanomaterials developed in this program are potentially excellent electro-catalysts for hydrogen fuel cells, which hold promises for the generation of clean energy.  Through this program, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained to become the future skilled work force equipped with the cutting-edge techniques and knowledge in nanotechnology.  The outreach effort will focus on the establishment of a research site that will attract and prepare high school students in the Western New York area, and in particular minority, women and economically disadvantaged groups, to enter these highly competitive science and technology fields. \r\n",
