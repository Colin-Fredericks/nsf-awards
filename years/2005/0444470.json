 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to substantially improve the productivity of programmers writing\r\napplications for petaflop-scale systems by using programmer defined light-weight transactions as the\r\nsingle abstraction for expressing parallelism, delineating communication, reasoning about memory\r\nconsistency, providing failure recovery, and allowing performance optimization. Transactions as the\r\ncentral abstraction for designing and programming parallel systems leads to a shared memory\r\nprogramming and memory coherence model called Transaction Coherence and Consistency (TCC).\r\nTransactions simplify parallel programming by providing a way of writing correct shared-memory\r\nprograms without threads, locks and semaphores. TCC systems provide high performance communication\r\nand synchronization with support for hardware mechanisms that can keep memory coherent and\r\nconsistent based on programmer-defined transactions.\r\nTo achieve the research objective, this research program will focus on five activities. First, the researchers\r\nwill develop new abstractions that use transactions to provide a shared memory programming model that\r\nmakes it much easier to analyze and optimize application performance. Second, the researchers will\r\ndevelop performance monitoring systems that make use of transactions to detect performance bottlenecks\r\nand to provide intuitive feedback to programmers. Third, the researchers will use the transaction based\r\nprogramming model to implement compiler-based static and dynamic feedback-directed optimizations\r\nthat automatically detect and eliminate performance bottlenecks and extend the scalability of transaction\r\ncoherency to 105 processors. Fourth, the researchers will use transactions to optimize the performance of\r\nparallel storage I/O. Finally, the researchers will develop simulation and emulation technology that will\r\nenable us to experiment with petaflop-scale systems that support light-weight transactions before they are\r\navailable.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe broad impact of this research is to use transaction-based parallel programming to educate and enable\r\na new class of parallel software developers who can implement parallel software with the same facility\r\nthat sequential software is written today. Enabling parallel software development will be critical to\r\nadvancing computing performance from desktop applications to large-scale scientific and commercial\r\napplications. While parallel processing has been essential for large-scale machines for a while, recent\r\nannouncements by Intel, AMD and IBM demonstrate that it will soon be critical for desktop applications\r\nas well. To educate students, other researchers, and industry about the benefits of transaction-based\r\nparallel programming, we will incorporate transactional programming concepts in the parallel\r\nprogramming curriculum and make transaction-based applications available to the wider scientific\r\ncommunity. The researchers expect that releasing a suite of optimized transaction-based applications\r\nalong with simulation technology will be instrumental in encouraging other researchers to experiment\r\nwith and explore the benefits of transactions. To further promote the use of transaction-based parallel\r\nprogramming we will organize a tutorial or workshop at a major scientific computing conference that will\r\ncover the principles and experience of programming with transactions.",
