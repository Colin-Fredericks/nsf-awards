 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of Cambrian soft-bodied faunas has greatly enhanced our understanding of\r\nsome key events in metazoan evolution. However, enigmas and incompletely described\r\nCambrian Burgess Shale-type soft-bodied faunas still remain, as does the question of why and\r\nhow Burgess Shale-type preservation occurs. The immediate objectives of the proposed research\r\nfor which funding is requested are: 1) to prepare, describe, monograph, and fit into a\r\nphylogenetic and paleobiogeographic framework new taxa from the Middle Cambrian softbodied\r\nfaunas of the Spence Member and the Wheeler and Marjum Formations using recent\r\ncollections made from Utah; 2) to use microanalytical techniques to determine the taphonomy of\r\nthe fossils at the specimen-level; and 3) to place the soft bodied organisms and the taphonomic\r\nprocesses involved in their preservation into a detailed paleoenvironmental framework using\r\nnewly developed microstratigraphic techniques.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research is to address some enigmas in Cambrian\r\npaleontology and geology, allowing multiple objectives to be attained. First, identifying and\r\ncharacterizing the elements of the Utah faunas will help establish which taxa are shared between\r\nthese formations and other Cambrian soft-bodied faunas distributed throughout the globe. Thus,\r\nthe stratigraphic and geographic ranges of these species and genera can be determined. Second,\r\nin conjunction with pre-existing information, the phylogenetic relationships of the various\r\narthropods in the Spence, Wheeler, and Marjum can be evaluated. These objectives will increase\r\nour understanding of Cambrian biogeography and also the nature and topology of important\r\nearly episodes in animal evolution. Additionally, intensive taphonomic and microstratigraphic\r\nstudy of three of the principal Burgess Shale-type localities will lead to a refined understanding\r\nof the paleoenvironmental factors and taphonomic processes that controlled the preservation of\r\nBurgess Shale faunas in the Cambrian, and will contribute to our understanding of why this type\r\nof preservation is unique to the Cambrian. Due to the richness and significance of these poorlyknown\r\nfaunas, the excellent exposure across the study areas and the relatively low metamorphic\r\ngrade of mudstones hosting the soft-bodied faunas, this project also provides a rare opportunity\r\nto address phylogeny, paleoecology, and preservation in Burgess Shale-type deposits in an\r\ninterrelated context.\r\nSome of the faunas that will be studied are in collections housed at the University of\r\nKansas (KU), and they are accompanied by precise locality data. There is also an emeritus\r\nprofessor at the University of Kansas, Dick Robison, with significant expertise in areas related to\r\nthis grant. Sue Halgedahl and Richard Jarrard, professors at the University of Utah, have also\r\nagreed to make their extensive collections of soft-bodied, Cambrian Burgess Shale-type faunas\r\nfrom Utah available to us for study; again, these are accompanied by precise locality data. Each\r\nof these factors will greatly facilitate this proposed research.\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, this project will contribute to the training of two graduate\r\nstudents, one at KU and one at the University of California, Riverside, who will participate in the\r\nproposed research activities and attend scientific meetings. Through the RUI program, this\r\nproject will also contribute to the field and analytical training of multiple undergraduates from\r\nPomona College, an undergraduate-only institution and member of the Keck geology\r\nconsortium.",
