 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to the University of Colorado under the direction of Dr. M. Deane Bowers for partial support of a project to curate and database the Gordon Alexander collection of grasshoppers.  This collection is composed of over 19,000 grasshoppers from the Rocky Mountain and plains regions of Colorado that were originally collected under the auspices of a 1958 - 1960 NSF grant.  Approximately 75% of this collection is composed of representative specimens from over 65,000 grasshoppers, representing 95 different species, that were processed during the tenure of this grant.  The remaining 25% is composed of specimens from other studies conducted in Colorado and neighboring states during the 1930's to 1960's.  Given the recent and dramatic impacts of humans in this region, this collection is of particular importance for understanding the communities in existence before these changes occurred.  The goals of this project are 1) to curate the collection in order to preserve it and make it accessible to researchers; 2) to database the collection; and 3) to make the information from this collection available to researchers as well as lay-people by publishing the data from this collection online.  In order to accomplish these goals, the Entomology section requires funds to support curatorial staff and students to coordinate and implement the project. The Entomology section also requires additional curatorial supplies, a microscope and computer equipment, to properly curate and database all specimens. \r\n\r\nThe Alexander grasshopper collection will be curated and databased and information from this historically important collection will be posted online via a new website developed under the auspices of the grant and through publishing the data on global biodiversity networks.  The Alexander collection will be made available in a format that will allow professional researchers and the public access to data that can be used for education and outreach-related projects.  Participation in this project by students will be extensive.  Graduate students will be trained in museum skills, insect taxonomy, curation, databasing, and use of computer programs that are important for making collection data available over the internet. Undergraduates and the general public will have also have access, via the internet, to a relational database that will allow them to examine Alexander's survey and collection data, \r\n\r\nThis project will make the Alexander Collection readily available to researchers, land managers, educators and students.  In addition to making the collection and its specimen information available for study, the data can be used by researchers to examine the effects of land use practices and climate change on communities and species.  Furthermore, the Education section of the Museum will ensure that the collection and the internet material will be used in public outreach and education to the public. \r\n",
