 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project expands a successful GK-12 program that was originally focused on engineering problem solving to a cross-campus program with the broader theme of authentic inquiry in all STEM disciplines. The institutionalized program is called the Project Partners in Inquiry (Project Pi) because it promotes inquiry as an instructional approach through partnerships between STEM graduate students and grade 3-8 teachers. GK-12 Fellows and their institutional counterparts (Pi Fellows) partner with science and mathematics teachers to develop the teaching skills of the Fellows, foster STEM content gain among teachers, and enrich K-12 students. learning of STEM concepts and applications. The Track 2 project reflects a unique partnership between Richland County School Districts I and II, three USC Colleges (Engineering and Information Technology, Science and Mathematics, and Education), the Graduate School, Office of Research, Office of Information Technology, and the SC Commission on Higher Education. The partners are contributing over $900,000 in cost share to this project, and plan to provide $100,000 per year beyond the Track 2 grant to support STEM students to work in K-12 schools and further the goals of GK-12. Institutionalization of GK-12 at USC will occur though the administration of Pi Fellowships by the Graduate School, the management of the Pi Project by the newly established Center for Teaching and Learning, and the adoption of a degree-credit graduate course (GRAD 800) that prepares STEM students for GK-12 activities.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual  Merit of this project includes an innovative inquiry-based learning cycle approach that enables Fellows and teachers to use inquiry in instruction. Fellows and Teacher Partners also learn cooperatively from one another. Other major program elements include the GK-12 Retreat, GRAD 800, the GK-12 Spring Seminar, and the GK-12 Institute for Teachers. The project is designed so that Fellows can help implement and develop lessons based on their disciplinary knowledge. Research will be conducted to determine what factors contribute to successful partnerships and on the extent to which the graduate student.s discipline and the teacher.s grade level assignment affect the partnership.s effectiveness. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts are reflected in the nature of the targeted schools, which include large numbers ofstudents in groups currently underrepresented in STEM. GK-12 activities will be integrated intograduate programs by institutionalizing coursework that includes K-12 teaching and by institutional support for Pi Fellows. Outcomes assessment from Track 1 tells us that graduate students that participate in GK-12 better understand the issues facing K-12 education and will continue to be involved in K-12 after leaving the University. The addition of science and mathematics students to the engineering student base broadens our programs interdisciplinary focus, allows for more coverage of the grades 3-8 curricula, and enriches the graduate student experience. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation and research will be conducted through the USC Office of Program Evaluation to assess program outcomes.\r\n",
