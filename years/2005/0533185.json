 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed one-year DEI project will create standard-based science materials that\r\nparents of students with disabilities can use to reinforce science instruction covered in\r\ngrades K-5. The Science Learning Ideas Pages will emphasize activities that parents\r\ncan do with their children at home (and in the community) and will be distributed by\r\nteachers to parents. It has been demonstrated that parent involvement in their child's\r\neducation is one of the prime reasons for success. Seventy-six sheets will be produced\r\nthat describe supplemental activities. The materials will be standards-based, and\r\ntherefore will be appealing for many teachers to use. These sheets will be available\r\nfree over the Internet, and will be distributed to state Science and Special Education\r\nCoordinators and to national parent organizations. Similar supplemental materials have\r\nbeen developed by this group in the past, but focusing on literacy and recreation. The\r\nproject is well thought out, and it involves a strong team with a good blend of STEM and\r\ndisability experience. One weakness was that there was little reference to the\r\nstrategies the investigators would use to make the activities accessible for students with\r\ndisabilities. The evaluation plan is strong, with both parent and teacher perspectives.\r\nThe reviewers unanimously felt that the Science Learning Ideas Pages could be just as\r\nuseful for students without disabilities as with disabilities. Therefore, we would suggest\r\nthat the investigators take a universal design approach to develop an inclusive\r\ndocument that could help parents of students regardless of whether their children have\r\na disability.",
