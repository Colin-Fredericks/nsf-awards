 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS), in collaboration with the All-Nations and the\r\nPacific Consortia of the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP), requests\r\nfunding to enhance the research skills and knowledge of Native American and Pacific Islander\r\nundergraduate students in tropical biology. The proposed program will take place at the OTS\r\nLas Cruces Biological Station in Costa Rica, an important research station in the Neotropics and\r\na major OTS center for hands-on training in field-oriented research.\r\nThe goal of the Native American and Pacific Islander program is to provide an intensive field\r\nresearch experience for Native American and Pacific Islander undergraduate students. The\r\nprogram is structured around a four-week stay in Costa Rica and Panama, during which the\r\nparticipants will conduct research at OTS Las Cruces Biological Station, among other sites, and\r\nvisit three indigenous communities. The focus of the program is the development of the\r\nstudents interest in biology and their capacity to conduct independent field research.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe strength of the program lies in engaging Native American and Pacific Islander students in\r\npure and applied biological research, while introducing them to the biodiversity, cultural\r\ndiversity and community-based conservation issues of the tropics. Under the guidance of the\r\nprogram staff and faculty mentors, the students will complete high quality research projects\r\ndesigned to sharpen their technical skills and enrich their professional development. In addition,\r\nby providing a broad range of scientific perspectives and research experiences, the students will\r\ngain a sense of career awareness to clarify and direct their future academic life.\r\nProject objectives\r\n1. Introduce Native American and Pacific Islander students to the biodiversity of the tropics.\r\n2. Help students analyze the role that Native Peoples in the Neotropics play in forest\r\nconservation and, by extension, examine the role of conservation in their own communities.\r\n3. Train students in the scientific method and in field research techniques.\r\n4. Develop the students research abilities by conducting guided field research projects.\r\n5. Encourage and facilitate the enrollment of these students in other field oriented biology\r\nprograms, such as REUs and OTS undergraduate and graduate programs.\r\n6. Enhance the interest and commitment of the students in pursuing a science career by\r\nproviding a unique and inspiring research experience.\r\n7. Provide the faculty mentors with tropical field research training to enhance their ability to\r\nencourage and support students at their home institutions.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis program is designed to impact the academic and professional development of Native\r\nAmerican and Pacific Islanders students by providing a broad range of scientific and research\r\nskills to improve their academic competitiveness at the undergraduate and graduate levels and to\r\nencourage them to pursue careers in the environmental and biological sciences.",
