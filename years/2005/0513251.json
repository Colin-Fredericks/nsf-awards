 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large scale continuum mechanics simulations routinely require\r\nthe efficient solution of very large linear or nonlinear systems\r\nof algebraic equations as well as powerful computer systems.\r\nSuch problems are increasingly solved on parallel or distributed\r\ncomputing systems which provide access to a large amount of memory\r\nas well as a substantial number of fast processors. The goal of\r\nthis project is to further develop solvers of domain decomposition\r\ntype, algorithms which respect the memory hierarchy of modern computing \r\nsystems and allow for a performance which approaches peak floating point\r\nperformance. There already exists a well developed mathematical theory \r\nand a good understanding of how to adjust these algorithms to problems\r\narising in different applications but there is also a real need\r\nto further extend our understanding and to improve and numerically\r\ntest new algorithms especially in view of emergence of parallel\r\ncomputing systems with very many powerful processors. A main\r\ngoal of this project is the further understanding of the\r\nFETI-DP and BDDC families of domain decomposition methods.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the work in this field is strongly influenced\r\nby the interaction between academic computational scientists\r\nand scientists at the US national laboratories and in\r\nthe engineering software industry. The connection to the SANDIA-\r\nAlbuquerque laboratories is particularly strong. Domain decomposition\r\nmethods are used extensively in very large and important applications\r\nat these laboratories and the domain decomposition methods are\r\nalso making significant inroads in software systems that are used\r\nby a large community of engineers for the design and checking\r\nof machine parts and larger engineering structures. Particularly important\r\napplication areas are elasticity and electromagnetics. The latter\r\nfield helps create a foundation for improvements of cellular\r\nphone systems, other wire-less communication systems, as well as\r\nmicro electronics.\r\n",
