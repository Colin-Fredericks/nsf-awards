 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops novel and efficient numerical\r\nmethods for Hamilton-Jacobi and Liouville equations. These equations arise\r\nfrom seismic wave propagation, geometrical optics, optimal control,\r\ntravel-time tomography, medical imaging, computer vision, and material\r\nsciences. His previous works on computing viscosity solutions and\r\nmultivalued solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations lead him to develop\r\nmore powerful and efficient numerical methods\r\nfor solving these equations and incorporate these new methods\r\ninto seismic modeling and inversion, as well as other possible\r\napplications. Problems under consideration include continued development\r\nof adaptive eikonal solvers for three-dimensional isotropic and\r\nanisotropic media; fast sweeping methods for stationary Hamilton-Jacobi\r\nequations on unstructured meshes; extending slowness matching methods to\r\ngeneral Hamilton-Jacobi equations for computing multivalued solutions; and\r\napplications of paraxial Liouville equations for geometrical optics, wave\r\npropagation and transmission tomography.\r\nThis investigation advances the state-of-the-art in geometrical optics,\r\nwave propagation and seismic travel-time tomography.\r\n\r\nThese fields and applications are of great strategic value in the US oil\r\nand gas industry, in environmental sciences, and in medical imaging.\r\nRecently, for example, the price of gasoline soared dramatically in the\r\nUnited States. One way to reduce the cost of production of oil involves\r\nlowering drilling costs by advancing the seismic data processing\r\ntechniques that oil companies use to find good drilling sites.  The\r\ninvestigator's new methods expedite routine data processing, provide new\r\ntools for exploration geophysicists to use for ground-breaking\r\napplications, and enable substantial cost savings in seismic explorations,\r\nas the speed and reliability of the underlying computational engine allows\r\n``rig-site'' adjustments to both seismic survey and drilling decisions.\r\n",
