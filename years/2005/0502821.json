 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cohomology of locally symmetric varieties plays an important role in\r\nnumber theory and in particular Langlands's program.  One reason is that\r\nthey are examples of spaces exhibiting an action of both a Hecke algebra]\r\nand a Galois group.  A fundamental goal is to relate these actions and the\r\ncorresponding L-functions.  In previous work, the principal investigator\r\ncreated a new tool, L-modules, to study such cohomology.  In the current\r\nproject, the principal investigator proposes to incorporate Hecke and\r\nGalois actions into L-modules.  He will also prove a \"decomposition\r\ntheorem\" for L-modules and apply it to construct cycles associated to\r\nsub-locally symmetric varieties.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research studies symmetry in geometry and number theory.\r\nApplications of geometry and number theory abound, for example to\r\ncryptography and crystallography.  A symmetry in geometry is a\r\ntransformation of space which doesn't change distance, for example a\r\nrotation.  In number theory a symmetry is a transformation of a number\r\nsystem that transforms the sum of two numbers into the sum of the\r\ntransforms and likewise for the product, for example complex conjugation.\r\nIn both subjects, the most interesting objects are those which remain\r\nunchanged under many symmetries.  For example, in geometry the sphere is\r\ninvariant under all rotations, while in number theory the set of roots of a\r\npolynomial equation with integer coefficients are invariant under all\r\nsymmetries.  The investigator's research concern higher-dimensional objects\r\nwhich possess both geometric and number theoretic symmetries, and the\r\nrelations between these symmetries.\r\n\r\n",
