 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator works on three projects: 1) Mechanical\r\nproperties of composites and polycrystals.  New reliable\r\nanalytical and numerical methods are developed to predict the\r\nstrength of a wide range of heterogeneous solids.  In addition,\r\ndetailed results on idealized models are obtained.  These serve to\r\ngain understanding of real materials and to test existing methods\r\nin regimes where their accuracy is uncertain.  2) Solute transport\r\nin porous media.  New efficient mathematical models are developed\r\nand studied.  Because this project is relevant to the\r\nunderstanding of the transport of contaminants in soils and the\r\ntransport of nutrients in bones, the range of potential\r\napplications of the results of this project is wide.  3) Small\r\nparticles migration and clogging.  Laboratory experiments that\r\ncapture the physical mechanisms involved in particles migration\r\nand clogging are studied and mathematically modeled.  The goal is\r\nto improve the current understanding of the physical phenomena\r\nthat lead to clogging, to provide guidelines for improved\r\nmethodologies to pump petroleum and water.  The phenomena to be\r\nstudied are also relevant in other contexts including sand filters\r\nin water treatment, food grain, pharmaceuticals, bio-mechanical\r\nsystems (lungs, kidneys, etc.) and filters.  The projects are of\r\nrelated nature.  In all cases, the macroscopic physical phenomena\r\ndepend on the microgeometry of the materials.  Accordingly, a key\r\ncomponent to their study is to identify the relevant different\r\nlength and time scales to formally obtain or construct the\r\nmathematical models.  \r\n\r\n     Guidelines that mathematical analysis can provide in the\r\nunderstanding of properties of heterogeneous materials is of great\r\nbenefit to society.  The current availability of computational\r\npower and the maturity that applied mathematics has reached make\r\nmathematical modeling and numerical simulation powerful tools. \r\nThe investigator believes that important discoveries are likely to\r\nresult from interdisciplinary work; accordingly, he collaborates\r\nand interacts with researchers in other disciplines.  Potential\r\napplications of the project include new guidelines on the disposal\r\nof contaminants, the design of improved methodologies to treat\r\nosteoporosis and related diseases, a better understanding of the\r\nprocesses that lead to loss of bone experienced in the absence of\r\ngravity (during space flights), and improve methodologies for bone\r\nimplants.  The objective of the educational activities is to\r\ncreate interdisciplinary learning and research experiences for\r\nstudents, with mathematics being a central component.  To\r\naccomplish that goal, a seminar in interdisciplinary mathematics\r\nis developed.",
