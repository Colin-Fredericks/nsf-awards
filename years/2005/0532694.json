 "awd_abstract_narration": "0532694 Schert The Environmental Enrichment Summer Program for 2005 is open to students who have completed algebra and chemistry before the summer program begins. Eligible students should exemplify a strong interest in math and science and have a grade of C or above in algebra and chemistry courses. Science teachers from local high schools will assist in the selection of students who will participate in the program.  This program will assist them to excel and gain a clear understanding of the fundamental environmental chemistry and engineering curriculum required to receive a degree.\r\nEight high school science teachers also will participate in the 2005 program. They will work with the students in the laboratories and provide assistance as needed. The teachers will be encouraged to take the latest research back to the high school classroom. In addition, each teacher will be required to submit a detailed written report to the Alachua County School Board Science Coordinator and the Center. The report will describe how the teacher benefited from the program and how the teacher will apply his or her new knowledge in the classroom.\r\nThe ultimate goal of the program is to promote an interest in chemistry and environmental engineering and expose students and high school science teachers to advanced topics in environmental science. The program will strengthen interest in science or engineering through instruction by university professors and their graduate students and interaction with scientific professionals.\r\n\r\n",
