 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research has several goals. The first goal is to\r\nstudy cohomological equations over hyperbolic dynamical systems.\r\nOne is interested to generalize Livsic's cohomological\r\nresults to cocycles for which periodic data is included in\r\nsemigroups in Lie groups. Positive results in this direction will\r\nbe natural generalizations of previous work, and will give\r\nobstructions to the topological transitivity of extensions over\r\nhyperbolic actions. The second goal is to use cohomological\r\nresults as a tool in the rigidity theory of partially hyperbolic\r\nhigher rank lattice actions. This goal is part of the rigidity\r\nprogram initiated by Zimmer, aiming to classify volume preserving\r\nhigher rank lattice actions on compact manifolds. A reachable\r\ntarget is to classify small GL(n,R) extensions of SL(n,Z) totally \r\nnon-symplectic actions (i.e. hyperbolic and with a special structure of the\r\nstable and unstable foliations). The third goal is to find generic\r\nclasses of partially hyperbolic transformations with rich dynamic\r\nproperties. Pugh and Shub recently conjectured that stably\r\nergodicity and accessibility occur more frequently than expected \r\namong differentiable maps, and that some partial hyperbolicity is \r\nsufficient to prove stably ergodicity. From a result of Nitica and \r\nTorok it follows that, under technical conditions, stably ergodicity is\r\nopen and dense in the class of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms\r\nwith one-dimensional central foliation. The density holds even in the \r\nhigher regularity classes. An interesting problem is to\r\ngeneralize this result to more general classes of partially \r\nhyperbolic diffeomorphisms. In other direction, a recent result \r\nof Nitica and Pollicott shows that for Euclidean extensions of \r\nAnosov diffeomorphisms on infranilmanifolds the only obstructions \r\nto stable transitivity are of cohomological nature. One would like \r\nto generalize this result to non-abelian fibers, and to classify \r\nthe obstructions to topological transitivity. The Investigator (with \r\nI. Melbourne and A. Torok) has recent results in this direction proving \r\nthe existence of stably transitive extensions with Sp(n) fiber.\r\n\r\nA chaotic map has a dense set of periodic points, that \r\nis points that are fixed by a higher iterate of the map, as well as transitive \r\npoints, that is points for which a higher iterate will get arbitrarily \r\nclose to any other point. Chaotic behaviour is expected to \r\nbe generic in large classes of maps and in nature. Part of this research \r\nwill be focused on finding new mechanisms for producing chaos \r\nfor large classes of dynamical systems that exhibit only partial hyperbolicity. \r\nIt will also concentrate on finding obstructions to chaotic behaviour. These \r\nresults will be of interest to the broader scientific community involved \r\nin applications of nonlinear dynamics in physical sciences. \r\nA spin-off of this work will be a careful study of the semigroups in the \r\nSpecial Euclidean groups with interesting applications to discrete control \r\ntheory and robotics. The Investigator actively participates in recruitment, \r\ntraining and professional development of K-12 mathematics teachers. He will \r\ncontinue his collaboration with undergraduate students and will support them \r\nto give talks at professional meetings. These activities will benefit from the \r\ngrant.",
