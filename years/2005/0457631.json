 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to help establish a full tenure-track faculty position in solar physics in the Department of Planetary Sciences and the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (DPS/LPL) at the University of Arizona, where a research group working in the general areas of theoretical heliospheric plasma physics and energetic-particle physics already exists. The goal is to integrate solar physics as an academic and research discipline into the University. This initiative will explicitly include close cooperation and collaboration with the National Solar Observatory staff  (two of whom are co-investigators), to take advantage of NSO personnel and facilities already in place. The intent is to attract an individual faculty member of the highest quality and to make solar physics a vibrant and important component of the University, as well as to benefit the broader solar physics community. \r\n \r\nThe proposed addition to the DPS/LPL faculty will extend the research and teaching of the Department into new areas, while at the same time building on existing strengths. It is expected that the combination of solar physics with heliospheric and planetary science will produce synergies with areas such as atmospheric sciences, Earth sciences, and cosmochemistry at the University.      The addition of solar physics to the educational program of the University of Arizona will have direct effects. The world-class research and teaching at the University and the proximity of the NSO will attract excellent students to do graduate work in solar physics.  Significant numbers of undergraduate students will be introduced to the current state of our knowledge of the Sun. The University will initiate a program of summer schools, conferences, and outreach programs in solar physics, which will bring the program to the attention of the broader public and science community. The activity will be located in the culturally diverse Southwest of the United States, where the University will reach out to students in a wide variety of ethnic groups and cultures, while encouraging them to consider science education and research as a career. \r\n",
