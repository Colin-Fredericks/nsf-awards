 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe investigator plans to concentrate his efforts on large sample theory\r\nproblems connected with self-normalized sums and functionals of the empirical\r\ndistribution. His interest in self-normalized sums arose largely out of the\r\nquestion: When is the Student-t statistic asymptotically normal? Among his\r\ngoals in this area, he hopes to complete the theory of the asymptotic\r\ndistribution of self-normalized sums. The particular functionals of the\r\nempirical distribution that he plans to investigate include statistics and\r\nestimators based on distance measures such as the empirical Hellinger distance\r\nand a class of integral functionals of density estimators, which are used to\r\nestimate entropy and the integral of the squared density and its derivative.\r\nThis will likely lead to the development of a theory of local U-statistics\r\nprocesses. This theory would be analogous to the local empirical process theory\r\nthat he has worked out with a number of his long-term collaborators to study\r\nthe large sample properties of kernel-type function estimators. These include\r\nkernel-type estimators of the density function, the regression function and the\r\nconditional distribution function. Local empirical process theory has shown\r\nitself to be a very powerful tool to determine exact rates of point-wise and\r\nuniform consistency of kernel-type nonparametric function estimators. A local\r\nU-statistics process theory should be at least as applicable. The research\r\nproblems outlined in this proposal should lead to the creation of a number of\r\nnew and useful methods to treat large sample theory problems.\r\n\r\nThe investigator works in the borderline area between probability theory and\r\nmathematical statistics. He is delighted when he uncovers unexpected\r\nprobabilistic phenomena that occasionally appear on this frontier. The problems\r\nthat he is interested in are frequently motivated by questions about the limit\r\nbehavior of statistical tests and estimators. They arise whenever one wants to\r\nmake a decision on the basis of limited knowledge.  This is especially the case\r\nwhen it is not feasible to sample an entire population to settle a question\r\nabout that population. Some typical examples are when a medical investigator is\r\ninterested in deciding whether or not a proposed new drug or medical treatment\r\nis effective or a fisheries scientist wants to estimate the number of salmon\r\nthat will return this season to spawn.  \r\n\r\n",
