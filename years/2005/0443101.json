 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a major teaching/learning problem for undergraduate engineering students who are highly visual learners - the need to develop a sound understanding of how engineering problems can be formulated and solved, and the ability to transcend disciplinary boundaries, in areas where abstract concepts are involved. Specifically, a generic framework and several prototypes of a new teaching tool, named 'Case Study Interactive', are currently being developed and tested in a variety of learning settings. This innovative instructional tool combines the delivery of technical knowledge and humor/entertainment within a highly visual and interactive computer simulation environment to present complex, multidisciplinary problems that evolve over time. The proposed concept harnesses the same motivators used in computer games, namely the desires to \"beat the computer\" and to maximize one's score, enticing the student to maximize his/her understanding of the laws that govern the response of the system (e.g., scientific principles, management practices). Interactive case studies also enable exposure of elementary and high school students to real-world engineering problems at a technical level that they can comprehend. By varying the relative amounts of technical knowledge and entertainment (\"game\") features, interactive cases can be developed for a wide range of ages and learning capacities. \r\n\r\n",
