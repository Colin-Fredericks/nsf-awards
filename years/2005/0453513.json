 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site will provide research opportunities for undergraduates in an environment where traditional geologic and geophysical research techniques are fully integrated with advanced data collection and management.  Field data collection will utilize global positioning system (GPS) technology and be uploaded into geographic information systems (GIS) for spatial analysis and the generation of derivative products. Fish Lake Plateau forms a remarkable location in which to study volcanic, tectonic, and surficial processes and the interaction of those processes from the mid-Tertiary to the present. The REU program will include five phases:  1) site introduction, GIS, and geophysical training at William & Mary; 2) field collection and data integration at Fish Lake; 3) post-field compilation and metadata production at William & Mary; 4) continued research at their home institution; and 5) project finalization and presentation at Coastal Carolina University.  The science research will integrate geological and geophysical field data into a GIS in a meaningful way that will provide answers concerning the interplay and timing of volcanic, tectonic, and surficial processes on the Fish Lake Plateau and more regionally, in the transition zone between the Colorado Plateau  and Basin & Range.    Over the 7-week summer program, participants will live and work together at William & Mary, both before and after a 4-week field campaign at Fish Lake.  Participants will develop specific research questions and a research plan in coordination with the project directors. The project directors, a graduate assistant, and two consulting scientists will work with the student participants in a both a mentoring and collaborative fashion.  After the summer program, students will work from their home institution on their research topics.  In January, student participants will come together at Coastal Carolina University for oral presentations, discussion, and ideas about future research directions for the REU site.  Many of the students will present their results at professional meetings.",
