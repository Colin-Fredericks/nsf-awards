 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\r\nThe proposer plans to work on a variety of problems in number theory and \r\ncombinatorics.  Among these are the problem of determining the structure of \r\nsubsets of finite fields having few arithmetic progressions. For example, suppose \r\nS is a subset of the integers modulo p having about p/2 elements, and having the \r\nleast number of three-term arithmetic progressions among all sets with about \r\np/2 elements.  How many three-term progressions does S have, and what can \r\none say about the structure of S?  The square dependence problem: pick integers \r\nat random less than x until a subset of these integers products to a square.  \r\nDetermine the expected stopping time of this process.  This problem is central to \r\nrunning time estimates for integer factoring algorithms, problems related to \r\nsum-product estimates in finite fields (given a subset of a finite field, how large \r\nmust the sumset or product set of that subset be?), and problems related to the \r\ncomplexity of inverting certain  number theoretical functions (how difficult is it \r\nto decide whether an integer n is in the image of the Euler phi function?).   The \r\nproposer has already made substantial progress on all of these problems, and \r\nforsees a rich research programme developing in the next several years.\r\r\n\r\r\nTwo good examples of the research problems on which the proposer plans to work, \r\nboth from the same area of mathematics, but of a very different character, are the \r\nsquare dependence problem and the three-term progression problem:  When one \r\nuses the internet to make purchases, ones credit card information is encrypted \r\nusing any of several coding schemes called ``public key encryption''.  There are \r\nmethods to break these codes (for, example the quadratic sieve); however, just how \r\nfast they work is not well understood.  A good solution to the square dependence \r\r\nproblem would give one a very precise estimate for how quickly these methods \r\nwork, as well as indicate how one might tweak them to make them run faster.  \r\nThe other problem, the three-term progression problem, concerns triples of \r\nnumbers which are equally spaced, such 3,5,7 or 11,22,33.  A fundamental, \r\nwell-studied problem in combinatorial mathematics is to determine when dense \r\ncollections of integers contain such triples;  for example, if you pick 100 numbers \r\nfrom among the numbers 1 through 1000, must your 100 numbers have one of \r\nthese triples?  No one knows exactly what makes certain collections of numbers \r\nhave no or few of these triples; however, the proposer has a research plan to \r\npartially answer this question, and already has an accepted publication in a \r\npeer reviewed journal (JCTA) on the problem.\r\r\n\r\n  \r\n",
