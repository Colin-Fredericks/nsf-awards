 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Principal Investigator (PI), with various collaborators, studies an\r\narea of number theory concerned with representations of Galois groups over\r\nthe rationals and cohomology of finite-index subgroups of GL(n,Z).  The\r\nlink between these is given by the action of Hecke operators on the\r\ncohomology and the image of Frobenius elements in the Galois\r\nrepresentation.   The PI explores the \"ADPS\" conjecture, where the\r\ncohomology and Galois representation are both mod-p valued.  He outlines\r\nan approach for proving this conjecture in certain 3-dimensional cases,\r\ntesting it in certain 4-dimensional cases, and independently verifying\r\nsome of its consequences for Diophantine problems.  The PI states a new\r\nconjecture that links the mod-p objects with automorphic representations\r\nand suggests an approach for proving this conjecture in the 3-dimensional\r\ncase.  Finally, the PI and a colleague continue their study of p-adic\r\nfamilies of automorphic cohomology.  On the one hand, for certain classes,\r\ne.g those on GL(3) not lifted from GL(2), they consider questions of\r\np-adic rigidity.  On the other hand, for deformable classes, they\r\ninvestigate 2-variable p-adic L-functions.\r\n\r\nThe ability to solve systems of algebraic equations has been central to\r\nmodern science and engineering.  It has also always been one of the main\r\ntopics in mathematics, driven both by these applications and by its\r\nintrinsic aesthetic appeal.    When the equations have whole-number\r\ncoefficients, their study becomes part of number theory.  The theory of\r\nprime numbers (numbers without smaller divisors except 1, such as 2,3,5\r\nand 7) is central here.  In the last 50 years, applications of these\r\ntheories have become crucial to cryptography and communications theory.\r\nThe Principal Investigator studies delicate questions concerning the fine\r\nstructure of sets of solutions to systems of polynomial equations, the\r\nsymmetries they exhibit, and their (often surprising) relationship to\r\nvarious interesting geometric and topological objects.    These\r\nrelationships are mediated by how the equations behave with respect to the\r\nvarious prime numbers.  There are a number of conjectural explanations of\r\nthese relationships, and the PI studies them, proving them in certain\r\n\"easy\" cases and verifying them by computer in more complicated cases.  He\r\nalso investigates phenomena which compare whole families of these\r\nstructures with respect to a fixed prime number.\r\n",
