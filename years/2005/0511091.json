 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the work outlined in this proposal is to build a more\r\ncomplete understanding of spatially localized structures in\r\nquadratically nonlinear parametric gain devices, focusing on the\r\nstability and dynamics of these structures in a self-heated\r\nmedium.  The scope of the proposed work includes the development\r\nof a numerical model capable of incorporating the multiple\r\ntemporal and spatial scales necessary to characterize the impact\r\nof absorption-induced heating of the parametric gain media, and\r\nanalysis of more tractable model equations such as the\r\nparametrically driven nonlinear Schroedinger equation coupled to\r\nthe one- or two-dimensional heat equation.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for several reasons.  The most\r\nimmediate of these lies in its applicability to parametric gain\r\ndevices, such as optical parametric oscillators, used for\r\nconversion of optical fields to frequencies in the far-infrared\r\nregion.  Such devices are very important for spectroscopic\r\napplications, including the detection of environmentally harmful\r\nagents or chemical weapons, and for military countermeasures,\r\nincluding jamming of infrared-based missile guidance systems.\r\nFrom a more theoretical standpoint, the proposed research draws\r\nfrom several areas that have recently made significant advances in\r\nmaturity, including multiscale simulation techniques, rigorous\r\ncollective coordinate reductions, and the dynamics of patterns in\r\ndissipative equations.\r\n",
