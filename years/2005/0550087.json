 "awd_abstract_narration": "The measurement of flood-stage discharge in mountain rivers is an enormous logistical challenge, particularly on large space and time scales, and the inevitable paucity of such data has impeded progress\r\nin our understanding of mountain landscape processes. We propose a novel solution that exploits new\r\nhigh resolution satellite imagery (2m, FORMOSAT-2) with unusually high revisit frequency (daily) over\r\na region of very broad interest to the earth science community (Taiwan). Our proposed method entails\r\nthe collation of a time series (2004-2005) of orthorecti*ed, georeferenced images of selected mountain\r\nriver channels, in tandem with contemporaneous stage measurements of discharge at the nearest gauging\r\nstation downstream. Patterns of inundation along selected channel reaches will be mapped in each\r\nimage. With the aid of cross-channel profiles mapped in the field at low stage, we will make estimates\r\nof low width, depth, mean bed shear stress and mean low velocity. Once a broad range of discharges\r\nhas been processed, we expect to be able to construct rating curves for these low measures as a function\r\nof the directly observed, at-station stage data. Combination of the rating models with the multi-decadal\r\narchive of station data in Taiwan will permit an assessment of the long-term probability distributions of\r\nlow widths, depths and shear stresses along and across the selected bedrock channels. Measurements of\r\nthis kind, albeit indirect, will be of enormous interest to the geomorphology community. However, the\r\nmethod is by no means guaranteed, because remote river gauging has never been attempted in mountain\r\ncatchments; it remains to be seen whether the precision of the anticipated rating curves will suffice for\r\nrivers akin to those of the Taiwan Central Range. The main task of the pilot project will be to address\r\nthis issue and to lay the foundation for a more comprehensive, longer-term assessment of Taiwanese\r\nmountain river discharge.\r\nBroader outcomes: While low measurements in steep mountain rivers are particularly sought after by\r\nthose interested in bedrock channel processes, they are also of great interest beyond: from modelers\r\nof landscape evolution and the interaction between climate and tectonics, to hydrologists preoccupied\r\nwith the assessment of flood hazard in populated mountain environments. Moreover, if the pilot project\r\nproves successful it will provide the Taiwanese space agency with an excellent example of the value of\r\nFORMOSAT-2 in natural hazard assessment, one of its principal missions. As a result, more attention\r\nwill be paid to the regular acquisition of FORMOSAT-2 imagery in tropical mountain areas, an essential\r\nstep if the elusive goal of a high-resolution, multitemporal image archive is to be achieved - at present,\r\nimages of highland areas are a relatively low prioity (for FORMOSAT-2 and other equivalent satellites)\r\nand are only acquired daily during emergency periods (e.g. typhoons). Such an archive would be widely\r\nappreciated across the discplines of earth sciences, hydrology, ecology, not to mention in remote-sensing\r\nR&D itself.\r\nA-1",
