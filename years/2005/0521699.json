 "awd_abstract_narration": "EAR-0521699\r\nTromp\r\n\r\nCaltech's Division of Geological & Planetary Sciences will construct an 864-node PC cluster computer that will be combined with an existing 160-node cluster.  The resulting supercomputer will have 1024-nodes (2048 processors) and will be dedicated to a wide spectrum of geoscience research and education.  The NSF Award provides an important component of the funding for a partnership between Dell, Intel, and Caltech. NSF, Dell, and Intel have provided the funds for the computer while Caltech renovated 1750 square feet of space with advanced cooling and uninterruptible power. \r\n\r\nThe computational facility will be used for research in the solid-earth sciences (including seismology, geodynamics, and geodesy), atmospheric sciences (including climate dynamics), and planetary sciences (including planetary atmospheres).  The project spans a wide range of topics in basic research as well as work that will have a substantial benefit to society (such as work related to earthquake shaking and climate change).  For example, in seismology, the infrastructure will lead to dramatically improved images of earth structure, globally and locally, as well as images of the rupture of large, destructive earthquakes. In geophysics, simulations tied to observations will lead to a fuller understanding of the forces driving plate tectonics and the rupture of earthquakes.  In atmospheric sciences, simulations will be used to demonstrate how water vapor is maintained, how it varies, and how it may cause rapid climate change. In planetary sciences, the mechanisms of the most dramatic weather events in the solar system, the Martian global dust storms, will be investigated.  \r\n\r\nSince many of the scientific challenges facing geoscientists today transcend disciplinary boundaries, and many of the computational challenges involve common issues related to algorithms, visualization, and data assimilation, the single computer system will enable cutting-edge simulations while promoting and fostering cross-fertilization of ideas.  The facility will generate a learning environment that fosters interdisciplinary interactions and integrates research with education, thereby educating and training the next generation of academic and industry computational scientists and engineers.\r\n",
