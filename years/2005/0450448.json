 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a plate washer capable of washing very high-density plates, such as 1536 well plates, for ELISA and high-throughput screening assays. Currently,  there  are  automated plate washers for 96 and 384 well plates, but there  are  none  available for  plates  with  ultra-high  density.  This  is because  currently  available  washer  technology, employing a nozzle system,   cannot  be  made  reliable  enough  to allow dispense  and  aspirate  nozzles to properly  reach  within  each  of the many, very  small  wells, and  because  the thin nozzles needed can get easily clogged using many standard buffers. In contrast, the proposed system uses a steady stream or sheet of solution, making the system less likely to clog. \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will be to allow use of high-throughput screening assays by industrial and academic researchers involved in genomics and drug discovery research. The proposed technology will enable additional use of fluorescent chemical compounds, that typically require a wash step to remove interfering substances,  for screening.\r\n\r\n",
