 "awd_abstract_narration": "This special meeting will bring together people from the Computational\r\nStatistics and Numerical Linear Algebra communities with people from the\r\nTheoretical Computer Science community to promote cross-fertilization of\r\nideas.  This will hopefully lead to a better understanding of modern\r\nmassive data sets as well as invention of new techniques and algorithms\r\nfor their modeling and analysis.  Most conferences and workshops on\r\ninformation retrieval and data mining are dominated by studies of\r\ntraditional data sets and traditional algorithmic techniques.\r\nNevertheless, modern data sets have become extremely complex and have\r\nrendered traditional approaches for processing them ineffective in many\r\ninstances.  The difficulties occur primarily in two ways: modern data sets\r\nare often high-dimensional and massive, and thus novel dimensionality\r\nreduction or sampling-based techniques have to be employed in processing\r\nthem, and modern data sets often have complicated nonlinear structures,\r\nand must be modeled with appropriate mathematical objects such as tensors,\r\nsymmetric spaces, Lie groups, etc.  This special meeting will study data\r\nsets with such complex structures and explore novel techniques for\r\nanalyzing such data.\r\n\r\nThe techniques that will be discussed at the meeting have applicability in\r\nnumerous fields of practical and important interest. For example:\r\n(1) Applications in Bioinfomatics and the Medical Sciences include\r\nimproved methods to analyze large microarray and high-throughput chemical\r\ndata sets for developing new medications, identifying novel gene products,\r\nelucidating protein folding pathways, and the improved detection and\r\nclassification of cancer.\r\n(2) Applications in the Social Sciences include improved methods to model\r\nthe combinatorial structure of large social networks; this has been used\r\nand will continue to be used to, e.g., identify potential terrorist cells\r\nhidden in a communications network.\r\n(3) Applications in the Geosciences include remote sensors in air-and\r\nspacecraft that produce more data than can currently be stored, but which\r\nmust be analyzed for environmental planning, weather forecasting, and\r\npublic health contamination issues.\r\n(4) Applications in Computer Vision include novel ways to identify noisy\r\nimages of targets and faces for improved target identification and\r\nindividual identification in more realistic settings.\r\n",
