 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communication devices, characterized by bandwidths over 500 MHz, can achieve data rates above 100 Mbps over distances of 10 m. This has the potential to open up vast markets, beginning with high-speed personal area networks (PAN). However, a host of important questions must be answered about the performance of UWB networks prior to their widespread acceptance. With this motivation, the aim of the project is to design efficient networking algorithms and protocols for UWB, using theoretical analysis, supported by simulations, to maximize network capacity. The project is investigating the problem of joint power adaptation, scheduling and routing in UWB wireless networks, including ad hoc networks. The methodology used is to obtain an optimal centralized algorithm as its solution, followed by a thorough analysis of the solution, and then the translation of the solution to decentralized protocols for practical UWB physical and MAC layers. \r\n\r\nThe project will provide guidance, through scientific publications, for UWB network protocol design, to speed up the development of the UWB network market. The impact of optimal physical layer techniques, such as power adaptation, on networking will be quantified, complementing the current heuristic approach. The development of rigorous cross layer optimization techniques and the exploration of a mathematical notion of 'network layering' will be incorporated into the PI's communication courses, providing interesting links between communications and networking. Undergraduate participation in the project will be encouraged through experiments on MAC protocols, using the PI's wireless educational laboratory.\r\n",
