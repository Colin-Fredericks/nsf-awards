 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective and approach:\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to synthesize well ordered self  assembled arrays of rare earth sulfide nanowires. This will result in dense arrays of highly  efficient field emitters that have low work function (~ 1 eV) and high melting point (~  2000 C). They will be capable of delivering several tens of A/sq-cm at low threshold voltages and will be used in traveling wave tubes produced by the  industrial partner.\r\n\r\nThe approach involves pulsed laser deposition of the constituent  materials into 10-nm sized pores of porous alumina and testing them at the facilities of the  industrial partner.\r\n\r\nThe broad impacts are varied. The commercial impact is in the field of  cold cathode technology that has applications in wireless systems including cell  phones, base stations, satellite communications, flat panel displays, etc. The educational  impact is in the training of graduate students as well as outreach efforts to mostly African  American 9th and 12th graders through the Richmond Area Program for Minorities in Engineering  (at Virginia) and to other under-represented groups though the Ethnic Engineers  program at Cincinnati. The fabrication method is environment friendly and the  economic/societal impact is in job creation in the high tech area of microwave products. \r\n",
