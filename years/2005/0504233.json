 "awd_abstract_narration": "Asymptotic equivalence theory has emerged as a growing new area of \r\nmathematical statistics research. The purpose of this project is to \r\ndescribe the asymptotic behavior of some nonparametric curve estimation \r\nmodels, which have distributions that depend on a smooth function f(x). \r\nFor each of these nonparametric models, the investigator derives a \r\nlimiting model that can be used as an asymptotic approximation, such \r\nthat inference in the original experiment can be performed under the \r\nlimiting experiment without loss of information. Many regular \r\nnonparametric models have been shown to be approximable in the limit by \r\na Gaussian white-noise-with-drift experiment which observes a Brownian \r\nmotion plus a mean that depends on f(x). In this project, the \r\ninvestigator considers extensions of the regular nonparametric problem \r\nto include nuisance parameters such as an unknown variance or an unknown \r\ndistribution of sample points. The limiting experiments in these cases \r\ncontain a secondary component that describes the nuisance parameter, and \r\nthis demonstrates that the estimation of f(x) can be separated from \r\nother unknowns in the problems. The investigator also approximates \r\nnonparametric problems with two-dimensional sample spaces by a Brownian \r\nsheet process plus a mean. These asymptotic approximations allow the \r\nnon-standard problems to be solved using techniques from the simpler \r\nGaussian models.\r\n\r\nIn many areas of technology today, large sets of data that do not follow \r\na typical pattern are difficult for scientists to analyze. This problem \r\ncomes up in tasks such as interpreting medical images and signals, \r\ndescribing distributions of plant species, and analyzing financial \r\nseries. In this project, the investigator transforms the problem into a \r\nform that can be solved by already existing statistical tools. As a \r\nresult, existing methods of analysis can be applied to a wider range of \r\ntechnological problems. Thus the techniques developed by the \r\ninvestigator may be used to improve the efficiency of medical imaging, \r\nsignal interpretation, financial analysis, and other applications.\r\n",
