 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interest in solid-state chemistry has undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities for performing exciting research in this area. The goal of this conference is to facilitate collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with specific interest in the synthesis and characterization of a new class of liquid crystal materials. The NSF funds will be used primarily to support the participation of students, post-doctoral scholars, and early career faculty, as well as invited speakers principally from undergraduate colleges. \r\n\r\n%%% \r\n\r\nThe Solid State Chemistry community continues to have direct impact on technological advances of high significance to society by designing new materials for energy, electronics and photonics, including the design and construction of novel sensor and display materials. \r\n\r\n",
