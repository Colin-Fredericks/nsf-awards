 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the University of Wisconsin-Madison and in other universities throughout the state, there are over a thousand  faculty performing research within the life sciences.  Fundamental to many of these studies is a mass spectrometric-assisted proteomic analysis of the cells, tissues and organs that make up the organisms.  The UW -Madison Biotechnology Center Mass Spectrometry/Proteomic Facility was established in 1998 as a  centralized facility for the purpose of acquiring mass spectrometers and making them available to the research community on a fee-for-service basis.  During the six years since inception, it has proven successful in meeting the proteomic needs of nearly one hundred different academic laboratories in a cost effective, top quality manner. However, a major deficiency for investigators using this facility has been the inability to obtain protein sequence from very small samples of tissue, a common handicap of biological research.  A second limitation is the ability to routinely perform quantitative differential proteomic experiments using isotope-assisted tandem mass spectrometry. The MALDI-based tandem mass spectrometer known commonly as a MALDI-TOFTOF is an instrument that is uniquely capable to address both of these problems.   Surprisingly, there is not a single MALDI-TOFTOF available in the state. Wisconsin researchers currently must drive/fly to Chicago or Boston to obtain precious instrument time. Lack of ready access to this instrument locally has hindered our researchers in obtaining the critical information needed for converting genomic sequence 'data' into a real understanding of life processes. The purpose of this award is to acquire this instrument and make it available to academic researchers statewide.  The instrument will be placed within the existing UWBC Core Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics Facility, ensuring that (i) it will be accessible to a large diverse group of researchers, (ii) that it will heavily used and (iii) that it will be well maintained for optimal sensitivity and overall reliability. \r\n\r\n    The broader impacts of this project are several-fold. First, the research users represent a large number of different academic disciplines, from Animal/Food Science to Engineering to Prebiotic Chemistry to the 'traditional' Molecular, Cellular and Organismal Biology areas.  Six years of prior experience in operating expensive and sophisticated mass spectrometers ensures that the operation of this MALDI-TOFTOF will be well organized, accessible and affordable for the entire community.  In addition, the university has strived to ensure that the UWBC core facilities in general, and the Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics in particular, are utilized for education at all levels, including undergraduates and high schools, both locally and in Wisconsin communities with underrepresented groups, such as economically impoverished schools in Milwaukee and Native American Indians in small communities of northern Wisconsin.   This instrument will advance discovery and promote teaching and generally enhance the academic infrastructure, not only at UW-Madison, but also, all over the state. \r\n \r\n",
