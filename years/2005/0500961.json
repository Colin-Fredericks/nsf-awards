 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will investigate representations of finite dimensional algebras\r\nby a variety of geometric, homological, and combinatorial methods,\r\nthe latter including adaptations of Groebner techniques.  Her first\r\nproject targets representations with fixed dimension and fixed top.\r\nFor that purpose, the PI is supplementing the classical geometric\r\nmethods in the field  --  predominantly affine  --  with a projective\r\nsetting inside Grassmannian varieties.  Combining the different\r\nviewpoints, she will explore moduli problems for representations with\r\nfixed top or fixed radical layering and work on a classification of\r\nthose degenerations of a given representation which leave the top or,\r\nmore strongly, the radical layering unchanged.  The second project is\r\nhomological and focuses on a class of tame algebras (string\r\nalgebras), which first surfaced in work of Gelfand-Ponomarev on\r\nrepresentations of the Lorentz group.  Her goal is to extend the (at\r\nthis point well-understood) homological behavior of finite\r\ndimensional representations to infinite dimensional ones.  In\r\nparticular, she will address the structure of modules of finite\r\nprojective dimension and the placement  --  in terms of in- and\r\noutgoing maps  --  of the full subcategory of such modules within the\r\nentire module category.  The third project is aimed at derived\r\ncategories.  In this direction, the PI will continue prior research\r\non the geometry of chain complexes. She expects applications to a\r\nlongstanding homological problem known as the `No Loop Conjecture'.\r\n\r\nUnder a wider angle, the project can be located as follows: The\r\nmajority of our physical models for the universe live in finite\r\ndimensional vector spaces. The most interesting of these spaces carry\r\nadditional structure, such as a Lie or associative algebra\r\nmultiplication, for example.  Associative finite dimensional algebras\r\nare the objects of the investigator's research. One approach towards\r\nunderstanding them is to explore their 'representations', which can\r\nbe thought of as linearized snapshots of the algebra which are\r\nrealized within algebras of matrices  --  both coarse-grained and\r\nfine-grained snapshots are of interest to highlight different\r\nfeatures of the algebra.",
