 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Engineering Technology (58) \r\n\r\nThis project is developing a partnership between the University of South Carolina Upstate and five South Carolina Community Colleges to create a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology Management Degree (BSETM) for students who have completed an Associate Degree in one of eight engineering technology disciplines. Graduates of the program are being prepared to become engineering technology managers for local and regional industries. Community College partners include Greenville Technical College, Piedmont Technical College, Spartanburg Technical College, Tri-County Technical College and York Technical College. Areas within the BS degree include project management, contract management, engineering cost analysis and systems decision-making. Applicable technologies at the community colleges include Architectural, Civil, Construction, Electronics, Graphics, General, and Mechanical Engineering Technologies. \r\n\r\nThe degree has a cross-functional focus that integrates best business and technical practice with an applications-oriented approach. Curriculum is being developed collaboratively between all of the institutions in the collaboration to ensure a seamless block transfer of associate degree recipients to the BSETM program. The project is building institutional infrastructure and use of best practices to nurture students and insure satisfactory academic progress, program completion and transfer to the baccalaureate management program. Included is a bi-annual shared \"Advising Academy\" for all advisors and counselors in the collaboration, mentoring and mentor training, creating a cyber-advising system, a student success banquet and development of student honor societies. \r\n\r\nThe leadership team is engaging in an outreach program to high schools students, parents and teachers to increase the awareness of opportunities in engineering technology. The outreach effort is focusing on recruiting and retaining women and minority students. Students recruited to the program are being supported through a bridge program. An educational/occupational outlook and opportunity CD/DVD is being developed and distributed across the 17 northern counties of South Carolina. \r\n\r\n",
