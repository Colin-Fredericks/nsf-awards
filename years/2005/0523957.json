 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe research objective is to develop a generic theory for model based feedback flow control. Accessible\r\nmodels, design and analysis methods and, indeed, clearer understanding of fluidic temporal actuation and\r\nsystem parameters influence of flow system behavior, as characterized by the onset or suppress of various\r\ninstabilities, are the key components. This integrated theoretical and numerical research program\r\ncombines unique fluid flow modeling expertise at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and system\r\nanalysis and control theory capabilities at Northeastern University (NEU). We envisage a closelycoupled,\r\nwell-coordinated synergy between the two institutions and with an already existing collaborative\r\nteam in industry and academe. A set of case studies of increased complexity will be used to isolate key\r\nstumbling blocks and develop critical enablers. Well beyond these benchmarks, effective feedback flow\r\ncontrol will provide critical enablers for substantial improvements in a wide range of applications,\r\nranging from aircraft, automotive, semiconductor, imaging, air conditioning, the chemical process\r\nindustry, bio-reactors, furnaces, to aeroengines & ground-based gas turbines for power generation.\r\nThe defining challenge in this nascent field arises from the deep chasm between the intrinsic complexity\r\nof unsteady and transient actuated fluid dynamics and the simplicity and robustness required of models\r\nuseful for feedback design and analysis, and architecture (i.e., sensors and actuators placement and\r\nspecifications) optimization. Addressing this challenge, the proposal is characterized by an analytic,\r\nphysics-based approach and aims at the fundamentals of fluid dynamics in relation to actuation. Essential\r\nnew modeling tools will be developed to efficiently characterized targeted dynamic manifolds, matched\r\nby controller and observer design and architecture optimization tools, geared to respect - and exploit - the\r\nexceptionally limited validity envelopes of such models. The selected benchmarks, characterized by\r\nsignificant unsteady motion and transient dynamics, include separation and stall of airfoils, the stability of\r\nthe backward-facing step flow, the separated vortical wake flow behind a bluff body, the stability of\r\nshock waves over airfoils, and the transition to breakdown states in a swirling flow in a pipe. Each is\r\nimportant in its own right for both fundamental science and critical applications. More significantly, they\r\nhighlight and isolated key technical issues in a framework which is both tractable and sufficiently rich.\r\nIntellectual Merit. Dominant techniques in the emerging field of feedback flow control such as transfer\r\nand describing functions and empirical (POD) Galerkin modes are often limited to nearly linear systems\r\nor tend to exhibit very poor capability to capture transient dynamics and actuation, and to sustain\r\nparametric changes in the operating point. The need for new tools, fresh and innovative approaches in this\r\nfield, and indeed the very evolution of feedback flow control as a new and well defined discipline, are an\r\noutgrowth of these gaps. The main thrust of the research will be to develop means to address these\r\nshortcomings by an appeal to the fundamental physics of the problems, combined with a system\r\ntheoretical approach. We look to develop reduced-order models which are derived from the Navier-Stokes\r\nequation and phenomenological physical characteristics, such as energy production, absorption and\r\ntransfer, and natural instabilities, and account for realistic boundary conditions and meaningful actuation\r\ntechniques. The research will be characterized by tight coupling of the PIs knowledge bases in system\r\ntheory and fluid dynamics and leverage prolific ongoing interactions with a cross disciplinary group of\r\nexperts in numerical flow simulations and imaging, experimentalists, and industrial researchers; this range\r\nof expertise is imperative, and external collaborations will serve as a source of initial insight, an impetus\r\nfor new directions, and an ongoing resource and for validation of developed tools and understanding.\r\nBroad Impact. The proposed approach is unique in its synergistic use of classical and modern\r\nmathematical tools, fluid dynamics and control techniques to provide a comprehensive theory of feedback\r\nflow control, led by a collaboration between two experts in these areas. The project will lead to an\r\nimproved understanding of the mechanisms that provoke instabilities and transition phenomena in various\r\nflow systems, the ways to actively control them for improved performance, and will provide rigorous\r\nmeans to explore and define the yet unclear feasibility scope of feedback control in fluid flow systems.\r\nThese advances will impact both on the basic science and on a wide range of industrial applications\r\ninvolving fluid flow / aerodynamics, shear layer mixing and combustion. It will also contribute to\r\nnonlinear control theory, developing new design and analysis methods for a challenging class of systems.",
