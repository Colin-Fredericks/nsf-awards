 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the scope of available information grows, it is increasingly\r\ndifficult to find what one needs when it is needed. The growth of\r\nsearch as an industry is testament to this problem, but existing tools\r\nare incomplete solutions. They index content, but not context. They\r\ncapture only static, syntactic relationships, not dynamic, semantic\r\nones. Perhaps most importantly, they have access only to information\r\nstored either on a user's local machine or publicly-accessible\r\ndistributed stores---other sources are neither indexed nor searchable.\r\nInformation Pedigree solves this problem by capturing context and\r\nsemantic relationships between information items, collecting disparate\r\nrelationship meta-data to support searches, and providing for\r\navailability of relevant items created on machines controlled by\r\nindividual users.  Information Pedigree achieves this goal by\r\ninstrumenting the flow of information between a user's applications\r\nand services, as well as the flow of information between different\r\nusers.  By observing these transactions, we form a contextual and\r\nsemantic index over data that is used, simplifying its retrieval for\r\nlater use.\r\n\r\nInformation Pedigree will make it easier for people to find and share\r\ndata, without placing additional burdens on them or their IT support\r\nstaff.  This greatly reduces time wasted in managing information,\r\nallowing information workers to be more productive.  The results from\r\nthis project will be widely disseminated in the research literature,\r\nand a prototype of the system will be made available to other\r\nresearchers as well as users.  This project will train several\r\ngraduate students, and influence the curricula of several graduate and\r\nundergraduate courses.\r\n",
