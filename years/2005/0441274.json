 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue and enhance an ongoing measurement program at Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) to routinely collect and analyze aerosol filter samples for non-sea salt sulfate (NSS), nitrate, sodium, ammonium, and nitric acid by now adding semi-continuous measurements of organic aerosol mass (OM).  Instrumentation acquired under this award will make operationally defined measurements of organic carbon (OC) at MLO where air characteristic of the free troposphere can routinely be sampled.  In addition, a number of seasonal intensive field measurement campaigns will be conducted at MLO to characterize OM in with even greater detail.  The behavior and variability of the OC/NSS ratio will be determined over several years and through collaboration with other groups the results will be compared with numerical simulations using a variety of models.  Results from this study will lead to an improved understanding of the role of organic carbon compounds in tropospheric aerosol chemistry, and a better quantification of organic aerosol mass will enable more accurate representations of organic matter in model treatments.  The broader impacts of this work include continuing a long-term heritage of highly climate relevant observations at MLO, producing important insights on how to better constrain chemical transport models and reduce uncertainties in climate model simulations, and providing research and educational opportunities for students at the University of Hawaii.",
