Frohman\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will extend and interpret quantum\r\ninvariants of three-manifolds utilizing the geometry of character\r\nvarieties. The ideas he is exploring will combine tools from\r\ngauge theory, representation theory, homological algebra, and\r\nthree-manifold topology. This entails work on several\r\nproblems. With Kania-Bartoszynksa he will define a quantum\r\ninvariant of three-manifolds which will be a real analytic\r\nfunction on the open interval (-1,1). The invariant will be\r\nobtained by heat kernel regularization of the divergent formula\r\nfor the Turaev-Viro invariant. The power series expansion at 0,\r\nwill be in terms of weighted signed counts of surfaces carried by\r\na spine of the manifold. The normalized limit as you approach 1,\r\nwill yield the total Reidemeister torsion of the SU(2)-character\r\nvariety of the fundamental group of the manifold. Using ideas\r\nfrom matrix models he will develop an analogous invariant based\r\non the SL(2,C)-character variety of the three-manifold.  With his\r\nstudents he will continue to study the connection between the\r\nA-polynomial and quantum invariants, and explore the knot and\r\nlink homology theories of Khovanov and Khovanov-Rozansky. With\r\nOliver Dasbach and Marta Asaeda he is looking at homology\r\ntheories underlying the Alexander polynomial. Finally, given a\r\nthree-manifold and a Heegaard splitting there is an algebra which\r\nis the Kauffman bracket skein module of the Heegaard surface and\r\na bimodule over that algebra built from the skein modules of the\r\ntwo handle-bodies. With Mike McLendon, he will study whether this\r\nhomology is a three-manifold invariant, and if it is, what its\r\nrelation to Khovanov homology is.\r\n\r\nThe rational understanding of the path integrals of Richard\r\nFeynman stand as one of the major unresolved problems of\r\nmathematics. Using his integrals Feynman was able to make\r\ncomputations in quantum electrodynamics that far exceeded\r\nprevious work. The tools he developed allowed the construction of\r\nmodern integrated circuits. The rules that physicists use for\r\ncomputing path integrals have never been made completely\r\nrigorous.  The major thrust of Frohman's work in recent years has\r\nbeen about these integrals in a simplified setting where things\r\ncan actually be computed. Specifically, the Yang-Mills measure in\r\nthe Kauffman bracket skein module assigns to a gauge field on the\r\nspace of flat connections on a surface a number. The formula for\r\nthe measure coincides with an asymptotic expansion that appears\r\nthroughout the physical literature. However, in this situation it\r\nis actually a convergent series.  Frohman is using this formula,\r\nand the estimates he used to prove it converged, to pursue the\r\nanalytic study of three-manifold invariants that were before only\r\ncomputable using algebraic and combinatorial methods. The goal of\r\nthe project is to reveal the geometric and toplogical nature of\r\nquantum invariants of three-manifolds to the end of increasing\r\nthe understanding of three-manifolds, representation theory and\r\nquantum gravity.\r\n\r\n",
