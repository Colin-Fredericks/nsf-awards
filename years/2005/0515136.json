 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAnimals are frequently challenged by stressors in their environment, including changes in the availability of food and water, presence of reproductive opportunities or predators, and other demands.  Survival depends upon the ability of the brain and body to respond to these challenges by altering behavior and bodily functions.  For example, changes in availability of food and water, or presence of predators, will lead to changes in foraging behaviors, arousal states, and metabolic activities.  These changes arise from the actions of neurotransmitters in the brain, and are coordinated by the actions of hormones in the brain and body.\r\n\tThe PI studies a neurotransmitter, called orphanin FQ or N/OFQ, that appears to be important in regulating responses to stressful challenges.  N/OFQ is a member of the opioid family of molecules (that is, is related to opioid drugs).  N/OFQ activates anxiety-related behaviors that increase vigilance and inhibit foraging, and it increases hormonal activities that affect bodily functions to enable the animal to cope with the stressors.  The PI is studying various aspects of N/OFQ and its role in regulating behavior, particularly in response  to stress.  The PI is examining the regulation of expression of the N/OFQ gene, regulation of N/OFQ function during stressful challenges, regulation of behaviors and hormones by N/OFQ, and is assessing the role of hormones in the behavioral effects of N/OFQ.  Because N/OFQ is found in all vertebrate animals, this research has the potential to shed light on the behavioral and biological regulation of organisms from fish to man.  The consequences of stress are a challenge for humans, and so it is important to understand of the biological mechanisms that have evolved to cope with stress.\r\n\tThe research program includes the participation of 4 graduate and 5 undergraduate students, and thus includes a substantial teaching component.  The laboratory at the University of Florida also has a long-standing collaboration with a researcher at Florida State University, which includes reciprocal training of students.  This research should uncover important information about the basic regulation of organisms during stressful challenges to homeostasis.\r\n",
