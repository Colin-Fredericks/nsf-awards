Applications of non-classical light have taken\r\non increased importance in recent years due to the emergence of quantum information and communication\r\nas major areas of research and development. The research proposed here will result in compact sources of\r\ncontinuous variable squeezing and entanglement based on second harmonic generation in a KNbO3 waveguide embedded in an optimized self-imaging ring resonator. There are several novel features of this project that distinguish it from other existing research. All prior demonstrations of entangled sources have used parametric downconversion. Spatial squeezing and entanglement in second harmonic generation have been predicted in intracavity and single pass geometries, but never observed. The use of harmonic generation greatly widens the scope of applications since it will make quantum sources available at new wavelengths.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity is the study and demonstration of spatial nonclassical\r\nlight and entanglement in X(2) nonlinear interactions. The PI will investigate a new mechanism of squeezing and entanglement generation that is the result of a spatial modulational instability. Extension of quantum optical effects to the spatial domain is of fundamental interest in the study of non-classical fields and may enable new applications in quantum information transmission, and precision measurements.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed activity will be in the furthering of the PI's ability to manipulate and\r\ncontrol optical fields. Success in this endeavor may result in new compact sources of nonclassical light for\r\napplications in quantum communication and quantum limited measurements. The research to be performed\r\nat The University of Wisconsin - Madison will expose undergraduate and graduate students to state of the\r\nart techniques and tools, and train them to contribute to the technological and scientific development of\r\nsociety.\r\n",
