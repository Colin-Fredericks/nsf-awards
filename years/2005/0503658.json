 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal involves various aspects of the homotopy theory of\r\nmanifolds, all of which, in one way or another, have connections to\r\nthe theory of embeddings. The proposal\r\nhas four parts:\r\n\r\n   1) Embedding theory. The PI will use techniques arising from the\r\nhomotopy theory of Poincare complexes to study embedding questions.\r\n\r\n   2) Group Actions. The study of equivariant manifold classification\r\nproblems will be approached in a new way using homotopy theory.\r\n\r\n   3) String Topology. This is emerging field, created by Chas and\r\nSullivan, studies algebraic structures associated with the free loop\r\nspace of a manifold. The PI proposes\r\nto study homotopy theoretic aspects of string topology.\r\n\r\n  4) Thickenings.  A \"thickening\" of a space is a manifold model for\r\nits homotopy type. The PI proposes  to analyse the homotopy type of \r\nthe moduli space of  thickenings of a finite complex.\r\n\r\nA \"manifold\" is a  space which is locally Euclidean. Manifolds arise\r\nnaturally in physics, chemistry and biology as spaces of solutions of\r\na  suitably \"nice\" set of algebraic equations modeling the scientific\r\nobject of study (space-time, atoms, dynamical systems, etc.) .\r\nManifolds play a central role in mathematics. It is often the case\r\nthat mathematical questions about  manifolds can be formulated in\r\nterms of parametrized families of functions between spaces associated\r\nwith manifolds. Homotopy theory is a subject designed to  tackle\r\nquestions about such families of functions. The PI proposes to study\r\ncertain kinds of manifold questions which can be hopefully be analyzed\r\nfrom the homotopy theoretic toolbox. These involve problems related\r\nwith intersections, embeddings and symmetries.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
