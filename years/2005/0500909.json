 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis project studies the complex and Kohn Laplacians in several\r\ncomplex variables, the d-bar-problem on complex manifolds, as well\r\nas their applications to and interplays with problems in algebraic\r\ngeometry and quantum physics. One of the main thrusts of the\r\nproposed research is  systematical study of the d-bar-Neumann and\r\nKohn Laplacians along the lines of the classical spectral theory\r\nfor the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians.  The investigator will\r\ncontinue his work on the interplays between spectral behavior of\r\nthese Laplacians and the underline geometric structures. A problem\r\nof particular interest is to characterize geometric structures on\r\nwhich these Laplacians have purely discrete spectrum. The\r\ninvestigator will also study the spectral theory of related\r\nSchrodinger operators with magnetic fields.\r\n\r\nComplex analysis and differential equations arise naturally in\r\nphysics, engineering, chemistry, economics, and other sciences.\r\nSpectral analysis of differential operators plays an important\r\nrole in quantum mechanics.  The proposed research will further\r\nexplore the intimate connections between the seemingly unrelated\r\nproblems in several complex variables and quantum mechanics.  It\r\ncould lead to new understanding and discoveries in both fields.\r\nIdeas, tools, and techniques developed in this project will also\r\nhave repercussions in other fields.  This project will have direct\r\nimpact on the development of human resources; it will support\r\ndevelopment of new courses and texts that attract students into\r\nmathematics and sciences.  It will facilitate interdisciplinary\r\nresearch activities with biologists and computer scientists.\r\n",
