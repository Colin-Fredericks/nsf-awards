 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds for a four-year, third and final phase of a GPS-based study of the\r\nColima-Jalisco region of western Mexico are requested. Since early 1995,\r\ntwo large magnitude earthquakes (M=8.0 and M=7.6) have ruptured the Middle\r\nAmerica subduction interface directly offshore from a 30-station GPS network,\r\nmost recently in January of 2003. These earthquakes have afforded an exceptional\r\nopportunity to study the coseismic and postseismic effects of large\r\nsubduction earthquakes, including the gradual decay of postseismic fault\r\nafterslip and viscoelastic flow and re-emergence of interseismic elastic\r\nstrain accumulation. Studying these earthquakes and their after effects\r\nhave numerous intellectual merits, outlined below. Specific goals for\r\nthe proposed project are as follows: (1) Continue annual measurements of the\r\nregional velocity field to characterize spatial variations in viscoelastic\r\nflow and afterslip triggered by the Mw=8.0 Oct. 9, 1995 Colima-Jalisco and\r\nM_w=7.6, 1.22.2003 Tecoman earthquakes, (2) Construct a six-station continuous\r\nGPS network to better characterize the temporal evolution of these viscoelastic\r\nand afterslip responses and better separate them from the underlying linear\r\nelastic strain accumulation. Continuous measurements will enable determine of\r\nwhether the Cocos/Rivera subduction interfaces accommodate downdip transient\r\naseismic slip events similar to those recently described for Cascadia, Japan,\r\nand southern Mexico. (3) Complete modeling of the coseismic and post-seismic\r\neffects of the 2003 Tecoman earthquake using existing and new observations,\r\nincluding a joint inversion of the geodetic and seismic constraints,\r\ncollaborative analysis of local seismic data for aftershock relocations, and\r\nsensitivity analysis for our assumed elastic constants, layer thickness,\r\nand subduction interface geometry. (4) Employ measured variations in\r\nthe direction and magnitude of interseismic strain accumulation to\r\nboth estimate the degree of locking along the Rivera and Cocos plate\r\nsubduction interfaces and relate onshore strain accumulation to\r\nthe oceanic plate motion. (5) Determine how the 1995 Colima-Jalisco earthquake\r\nand subsequent processes altered stress levels in the adjacent Tecoman earthquake\r\nrupture zone. (6) Extract information about upper plate deformation associated\r\nwith the continental rifts in our field area from GPS, seismic, and Shuttle\r\nRadar Topographic Mission data. As has been the case in previous stages of\r\nthis project, the present phase of the project will have numerous broader impacts.\r\nThree Mexican scientists will participate as official collaborators: Osvaldo Sanchez\r\nof UNAM, Bertha Marquez of the Universidad de Guadalajara, and Gabriel Reyes of\r\nthe University of Colima, as well as Mexican undergraduate and graduate students\r\nfrom three universities. In addition, support is requested for a UW graduate student\r\nto continue his finite element modeling of the geodetic data for his dissertation,\r\na Caltech graduate student who will work with Gabriel Reyes on local seismic data,\r\nand two REU undergraduates who will work under Stock's guidance. Data from the new\r\ncontinuous sites will constitute a useful legacy for other investigators, particularly\r\nfor detecting and characterizing transient signals related to aseismic slip along\r\nthe subduction interface.",
