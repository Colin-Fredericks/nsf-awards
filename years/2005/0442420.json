The approach is based on analyzing and implementing graphics applications with real-world complexity. It is motivated by students' interest in computer graphics because of their experience with graphics-based applications and their desire that their courses will be directly applicable.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in facilitating a better understanding of fundamental computer graphics concepts in real-world applications, resulting in improvements of student motivation/retention with efficient learning.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project lies in creating a model for computer graphics courses in most existing IT/CS/Engineering degree programs that supports working adults in both self-learning the concepts and in practicing implementation of computer graphics applications.",
