AIMBE is the U.S. member organization to the International Federation of Medical and Biological Engineering and this award provides funds to support travel of AIMBE'S appointed representative to participate in meetings of IFMBE's Administrative Council. Representation on the Administrative Council provides the United States with the opportunity to develop new lines of communications and collaborative projects among biomedical engineering researchers globally, thereby extending the U.S. leadership role in medical science and technology research and development. This is particularly relevant to investigations concerning emerging medical technologies.\r\n\r\nProceeds from an award are to support the cost of attending Council meetings and regional conferences in Asia-Pacific, Latin and South America, and Europe. The Council meetings entail strategic planning of the organization, planning of scientific meetings, publications, dissemination of scientific information and initiation of advanced projects in critical and emerging areas. The regional conferences are designed to promote collaboration and networking among Bioengineering researchers and educators from the United States and developing countries and as a mechanism to implement the critical projects.\r\n\r\nThe funding level is modest compared to the anticipated value for the U.S. community of biomedical engineering researchers. Also, the project is expected to promote the role of the National Science Foundation in advancing research and education in this field globally while assisting NSF in achieving its strategic objectives.",
