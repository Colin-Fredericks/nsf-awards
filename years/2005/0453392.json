 "awd_abstract_narration": "REU site: BACHE-REU Scholarship Program in Computer Science\r\n\r\nThe program, BACHE-REU Scholarship in Computer Science, is designed to\r\nprovide undergraduate research opportunities to full-time students attending any of the\r\nfive member institutions in the Birmingham Area Consortium of Higher Education.\r\nThe five institutions are Birmingham-Southern College, Miles College, Samford\r\nUniversity, the University of Montevallo, and the University of Alabama in Birmingham.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe BACHE REU-CS program is a year-long experience in which\r\nparticipants are selected from BACHE institutions to take part in projects designed by\r\nfaculty researchers from within the BACHE consortium. Each participating institution\r\nwill have an assigned faculty coordinator who will publicize the project on his/her\r\ncampus. Fourteen students will be selected by acommittee of faculty mentors based on\r\ncompatible interest and skills outlined in available projects. Accepted Scholars will\r\nspend up to 10 hours per week for theacademic year and full time during the summer\r\nlearning a wide variety of disciplines and approaches. The students will participate in \r\nweekly journal club meetings and monthly research-in-progress meetings. In addition, \r\nthe students will present their work in an inter-institutional symposium.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe primary goal of this program is to give BACHE REU - CS\r\nscholars the experience and confidence to pursue graduate study in computer science.\r\nSeveral factors shape the design of this program. 1) While all BACHE institutions offer\r\nundergraduate computer science and/or management information system majors, only\r\nthe University of Alabama in Birmingham offers graduate study in Computer Science.\r\nThis program will increase the research opportunities for students attending\r\nBirmingham-Southern College, Miles, Samford, and the University of Montevallo. 2)\r\nBACHE institutions represent a wide range of student profiles: Samford and\r\nBirmingham-Southern College students are generally upper middle class or affluent,\r\nUAB has a large first-generation college student and international representation, Miles\r\nis an historically black institution, and Montevallo is a state-supported liberal arts\r\ninstitution. Interaction between faculty and students from such disparate institutions will\r\nbe of great benefit to all concerned, and will respond to the NSF's stated goal of\r\nincreasing research participation by underrepresented constituencies.",
