 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid lateral solidification (RLS) is a unique new laser-melting process that allows thin metallic films on dielectric/amorphous substrates to be rapidly solidified. It can be viewed as 'nonconventional' or 'integrated' rapid solidification that can provide rapidly solidified films of extremely high purity and uniformity. This grant aims to perfect and use this technique for a detailed study of three technically promising Cu-based systems, and to leverage related numerical modeling efforts into a comprehensive computer modeling initiative in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. \r\nThe experimental effort: (1) investigates the rapid solidification process in-situ using laser melting and RLS of Cu, Cu-Cr and Cu-Sn thin films under well-controlled conditions (this includes in-situ measurements of solidification velocities, and analysis via transmission and scanning microscopy); (2)? extends metal rapid solidification research farther into non-equilibrium regimes, exploring the boundaries of amorphous and glass formation in Cu-Sn alloys; (3) measures application-critical properties on RLS microstructures of Cu and Cu-Cr alloys, including conductivity and electromigration; (4) models the experiments using the numerical simulation code 3DNS, which will be integrated with a new computer modeling education initiative in MSE. \r\n\r\nThe research will open up a broad new arena for applications of non-equilibrium metallic phases, engineered and composite microstructures, shape memory functionality, and amorphous metals into thin-film advanced devices, including engineered microstructures for Cu and Cu-alloy interconnects, shape memory and metallic glass alloys integrated into sensors, MEMS, and SAW devices, and new metal-based connections/electrodes with advanced metal-oxide devices. A new comprehensive computer modeling initiative is planned that will integrate instruction, support, and outreach to transform the MSE curriculum at the University of Pittsburgh. Another goal recruits graduate students, boosts undergraduate enrollment, as well as increases diversity through student exchanges with the University of Augsburg exchange program and the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program. \r\n",
