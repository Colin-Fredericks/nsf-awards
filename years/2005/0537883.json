Laser and Plasma processing of materials is used in various manufacturing sectors such as semiconductor/electronic manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, general manufacturing, life science products, medical device manufacturing.  The focus of the center includes:  bulk processing, surface processing, coatings, surface etching and patterning.\r\n\r\nThe I/UCRC will also take full advantage of being cited next to Free Electron Laser Facility of Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.  The Facility is the world's most powerful, tunable laser, currently delivering kilowatt average power in the mid infrared.  The strong interest in the center is evidenced from various letters of commitment received from industry and federal laboratories.  \r\n",
