 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to organize and conduct a workshop, Frontiers in Evolutionary Biology, to address emerging research priorities in evolutionary biology.   The proposed workshop is planned to take place on January 10-12, 2005 at NSF in Arlington.  The specific goals of this meeting are to: 1) review, discuss, and propose a series of targeted research initiatives in evolutionary biology; 2) propose mechanisms for incorporating these initiatives into the research priorities of the NSF; 3) produce a report of our findings to be used by NSF staff and others. \r\n\r\nTo reflect the growth and new developments within evolutionary biology, the proposed workshop will expand its scope to consider patterns and processes of evolution at the population level, including behavioral, morphological and physiological aspects of evolution.  This expanded scope will include the range of evolutionary research and topics considered by Population and Evolutionary Processes, Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology, Animal Behavior and related programs at NSF.  \r\n",
