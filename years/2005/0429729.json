This mentoring effort truly reaches, recruits, and retains underrepresented groups in engineering. The Bridge program that was developed by Charlena Grimes has documented success and is a primary component of the nomination. The 14-year old program has improved the departmental retention rate by 20%. Program documentation reflects that more than 663 underrepresented students have participate dint he program; 50 percent earned a degree in STEM (or are very close to degree attainment) and 75 percent earned some degree from WSU, compared to non-Bridge students who have a 67 percent graduation rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
