 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Biocomplexity in the Environment / Materials Use: Science, Engineering and Society research project investigates potential pathways of Brominated Flame Retardants (BRFs) to the environment from products during use or after disposal, as well as the perspectives of different stakeholder groups involved in manufacture, use, and regulation of BFRs and products that contain them. BFRs enable manufacturers of plastics, furniture, and other products to meet stringent fire resistance requirements in an economical manner. However, BFRs have also been measured in the fatty tissues of animals and humans in increasing concentrations.  Concern about the environmental safety of BFRs has lead to the prohibition of some formulations in some jurisdictions, including California.  While all parties stress the importance of safety, it is hypothesized that different groups will emphasize different dimensions of the so-called \"precautionary principle\" in their BFR arguments.  For example, manufacturers may frame the issue politically in terms of \"caution\" about risks from fire, while environmental groups may emphasize \"caution\" regarding the unknown health risks posed by bio-accumulation of these nearly ubiquitous compounds.  To better understand the role of these overlapping ideas of \"precaution\" in the political process, and possibly identify opportunities for mutual advantage, the multidisciplinary research team will apply multi-criteria decision analysis in search of BFR formulations that best address each group's concerns. The results will contribute to development of educational programs in sustainable engineering and policy, aid regulators with pressing policy decisions, strengthen ties between academia, government, industry and non-governmental organizations, and result in a more robust framework for investigation of other environmental policy and decision making problems.\r\n\r\n",
