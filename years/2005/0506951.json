The fundamental mechanisms by which nanoscale ligands\r\nsuch as dendrimers  bind metal ions will be elucidated through a combination of techniques:  dendrimer  synthesis  and  characterization, bench  scale  measurements  of  proton  and  metal  ion binding, spectroscopic measurements and analysis, and multiscale  modeling.  In addition to advancing the fundamental science of metal ion chelation by nanoscale  ligands,  this  research  could  provide insight  and  guidance  to scientists and engineers  interested  in  the  use  of  dendrimers  as high  capacity  chelating  agents  for industrial separations and templates for the synthesis of metal-bearing nanostructures with electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic activity.  Two water purification platforms will be emphasized in this project: dendrimer-enhanced filtration  systems  and  dendrimer-based  treatment  units. The  dendrimer  enhanced  ultrafiltration  (DEUF)  process  combines  water-soluble functionalized  dendritic  polymers  with  the  well-established  water  purification  technology  of  ultrafiltration.  A key objective of this project is to optimize DEUF for the recovery of metal ions from the membrane concentrates of water treatment and desalination plants, thus providing water utilities in the US with more efficient and cost-effective means of treating the  problem  of  brine  disposal.   Another goal of this project is to explore the use of iron-dendrimer complexes as functional materials for a new generation of membrane-based reactors for water purification.  In terms of the broader impacts, this project could provide the water industry with a versatile technology for purifying water contaminated by redox active metal ions such chromium. Similarly, the development of dendrimer-based units that selectively remove copper and lead from  water  would  provide  municipalities  with  novel means of treating contaminants resulting from the dissolution of water delivery pipes.  This project will also provide training opportunities in interdisciplinary research  for postdoctoral,  graduate  and  undergraduate  students  at  Howard  University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology.\r\n",
