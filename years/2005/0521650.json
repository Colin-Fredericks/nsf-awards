 "awd_abstract_narration": "A JEOL, model, JSM-7000F thermal field emission scanning electron microscope will be installed at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) to perform research, research training and instruction. The SEM will provide intermediate range order (10 to 100 nm scale) information from a diverse number of materials and nanostructures, which is crucial to understanding their properties and, physical and chemical basis of the formation. This project will enhance fundamental research in nationally important areas such as synthesis of semiconductor, metallic, dielectric, and organic nanostructures with applications in nanoelectronics, renewable energy, health, national security, and environmental remediation. The SEM will be used in funded research projects including; ordered nanoscale nucleation and crystal growth of nanoheterostructures, health effects of carbon nanotubes, analysis of friction stir welding, nanoparticle synthesis by plant tissues, and synthesis and analysis of surface compounds. The SEM will also be used for research training and education of students at UTEP, which is a minority serving institution located in a geographically isolated and economically underdeveloped region. The SEM will be used in a course to teach and train a large number of students and researchers. The SEM will fortify the strengths of UTEP in materials research and its strategic goals to dramatically improve and increase research activity. This project will create a unique and strategically important capability in an underrepresented region and will be publicized to encourage researchers from UTEP and other regional academic and industrial institutions to use the instrument. UTEP has plans for the long-term operation and maintenance of the SEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA high-performance electron microscope (SEM) will installed at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) for teaching and research activities. This powerful microscope can magnify an image up to 500,000 times, allowing researchers to see very small features on the order of one-billionth of a meter (nanometer). Students and researchers will use it to image very small material and device structures. Applications include catalysts, semiconductors and many other materials which behave very differently as the particle size changes. This project will enhance fundamental research in nationally important materials, which have applications in electronics, renewable energy, health, national security, and environmental remediation. The SEM will be used in funded research projects in the areas of high-efficiency solar cells, carbon nanotube health effects, novel welding techniques, environmental remediation using plants, and synthesis of stable pigments. The SEM will also be used for training and education of students at UTEP, which is a minority serving institution located in a geographically isolated and economically underdeveloped region. The SEM will be used in a course to teach and train a large number of students and researchers. The SEM will fortify the strengths of UTEP in materials research and its strategic goals to dramatically improve and increase research activity.
