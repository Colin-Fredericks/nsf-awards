 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will examine the feasibility of commercialization of a new technology, known as the Helmholtz Equation Least Square (HELS) method based Nearfield Acoustical Holography (NAH), for visualizing acoustic radiation from a complex vibrating structure in a manufacturing environment.  Noise is one of the growing environmental issues that face our society every day.  According to National Institute of Health, over 10 million Americans suffer permanent noise-induced hearing loss.  The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health report that about 30 million Americans are exposed to daily noise levels that will eventually impair their hearing.  The first step in tackling noise pollution is to obtain an accurate diagnostics.  By visualizing sound, engineers can pinpoint source locations and reduce noise levels most cost effectively.  The goal of this project is to provide engineers with a powerful tool to acquire an in-depth understanding of sound generation mechanisms that cannot be obtained by using conventional noise diagnostics.  The insight and knowledge gained will enable an engineer to devise the most cost-effective way to both reduce noise pollution in a manufacturing process or environment and perform noise related quality control on products.  Special attention will be given to development of an optimal regularization scheme to enhance the accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing an acoustic field in a realistic manufacturing situation.  In particular, the effect of acoustic reflections from nearby surfaces, which have never been addressed in traditional NAH theory, will be considered.  Moreover, methods for a rapid deployment of this technology to meet the engineering application requirements will be developed and tested.  It is anticipated that this project will yield a robust tool to tackle noise issues in a general manufacturing setting in the most cost-effective manner. \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this project will have a significant impact on reducing noise pollution, improving workforce capabilities and competitiveness, and providing a practical tool for noise-related quality control.  This technology will benefit companies that want to lower noise levels in product and manufacturing system or improve the manufacturing quality control process.  Manufacturers will benefit from a quieter manufacturing environment, and end users will benefit from quieter products.  Successful commercialization of this novel technology will have an impact on manufacturing industries such as automotive, aerospace, appliances, and many others where noise is one of the major concerns.\r\n",
