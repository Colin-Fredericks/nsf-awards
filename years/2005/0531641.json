 "awd_abstract_narration": "Slowlife is a traveling multi-media science/art educational exhibit that\r\nwill include video, live plants, photographic prints, and interactive\r\nenvironments. The exhibit was originally designed by plant biologist Dr.\r\nRoger Hangarter in collaboration with artist, Dennis Dehart. Built on\r\ncore series time-lapse movies, the exhibit will attempt to convey to a\r\npublic audience that plants are complex living beings instead of\r\nornamental inanimate objects. By combining time-lapse movies with\r\nartistic elements that demonstrate various plant movements and growth\r\nresponses, the exhibit accurately and effectively combines science and\r\nart in a way that provides scientists and non-scientists with a novel\r\nway of learning some basic plant biology. The exhibit lets viewers\r\nexperience a sense of intrigue, mystery, and a bit of awe, all of which\r\ncontribute to enhancing their awareness of plant life. The experience\r\nalso provides viewers with an opportunity to reflect on their\r\nrelationship to plants and their environment. The original exhibit had a\r\ndebut installation at the Indiana University School of Fine Arts\r\nGallery. The traveling exhibit being built through this award is\r\nscheduled to open at the U.S. Botanic Garden Conservatory on the\r\nNational Mall in Washington DC in October, 2005. Following that\r\ninstallation, it will be shown at the Chicago Botanic Garden in June,\r\n2006.  During the two installations in Washington, DC and Chicago, it is\r\nestimated that 900,000 people will see the exhibit.  It will travel the\r\ncountry for the following 5 to 7 years.\r\n\r\n",
