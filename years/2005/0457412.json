 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the creation of a methodology for modeling \r\nand mathematical computation to quantify operational flexibility in service \r\nand manufacturing supply chains. It emphasizes the flexibility attained \r\nwhen sources of production (e.g., workers, machines, plants, etc.) are \r\nmulti-functional. Examples of this include workers with multiple skills, \r\nmachines with flexible or reconfigurable capabilities, and supply chains \r\nwith flexible sourcing and distribution options. By having multi-functional \r\nservers (sources), capacity can be dynamically allocated in response to the \r\nrealization of uncertain demand. Taking queueing networks as models of the \r\nproduction systems, approximate deterministic metrics of flexibility are \r\nused to accurately predict the best design from various alternatives. \r\nMathematical programming, queueing theory, Markov Decision Processes, and \r\ndiscrete event systems simulation are employed. The research illuminates \r\nthe connections between general queueing networks with flexible servers and \r\nthe properties found in approximate, deterministic network models.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in \r\nthe design of service and manufacturing operations and supply chains that \r\ndeliver high-performance efficiencies and service levels despite uncertain \r\nchanges in technology, heightened consumer expectations, decreased vertical \r\nintegration of the supply chain, and intensified global competition. The \r\nprimary objectives of this research are to (1) develop effective methods \r\nfor quantifying flexibility, (2) develop principles and methodology to \r\nbetter select a roster of flexible workers for a shift (or work period) \r\nthat results in a robustly productive team, and (3) invent a methodology to \r\nassist in the design of robust multi-echelon supply chains. The anticipated \r\nresults of this research are: (1) managerial insights that deepen the \r\nunderstanding of how to design production systems and worker/staffing \r\nschedules that are truly flexible and robust and (2) tractable \r\nanalytical/numerical models and methods for the analysis and design of \r\nmulti-echelon supply chains.  Upon implementation, the results will help \r\nordinary people through increased quality of service in everyday \r\ntransactions, workers through increased career development and training, \r\nand businesses through improved management practices and competitive \r\noperations.\r\n",
