 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will develop a low-cost nano-composite self-assembled thermoelectric system via a commercially viable manufacturing process. Control of homogeneity at the molecular level dictates the ultimate performance of the thermoelectric material, which is quantified by the Figure of Merit, ZT. High values of the Figure of Merit (preferably 2 or greater) are only achievable by strict control of molecular deposition, which is attainable via self-assembly processing. Self-assembly represents a method for rapid, aqueous based, room temperature deposition of molecularly uniform material layers. This synergistic manufacturing approach combines properties obtained only via nano-structured materials for macro scale structural components. \r\n\r\nPotential applications of nano-structured, low-cost, self-assembled thermo-electrics include remote power generation, commercial refrigeration and air conditioning, and cooling for electronics and optics. Consumer and corporate products would benefit via replacement of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) based cooling units. Replacement with thermoelectric modules facilitates an environmentally friendly, precisely controlled thermal management solution for nearly any refrigeration or air conditioning application. Thermoelectric modules can also take advantage of waste heat generation from industrial and private operations to generate auxiliary power for such systems.\r\n",
