 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estimated to contain more than 15,000 species, the decapods are the most\r\nspecies rich and economically important group of Crustacea, including\r\nshrimp, crabs, crayfish, and lobsters.  Furthermore, many extant families\r\nhave well-documented fossil records. Accordingly, the decapods have been the\r\nsubject of more published papers than have all other crustacean groups\r\ncombined, due in part to their species richness, economic importance, and\r\nmorphologic diversity.  Given the prevalence of decapods in the public and\r\nscientific mind, understanding the evolutionary history of this significant\r\ncrustacean group is crucial. Five principal investigators, K. Crandall, D.\r\nFelder, J. Martin, C. Schweitzer and R. Feldman, will lead an international\r\ngroup of decapod researchers in a collaborative effort to resolve\r\nhigher-level decapod relationships by integrating developmental,\r\nmorphological, molecular, and paleontological evidence. This international\r\nresearch team, including both lead investigators and collaborating team\r\nmembers, has collectively published on every major lineage of decapods, and\r\nincludes expertise in comparative morphology, systematic paleontology,\r\nmolecular, morphological (adult and larval), and combined data phylogenetic\r\nanalysis, as well as systematic theory. This group will collect molecular (~\r\n20 genes) and morphological (~200 characters) data from nearly all 153 extant\r\nfamilies of decapods and morphological data from all 16 fossil families.\r\nData will be rigorously analyzed to estimate evolutionary relationships.\r\nThe resulting phylogeny will be used to test outstanding hypotheses\r\nconcerning decapod evolution and dates of divergences. Taxonomic schemes\r\nwill be accordingly revised.  In addition, principal investigator N.\r\nHanegan, a science educator, will establish collaborative university and\r\nschool projects to integrate effective professional development for teachers\r\nwith classroom activities for students, centered on state biology content\r\nstandards through inquiry-based learning. High school students will be\r\nengaged in research including question development, data collection, and\r\nanalysis while interacting with university researchers and other schools in\r\nthe Project Crawfish network. Undergraduates, graduate students, and\r\npostdoctoral associates will be trained across the spectrum of techniques as\r\napplied to decapod systematics.  Project Crawfish will train teachers from\r\n15 schools across Utah and Louisiana, impacting 22,500 high school students\r\n(with high minority representation) concepts through experiential learning.\r\nBoth the educational and research components will utilize web-based\r\ndissemination of research results and both will strive to produce extensive\r\npeer-reviewed publications, including comprehensive monographic revisions.\r\n \r\n \r\n",
