 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate active nanoscale optical interconnects,\r\nbased on nonlinear photonic crystal nanocavity switches. Active optical interconnects\r\nform the basis of a reconfigurable flow of information on CMOS microelectronic chips,\r\nwith ultralow latency, ultrahigh bandwidth, low power dissipation, and high-density\r\nintegration feasibilities. The approach is based on silicon nanocavities for immediate\r\nCMOS compatibility, with insertion of nonlinear nanomaterials or nanopatterned\r\nmaterials to achieve ultralow switching thresholds and high-speed operations. The cavity\r\ndesigns will take advantage of photonic crystal nanolattices for strong field enhancements\r\nand material interactions. All-optical switching through Kerr nonlinearities will also be\r\nexplored. Theoretical designs and concepts will be investigated via full three-dimensional\r\nfinite-difference time-domain simulations, and devices will be fabricated and\r\ncharacterized at Columbia.\r\nIn terms of broader impact, this exploratory program addresses several of the core issues\r\nfor continued CMOS VLSI scaling. It is thus of general interest for engineers and\r\nscientists active in optical data communication and silicon microelectronics. The program,\r\nin addition, will support the interdisciplinary training of students in nanophotonics for\r\nthese industries. Moreover, the program will participate in the Columbia Undergraduate\r\nResearch Opportunities Program (UROP) and will partner with the NSF/Columbia NSEC\r\nNanoelectronics and MRSEC Nanomaterial programs with the support of one summer\r\nundergraduate research experience. A university-wide seminar series on Nanophotonics\r\nwill be developed for the Fall 2005 semester, targeted at first-year graduate students and\r\nundergraduate seniors, and a series of follow-on activities involving local K-12 students\r\nwill be developed.\r\n",
