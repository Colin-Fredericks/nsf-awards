 "awd_abstract_narration": "This major research instrumentation (MRI) proposal is for the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with e-beam lithography and EDX capabilities. This instrument will add state-of-the-art lithography, imaging and analysis capabilities to the Micro and Nano-Electronics Laboratory (MiNEL) at South Dakota State University. Related to intellectual merit, this equipment will support several ongoing and proposed interdisciplinary research projects in nano-sensor research and development, as well as other research projects from other departments on campus including chemistry, biology and dairy science. These projects include the development of a new sensing structures for monitoring air quality and analysis of DNA; improvement of the texture and functionality of process cheese; the development of a research program in nano structured photovoltaic devices; The Identification of Volcanic Ash Particles in Antarctica Ice Cores; and the assembly of virus-like particles by arterivirus-encoded proteins. Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity include using this instrument to enhance research and education infrastructure by adding instructional laboratory modules in several disciplines including engineering, chemistry, pharmacy, biology and dairy science. Native Americans, an underrepresented group, will benefit by a project to incorporate an SEM workshop into an existing outreach program focused on a major regional Native American high school. Economic development will be supported by joint projects with local industry. Presenting research results at local and state economic development meetings will help demonstrate the connection between research and societal benefit such as improved homeland security and health. Broader audiences such as K-12 students will be reached by a web site featuring images taken by the SEM. This instrumentation will also strengthen a recently established state interdisciplinary nanotechnology research center and a regional nanotechnology initiative.",
