 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in two separate major research areas. The general\r\nTheory of m-Quasi-invariants  and the Theory of Macdonald Polynomials.\r\nm-Quasi-invariants originally arose in the study of particle dynamics\r\nbut have emerged as a truly fascinating Algebraic Combinatorial\r\nsubject. For each Coxeter Group G there is an associated one parameter\r\nfamily of subspaces which interpolates between the ordinary polynomial \r\nring and the ring of G-invariants. The m-Quasi-Invariants of $G$ are \r\nsimply polynomials which, upon the action of the difference operator \r\ncorresponding to a reflecting hyperplane of G, they  produce a factor that \r\nis divisible by the equation of the reflecting hyperplane raised to the \r\npower 2m+1. This theory has been extensively developped, from the \r\nalgebraic point of view, in fundamental papers by Feigin-Veselov,  and \r\nFelder-Veselov, and  culminated in  certain conjectures  which were proved \r\nby Etingov-Ginsburg in 2002. Jointly with N. Wallach the PI discovered\r\nthat  several constructs associated to $m$-quasi-invariants,\r\nsuch as the associated Baker-Achieser function, encode some truly\r\nremarkable combinatorial properties of the corresponding Coxeter group.\r\nThe present project is to explore the theory from the combinatorial\r\npoint of view. The early successes obtained in the study of the simplest \r\ncases of the dihedral groups strongly suggest  that such a study should be \r\nconducive to significant discoveries in various areas of Mathematics \r\nranging from Combinatorics, Representation Theory and the Theory of \r\nspecial functions.\r\n\r\nSince its 1988 discovery, the Macdonald symmetric function basis has\r\nprogressively emerged as a central element in the  connection between\r\nRepresentation Theory and the Theory of Symmetric Functions.\r\nAfter more than a decade of research in  the Theory of Macdonald \r\npolynomials, the PI,  M. Haiman  and collaborators have been led to a \r\nvariety of conjectures in Representation Theory, Algebraic Geometry, \r\nCombinatorics and Symmetric Function Theory. Efforts in proving these \r\nconjectures have yielded fundamental facts and methods  in each of these \r\nareas. Recently J. Haglund discovered and in collaboration with Haiman and \r\nLoehr proved a remarkable purely combinatorial formula for a suitably \r\nmodified family of Macdonald polynomials. This discovery opens up a \r\nvariety of research problems involving some of the conjectures\r\nwhich up to quite recently appeared inaccesible. The Pi plans to dedidcate\r\na substantial portion of the projected research effort in this area in\r\ncollaboration with his PhD students.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe   proposed work, involves extensive computer explorations and\r\ntransfer of information across several mathematical boundaries, from\r\nRepresentation Theory to the Theory Special Functions and then to \r\nCombinatorics. These transfers provide an invaluable vehicle of discovery, \r\nsince results and mechanisms which may be quite obvious in one of these \r\nareas often translate in highly  non trivial and unexpected facts in one \r\nof the other areas. It should be mentioned that symbolic manipulation \r\nsoftware  such as MAPLE and MATHEMATICA combined with the present \r\ngeneration of fast processors have literally  transformed many  branches \r\nof mathematics into experimental sciences. Moreover computer data can be \r\nsuccessfully used not only in the discovery of results but also in the \r\nconstruction of proof. The two basic projects that are the focus of the \r\nplanned  research are also highly suitable for the training of young \r\nresearchers and the opportunity that it provides them to discover and \r\nexperience the manner in which research  can be carried out in the 21st \r\ncentury. Thus all the research problems created by this project\r\nare invariably brought  in the the class room to be shared with students\r\nand collaborators. \r\n\r\n",
