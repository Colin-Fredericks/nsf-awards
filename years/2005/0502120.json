 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe principle investigator is studying normal subgroups in the groups of \r\nrational points of algebraic groups and in their important subgroups \r\n(such as S-arithmetic subgroups). Questions of this nature are rooted in \r\nthe works of the founders of modern algebra such as Galois, Jordan and \r\nDixon, and have been an area of active research in various periods of the\r\n20th century (among important contributors one can mention Artin,\r\nDieudonne, Tits). While these works dealt mainly with the isotropic case \r\nwhere one can use unipotent elements, the PI's research focuses on the \r\nanisotropic case where no unipotent elements are available, hence essentially \r\nnew techniques are needed. Anisotropic groups are usually associated with\r\nnoncommutative division algebras. Recently, in a joint work of the PI with \r\nY.Segev and G.M.Seitz, new methods for analyzing normal subgroups of the \r\nmultiplicative group of a finite dimensional division algebra were developed, \r\nand the current proposal describes a variety of problems where these \r\nmethods or their suitable adaptations can (and will) be used. In particular, \r\nthe PI intends to make a substantial progress in the investigation of\r\nunitary groups over global as well as general fields. Another\r\ncentral topic of the project is the congruence subgroup problem\r\nfor S-arithmetic groups. The PI will continue the ongoing joint\r\nresearch with G.Prasad focused on proving centrality of the\r\ncongruence kernel in new cases, and also the work on the book\r\nproject devoted to the congruence subgroup problem. \r\n\r\nThe investigator's research is on the structure of classical and \r\nalgebraic groups and their arithmetic subgroups. Questions of this \r\nnature are rooted in the works of the founders of modern algebra \r\nsuch as Galois, Jordan and Dixon, and have been an area of active \r\nresearch in various periods of the 20th century. In particular, \r\nit should be noted that the congruence subgroup problem is \r\nconnected with other fundamental problems in number theory, currently \r\napplied in data transmission, data processing and communication systems. \r\n\r\n",
