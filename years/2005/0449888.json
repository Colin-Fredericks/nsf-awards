 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER award, experimental petrology techniques will be used to explore the dynamic chemical environments of magma chambers and volcanic conduits through studies of mass transport, reaction kinetics, and phase transformations.  Crystallization of hydrous silicate melt at magma reservoir and conduit conditions will (1) monitor the evolution of the sizes, quantities, and shapes of crystal populations during decompression from magma chamber conditions, (2) address the crucial and persistent problem of nucleation phenomena, and (3) determine the mechanisms and rates of crystal growth, particularly at small cooling-driven and devolatilization-driven supersaturation.  A key feature of these studies is the combination of experimental work with frontier analytical techniques in transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction.  The research is expected to rigorously test quantitative models of crystal size distribution evolution in closed systems and make a fundamental contribution toward deciphering magma transport history from the crystal textures of erupted rocks.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed studies center around an integrated plan for scientific research and human resource development.  A research experience program for K-12 teachers in volcano-petrology (RET/V-P) will provide an opportunity for teachers to participate in research activities with undergraduates and graduate students for six weeks during the summer.  The goal is to achieve a collaborative lab group wherein undergraduate students pursue senior thesis research projects, graduate students gain leadership experience mentoring the undergraduates and teachers, teachers deepen their confidence and mastery of science content, and the ensemble benefits from exposure to different learning perspectives.  \r\n\r\n",
