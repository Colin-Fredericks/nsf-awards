Yet, because women are\r\nseverely underrepresented on engineering faculties nationwide, many junior and mid-level\r\nengineering faculty women lack positive female role models and mentors and are too often\r\noverlooked or left out of crucial information loops. The successful senior women who are the\r\npotential mentors have little time or experience of successful mentoring. What is needed is a\r\nmentoring model, or methodology, that provides the necessary support for junior and mid-level\r\nwomen faculty, mines the experience of senior women faculty, and respects the time demands\r\nthat are a reality for all productive engineering faculty members. It is necessary to design ways in\r\nwhich successful mentors can have sustained contact with junior faculty while not overburdening\r\nthe mentors themselves.\r\nThe proposed Mentoring for Academic Career Development Study and Action Workshop,\r\nled by Penn State's Council of Senior Engineering Faculty Women will bring together senior\r\nwomen from universities and industry to identify effective practices in faculty mentoring as well as\r\nproblems in developing good mentoring programs. The goal will be to develop a realistic model\r\nand guidelines for mentoring junior and mid-level faculty women. Inclusion of successful industry\r\nwomen will allow the workshop to include industry practices and experiences in the deliberation.\r\nWorkshop objectives are to:\r\no Create a realistic model, based upon experience, practice and on-going research, of how\r\nmentoring can be provided in a comprehensive way to junior faculty women.\r\no Build on existing Penn State workshops for career development for faculty women\r\no Improve the mentoring experiences of all participants\r\no Identify a set of research questions for future investigation into mentoring for engineering\r\nfaculty women\r\no Publish and broadly disseminate workshop outcomes\r\nThe workshop will include pre-assessment surveys, pre-work and readings on current literature,\r\nand pre- and post-conference interactions-all designed to set up a productive dialogue. Postconference\r\nassessment will also be conducted.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe PAESMEM Mentoring Study and Action Workshop aims to broaden current understanding of\r\nthe challenges of mentoring in the Academy to benefit three important audiences - junior and\r\nmid-level faculty women, senior faculty women and administrators. The proposed workshop will\r\nresult in published guidelines in paper and electronic format. The workshop assessment will\r\nprovide basic information for researchers in academic mentoring. In the long term, this workshop\r\nwill create a new dialogue about effective mentoring that can be implemented in the high\r\npressure world of engineering faculties. It is anticipated that the findings will be relevant to other\r\nSTEM professionals.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe findings of the workshop have the potential to provide engineering faculty with the tools for\r\ndeveloping an effective mentoring model for engineering faculty women, a group\r\nunderrepresented in engineering.\r\n",
