The student-research groups are supervised by senior faculty and a small number of advanced undergraduate students, who in turn mentor students in honors sections of lower-level courses, including General Psychology, Biopsychology and Health, The Psychology of Music, Social Psychology, and Lifespan Development, to carry out experiments related to the content of these courses. These honors students are subsequently recruited to become members of this group. The acquisition of psychophysiological knowledge also reaches non-honors students taking these courses, since they are offered opportunities to participate in the experiments. The project is examining student learning in psychophysiology, as well as changes in knowledge and attitudes toward science in general. Evaluations are looking for improvements in laboratory reports, independent research projects, and senior thesis projects. Project results are expected to indicate substantial impact on lower-level students, who rarely learn to do psychophysiological investigations at most colleges and universities.\r\n",
