 "awd_abstract_narration": "The RAISE (Research Agenda in Science Education) conference is a forum to bring together the professional societies and organizations, representatives from K-12 science education, and invited experts whose task it is to outline, design and construct the scaffolding underlying the progress model for science education research.  This first-ever collaboration of professional societies, science educators, and organizations in science education and science is a comprehensive process by which to directly and systematically design and implement a robust progress model in science education, and ultimately a more systemic research agenda in science education.  Using the products of the progress model, policy makers, educators and researchers can be more responsive to important needs in science education, identify and use the best knowledge that has been accumulated, and, very importantly, develop and apply relevant new knowledge and understanding in all educational settings.  The ultimate goal of the conference is the development of the research agenda and associated activities that will inform policy and practice which in turn supports excellence in science education that is needed and sought by society.",
