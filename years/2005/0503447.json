 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0503447\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Thomas C. Hales\r\n\r\nIn 1972, Robin Milner created a proof-checking program LCF (for\r\n\"Logic for Computable Functions\").  The proof-checking program\r\nLCF and its descendants have been in continual development since\r\nthen.  These programs have finally reached the level of maturity\r\nthat they are capable of checking every logical inference of\r\nextremely complex mathematical proofs.\r\n\r\nWith a noticeable increase in the number of computer-assisted\r\nproofs in geometry there are dangers that computer code will not\r\nbe scrutinized with the same care as traditional proofs. One\r\nsolution is for mathematicians to significantly increase their\r\nuse of formal methods, particularly when proofs are computer\r\nassisted. The purpose of this proposal is to build the\r\nfoundations of discrete geometry within one such system\r\n(HOL-light, short for Higher Order Logic, is one of the\r\ndescendants of LCF).\r\n\r\nThe foundations of discrete geometry will be developed to the\r\nstage where several classical theorems will be formally\r\nestablished.  The theorems to be formalized include Rogers's\r\nbound in sphere packings, and the problem of 13 spheres (the\r\nNewton-Gregory problem).\r\n\r\nTraditional mathematical proofs are written in a way to make them\r\neasily understood by mathematicians. Routine logical steps are\r\nomitted. In a traditional proof, an enormous amount of context is\r\nassumed on the part of the reader. Proofs, especially in geometry\r\nand related areas, rely on intuitive arguments in situations\r\nwhere a trained mathematician would be capable of translating\r\nthose intuitive arguments into a more rigorous argument.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, in a formal proof, all the intermediate logical\r\nsteps are supplied. No appeal is made to intuition, even if the\r\ntranslation from intuition to logic is routine. Thus, a formal\r\nproof is less intuitive, and yet less susceptible to logical\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\nIn the past, formal proofs were not a practical possibility for\r\nmathematical arguments of any significant complexity.  However,\r\ntechnological advances over the past 30 years have made it\r\npossible for extremely complex mathematical proofs to be expanded\r\ninto a formal proof.  Computers are used to check that every\r\nlogical step has been supplied.\r\n\r\nThis project will establish foundational material from discrete\r\ngeometry (especially the topic of sphere packings) from a formal\r\nstandpoint.\r\n\r\nThis is a joint award of the programs in Geometric Analysis and Foundations.\r\n",
