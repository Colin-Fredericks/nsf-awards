 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT - 0508390\r\nClarkson University\r\n\r\nNanoparticle emissions from anthropogenic activities contribute to urban pollution, influence global climate through cloud system interactions, and are increasingly recognized to cause adverse human health effects. The molecular processes that result in the formation and evolution of ambient nanoparticles must be probed to provide an improved understanding of the role of these particles in the environment. Such studies are complicated by the inhomogeneity in spatial and temporal occurrences of particle formation and their rapid growth rates under typical ambient conditions. The techniques that are currently available for nanoparticle measurements are, however, largely inadequate for these studies.\r\n\r\nBased on the need for accurate characterization of nanoaerosol processes, the overall objective of this research project is to design and develop instrumentation that can enable in-situ, real-time, and high-resolution measurements of nanoparticle size distributions and provide compositional characterization. Ambient measurements with these instruments will be used in conjunction with laboratory experiments and modeling, to greatly advance our understanding of nanoscale processes in the environment.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\n\r\nThis proposal is motivated by an immediate requirement for real-time, high-resolution\r\nnanoparticle physical and chemical characterization. For such measurements, this proposal introduces two new and innovative nanoparticle characterization techniques.\r\n\r\n1) A unique classifier design that will enable high-resolution nanoparticle size distribution measurements with a large aerosol sampling rate; and 2) A new volatility response spectrometer for fast particle composition measurements at rates ~ an order of magnitude faster than currently possible.  \r\n\r\nField measurements with these instruments in combination with aerosol microphysical modeling will advance our understanding of environmental nanoparticles and their processes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the development of new instruments for atmospheric nanoparticle characteristics, this proposal will establish a new fast tandem differential mobility technique that can be extended for other measurements such as aerosol hygroscopicity. Epidemiology studies with data from the proposed instruments will be critical to determine any link between exposure to source-classified ambient nanoparticles and human health.\r\n\r\nAs a part of this project, a post-doctoral scholar and an undergraduate student researcher will be recruited. We hope to involve researchers from underrepresented groups by coordinating our recruitment through Clarkson's minority programs and with personal recruiting effort at Southern University, Baton Rouge, LA. The results and instrument designs will be presented in conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the fields of nanoparticle science and the environment will be greatly advanced with the improved knowledge of these particles and their processes. Their measurements at high resolution and accuracy will provide critical data for policy makers and scientists to study the complex nanoparticle-atmospheric interactions and assess nano-aerosol contributions to environmental changes or human health effects.\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses the research theme 'Nanoscale processes in the environment'.\r\n\r\n",
