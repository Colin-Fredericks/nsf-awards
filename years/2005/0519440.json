 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workshop Proposal:\r\nCrossings: Applying Research Findings to\r\nCross-Border Security Cooperation\r\nAbstract\r\nA team of academic researchers, public officials, and industry leaders in southeastern Michigan\r\nand southwestern Ontario propose to conduct a workshop on the cultural and institutional\r\nchallenges of cross-border security cooperation, and the application of research findings in\r\ndisaster management and organization research to issues of cooperation. We observe that a\r\ngrowing class of disasters are those that observe no political boundaries, including international\r\nfrontiers: certain of these, particularly those involving biohazardous events, can be compounded\r\nby the differences in cultural values and institutional assumptions (for example: accessibility of\r\nhealth care) on different sides of a border.\r\nTo create a research agenda for understanding these issues, and for applying the findings of basic\r\nresearch, we propose to bring together researchers and disaster management practitioners from\r\nboth Canada and the United States for an intensive, one-day discussion of the challenges posed by\r\nthese new problems in crisis management and the new opportunities for solving them afforded by\r\ncurrent academic research. In the scope of an intensive, well-staffed discussion between\r\nacademics and practitioners, we will be able to identify specific opportunities for applying the\r\nresearch results of multiple projects, and to identify critical areas for future research collaboration\r\nbetween Canada and the United States.\r\nThe workshop will be jointly sponsored by institutions in Canada and the United States.\r\nContributions to Theory and Method\r\nThis workshop will be an agenda-setting workshop, building a consensus among leading\r\nacademics in the United States and Canada, and practitioners at the state, provincial, and\r\nmunicipal levels, for applied research in crisis management. It will give particular focus to the\r\napplication of simulations and modeling, particularly agent-based models of cooperation, to\r\nissues of improving organizations' response to disasters.\r\nBroad Social Impact\r\nThis workshop will bring together the users of crisis management research findings with the\r\nproducers of that research. Numerous areas that we have already identified where research could\r\nimprove practice  in the design of drills and scenarios for improved learning, in the\r\nimplementation of communication technologies for improved coordination, and in the\r\nimprovement of organizational learning from crises  can be quickly implemented following this\r\nimportant meeting of researchers and practitioners.",
