 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prairie Analysis Seminar 2004\r\n\r\n     The PIs propose to continue with the Prairie Analysis Seminar, an \r\nongoing joint project of the University of Kansas and Kansas State \r\nUniversity. The seminar already had three previous successful editions \r\nin 2001, 2002, and 2003. The scientific activities taking place at the \r\nseminar are extremely stimulating and will certain generate further \r\nadvances in mathematical research in harmonic analysis and related \r\nareas. The next meeting will be held in November 2004 in Lawrence. The \r\nmain speaker is Stephen Waniger. He will lecture about discrete \r\nproblems in harmonic analysis. These are problems whose solution \r\nrequire the use of methods from analytic number theory and relate to \r\nthe study of operators acting on functions defined on the n-dimensional \r\nintegers or discrete subgroups of homogeneous groups. The other two \r\ninvited speakers will be Loukas Grafakos who will describe results \r\nabout maximal multipliers and Akos Magyar who will present some Ramsey \r\ntype results on lattice points. All the topics are of current interest \r\nin harmonic analysis and address important difficult problems in the \r\narea.\r\n\r\n     This annual conference is of extreme importance in the geographical \r\narea and it is quickly becoming a tradition with national and even \r\ninternational reputation. The seminar is structured so as to keep costs \r\nfor the host university and participants to a minimum, allowing a wide \r\nrange of mathematicians to attend. The main speakers chosen are at the \r\nforefront of their field, giving all in attendance the opportunity to \r\nlearn of their recent work. Equally important is that the conference \r\nwill allow the participating graduate and postdoctoral students to give \r\ncontributed talks, thus increasing their visibility and awareness of \r\ntheir work in the mathematical community. This is of crucial relevance \r\nin the education of graduate students as well as for those who have \r\nrecently obtained their Ph.D. The first three editions of the \r\nconference attracted a number of researchers from small universities \r\nthroughout the region, in addition to those attending from major \r\nresearch institutions. A number of participants are faculty from small \r\nuniversities and colleges in the geographical area. Many of these \r\nfaculty maintain research careers in spite of geographical isolation \r\nand welcome the rare opportunity to meet with other mathematicians. \r\nStrong connections with these small universities and colleges are \r\nmutually beneficial, as these schools produce many excellent \r\nundergraduate students that can be attracted to graduate education in \r\nmathematics and sciences.\r\n",
