Because front speeds are part of the large time\r\n(large scale) behavior of solutions to stochastic reaction-diffusion \r\nequations, one needs a large domain size, sufficient resolution of front \r\nstructures, and many realizations of random samples. The \r\nvariational principles are established\r\nby exploiting the analytical and probabilistic properties of solutions. \r\nSignificant dimensional reductions are achieved so that only\r\nassociated linear problems need to be solved to find principal\r\neigenvalues or Lyapunov exponents. Besides being a useful tool for \r\nanalysis of speed statistics, the variational principles also help to \r\ngenerate fast and efficient computational algorithms. The project will\r\nexplore this approach to study front speeds in various space/time random \r\nmedia, the speed asymptotic laws and the dependence on statistics of \r\nrandom media.\r\n\r\nThe project is motivated by flame fronts in the environment (forest or \r\nbuilding fires) and internal combustion engines of vehicles, where fluid \r\n(air or liquid) motion could alter the speed of burning process\r\nsignificantly.  The fluid motion often contains uncertainties and\r\ncan be best described as random media. Scientific understanding\r\nand efficient computing of front speeds can help to control the\r\nspread of flames, and minimize the waste gases from the combustion engines\r\nto benefit the environment. The methods being developed in the project \r\nwill contribute to both the understanding and computing\r\nof random fronts, a subject largely in its infancy.\r\n\r\n",
