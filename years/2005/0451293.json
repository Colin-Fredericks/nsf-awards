Cohorts of undergraduate students from the greater Los Angeles area participate in a ten-week summer research program at the host institution. The project includes mentorship by the experienced computer science faculty members, weekly presentations and seminars, and laboratory visits and other professional development opportunities.\r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The projects are in major current research areas that are of interest to the community at large and that have clear practical applications. The students participate in a full range of research activities from preparing research literature reviews to production and dissemination of research results.\r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups. The participating faculty members are committed to engaging women and under-represented minority students in their research. The partnership with nearby campuses in the California State University system should enable recruitment of a diverse set of students who might not have access to similar experiences on their own campuses.  Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learni\r\n",
