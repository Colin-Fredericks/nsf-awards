 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nJorgensen/Han\r\n\r\nThe GPOTS series has a strong record of serving as a source of research problems for graduate students, fresh Ph.D.'s and postdocs. And it has always attracted a large number of younger researchers. The organizers have been consistent in their effort of attracting members of underrepresented groups. Deguang Han and the analysis group in the math department at the University of Central Florida have established a close collaboration on wavelets in image and signal detection theory with the Lockheed Martin ATI division in Orlando, who have shown great interest in this conference and its theme of applying operator theory to wavelets. GPOTS-2005 could have impact on strengthening the collaborative activities between Florida universities and industries.  The senior people who have been attached to the GPOTS series have a clear record of Ph.D. production, and they all have had a number of Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups, including women. All are committed to the recruitment and retention of women and minority students in mathematics. Raul Curto recently won the Catalyst Award (2000) given by the University of Iowa Office of Affirmative Action in recognition of persons that enrich diversity within the UI community. The University of Iowa has now a  graduate population which includes 25% underrepresented minority students. With the help of an AGEP grant, the U. of Iowa has recently joined forces with sister institutions in Alabama, Florida, and Texas in an Alliance for the Production of African American Ph.D.'s in the mathematical sciences, and has helped to support REU-type activities for undergraduates. If supported, the two GPOTS conferences will invigorate these activities that are vital to involvement of underrepresented groups in the research community. Another way the universities in central region have involved their graduate students is through the series of bi-annual weekend research meetings (INFAS) involving three universities in Iowa and three in Nebraska.\r\n",
