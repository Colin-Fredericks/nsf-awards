 "awd_abstract_narration": "Novel transmission formats hold the potential for large increases in \r\nthe total system capacity of optical fiber transmission systems.  At \r\nhigh bit-rates, however, nonlinear and stochastic physical effects \r\ncontribute to limit the overall system performance.  The deterministic \r\nimpairments are mainly due to the combination of nonlinearity and \r\ndispersion.  The stochastic impairments occur due to amplifier noise \r\n(which induces amplitude, timing and phase fluctuations) as well as \r\npolarization-mode dispersion.  All of these effects produce impairments \r\nwhich lead to unacceptable rates of transmission errors.  However, \r\nthe large scale and complexity of these systems, the variety of effects \r\ninvolved, and the extremely low bit-error-ratios required of these \r\nsystems (which requires studying the occurrence of extremely rare \r\nevents) all contribute to make the modeling of optical fiber \r\ncommunications a challenging task.  Recent work has demonstrated that \r\ncareful mathematical and computational modeling can be very effective \r\nin describing the behavior of realistic optical fiber transmission \r\nsystems.  This research project aims at evaluating the potential of \r\nnew transmission formats and assessing how each of them is affected \r\nby the various transmission impairments.  The methods that will be \r\ndeveloped in this project are expected to make an impact on how \r\nthese systems are modeled and designed.  In addition, because \r\nnew ultra-short pulse lasers share many similarities with \r\ndispersion-managed optical transmission systems, the mathematical \r\ntechniques that will be developed as part of this research project \r\nwill help researchers understand the behavior of these lasers and \r\ntheir fundamental limits.\r\n\r\nThe development of high-capacity optical fiber communications has \r\nbeen a major technological advance that enabled the widespread use \r\nof the internet and the world-wide-web which revolutionized our \r\nday-to-day interactions.  The demand for further increase in the \r\ntotal transmission capacity remains unabated, however, fueled by \r\nemerging applications such as video-on-demand, video-conferencing \r\nand others requiring very large bandwidths.  A key feature of this \r\ncollaborative research project is the combined use of sophisticated \r\nmathematical and computational methods to model the behavior of \r\nrealistic lightwave systems, with the aim of developing the accurate \r\ntools which are needed to efficiently study the behavior of optical\r\nfiber transmission systems and to design the next generation of \r\nsystems.  As such, the outcome of this project will contribute to \r\nstrengthening the national infrastructure and maintaining U.S. \r\ncompetitiveness in an area which is of great national interest,\r\nthus benefiting not just researchers, but also the community at \r\nlarge.\r\n",
