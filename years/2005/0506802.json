 "awd_abstract_narration": "0506802\r\nJanes\r\n\r\nThis program will develop molecular heterostructures, including metal/molecule/semiconductor structures, develop novel electronic devices based on these structures, and characterize and model the properties of the devices. The use of both molecular and semiconductor states can provide interesting electronic characteristics, and raises possibilities for integrated sensing or memory elements. A well-integrated, interdisciplinary approach incorporating both experimental and modeling thrusts will be employed. This collaborative program includes participants from Purdue University, Northwestern University and Washington University at St. Louis. The program will develop an inventory of molecular layers on silicon with known chemical and electronic properties and investigate potential electronic device and sensing applications. The proposed approach is novel in terms of both the electronic properties and structural stability that can be achieved via covalent bonds to semiconductor surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed work includes the development of novel approaches for molecular-scale memory, switching and integrated sensing devices suitable for integration with existing silicon microelectronics technology. The participants will pursue several initiatives in formal and experiential informal education and professional development. The initiatives include  development and dissemination of course modules on nanotechnology, including modules suitable for high school and undergraduate students. Research and education partnerships will be developed with several universities which serve underrepresented groups and with corporate laboratories. The integrated educational and professional development initiatives will expose undergraduate and graduate students at the participating universities to new interdisciplinary approaches, provide opportunities for students and faculty from partner universities, and enrich the educational experiences for students at other universities through web-based initiatives.  \r\n",
