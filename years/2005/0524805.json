 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMillimeter-Wave Reconfigurable Antenna Arrays Using Monolithic MEMS Technology\r\nAbstract: Reconfigurable antenna arrays can dramatically enhance versatility of the RF front-ends in radars\r\nand transceiver systems, and present an interesting problem at millimeter-wave (MMW) frequencies. The\r\npurpose of this project is to utilize radio-frequency micro-electromechanical system (RF-MEMS) technology\r\nto form highly integrated, monolithic, reconfigurable antenna array architectures. Two different aspects of\r\nthe problem will be addressed under the proposed program: 1) design of reconfigurable radiating structures\r\nthat lend themselves to surface micro-machining fabrication techniques, and 2) fabrication of monolithic\r\nMEMS arrays and technological issues involving wafer-scale integration. A programmable aperture lens-array\r\nis proposed based on MEMS-enabled antenna-filter-antenna (AFA) elements. AFA's are three-layer planar\r\nstructures composed of transmit and receive antennas and bandpass filters. The complete array, including\r\nMEMS switches, is fabricated using a stack of two similar size quartz or glass wafers, and in a monolithic\r\nfashion. MEMS devices are sandwiched between the two bonded substrate wafers, resulting in a selfpackaged\r\nstructure.\r\nIntellectual Merit: High-performance, low-cost beam-steering is of prime importance for wide-spread\r\ndeployment of commercial MMW systems. MEMS technology enables novel integrated antenna array\r\nconcepts, which can respond to this need. The findings of this project are expected to advance the technical\r\nknowledge and understanding in the areas of antenna arrays and applied electromagnetics, as well as RFMEMS\r\ndesign and technology.\r\nBroader Impact: An unconventional research effort of this type promotes the research culture and\r\ntechnological competence among graduate students. Development of the necessary measurement capabilities\r\ncreates opportunities for the participation of undergraduate students through summer internships and senior\r\ndesign projects. ASU is the main vehicle of higher education for a large number of students from underrepresented\r\nethnic backgrounds through the state of Arizona. The proposed program furthers involvement\r\nof these students in advanced technology research, and is a practical step towards making engineering\r\neducation accessible to minorities.",
