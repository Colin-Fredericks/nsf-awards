This award supports theoretical research on quantum mechanical phenomena that arise from the interaction of nanoscale atomic structures with complex electronic states in materials. Nanostructures can reveal the wavelike nature of electrons in materials. This property has led to the discovery of new quantum effects, such as electron waves focusing to form images in nanostructures known as quantum corrals. The PI plans to study the combination of various nanostructures with bulk systems that exhibit superconductivity, magnetism, or other electronic states with an aim to discover new solid-state quantum mechanical effects. Possible examples include novel types of phase transitions at absolute zero temperature, superconducting nanostructures, frequency-dependent quantum imaging \"around the corner,\" and the controlled manipulation of quantum effects in molecular nanostructures. This research may contribute to our understanding of fundamental processes on the nanoscale and suggest new ways to experimentally probe complicated electronic states of matter. It may also contribute to the foundations of quantum information technology and spintronics.\r\n\r\n This award also supports integration of research with education and outreach. The PI intends to create interest and excitement about nanoscale physics inside and outside the academic setting. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in theoretical condensed matter physics. The results of the research will be communicated to a broader public audience through a collaboration with the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, where the PI is involved in the planning stages of a new exhibition and outreach program on \"Essential Science.\" The PI also intends to develop a new course outside the traditional area of physics on Ethics and Science that addresses public debates over scientific and ethical challenges of novel technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
