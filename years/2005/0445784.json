 "awd_abstract_narration": "The enormous amount of information processed in the nervous system is dependent on a complex network of trillions of neuronal connections. These neural connections are formed during embryonic development, when neurons extend axonal projections to their targets. Axonal migration occurs in a highly precise and stereotypic fashion. The objective of this project is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which motor axons migrate from the spinal cord to their distant muscle targets. \r\n\r\nThe laboratory of Dr. Granato uses the zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate the molecular and cellular aspects of axonal migration. This project focuses on one gene, called diwanka. In embryos in which the diwanka gene is defective, motor axons fail to extend to their muscle targets, suggesting that this gene plays a crucial role in guiding motor axons. Dr. Granato has recently identified the gene responsible for the diwanka phenotype. The gene is thought to play a role in collagen modification, but its precise role in guiding motor axons is currently unknown. In the experiments proposed here, Dr. Granato will investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which this gene helps in making precise neural connections. \r\n\r\nThis research program has broad impacts, in providing scientific research positions at different levels (premed and post-doctoral) to underrepresented minorities, and by enhancing scientific discoveries that may benefit society (i.e. regeneration of motoneuronal connection), as well as by presenting our research discoveries at interdisciplinary conferences.\r\n",
