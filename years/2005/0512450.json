 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project aims to develop high power UV LED based lamps for use in water/air/food sterilization/purification, bio-aerosol detection, and laboratory measurement systems. There are currently no portable, rugged, long-lifetime, non-toxic sources of ultraviolet radiation for integration into increasingly important UV water and air purification (particularly residential), bio-aerosol detection, and food sterilization systems. The predominant sources of UV radiation are low-pressure, medium-pressure and amalgam Hg based lamps. These high voltage lamps are large, non-directional, ozone-producing sources of radiation with radial emission from a tube source. This restricts the design flexibility of purification systems because of the geometrical constraints imposed by the lamp. More important than system design restrictions, however, is that these lamps produce dangerous ozone gas and each lamp contains approximately 60, 120 and 300 mg of Hg for low pressure, amalgam, and high pressure lamps, respectively. Deep UV LEDs with emission wavelengths below 365 nm require new UV compatible reflective coatings, UV resistant encapsulation with proper refractive index matching and new UV-transparent optics designs. The company proposes to develop manufacturing innovations in the packaging of high power UV LEDs to extend the range of applications for which UV LEDs are suitable.\r\n\r\nIf successful this solution will service the following markets: i. Sterilization/Purification for Water, Air, and Food Preparation/Storage. ii. UV Spectroscopy and Lab Equipment Manufacturing for Biological, and Optical Research and Development. iii. Biological weapons detection using UV fluorescence. \r\n",
