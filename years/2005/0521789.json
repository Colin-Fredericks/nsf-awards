 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to formulate a process model for the resin flow and compressive forces during the Compression Resin Transfer Molding (CRTM) process, develop the numerical formulation and implement it in our current simulation of Liquid Composite Molding to explore the process interactively and seamlessly provide technology transfer to industry. This research approach will conduct exploratory experiments to characterize flow-compression coupling in CRTM process. The governing equations will be formulated and analyzed to identify key material and process parameters and to develop methods for their experimental and analytic determination. Numerical formulation and efficient algorithms to solve these equations, to provide predictive modeling for flow patterns, times and forces required for successful filling and fiber deformation in the CRTM process, will be integrated in our simulation. Finally, the simulation will be used to design the mold and the process for prototype net shaped components. \r\n\r\n\r\nReplacement of metallic structures in automobiles with polymeric composites would provide substantial fuel savings due to the weight reduction. We will formulate predictive models of novel processes applicable for rapid manufacturing of net-shape composite structures in a cost effective way. This will accelerate the prototype development cycle for high volume production and addresses the global need to develop and use the science base for improving and inventing composite manufacturing processes. We will collaborate with Department of Energy and Automotive Composites Consortium (ACC) to address predictive modeling of components of interest to them. This research is co-funded by NSF and DOE's FreedomCAR program.",
