 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n  \r\nThis project is 1) developing discovery-based interactive audio-visual instructional modules designed to improve student learning of post-calculus probability and statistics concepts, and 2) evaluating the effectiveness of the learning approach and learning objects.   \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project includes developing educational materials that meet auditory, visual and kinesthetic learning styles of students.  By enhancing existing open-source materials, such as Internet applets, and by combining audio-visual instruction with interactive inquiry-based lessons, students are guided to discover and visualize important concepts in post-calculus probability and statistics.  The audio-visual component of the learning modules includes an animation of the learning object highlighting important and sometimes complex features and showing the results of selecting certain components. This component is designed to resemble the teacher demonstrating the material to the student. This approach for combining interactive learning objects with audio-visual instructions and guided discovery is new in post-calculus probability and statistics and can be a powerful method for future instruction given the audio-visual nature of today's students. \r\n \r\nBroader Impact:  The impact is wide reaching beyond just post-calculus probability and statistics. The method of combining visualizations with audio instructions and inquiry learning is a valuable experience for future mathematics teachers taking the probability and statistics classes.  Furthermore, promoting independent work is crucial as departments strive to help students become life-long learners.   \r\n",
