 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Design Automation Summer School (DASS)will offer graduate students the opportunity to participate in a three day intensive course on selected areas of research and development in design automation (DA).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe School offers graduate students pursuing doctoral studies in DA the opportunity to participate in a week-long intensive course focusing on the core as well as new and emerging areas in DA.The school is intended to broaden and complement a limited and often highly focused curriculum in DA that is currently offered at universities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe goals of the DASS dovetail well into the NSF 's primary objectives of investing in the education of the next generation of engineers and computer scientists and achieving broadened participation from underrepresented populations.The DASS is also intended to complement educational and professional development activities in the electronic design automation arena including scholarships, awards,and outreach projects such as the University Booth,the CADAthlon,and the Design Automation Conference (DAC)Ph.D.forum that have met with tremendous success over the past\r\ndecade.\r\n",
