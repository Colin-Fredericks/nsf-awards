 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses a strategy that is creative, well constructed, and moving into a\r\nnew area of research. The concept of identifying effective strategies to enhance\r\nlearning for two groups of traditionally underrepresented students - those who are deaf\r\nand those who have English as a second language - is an area of focus worthy of\r\nexploration.\r\nReviewers encourage the researchers to think about other disabilities as they create\r\nmaterials and would include a broader dissemination to include journals/conference\r\npresentations outside of the ESL and deaf service areas. More clarification would have\r\nbeen helpful regarding the \"best practices\" that are to be implemented. Some concern\r\nwas expressed about whether the level of staffing was adequate.\r\nOverall, the proposal builds on solid previous work by experienced researchers and is\r\nwell thought out. The project may provide a new model to partner programs serving two\r\ndifferent groups of underrepresented students!",
