Future implementations of multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) systems on portable devices will require new approaches to antenna system design if they are to deliver promised capacity increases.  In particular, integrating antennas into portable packages in a traditional  way  may  severely  constrain  MIMO  system  performance.   Since the antennas  will share  a  package,  induced  chassis  currents  may  result  in  higher  or  even  unacceptable  correlation between  propagation  channels  unless  the  system  is  designed  properly.    Moreover, once fixed antennas are integrated into a chassis,  their  coverage  area  and  coupling  to  other  antennas  is  also fixed.    The PIs work aims to develop and demonstrate integrated, low cost  reconfigurable antenna systems that are designed specifically for MIMO systems to avoid these pitfalls.   \r\n \r\nIntellectual  Merit  The PIs  propose  the  development  of  low  cost  integrated  reconfigurable  antenna technology  for  portable  MIMO  systems,  taking  a  holistic  approach  that  keeps  the  goal  -- independent, uncorrelated channels achieved with minimal expense -- in the foreground.  To position the project to have the greatest impact on future wireless systems, They will concentrate their efforts in \r\ntwo frequency bands: 5-6 GHz  ISM band and 60 GHz unlicensed band.  The work will consist of three inter-related thrusts, which are summarized here.   \r\n\r\nThrust  I:  Pattern  Reconfigurable  Antennas  for  MIMO  Systems:  Individual  pattern  reconfigurable antennas  equipped  with  RF  micro-electromechanical  system  (MEMS)  switches  will  be  developed and  designed  to  deliver  specific  radiation  patterns  in  integrated  scenarios  by  considering  likely  or intended MIMO wireless channels.  \r\n\r\nThrust  II:  RF  MEMS  Switches  Designed  for  and  Implemented  in  Reconfigurable  Antennas:  The switches developed here will use new, low cost organic liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrates and will  be  designed  specifically  for  these  antennas  to  maximize  their  reconfigurability  and  minimize \r\nundesired behavior from packaging and bias effects, etc.  Thrust  III:  Packaging,  Integration,  and  Evaluation  of  Portable  MIMO  Antenna  Systems: New techniques for packaging and integration of the RF MEMS-equipped antenna systems developed here specifically  for  MIMO  operation  will  provide  a  rich  experimental  framework  in  which new  ideas about the capabilities and limitations of practical MIMO systems can be measured and assessed.   \r\n \r\nImpact on Future High Capacity Wireless Communication Systems   \r\nThe  portable,  reconfigurable  wireless  MIMO  systems  on  low  cost  substrates  developed  here  will have  the  potential  to  revolutionize  how  information  is  exchanged,  how  parallel  computations  are conducted, and how data is processed or mined.  Additionally, the new reconfigurable antennas, RF MEMS  switches,  organic  substrate  processing,  and  packaging  and  integration  techniques  that  will emerge  from  the  project will  lead  to  advances  in  other  areas  of  wireless  communication,  sensor networks, and control.    \r\n \r\nBroader Impact \r\nTo expand the impact of this project, the investigators will take several coordinated steps to involve undergraduates and members of underrepresented groups in this research project.  Specifically, they will conduct undergraduate researcher summer exchanges, recruit and mentor women and minority students in their research groups, and guide undergraduates in related senior design projects that may \r\nlead to graduate studies.   \r\n\r\n",
