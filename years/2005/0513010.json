 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stimuli-responsive polymers (SRPs) exhibit a change in properties upon application of an external\r\nstimulus, such as a change in temperature, ionic strength, pH, electric, magnetic or mechanical fields or by\r\nchemical or biological analytes. Examples include liquid crystal polymers (LCPs), polymer solutions and\r\ngels, which undergo a change in phase morphology, electro- and magnetorheological fluids and electroactive\r\npolymers (EAPs). SRPs have potential applications as smart films in sensors, actuators, electro-optic\r\ndevices, etc., where the viscoelastic properties become important. A recent advance has been the\r\ndevelopment of metallosupramolecular polymers and networks based on metal:ligand binding. This project\r\nrequests support to investigate the molecular origin of the viscoelastic behavior of a novel family of\r\nmetallosupramolecular polymers, developed by S. J. Rowan and coworkers, which dissolve in various\r\norganic solvents, and which can be conveniently functionalized by incorporation of photonic or ionconducting\r\nmoieties. Knowledge of the molecular origin of the viscoelastic and thermodynamic behavior of\r\nthese materials is a key step towards rational molecular design, aimed at optimizing their properties, and to\r\nunderstanding how to process them into functional films. Such studies have not been systematically\r\npursued to date, and are the subject of this proposal.                                                                                               \r\nRowan et al. create supramolecular polymers and networks of controlled architectures from a bisligand\r\nfunctionalized monomer via addition of lanthanide and transition metal ions, which act, respectively,\r\nas crosslinkers and as chain extenders. Thus, the molecular weight and network architecture is determined\r\nby the ionic concentration and composition, and by the ion-binding strength and kinetics. These materials\r\ncombine the functionality of the metal ions with the processability and mechanical strength of a dynamic\r\npolymeric network. We propose studies to first investigate the properties of the supramolecular polymers\r\nformed by mixing the monomer with transition metal ions. Viscometric, light scattering and small-angle\r\nneutron scattering studies will be performed as a function of monomer:metal ion ratio, in different solvents,\r\nand as a function of temperature. The role of the coordinating power of the metal ion and solvent will be\r\nexplored. The results will be interpreted in terms of apparent chain molecular weight, in the context of\r\ntheories of equilibrium chains and/or kinetically frozen chains. These studies will then be extended to study\r\nthe effects of adding lanthanide as crosslinker. The onset of gelation and/or phase separation will be probed\r\nby scattering and rheological measurements. The structure and morphology of the gel phase will be\r\nexamined by light, x-ray and neutron scattering techniques and by optical and transmission electron\r\nmicroscopy. These studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of the relationship between\r\nprecursor structure and metal ion binding characteristics versus thermodynamic and viscoelastic behavior\r\nfor this important new class of stimuli-responsive materials.                                                                               \r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal derives from the fact that the results obtained will generate\r\nimportant new fundamental knowledge on an important new class of stimuli-responsive materials. In\r\naddition, they will serve to test existing theories of self-assembling polymers and networks, and more\r\nimportantly are expected to identify novel phenomena, which will provide new challenges for theorists.            \r\nMoreover, the project will have broader impact, in that it will serve to train two PhD graduate\r\nstudents, and is expected to provide research opportunities for undergraduate students in a vital area of\r\npolymer research. The results will be disseminated at national and international meetings and will be\r\npublished in leading scientific journals. In addition, it is expected that our findings will generate empirical\r\nknowledge, which will be an important step toward practical commercial application of these materials as\r\nfunctional, stimuli-responsive coatings and films.",
