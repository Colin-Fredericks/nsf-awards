 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop novel nanodevices by integrating intelligent polymer networks with magnetic nanoparticles.  The approach is based in innovative processes to be developed that will enable for the controlled polymerization of a wide variety of intelligent polymer networks directly on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles.  Intelligent polymer networks can be designed to mimic biological recognition processes or to recognize environmental conditions with tailored response yet also be more robust than biological systems.  The properties of these polymer networks can be tailored through their molecular design.  These nanoscale devices are expected to have inherent advantages in a wide variety of applications, such as in sensing, separations, and therapeutics.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research is unique in its combination of magnetic micro- and nanoparticles and intelligent polymer networks.  In general, the research will advance the fundamental understanding of intelligent polymer networks and magnetic particles, and it is expected to act as an initiation point for many further developments within the PI's laboratory in the area of intelligent materials and devices.  The proposed research will directly educate at least one Ph.D. student and is expected to initiate the education of many more students in this new area of research.  These students will be trained and educated in all aspects of the field intelligent materials and micro- and nanotechnologies.  The potential social and economic impacts are boundless.  For example, the novel nanoscale devices proposed in this project are anticipated to significantly enhance therapeutic and diagnostic methods in modern healthcare.  \r\n",
