 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to further the development of the technology to manufacture the first environmentally safe polymer coating that can successfully prevent aquatic biofouling on submerged man-made surfaces. The  Phase I study clearly showed that the unique honeycomb-like structure of these novel nano-structured dendritic polymer coatings not only delivers very efficient anti-fouling protection, but also prevents environmental pollution.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact (commercial significance) of the program is the immediate application of this technology to coatings for ship/boat hulls used in marine and fresh water environments.  These unique nano-structured antifouling coatings are also expected to have a very broad impact and large commercial effect in a variety of other water-based industries, ranging from shipping, fishing, tourism and defense, to production of energy in hydroelectric plants, protection of shorelines, production of potable water by desalination of sea water or from biofoulant-infested fresh-water sources.\r\n",
