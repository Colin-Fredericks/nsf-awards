 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will direct thermal-energy-to-electrical-energy conversion technology (DTEC) to produce Thermal Diodes to capture waste heat from electrolytic smelters and to convert it into additional electricity for use by the smelter, thereby improving energy efficiency. The research objective is to develop the most fundamental elements of ENECO's Thermal Diode technology on PbTe compounds, to characterize their performance and to assess the possibility that PbTe Thermal Diodes can be produced with an absolute efficiency in excess of 20% at temperatures of 400-600oC as predicted from numerical modeling. The research requires building p*/n/p and n*/p/n structures by thin film deposition on ptype and n-type single crystal substrates, production and characterization of the precursor materials, characterizing the DTEC performance of the structures, and optimizing structures for maximum conversion efficiency. \r\n\r\nCommercial products derived from this technology are expected to be inexpensive to manufacture using common semiconductor fabrication techniques. This new technology could open extensive new market opportunities in the recovery of waste heat, efficient conversion of primary heat, and solid state cooling in sectors where it is at present uneconomical.  From a societal perspective, widespread use of this new technology could help to reduce total environmental emissions and conserve energy. \r\n",
