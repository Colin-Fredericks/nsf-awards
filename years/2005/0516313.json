 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will employ sophisticated methods to conduct a synthetic analysis of genetic, species distribution, and remote-sensing data to examine the geological complexity of Madagascar. The proposed activities will yield novel insights that will connect geological and geographic forces to patterns of vertebrate distribution and abundance.  Madagascar has been designated as one of the most critical geographic priorities for conservation action as it retains less than 10% of the natural habitats that existed before human colonization.  The proposed work will serve as a model for integrating diverse scientific disciplines and methods for understanding and conserving biodiverse and threatened habitats.\r\n\tThe project has a significant focus on capacity-building through the education and training of both American and Malagasy students.  Research opportunities for American students will be enhanced by the formation of Malagasy/American partnerships wherein Malagasy students will serve as mentor/guides while in Madagascar, with the converse being true in the U.S.  The proposed activities will build natural history collections both in the U.S., namely at the Field Museum of Natural History, and in Madagascar.  Finally, the project will produce a number of online electronic products for data query and analysis that will be internationally available. This award is co-fund by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
