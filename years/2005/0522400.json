 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville is studying participants in a robotics educational program to gain an understanding of how such programs may have a short-term effect on girls' perception of their achievement in STEM areas, and whether this translates into long-term choices in study and career options. Specifically, the project addresses the utility of the psychological components of the expectancy-value model for understanding the role of gender differences in STEM-related choices. It also examines the role the gender make-up of the robotics team and the motivation for participating in the program play in girls' STEM perceptions, expectations, and choices.\r\n\r\nRobotics provides a comprehensive view of an integrated system. It illustrates the connection between mechanical, electrical, and computing components. Because of its multidisciplinary nature, the use of robotics in the classroom has become a useful tool for the practical, hands-on application of concepts across various STEM topics. There is clear evidence that shows robotics projects are engaging educational tools and have been pedagogically successful in teaching STEM concepts. However, it is less clear whether such projects translate into long-term interests in STEM areas of study and, ultimately, career choices.\r\n\r\nThe project involves participants in the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics' Botball Program. The Botball Program is a team-based activity that engages thousands of middle school and high school students in regional and national robotics competitions and exhibitions. The project employs a mixed methodology research approach to gain a rich understanding of the factors involved in STEM perceptions and choices. To examine the expectancy-value model, quantitative analyses including ANCOVA and structural equation modeling will be employed. The quantitative study is complemented with a qualitative approach. The qualitative study, which includes observations, interviews, and artifact analysis, will enable a deeper understanding of the effect of participation in robotics projects and permit the examination of role cultural issues may play in STEM choices.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit  \r\nThe most significant intellectual merit is due to the use of: 1) the expectancy value model; 2) a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods; 3) both explicit and implicit attitudes measures; and 4) a unique qualitative methodology in which participants in the study will assist us in data collection. By applying the expectancy-value theory, the study provides the most comprehensive view of the factors involved in a girl's STEM experience and how this experience affects self-perception. The combined interpretation of the comprehensive qualitative/qualitative study will provide a clearer understanding of how programs that apply technology, like robotics, affect girls' perceptions of their abilities, how specific factors engendered in the expectancy-value model impact these perceptions, and how these effects influence choices to enter STEM careers. The two year study will help determine if impacts are short term or longer lasting. And if they are longer lasting what are factors that sustain or even strengthen girls' motivations for achieving goals in STEM areas.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe most significant broader impact is that the study dovetails directly with work in curriculum development at KIPR and SIUE. KIPR has a continuing NASA Grant and a working relationship with NASA Educators for the development of STEM curriculum and SIUE has an ongoing educational effort for the development of robotics curriculum for K-12 outreach and undergraduate courses.  Results will allow programs such as Botball, FIRST Robot League, Tufts University Next Steps Program, CMU's Expanding Your Horizon Program, and many others to target factors in their programs that actually impact a girl's STEM-related choices.   Dissemination will be aimed at educators, educational researchers, and developmental psychologists.\r\n",
