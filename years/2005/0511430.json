 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is the development and analysis of least-squares\r\nmethods for partial differential equations (PDEs) arising from applications\r\nin fluid and solid mechanics.  These systems are naturally nonlinear and\r\nnumerical simulation is typically difficult and expensive.  The\r\nleast-squares finite element method is a powerful tool for many PDE-based\r\napplications in science and engineering.  One of the main characteristics\r\nof a least-squares formulation is that it transforms a given set of\r\nequations into a loosely coupled system of scalar equations that can be\r\ntreated easily by multilevel finite element methods.  The finite element\r\nspaces for the individual unknowns may be chosen independently, based on\r\nsimplicity and availability or from the physics of the underlying problem.\r\nThe linear systems of equations resulting from well-posed least-squares\r\ndiscretizations are always self-adjoint and positive definite, and\r\nvariational multigrid methods generally provide a robust, scalable solver.\r\nIn addition, the associated functional itself provides a natural sharp\r\nlocal error estimator, which can be used for effective adaptive mesh\r\nrefinement.  Coupling nested iteration and Newton linearization with a\r\nleast-squares discretization and multigrid iterative solver constitutes a\r\nrobust, comprehensive solution strategy for difficult nonlinear problems.\r\n\r\nThis project represents a focused study of least-squares methods for\r\nseveral linear and nonlinear elasticity and fluid flow problems, extending\r\nto applications in viscoelasticity.  Some research in these areas has been\r\nsuccessful and preliminary results are encouraging, but much remains to be\r\ndone.  This project includes both general solution methodologies for\r\nproblems with strong nonlinearities and specific least-squares formulations\r\nfor models that have not been analyzed in a least-squares framework.  The\r\napplications considered in this project include complex and specialized\r\nsystems important in areas including engineering, physics, aerodynamics,\r\natmospheric sciences, geology, and biomechanics.  One target application,\r\nfor example, is a specific incompressible, non-Newtonain flow which arises\r\nin the modeling of blood flow. Here, a viscoelastic model that takes into\r\naccount the elastic nature of the suspended red blood cells is to be\r\nconsidered.  In these and many other areas of interest, computer simulation\r\nof complex phenomena are currently limited by efficiency of numerical\r\nmethods.  The basic techniques developed here will enhance the broader area\r\nof scientific computation by adding to the collective understanding of how\r\nto analyze and solve complex problems.\r\n",
