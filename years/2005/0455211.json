The intellectual merit lies in the fact that these participants will be exposed to the most recent developments and will participate in fruitful scientific exchanges in an area of mathematics and its applications in which modern mathematical analysis comes to grips with problems of scientific importance, including problems in physics, information science, materials science, and the biological sciences. This\r\nexposure inevitably leads to new developments and discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe conference will be held during the week of March 29 to April 2, 2005, on the campus of UAB. Some of the truly outstanding leaders in the area of differential equations and mathematical physics will speak to participants. Since 1981 this large international conference has been very successful in bringing together senior and young scholars from around the world. The broader impacts of the proposed activity include the advancement of knowledge through communication of recent results to a wide audience that includes graduate students, recent PhD recipients, as well as members of groups that are not well represented in the mathematical sciences. An important contribution of the conference is the special opportunities afforded to younger participants to present their work often for the first time to the international leaders in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
