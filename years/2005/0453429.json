 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site in neuroscience at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) will provide motivated undergraduates with the opportunity to experience exciting independent research under the guidance of a faculty mentor. The REU site is designed to increase student interest in graduate education leading to careers in research and to enhance student's written and oral communication skills.  Under the supervision of a faculty mentor, students have the opportunity to design their own projects and learn basic skills necessary to conduct a research project.  Students receive training in the research methods applicable to their research plan, analyze their data, attend lab meetings and journal clubs, and create written and oral presentations of their results at a research forum at the end of the summer program and at weekly journal clubs.  Projects in developmental, molecular, cellular, and integrative/behavioral/cognitive neuroscience are available. Students are paired with faculty mentors and participate in weekly faculty-student research discussions and lunches, and cultural and social events.  Twelve students will be selected for the ten-week research experience each summer.  Under-represented minority students and undergraduates from institutions at which research opportunities are limited are encouraged to apply.  Application and other information on the REU program are available at: http://www.neurobiology.uab.edu/REU.htm or by contacting Ms. Cindy Urthaler, 205-934-1550 (voice); Email: urthaler@nrc.uab.edu\r\n\r\n",
