 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator works on the topology of complex algebraic maps, \r\nwith applications to algebraic cycles. The study of the relations between the topology of the domain and target of a map is \r\ninteresting and has broad applications in the fields of geometry and topology. This project aims at\r\n1) Furthering the study and the understanding of the Hodge\r\nand Chow-theoretic properties of complex algebraic maps and at\r\n2) Explicitly studying these properties in significant cases.\r\n\r\nThe term ``algebraic maps\" above is a technical term for polynomial equations. Algebraic geometry is the discipline devoted to their study. It is an ancient subject rooted in the early achievements of humanity, like the wheel, the Egyptians' elliptical flowers arrangements and Archimedes' burning parabolic mirrors. Circles, ellipses and parabolas arise from the polynomial equations we study in high school. \r\nThey are both beautiful and ubiquitous in nature as they describe many natural phenomena, from the motion of planets to the shape of leaves and flowers, to the behavior of microscopic particles. The funded project is strongly inclined towards pure research and proposes to study the deeper properties of the solutions to more complicated \r\nalgebraic equations. As it has always been the case, pure and applied mathematics  will influence each other and new abstract ideas will fuel the progress of applications.\r\n",
