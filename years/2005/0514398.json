 "awd_abstract_narration": "ADLER - 0211480\r\nIn natural systems, organisms face simultaneous direct and indirect interactions with mutualists and\r\nantagonists, yet our understanding of the relative importance of these competing pressures in\r\nshaping the evolution of phenotypic traits is still rudimentary. For example, flowering plants may\r\nface the dilemma of attracting pollinators while discouraging floral enemies, such as nectar\r\nrobbers. Because robbers are competing with pollinators for the same resource (e.g., nectar), it may\r\nbe particularly difficult for plants to evolve defensive mechanisms that are effective against\r\nantagonists without also deterring mutualists. The goal of the proposed research is to determine\r\nhow a ubiquitous but poorly understood floral trait, toxic nectar, influences interactions with both\r\nnectar robbers and pollinators, and how these simultaneous interactions shape selection on this\r\nphenotypic trait.\r\nToxic nectar, or nectar that contains secondary compounds, is a widespread trait that may confer\r\nresistance to floral robbers, but at a potential cost to pollinator attraction. Currently, the costs and\r\nbenefits of toxic nectar are unknown. In addition to resistance traits, plants may cope with\r\nantagonists via tolerance. The concepts of resistance and tolerance have traditionally been used in\r\nreference to herbivores; however, nectar robbers, like herbivores, have profound effects on plant\r\nfitness and plants are likely to use resistance and tolerance as defensive mechanisms against\r\nrobbers. The proposed research will extend resistance and tolerance concepts to a wider range of\r\nplant-animal interactions through an examination of the role of nectar traits, such as nectar toxicity\r\nand production, as mechanisms of resistance and tolerance to nectar robbing.\r\nThe aim of this work is to understand the ecological role of toxic nectar within the context of\r\ninteractions between mutualists (pollinators) and antagonists (nectar robbers), and to determine the\r\nextent to which resistance and tolerance mediate the impact of nectar robbers on plant genotypes.\r\nThe research proposed will experimentally manipulate nectar toxicity in Gelsemium sempervirens,\r\na perennial vine with documented alkaloids in its nectar, to determine the impact of toxic nectar on\r\nthe community of insect pollinators and robbers as well as on male and female plant reproduction\r\nand offspring success. In addition, this study will manipulate nectar robbing and pollination in\r\ngenotypes of G. sempervirens with known variability in nectar toxicity to determine the direct and\r\nindirect effects of nectar robbing on plant fitness, genetic variation in resistance and tolerance to\r\nnectar robbing, and costs of toxic nectar in the absence of nectar robbing. The research combines\r\nmanipulative field experiments with observations to address four main questions: 1) Is there\r\ngenetic variation in nectar toxicity? 2) Does toxic nectar benefit plants by increasing resistance to\r\nnectar robbing without reducing pollinator attraction? 3) Does nectar robbing reduce plant fitness\r\ndirectly or indirectly, and do plant genotypes vary in their resistance or tolerance of nectar robbing?\r\nand 4) Is there a cost of toxic nectar in the absence of robbing?\r\nThe work proposed here is novel in that it integrates the costs and benefits of resistance associated\r\nwith a ubiquitous but poorly understood floral trait, toxic nectar, in the context of joint forces of\r\nselection exerted by both mutualistic and antagonistic floral visitors. This work extends an existing\r\nconceptual framework and provides empirical insight into the diversity of roles a single floral trait\r\ncan serve, from attraction to defense. Consideration of the broader context in which organisms\r\nevolve is fundamental to our understanding of how multiple-species interactions shape genetic and\r\nbiological diversity at ecological, microevolutionary, and macroevolutionary scales.\r\n",
