 "awd_abstract_narration": "The crystallization of synthetic polymers, in spite of its significant industrial importance,\r\ncontinues to represent a primary challenge of polymer science and condensed matter physics.\r\nAlthough kinetic theories on polymer crystallization enjoyed widespread acceptance, the\r\nunderlying dynamics of polymer crystallization is still unknown. Consequently, man's ability to\r\ncontrol polymer structure via crystallization is limited, particularly during its early stages and at\r\nthe nanoscale.                                                                                                                                                          \r\nIn this SGER proposal, we propose to initiate research on the Terahertz (THz) dynamics\r\nof polymer crystallization. THz dynamics originates from the collective modes of inter- and\r\nintra-chain motions and is expected to be active during both stages of nucleation and growth. The\r\nspectral fingerprints of the collective modes lie in the far-IR region, from a few wavenumbers to\r\nsome 300 cm-1. Energetically, they reside in the THz regime (1 THz = 1012 Hz).                                          \r\nIt is the objective of this proposal to establish the role of THz dynamics in structural\r\nformation during crystallization. Efforts will be focused on the stage of primary nucleation. The\r\nspecific aim is to establish concrete microscopy evidence that THz energy input is capable of\r\ncontrolling nucleation behavior. Experimentally, brilliant monochromatic THz free-electron\r\nlaser (FEL), whose energy is characteristic of nucleation activation, will be used. In-situ\r\nmicroscopy is employed to follow changes in nucleation behavior upon FEL illumination on\r\nmetastable polymer melts.                                                                                                                                                             \r\nThe goal is not only to establish the role of THz dynamics in polymer crystallization, but\r\nalso to introduce the concept of THz dynamics to study structural phase transformations in\r\npolymer systems. The experimental strategy adopted in this proposal also opens the door for the\r\ndevelopment of a groundbreaking nanotechnology for molecular engineering.\r\n",
