 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jason Weckstein and John Bates of the Field Museum and Alex \r\nAleixo of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi will use DNA \r\nsequencing technology to reconstruct the history of \r\nassociations between two codistributed toucan host groups \r\nand two of their parasitic chewing louse genera.  Their main \r\nobjective is to determine how different parasite groups, \r\nwhich differ in features of their biology and ecology, \r\nrespond to identical geographical and habitat perturbations \r\n(diversification and speciation of the hosts).    Studies of \r\nhosts and permanent ectoparasites provide a unique \r\nopportunity to reconstruct the history and the environmental \r\ncontext in which the processes of diversification and \r\nspeciation occur.  Permanent ectoparasites are hypothesized \r\nto share a common evolutionary history with their hosts, \r\ntherefore, one can reconstruct this history of interactions \r\nbetween hosts and parasites by superimposing the parasite's \r\nevolutionary history onto the host's evolutionary history.  \r\nThe replicate parasite lineages included in this study live \r\ntheir entire life cycles on the same avian hosts, yet are \r\nmembers of different louse suborders that differ in a \r\nvariety of biological and ecological features.  By comparing \r\nthese replicate parasite groups, this study will assess how \r\nunique features of each parasite's biology correlate with \r\ndiversification in the hosts.  Insights gained in this \r\nsimple system will shed light on patterns of speciation and \r\ndiversification in the more complex systems of free-living \r\norganisms.\r\n\tThis project also has a number of important societal \r\nbenefits.  First, this work will document basic patterns of \r\nbiological diversity in Amazonia, one the earth's richest \r\necosystems.  It also will involve international \r\ncollaboration between US and Brazilian researchers from the \r\nField Museum of Natural History and the Museu Paraense \r\nEmilio Goeldi.  Researchers and students will travel between \r\nthese two institutions to teach, learn, work, and \r\ncollaborate with each other to further our understanding of \r\nspeciation and diversification in the tropics.  This \r\ninternational collaboration will provide an unprecedented \r\nopportunity to study patterns of diversification and \r\nspeciation in the Amazon.  Second, studies of lice and their \r\nvertebrate hosts have played a prominent role in \r\nunderstanding the historical associations of hosts and their \r\nparasites.  Theories and analytical methods developed using \r\nthese model organisms have been applied to other systems \r\nsuch as vertebrates and their viruses, which are critical to \r\nhuman health issues.  This project will further the \r\nbiological understanding of these kinds of systems and will \r\nhelp us to understand the ecological characteristics that \r\nprovide opportunities for disease causing parasites to jump \r\nbetween hosts.\r\n\r\n",
