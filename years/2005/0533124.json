 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nIn this project an automated microscope workstation will be specifically designed for\r\nstudents with mobility and visual impairments to independently operate all features of light\r\nmicroscopy. In a previous project an accessible microscopy workstation, called AccessScope,\r\nwas developed to allow persons with mobility impairments to control a research light microscope\r\nwithout assistance through a personal computer, including loading slides. The PC became the\r\nuser interface for controlling the microscope hardware and for displaying slide images in a live\r\npreview window via a video camera. Thus, the PC replaced the need to physically operate the\r\nmicroscopy workstation and view through microscope eyepieces. The AccessScope project\r\ndemonstrated that independent control of microscopy was possible and useful for students with\r\ndisabilities to actively participate in this laboratory technique.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nTechnical advancements can provide AccessScope with even greater functionality and\r\nthe capability to be independently operated by students with visual impairments. A standalone\r\nsoftware application to control AccessScope and view slides will be developed in this proposed\r\nproject. This new software application will provide features that other commercial applications,\r\nincluding the one used in the previous AccessScope project, do not offer. Better stage movement,\r\ntheta rotation of slide images in real-time, and remote control of the AccessScope workstation\r\nthrough the internet will be available. Disabled students using a PC will be able to remotely\r\ncontrol a publicly shared research-level light microscope from virtually anywhere. The graphical\r\nuser interface of the AccessScope application will be designed to accommodate users with low\r\nvision and upper limb motor impairments. Design features of the user interface will include user\r\ndefinable shortcut keys, intuitive graphical buttons and analog controls, color filtering, and the\r\nability to alter the user interface's color, size, and contrast. The AccessScope application will be\r\ncompliant with different assistive technology input devices for users with mobility impairments\r\nand screen enlargers, magnifiers, and readers for users with visual impairments. The\r\nAccessScope application will be simple enough in design to be used by secondary and\r\npostsecondary students with disabilities yet powerful enough to be valuable for scientists.\r\nBroad Impact\r\nThe goal of the AccessScope project is to allow students with mobility impairments or\r\nlow vision to independently use a light microscope and be able to actively participate in the same\r\nlearning experiences as their able-bodied peers. Microscopy is an essential tool in many STEM\r\nfields. Not only does microscopy allow disabled students to participate in laboratory courses, but\r\nthe hands-on experience provides a greater understanding of the character of tissue specimens,\r\nhow histology slides are created, and the physics of microscope optics including its limitations.\r\nActivity-based learning is critical for pursuing an undergraduate science education, graduate\r\nlevel research, and many careers in science and engineering.\r\nThe AccessScope software program will allow students with disabilities to have complete\r\ncontrol of commercially available microscope equipment. This program will be freely distributed\r\nto students and teachers in secondary and postsecondary institutions, thus decreasing the expense\r\nof developing an AccessScope workstation. In addition, a demonstration version of the\r\napplication will also be available to allow users to evaluate AccessScope without commitment.",
