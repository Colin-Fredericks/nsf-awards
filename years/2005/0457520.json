 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of the project is to explore the nature of changing tooling-workpiece interface and tooling wear due to material advancing, and to develop an Interface Concurrent Modeling, Simulation and Optimization System (Interface-CMSOS) in the environment of stamping process and workpiece quality control, assisted by experimental measurements and validation. The research will also aim at industrial goals to establish die material/surface design guidelines for successful implementations of advanced high strength steels in new vehicle programs. Both experimental and numerical approaches will be used to pursue the objective. Four tasks are planned: (1) Understanding the tooling-workpiece interface and tooling wear based on multi-scale modeling, (2) model validation and correlation with stamping test results, (3) Integration of models to form an Interface-C-MSOS framework, and (4) Development of an optimization methodology and efficient algorithms considering variations and uncertainties. The education objective of the project is to integrate research with education and to connect teaching with industrial practice, which will be accomplished through collaborations among PIs and participating engineers.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that the research results will provide critical understanding of tooling-workpiece interfaces, die wear and the trend of interface changing due to material upgrading, as well as approaches for advancing such understanding hand-in-hand with new material development. This Interface-CMSOS is the first integrated attempt to tackle systematically the problems raised in material updating. Equally important, the idea of Interface-CMSOS tends to encourage the application of new materials, making material research and development more profitable.",
