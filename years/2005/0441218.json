 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe proposed activities of this award focus on exploring MBE synthesis of high quality, promising Si/Ge-based magnetic semiconductor epitaxial films and heterostrucutres. It is aimed at meeting the future challenge to electronic materials by enhancing our ability to control and tailor both electronic and magnetic properties of semiconductors to be used for preparing and processing the full electronic states in a single electronic device, thus potentially revolutionizing the electronic and information technology. Complementary doping using two or more transition metal elements will be employed as the strategy to stabilize epitaxial growth at high doping levels in order to achieve high temperature ferromagnetism and to tailor electronic structures. Combinatorial approach will be employed for the systematic study. The proposal is a collaborative and interdisciplinary effort based on significant recent advances and expertise in MBE synthesis of magnetic semiconductors made possible by the continued NSF support. It involves active collaborations with research groups around the world. The work will train students at all levels in areas of critical importance to the future scientific and technological well-being of our country, particularly synthesis of novel materials.\r\n%%%\r\nThe key future challenge to electronics technology is our ability to control and tailor both electronic and magnetic properties of semiconductors on the silicon-based platform and beyond.  If both electronic and magnetic states can be prepared, processed, and integrated in a single device or chip, it would revolutionize the electronic and information technology. The proposed research is aimed at meeting the challenge by systematically exploring novel synthesis and properties of silicon-based magnetic materials. Complementary doping with several dopants will be used to stabilize and tailor the novel materials in order to achieve the desired electronic and magnetic properties. Combinatorial approach will make it possible for examining a large number of materials candidates. The proposal is a collaborative and interdisciplinary effort leveraged against significant advances and expertise made possible by the previous NSF support. It will involve active collaborations with research groups around the world. Education, collaboration and outreach are the key features of the proposed work. The work will train students at all levels in areas of critical importance to the future scientific and technological well-being of our country.\r\n",
