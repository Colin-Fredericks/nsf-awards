Newly developed\r\nexperimental techniques may lead to a substantial revision of our current\r\nunderstanding of this state. These techniques allow one to observe local\r\nmagnetic fields of the intermediate state in real time and to measure them\r\nwith extreemly high sensitivity. This research has connections to important\r\nquestions of pattern formation in complex mathematical, geophysical,\r\nchemical and biological systems and even to the formation of galaxies. The\r\nproject carries significant educational impact. Students of all levels will\r\nwork on the project, each performing specific set of measurements. Some\r\nexperiments will be part of the advanced solid-state physics laboratory. The\r\nproject involves active domestic and international collaborations with the\r\nleading experts in the field, including those who initiated related studies\r\ndecades ago. A workshop on pattern formation in type-I superconductors is\r\nplanned at the end of the research term.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\n\r\nThis individual investigator award will support comprehensive studies of the\r\nintermediate state in type-I superconductors. Unique experimental\r\ntechniques, such as magneto-optical visualization of magnetic fields and\r\npico-emu sensitive tunnel-diode susceptometry, combined with conventional\r\nmethods, will be employed to understand the intermediate state in a broader\r\ncontext of pattern formation in highly nonlinear systems. The study of\r\ntopological hysteresis and complex shape effects may lead to the\r\nidentification of unusual thermodynamically equilibrium states and,\r\nultimately, to substantial revisions of our current understanding of type-I\r\nsuperconductivity. The ability to continuously tune the system across a\r\nbroad range of topologies using both temperature and magnetic field makes\r\ntype-I superconductivity an ideal arena in which to study general questions\r\nof pattern formation in nonlinear systems. Connections to biological,\r\nchemical and astrophysical systems will be studied as part of this project.\r\nThe project carries significant educational impact.
