It includes the formation of Mathematical Science Success Units (MSSUs) which consists of two scholars, a mentor, a graduate student and an advisor.  It also includes an academic year project for each MSSU with participation in a web accessible international math competition, conference attendance and presentation of project work; an Advanced Mathematics Discover Series by way of video-teleconferencing and a weekend mini-course; and Summer Research Experiences to expand interest in the mathematical and related sciences, and introduce undergraduates to graduate level concepts. \r\n\r\nThe Mathematical Sciences Connections to Produce PhDs program facilitates success through the critical transition point from undergraduate to graduate studies.  The program also provides exposure to various fields of mathematical interest and application, providing alternatives that increase the number of undergraduates that pursue a related science, engineering or interdisciplinary field, rather than losing students to non-STEM pursuits.  The program design takes advantage of productive practices at both institutions, lessons learned from previous undergraduate-to-graduate transition point projects, and innovative approaches.\r\n\r\n",
