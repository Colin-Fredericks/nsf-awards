The power of indentation as a scientific tool lies primarily in its experimental simplicity, due to the minimal specimen preparation involved. However, interpretation of results is non-trivial and key to successful analysis are sufficient analytical modeling and supplementary observation.    In this plan, indentation will be used to develop constitutive behavior of three 'testbed' systems: i) rapidly quenched small-volume structures on substrates, ii) carbon nanotube arrays on substrates, and iii) lung parenchyma.  Academic, industrial and/or clinical collaborators have been identified to add perspective and disseminate information.  Efforts are planned to develop new interdisciplinary research courses for university, and practical and pre-collegiate training programs for K-12 students.\r\n\r\n",
