This workshop is the fourth in a series of workshops that are being held biannually between the United States and Japan under a mutual agreement between the National Science Foundation and MEXT.  \r\nThe overall objective of this workshop is to bring a sharp focus on the scientific and technological possibilities for Nanophotonics. The workshop addresses the interdisciplinary needs of Nanophotonics and new optical integration technologies through a dialog of the leading practitioners of related research. In this workshop, the scientists from the US and Japan will explore areas of significant emphasis of research in nanophotonics and will provide an opportunity for discussion of the advances in science, engineering and technology at the nanoscale and of the related disciplinary aspects related to the fundamental aspects with practical applications.  The program includes 11 speakers from United States and 13 speakers from the Japan.\r\nThe workshop will be held in Yokohama.  The presentations and discussions will be on October 25-27, 2004 (see attached schedule).  The proceedings of the workshop and the list of recommendations will be available to all the participants of the workshop, NSF, and MEXT.  The workshop will start with a special lecture on the subject of \"Nanophotonics: Beyond the limit of optical technology\".\r\n\r\nThis is a very timely workshop and it will bring experts in nanophotonics for discussion of their current research and future requirement and will be a forum for discussion of mutual areas of interest between the US and Japan with special focus on applications in optical systems.  This type of activity is an essential part of the process of bringing the benefits of nanotechnology to society.  \r\n",
