 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary, 2005 Epigenetics Gordon Research Conference \r\n \r\nThe study of epigenetics concerns the enormously complex mechanisms by which \r\ngenotype gives rise to phenotype. It pertains to every aspect of development in virtually \r\nall organisms and has been a good reminder that the essence of how genotype gives rise \r\nto phenotype does not, after all, reside completely in DNA. This proposal requests \r\nsupport for the sixth Gordon Research Conference on Epigenetics to be held at \r\nHolderness School, New Hampshire, August 7-12, 2005.  Invited speakers are leading \r\nresearchers working on prokaryotes, fungi, ciliates, plants, worms, insects, and mammals, \r\nand their presentations will cover some of the most fascinating areas of science today, \r\nincluding molecular and cellular memory, cellular de-differentiation, DNA asymmetry, \r\nDNA methylation, RNA interference, parental imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, \r\nparamutation, ploidy, switching, environmental stress, genome defense systems, position \r\neffects, histone modifications, mammalian cloning, and stem cell development. Of \r\nparticular interest are newly-recognized phenomena whose underlying mechanisms are \r\ncurrently mysterious. \r\n \r\nThe 2005 Gordon Research Conference on Epigenetics will provide a unique setting for \r\nresearchers working on this broad spectrum of mechanisms and organisms to come \r\ntogether and exchange results and ideas. With a limited enrollment and ample time for \r\nformal and informal discussions, the cross-disciplinary environment of this conference \r\nwill foster the innovative thinking and novel collaborations that are critical for the \r\nsuccess of researchers in the field of epigenetics. Finally, as has always been the case \r\nwith this series, the 2005 Conference will place a high priority on promoting the science \r\nand careers of young investigators and increasing the diversity of the scientific \r\ncommunity.",
