 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Santa Clara University for the summers of 2005-2007.  The program director is Michael Carrasco who is assisted by co-PI Ram Subramaniam. Each summer, eight undergraduates will be engaged in original, individual, ten-week research projects in analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry. Each student will receive instruction directly from a faculty mentor, use state-of-the-art instrumentation in recently modernized and newly-built chemistry facilities, and learn the physical and intellectual techniques necessary to become an independent researcher. Development of professional communication skills will be fostered by weekly research meetings at which students present and discuss their results and by having the students deliver a formal presentation at a final symposium. Students will examine ethical issues in scientific work through a weekly seminar series conducted by the faculty mentors in concert with ethicists from Santa Clara University's Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. This series increases awareness of ethical concerns in science (ethical sensitivity) and imparts the knowledge and skills needed for students to perform an ethical decision-making analysis (ethical judgment and commitment). Student recruitment partnerships established with faculty at local, high-minority-enrollment community colleges will serve as conduits for the participation of students from underrepresented groups. Santa Clara University will establish continuing mentoring relationships with these students with the goal of ensuring their immediate entry into four-year colleges and universities and their eventual entry into the chemistry workforce.",
