 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nProposed abstract:\r\n\r\nProfessor Jonathan Rosenberg will study the topology and geometry of manifolds, \r\nas well as C*-algebraic index theory, and various applications.  The \r\napplications will include a number of topics relevant to modern physics,\r\nsuch as the classification of manifolds of positive scalar curvature,\r\nrelevant to the problem of understanding the possibilities for the\r\nlarge-scale geometry of space-time, and questions relevant to dualities between \r\ndifferent space-time topologies in string theory.  Professor Rosenberg is \r\nclosely involved in the supervision and improvement of the mathematics graduate \r\nprograms at the University of Maryland. He will train graduate students and \r\nadvanced undergraduate students in algebra, analysis, geometry, topology, and \r\nmathematical physics, and will also work toward integration of mathematical \r\nsoftware into the undergraduate mathematics curriculum.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, one main focus of the proposal will be the classification \r\nof manifolds via their Yamabe invariants, and the classification of metrics of \r\npositive scalar curvature, problems which involve a quite subtle blend of \r\ndifferential topology, differential geometry, and analysis. Another focus will \r\nbe applications of topology and noncommutative geometry to mathematical physics, \r\nespecially to T-duality in string theory. Other topics will include the use of \r\ninvariants coming from C*-algebras (especially Kasparov's KK-theory) to study \r\nthe geometry and topology of manifolds. For example, the KK-classes coming from \r\nthe classical elliptic operators, such as the signature operator and the \r\nDolbeault operator, will be intensively studied. These studies will deepen the \r\nlink between topological and analytic approaches to geometry of manifolds and \r\nsingular spaces. In addition, Professor Rosenberg will study the applications of \r\nK-theory to the study of C*-algebras, and various related problems on algebraic \r\nK-theory, especially concerning algebras of operators or algebras coming from \r\nquantization of geometrical systems. \r\n",
