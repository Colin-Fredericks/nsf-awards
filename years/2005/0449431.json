The main object of this project is enhancement of filtration performance using particle aggregation in feed water and on the membrane surface.  Geometrical structure of the aggregate cake and fluff layer will be modeled and the specific resistances will be estimated from the simulations. Stokesian dynamics will be developed and modified to simulate the generation of the aggregate cake layer. A primary objective of this project is to determine the critical conditions, i.e., critical flux, below which no disintegration will happen.  The educational plan will focus on cultivating scientific motivation of domestic students who are mostly American-born Asian and native Hawaiian students. They will be introduced to the project through new courses at the undergraduate level on the purpose of research-based education. The proposed course activities will integrate domestic undergraduate and foreign graduate students through research-related projects to foster collaborations. There is a need for developing molecular models that capture the molecular level information of aggregates both in solution and on membranes.  Understanding the physico-chemical aspects of the aggregates on membrane surfaces will offer means of preventing these and thus improving the membrane efficacy. The proposed research is thus expected to have a significant impact on designing more efficient filtration systems.\r\n",
