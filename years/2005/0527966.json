 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests funding for a symposium Surface-mediated Assembly of Polymers, Colloids and Nanoparticles: From 2D to 3D which will be held in Washington, DC, on August 28 - September 1, 2005 at the 230th ACS National Meeting in association with the Division of Polymer Materials: Science and Engineering.  Symposium organizers include: Paula T. Hammond, MIT, USA; Gleb Sukhorukov, Max\r\nPlanck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, Germany; and Svetlana Sukhishvili, Stevens Institute of Technology, USA.                                                                                                                             \r\nIntellectual merit. This symposium will address self- and directed assembly approaches to the construction of thin film heterostructures, colloidal structures, responsive ultrathin films and membranes. Major distinguishing features of the symposium include: (1) integration of theory and modeling approaches to experimental science and engineering of self-assembly; (2) representation of recent developments in surface self-assembled materials in Asia; and (3) emphasis on increased participation of young faculty,\r\npostdoctoral associates and graduate students.                                                                                               \r\nBroader impact. The symposium aims to bring together leading scientists from the US, Europe and Asia, both materials scientists and engineers, working in the interdisciplinary area of surface self-assembly. Encouraged participation of students will enable them to be exposed to state-of-the-art knowledge in the field and to sharpen their knowledge of the field during focused discussions with leading researchers. Through support from NSF, US graduate students will be entitled to financial compensation toward their travel\r\nexpenses.",
