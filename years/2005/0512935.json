 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project focuses on the development of high temperature resins and tapes and their use in automated tape placement (ATP) fabrication with in-situ electron beam cure. Thermoplastic polymer matrix ATP and layer-by-layer electron beam curing ATP (EB-ATP) have been identified as among the most promising techniques for achieving  autoclave properties in ATP composites. The materials to be developed during the course of this program are fully imidized polyimide molding powders with low melt viscosity and cured properties suitable for high-temperature applications. In addition to the materials themselves, processes for fabricating high quality tapes and for manufacturing composite plates will be developed during the course of this program. \r\n\r\nManufacturing affordability has presented a significant barrier to the commercial exploitation of the benefits of thermally stable polymers in advanced composite structural components. The proposed combination of high temperature, low melt viscosity polyimide with powder towpreg and tape developed during this Phase I program and its Phase II follow-on will be an enabling technology for extending the use of filament winding and ATP with electron beam cure for high-performance composites and will fill a much-needed niche in the advanced composites industry. \r\n",
