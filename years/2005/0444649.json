 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA research team consisting of Dr. Peter Cole, Dr. Gabriella Hermon, \r\nand Dr. Uri Tadmor, assisted by Ms. Yanti Jotika, a graduate student \r\nin linguistics, will conduct linguistic fieldwork on Traditional \r\nJambi Malay, an endangered Malay variety spoken in Jambi Province in \r\nsoutheast Sumatra, Indonesia. Malay-Indonesian is a major world language, perhaps the fourth most widely spoken language in the world. Yet there are almost no thorough scientific descriptions of vernacular Malayic languages \r\nand Malay-Indonesian dialects. Grammars of Malay-Indonesian as well \r\nas most theoretical works on the language are almost entirely based \r\non the quasi-artificial standard language. Most native speakers of Malay live in Sumatra, many more than in Malaysia, yet there is not even one thorough grammatical description of a Sumatran Malay dialect. Traditional Jambi Malay is an ideal choice because Jambi is widely considered to be original locus of Melayu (the Malay-Indonesian term for 'Malay'), and is thus the key to understanding the complex diasystem of hundreds of Malay dialects. The linguistic field work will be carried out in two villages, Mudung Laut and Tanjung Raden, where \r\nTraditional Jambi Malay still exhibits many features lost in the \r\nkoineized urban variety spoken in Jambi City. The results of the project will include a general description of the language, documentation of the language in the form of a computerized database of texts linked to digital recordings in a variety of genres, and theoretically oriented studies based on the data. An automatically generated Jambi Malay-English-Indonesian glossary will also be produced, which will serve as the basis for a Jambi Malay dictionary in the second stage of the project. Finally, the investigators will prepare two locally published volumes, one of folk stories and the other autobiographical sketches.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the project include first and foremost the \r\ndocumentation and description of an endangered language (an important \r\npriority for linguistics around the world), as well as the training \r\nof a speaker of that language as a field linguist. The project will \r\nalso create cultural materials for use by the speakers of the \r\nlanguage. The project involves cooperation between U.S. scientists \r\nand scientific institutions abroad: The director of the Jakarta \r\nField Station of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary \r\nAnthropology is a co-PI on the project. The project also plays a \r\nrole in the training of American graduate students with regard to the \r\nimportance of work on endangered languages and contributing to the \r\npreservation of the linguistic and cultural heritage of a \r\nmarginalized community. Equally important is the role of the project \r\nin training international graduate students.\r\n",
