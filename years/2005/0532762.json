Optical packet switched (OPS)\r\nnetworks offer the unique combination of encompassing the enormous capacity of the optical domain\r\nwhile providing versatile connectivity afforded by individual packet routing.\r\n\r\nThe key performance metrics of OPS networks at the logical layer, including throughput, latency,\r\nscalability, and packet-loss-rates have been studied extensively for various architectures. However, the\r\nphysical layer performance, a critical measure of the feasibility of packet switched networks intended for\r\nimplementation in the optical domain, is not well understood in this context. In OPS networks optical\r\npackets are typically self-routed through a complex web of interconnection topologies. The exact path any\r\npacket may take is not often known, as the routing mechanism may be performed statistically to achieve\r\nfairness and load balancing. Furthermore, the data structure carried within the packet may be diverse and\r\ninclude data encoded in different bitrates and modulation formats.\r\n\r\nThus, whereas it may be shown that the logical topology scales in terms of the network layer performance\r\nmetrics, it does not necessarily follow that the physical layer with complex optical packet propagation\r\nalso scales in terms of maintaining end-to-end signal integrity.\r\n\r\nIn this proposed exploratory research the PI will aim to achieve a methodology for evaluating the\r\nintegrated physical/logical layers performance in OPS networks that truly encompasses the diverse set\r\nof scaling metrics and captures the complex nature of optical signal propagation in these networks. To\r\naccomplish these goals an experimental investigation will be performed employing a unique, integrated\r\nsystem of a fully connected 12-port OPS network containing 36 switching elements. This experimental\r\ntest-bed will enable direct coupling between numerical and analytical modeling with realistic data\r\npropagated end-to-end through a complete implemented OPS network.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed exploratory research will establish a novel methodology for bridging\r\nthe gap between the network logical and physical layers in OPS communication systems. These activities\r\nwill create the groundwork for an emerging field of research that integrates two currently separate\r\ndisciplines. The merging of the logical and physical layers will enable an integrated systems approach to a\r\nnew understanding of the critical performance metrics for OPS networks. Unlike electronic systems, the\r\nphysical layer of optical communication systems is subject to numerous impairments arising from the\r\ninteractions (linear and nonlinear) of the optical field with the transport medium, switching elements, and\r\namplifiers. Thus, the total complex system performance cannot be decoupled into its physical and logical\r\ncomponent layers and must be studied in an integrated fashion. The tools to perform this investigation\r\nhowever do not yet exist. In this proposed exploratory research program the PI will perform realistic traffic\r\nrouting experiments in a completely implemented optical packet switched network element. These\r\nexperiments will stress the physical layer scalability as incoming packets to each of the ultra-high\r\ncapacity ports may contain payload data that spans the WDM C-band. The entire payload is transparently\r\nrouted end-to-end through the network element and thus may include a diverse set of modulation speeds\r\nand formats encoded along the multiple payload wavelengths. These experimental investigations by\r\ndirectly coupling the physical and logical layers, will enable the creation of a truly integrative systems\r\nmodel for the performance of OPS networks.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Clearly, the migration of optical communication systems is headed toward dynamic\r\nnetworks driven by the explosive growth of packetized data centric traffic. OPS networks offer the\r\npotential of exploiting the enormous capacity of lightwave communications while delivering fine grained\r\nconnectivity to a multitude of traffic destinations via individual packet routing. The diverse set of data\r\nstructures, encoding, and modulation schemes enabled by the transparent end-to-end payload path creates\r\na network element that can potentially seamlessly evolve with many new network generations. Test-bed\r\nexperiments and modeling employed to demonstrate the integrated physical/logical layers performance\r\nscalability will enable intelligent design of future ultra-high capacity packet switched systems.\r\n\r\n",
