With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, this group is using scanning probe microscopy coupled with kinetic Monte Carlo methods to study the surface morphology during the wet etching of silicon surfaces.  They are focusing on the chemical factors that lead to specific morphologies, and are working to develop an etchant capable of producing atomically flat Si(100) surfaces.  A fundamental understanding of the silicon wet etching process would strongly impact the commercial production of electronic devices.  Students trained in this area will make important contributions to the semiconductor industry. \r\n\r\nA fundamental understanding of the evolution of surface morphology during the wet chemical etching of silicon surfaces is the goal of this research project.  Professor Hines and her group are using scanning probe microscopy and model calculations to examine the chemical effects of etchants on the morphology of the processed silicon surface.  Information from this research is important for the development of efficient, directed processes in the semiconductor industry. \r\n",
