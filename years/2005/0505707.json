 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe PI is interested in the large scale geometry of groups and complexes.\r\nOne project involves analyzing the asymptotic behavior of filling \r\ninvariants of groups. In collaboration with Martin Bridson, Max Forester \r\nand Krishnan Shankar, the PI is investigating the first and second order \r\nDehn functions of groups. In joint work with Max Forester and Krishnan \r\nShankar, the PI is exploring what types of functions can arise as first or \r\nsecond order Dehn functions of subgroups of CAT(0) groups, and of \r\nhyperbolic groups. Another project of the PI and John Crisp, Anton Kaul \r\nand Jon McCammond involves generalized Garside structures and associated \r\ncomplexes for Artin groups.  Another project, comprised of separate \r\ncollaborations of the PI with John Crisp and with Jon McCammond, focuses \r\non  non-positive curvature and dimension in group theory, and on the \r\nconnections between large scale notions and local notions of non-positive \r\ncurvature.  A number of other projects include investigations into \r\nconjugacy and isomorphism of generalized Baumslag-Solitar\r\ngroups, ends of amalgams, distortion of subgroups of hyperbolic\r\ngroups, and the existence of surface subgroups of hyperbolic groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroups are used by mathematicians to study symmetry. A group is just a \r\ncollection of symmetries of an object. Examples include the geometric \r\nsymmetries of a wallpaper pattern, or of a crystal structure, or of an \r\nEscher painting, or the algebraic symmetries associated to roots of \r\npolynomials.  Mathematicians have studied groups intensively as abstract \r\nalgebraic objects since the 19th century. In the  1980's M. Gromov \r\nproposed that we consider groups as geometric objects, and began to \r\nderive deep connections between the geometric and the algebraic \r\nproperties of groups.  One theme which emerged from Gromov's \r\nwork is that the geometric properties which have deep algebraic \r\nconsequences are not local properties, but rather coarse or \"large scale\". \r\nFor example, and infinite ladder and an infinite straight line are not \r\nlocally alike, but are large scale alike, and their symmetry groups will \r\nhave many algebraic similarities.  The PI investigates large scale \r\nversions of isoperimetric problems (area versus perimeter length\r\nproblems) in groups, and also the geometry of coarsely negatively\r\ncurved groups. These investigations help deepen our understanding of\r\nthe nature of symmetry.\r\n\r\n",
