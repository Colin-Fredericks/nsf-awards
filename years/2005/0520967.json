 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MRI project aims to acquire a vital nanoindentation instrumentation that can augment the existing materials research and education priorities at The University of Akron.  There are 4 PIs across three departments, possessing expertise in polymer processing and development, materials characterization of structure-property relationships, and mechanical behavior of polymers.  The presently unavailable nanoindentation system can (1) enhance NSF-funded cost-effective alternative nanomaterials for functional polymer nanocomposites.  The research aims to develop a novel alternative technology and formulates a distinct and cost-effective breed of functional nanoscale reinforcements, viz., nanoscale graphite platelets (NGP). The NGP can be made available at low cost and surface modified using UV/O3 for different composite applications.  Nanomechanical characterization will produce fruitful information in localized viscoelastic deformation, multiphase morphology and interfacial properties, all of which play important roles in influencing the functional performance of the composites.  The indentation system can also (2) benefit research on developing cement-polymer composites reinforced by nanocrystallites, referred to as polymer-intercalated/exfoliated cement (PIEC), which provides an order of magnitude higher in enhancement in strength, adhesion, workability, durability and cost-reduction than conventional infrastructure materials.  The instrumentation can quantify the interfacial parameters that govern the composite's property enhancements.  (3) Understanding of multi-scale structure development in polymer processing by chaotic mixing can be augmented via nanoindentation techniques.  Nanoindentation can perform toughness assessment that could not be otherwise obtained using existing instrumentation for the layered silicate nanocomposites processed via chaotic mixing.  (4) The state-of-the-art self-arrangement nanolithography method developed at Akron, which involves the use of mechanical film-stretching with the incorporation of block copolymerization methods prior to excimer laser irradiation, can be enhanced.  The instrument can provide quantitative measurements of the polymeric domains derived from self-arranged nanolithography.  The Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Akron is over 86 years old and poised to develop novel educational programs in the new century.  The Department offers one of a kind ABET-accredited (2002) Bachelor of Science in Mechanical-Polymer Engineering (BSMPE) program in our nation.  The unique program produces qualified engineering students equipped for the challenges in engineering practice for the regional industry and federal laboratories.  The instrument will be integrated with the laboratory experience for the BSMPE students.  The Department also boasts one of the oldest (1914) and most dynamic engineering co-op programs in our nation, with strong support from our neighboring industrial partners in Ohio. \r\n\r\n The up-to-date knowledge acquired by our undergraduate students in senior design and co-op projects can greatly strengthen our nation's industrial hub.  The University has established the Akron Global Polymer Academy to disseminate new technologies to companies.  It also helps small US companies to upgrade their operations by providing the technology and human resources.  Presently, Ohio is undergoing a pressing technological transition.  The project can benefit our industrial partners and provide sustainable industrialization and science education in the state through cultivating a science-intensive infrastructure in the northeastern Ohio region.  \r\n",
