A formal program is in place at SUNY Buffalo, which will ensure satisfactory progress is attained on these projects. A group of students and the Principal Investigator will work with Aspire, Inc., a collaborating agency, and individuals with disabilities on the projects. Seventy-five projects are expected to be completed during the five-year duration of this award. A written report on the completed projects will be submitted for an annual publication. When completed, each project will be given to the person for whom it is designed. The hope is that this \"real world\" experience will give engineering students a sense of purpose and pride, help engineering schools serve the community, attract new students into engineering, and raise student interest in graduate education. \r\n\r\nThis type of undertaking is important since it provides a meaningful experience for engineering students as part of their undergraduate design requirements, and will also benefit a population where customization is often needed for rehabilitation devices.\r\n\r\n",
