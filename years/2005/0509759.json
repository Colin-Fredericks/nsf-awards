First-principles\r\ntheoretical formulations over the past decade have been derived from volume averaging\r\ntheorems in which microscopic interfacial behavior is explicitly incorporated. These theories have\r\nproposed that interfacial area per volume directly affects macroscopic behavior, and that this\r\nvariable may govern the observed hysteresis in the capillary pressure - saturation relationship.\r\nThe scientific objective of this proposal is to measure the evolution of interfaces among\r\nmultiple phases in a porous medium. Two- and three-dimensional micro-models will be used to\r\ndirectly image and quantify the behavior of the interfacial geometry while concurrently measuring\r\nfluid pressures (globally and locally) and fluid flow. The specific scientific goals are: (a) to\r\ndetermine if an ensemble-averaged relationship among capillary pressure, saturation and\r\ninterfacial area per volume may be universal for statistically similar pore distributions, (b) to\r\nquantify the relationship between interfacial geometry, saturation and relative permeability for\r\nsteady-state flow conditions, and (c) to determine if the relaxation coefficient associated with\r\ndynamic flow conditions depends on the evolution of the interfacial geometry with time. In\r\naddition, we propose to revolutionize the use of micro-models in the study of fluids in porous\r\nmedia in two ways: (a) the incorporation of local probes into two-dimensional micro-models to\r\nmeasure local pressures; and (b) the development of a new two-photon lithographic technique for\r\ncreating transparent three-dimensional micro-models that can be directly imaged by using laser\r\nconfocal microscopy.\r\nMerit  Criteria:\r\n1. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is the acquisition of explicit data sets\r\nconnecting interfacial areas, and other relevant geometric micro-scale data, with macroscopic\r\nhydraulic properties on truly three-dimensional micro-models. The proposed combination of\r\nexperimental methods and analysis will make it possible for the first time to answer the principal\r\nquestion of which microscopic properties are most useful for predicting macroscopic flow\r\nproperties of a porous medium.\r\n2. The broader impact from the proposed activity will be confirmation/disproof of theoretical\r\nmethods used for addressing the prediction of flow and distributions of multiple fluids in a porous\r\nmedium which affects applications in oil, gas and water production, ground water protection,\r\nchemical mixing and processing in chemical engineering, and in porous tissue applications of\r\nbiology and bioengineering. Our outreach objective is three-fold: (1) To train and educate\r\ngraduate and undergraduate students in the science of laboratory research; (2) To work with\r\nscience education majors to develop hands-on experiments for grades 7-12; and (3) To integrate\r\nthe hands-on experiments into our Physics Outreach Program which reaches students in grades\r\n7-12, as well as parents and teachers throughout Indiana.\r\n",
