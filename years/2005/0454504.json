 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Inter-American Materials Collaboration project addresses correlation effects and transport in nanostructured materials.  The project brings together groups led by Adriana Moreo, Florida State University, and Sergio Ulloa, Ohio University, in the US, Guillermo Chiappe, Universidad de Buenos Aires, in Argentina, and Maria Davidovich and Enrique Anda, Pontificia Universidade Catolica, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The main scientific goals of this effort are: (i) to study the subtle quantum properties of transport across nanosystems, such as quantum dots and molecules, by applying a variety of computational and analytical methods, and (ii) to search for common aspects in the physics of artificially created nanostructures and self-generated nanoclusters in oxides, such as manganites and cuprates. \r\n\r\nThe activities significantly contribute to the training of young researchers, who achieve a broad education in both condensed matter and computational physics. In addition, the collaboration strengthens the research environments in the participating institutions, and establishes new partnerships in the continent. The project includes organization of a workshop on correlation effects in nanostructured materials, that brings together about 30 researchers from all the Americas to further stimulate exchanges and collaborations among experimental and theoretical groups. This award is supported by the Division of Materials Research, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n",
