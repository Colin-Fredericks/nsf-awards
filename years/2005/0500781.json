He is also interested in \r\nexploiting p-adic methods for the construction of classical automorphic \r\nforms.\r\n\r\nThe theory of automorphic forms \r\nis one of the main themes of modern  mathematical research. Besides being \r\na beautiful subject in its own  right, it is intimately connected with \r\nother important areas of  mathematics such as number theory (the study of \r\nproperties of numbers, with applications to cryptography) and \r\nrepresentation theory (the study of symmetries, with applications to \r\nphysics). Often, it has surprising applications to concrete problems, such \r\nas the construction of Ramanujan graphs which are of great interest in \r\ncommunication and network theory. The investigator's research is aimed at \r\nelucidating the connections of automorphic forms with number theory and \r\nrepresentation theory.\r\n\r\n",
