 "awd_abstract_narration": "Static non-linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) describe a variety \r\nof problems in physics and engineering. Numerical schemes are commonly \r\nused to approximate the solution satisfying particular boundary \r\nconditions. Such schemes usually require solving a large system of coupled \r\nnon-linear discretized equations. Iterative methods for such systems can \r\nbe very expensive computationally, often leading practitioners to use \r\nalternative problem descriptions to avoid solving the full boundary value \r\nproblem. The investigator proposes a family of fast (non-iterative) \r\nmethods for a wide class of static PDEs, for which the direction of \r\n\"information flow\" defines a natural ordering on the discretized \r\nequations. In a joint work with J.A. Sethian, non-iterative Ordered Upwind \r\nMethods (OUMs) were introduced for Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs arising in \r\nanisotropic (& hybrid) control and in front propagation. The investigator \r\nproposes to extend OUMs to boundary value problems describing differential \r\ngames and non-autonomous optimal control problems.  \r\nIn a joint work with J. Guckenheimer, the OUMs were \r\npreviously applied to a special system of quasilinear PDEs to approximate \r\ninvariant manifolds of vector fields. The investigator proposes to extend \r\nthe invariant manifold approach to compute multi-valued solutions of \r\nboundary value problems.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the proposed methods stems from the notion of \r\n\"causality\" -- unobvious yet natural ordering of the elements of \r\ncomputation.  This approach is relevant for the applications as diverse as \r\nrobotic navigation and photolithography, seismic imaging and computational \r\ngeometry, optics and transient elastography, differential games and \r\nsegmentation of images.  Which trajectory is optimal for a rover traveling \r\non the surface of Mars?  With what delay and how strongly will an \r\nunderground explosion be felt by a sensor at a given point on the surface?  \r\nWhat are the optimal parameter values for etching and deposition in the \r\nintegrated circuit manufacturing?  What is the minimum safe distance for \r\nthe aircraft collision avoidance?  Will the electrical power system \r\nautomatically recover after a \"fault\"? Answering these important practical \r\nquestions in real time requires efficient and robust numerical methods for \r\nsolving the corresponding partial differential equations. \r\n",
