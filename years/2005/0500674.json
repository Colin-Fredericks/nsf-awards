The systems\r\nto be considered include those from ordinary and partial differential\r\nequations, systems of lattice differential equations (that is,\r\nspatially discrete systems), differential delay equations, and\r\nmax-plus operators. Issues such as the existence of equilibria and\r\ntheir stability, spontaneous formation of spatial patterns and spatial\r\nchaos, the existence and qualitative properties of traveling fronts,\r\nand the appearance of spontaneous temporal oscillations will be studied\r\nfor these problems. In addition to the established techniques (both\r\ntheoretical and numerical) from differential equations and dynamical\r\nsystems, a significant portion of the proposed research involves the\r\ndevelopment and implementation of new tools and techniques with which\r\nto study these systems. Among the techniques to be employed are those\r\ninvolving singular perturbations, invariant manifolds, exponential\r\ndichotomies, and topological methods.\r\n\r\nWe are developing new mathematical techniques for analyzing and\r\nunderstanding differential equations and difference equations. Such\r\nequations typically arise as models in numerous areas of science. In\r\nbroad terms, these types of mathematical systems model time-dependent\r\nor evolutionary behavior, as it occurs in a wide range of scientific\r\nareas, including biology, chemistry, electrical circuit theory, image\r\nprocessing, and material science. Although this is a very broad scope\r\nof inquiry, the specific problems to be studied exhibit features in\r\ncommon -- spontaneous formation of patterns, self-sustained oscillations,\r\nregulation by internal feedback (often with time delays) -- which can be\r\nanalyzed with some of the basic tools of dynamical systems theory. It is\r\nexpected the resulting mathematical advances arising from these studies\r\nwill increase the knowledge of, and will provide insight into both the\r\nabstract theory of dynamical systems, as well as the scientific areas of\r\ninquiry.\r\n",
