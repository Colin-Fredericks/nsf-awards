The  speakers,  who  are predominantly from the tribology community, are being asked to present talks and give thought to  applications  of  low  friction  coatings  that  are  specifically  applied  to  glass  and  ceramics.  In \r\ngeneral, what is required is a low friction, hard, wear resistant layer which is well bonded to the substrate. Surface treatments need to be optimized for each tribological application. There is extensive interest in biocompatibility of ceramics with modified surfaces for artificial implants such as teeth, hips, heart valves and retinal implants as they provide excellent chemical durability,  wear  resistance,  biocompatibility,  environmental  friendliness,  and  esthetics. Development of ceramic restorative materials is a high research priority  due to environmental \r\nconcerns associated with metals waste and disposal. Catastrophic effects of surface flaws are minimized  or  eliminated  by  depositing  surface  coatings.  The  recent  overview  by  Grill* on diamond-like carbon coatings as biocompatible materials shows them to be very promising for this  area,  though  extensive  clinical  trials  are  not  complete.  Biocompatibility  will  be  a  large \r\ncomponent of the symposium. As well as bio applications, other extreme environments will be examined in applications where superhard  coatings  are  needed  such  as  in  abrasive  tools.  The  session  will  stimulate  interest, \r\ndiscussion and ideas by bringing together a variety of different disciplines and outlooks. \r\n(2) Broader Impacts of the Symposium \r\nThis  is  a  one  day meeting  that  can  easily  be  attended  from anywhere  in  the  United  States.  In addition  we  have  attracted  international  speakers.  It  is  a  new  subject  area  for  the  American Ceramic Society  annual meeting, which welcomes new ideas and incentives to increase membership. Novel  aspects  include  a  luncheon  with  students,  who  will  be  invited  to  bring  a  poster,  an \r\nextended abstract and their resumes to the session. The organizers have made a special effort to have a large proportion of female invited speakers and have attracted four from the total of ten. The  Symposium  Chair  (and  Primary  Co-PI)  will  give  an  informal  presentation  on  life  at  a national laboratory and be open to questions on the career of a scientist at such institutions. The Secondary Co-PI is a postdoctoral student. He will be receiving valuable first hand experience on how to organize a symposium and will also be available at the luncheon to answer questions on life at a national laboratory as a postdoctoral student. \r\nOverall,  this  symposium  will  be  a  very  stimulating  environment  to  launch  a  new  area  of discussion with a diverse and interesting set of participants. The day will culminate in a dinner to cement  relationships, initiate collaborations and discuss future funding of possible projects. Papers of invited speakers will be published in a special journal issue:  Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter. \r\n                                                 \r\n* Diamond and Related Materials 12 (2003) 166-170 \r\n",
