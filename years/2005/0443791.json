 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2005 Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications will be held July 10-13, 2005, at Denison University in Granville, Ohio. This conference is the 20th in a series that began at City College of CUNY in 1984 and held most recently at the University of Cape Town, South Africa in 2004.  This conference generally draws over 125 graduate students and researchers from across the United States and over 25 other countries.  It is offered at a time when most researchers are free from teaching obligations and can travel to conferences.  The diverse offering of special sessions was intentionally designed to impact a broader range of mathematics and related fields, beyond the traditional areas of topology.  This diversity should also promote the collaboration between researchers in different fields.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this conference are to:\r\n1. Present the participants with the leading researchers and latest developments in topology and related fields\r\n2. Encourage and promote applications of topology in these related fields\r\n3. To provide an opportunity for mathematicians from across the country and around the world to communicate and collaborate at a time that is convenient to most\r\n4. Expose graduate students to a high level of research activity and prepare them for research in applications of topology\r\n\r\nThere will be six invited plenary speakers: Marcy Barge of Montana State University, Jose Bonet of the Politechnical University of Valencia, Todd Eisworth of Ohio University, Jan van Mill of Vrije Universiteit, Dona Strauss of the University of Hull, and Dana Scott of Carnegie Mellon University.  There will be two workshops:  Interactions between topology and computer science by Achim Jung of the University of Nottingham, England and Convergence in Topology by Gary Gruenhage of Auburn University.  All of these plenary speakers are leaders in his or her field.  Achim Jung is known for his ability to identify relationships among the fields of topology, domain theory, and denotational semantics   Gary Gruenhage is arguable the most productive point-set topologist in North America.  Five special sessions are planned:  Topology and Set Theory, Topology and Set Theory, Topological Groups, Topology in Functional Analysis, Topology in Computer Science, and Topology in Dynamical Systems.\r\n",
