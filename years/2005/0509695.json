 "awd_abstract_narration": "The key objective of the project is to build a quantitative predictive capability \r\nfor the focusing nonlinear electromagnetic waves. A standard mathematical model \r\nfor describing this type of problems is the nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS). \r\nBy now, this equation is relatively well studied. There are, however, indications \r\nthat the NLS model may be oversimplified. An alternative is provided by a more \r\ncomprehensive nonlinear Helmholtz equation (NLH), from which the NLS is, in fact, \r\nderived by employing the so-called paraxial approximation and neglecting the \r\nimportant phenomenon of backscattering. In contradistinction to the NLS, relatively \r\nlittle is known about the solvability of the NLH and uniqueness of its solutions.\r\nMoreover, this equation presents a considerable challenge for the numerical approach\r\nas well. Nonlinearity is a major hurdle, as it implies that the impinging and\r\n(back)scattered waves cannot be separated. Another key difficulty is the small \r\nmagnitude of backscattering compared to that of the forward propagating wave.\r\nIn the course of the project, the PI and his colleagues will develop, implement,\r\nand test an efficient numerical procedure for integrating the NLH. It will involve\r\nmajor modifications and improvements to the previously proposed methodology that\r\nhas already proven successful and, in fact, unparalled in the literature. The \r\nmethodology employs a high-order finite-difference approximation. Its central \r\nelement is a special two-way nonlocal artificial boundary condition that makes the \r\nouter boundary transparent for all the outgoing waves and at the same time is capable \r\nof accurately prescribing the given impinging signal. It is expected that with the \r\nhelp of this methodology, a valuable new insight will be gained into a number of key \r\noutstanding questions in nonlinear optics, in particular, whether the nonparaxiality \r\nand backscattering may arrest the collapse (blow-up) of focusing nonlinear waves, and \r\nwhether the NLH is capable of sustaining the so-called narrow spatial solitons, with \r\nthe width on the order of only several wavelengths.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the project, a numerical methodology will be built to simulate the\r\npropagation of intense laser light through a variety of media and materials. This \r\nmethodology has a solid mathematical foundation, and is expected to help address\r\na number of challenging issues in the theoretical nonlinear optics. In addition\r\nto its potential theoretical merits, the methodology will be useful from the \r\nstandpoint of applications as well. Indeed, the propagation of laser beams in \r\nmaterials is typically accompanied by the phenomena of nonlinear self-focusing and \r\nbackscattering. The capability to quantitatively analyze and predict these key \r\nphenomena is extremely important for many of applications in modern science and \r\nengineering. The latter range from remote atmosphere sensing (when an earth-based \r\npowerful laser sends pulses to the sky, and backscattered radiation accounts for a \r\nsubstantial part of the detected signal), to laser surgery (propagation of laser beams \r\nin tissues), to transmitting information along optical fibers. There are other possible \r\napplications that involve, e.g., interactions between the co-propagating or counter-\r\npropagating laser beams. They may provide a vehicle for designing the so-called all-\r\noptical switches for the next generation of opto-electronic circuits. The proposed \r\nnumerical methodology will yield a powerful tool for the accurate and robust analysis \r\nof the foregoing applications, along with many others.\r\n",
