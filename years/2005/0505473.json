 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies mathematical problems involving\r\nshock waves in nonlinear conservation laws and related applications,\r\nalong with the analysis and development of efficient new nonlinear\r\ntechniques. Shock waves often occur in solutions of nonlinear\r\nconservation laws of hyperbolic type, mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type,\r\nand mixed parabolic-hyperbolic type. The proposed work is in three\r\ninterrelated topics corresponding to the nonlinear conservation laws\r\nof three types:\r\n(1) multidimensional transonic shocks, free boundary problems, and\r\nrelated nonlinear problems;\r\n(2) divergence-measure fields for entropy solutions with shocks to\r\nhyperbolic conservation laws;\r\n(3) solutions with shocks to anisotropic degenerate\r\ndiffusion-convection equations and related nonlinear problems.\r\nIn each, both nonlinear problems involving shock waves and new\r\nmathematical techniques are proposed. The unifying mathematical theme\r\nof the three topics is shock wave problems and related nonlinear\r\ntechniques. The objective of this proposed program is twofold:\r\n(1) investigate important nonlinear problems involving shock\r\nwaves to gain new physical insights, to guide the formulation of\r\nefficient nonlinear techniques, and to find the correct mathematical\r\nframeworks in which to pose the nonlinear conservation laws and\r\ndevelop the numerical methods that converge stably and rapidly;\r\n(2) analyze and develop nonlinear techniques including free boundary\r\nmethods, kinetic methods, compensated regularity methods, and related\r\npotential techniques to formulate new, more efficient nonlinear\r\ntechniques and to solve various more important nonlinear problems\r\nin conservation laws and related applications.\r\n                                                                                \r\nThe mathematical problems in this research program arise in such\r\nareas as gas dynamics, hydraulics, elasticity, multiphase flow,\r\ncombustion, magnetohydrodynamics, semiconductor, phase transitions,\r\nkinetic theory, biophysics, sedimentation-consolidation processes,\r\nmaterial science, and image processing.\r\nThe award will support research on the solvability of these\r\nmathematical problems involving shock waves in nonlinear conservation\r\nlaws and related applications, the qualitative behavior of their\r\nsolutions, as well as the analysis and development of nonlinear\r\nmethods in applied analysis and numerical analysis.\r\nThis research will lead to a deeper understanding of nonlinear\r\nphenomena, especially for shock waves, and will provide more\r\nefficient nonlinear methods and theories for applications.\r\nGiven the richness and the range of applications for which\r\nshock waves are involved in nature, this project will have\r\na broad impact by understanding the behavior of shock waves and\r\ndeveloping methodology and a set of nonlinear techniques\r\nfor their further study.\r\n\r\n",
