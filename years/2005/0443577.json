 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University will acquire an X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector and low-temperature system. The research to be supported by this X-ray instrumentation covers a broad range of organic, inorganic, organometallic, and materials chemistry. The new X-ray diffraction system will serve the structural needs of six major users and eight other users at Colorado State University and at least eight other academic researchers in the Colorado/Wyoming region. The instrumentation will impact the research of well over 100 undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows; support the hands-on instruction and training in diffraction-based structural chemistry provided by existing courses at Colorado State and regional institutions; and support the ability to provide demonstrations of X-ray diffraction methods to visitors, high school chemistry groups, and K-12 teachers (through Colorado State's Center for Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education).\r\n\r\nThe X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. Such structural studies have a large impact in a number of areas, especially in the synthesis of important organic and inorganic chemicals and in understanding chemical interactions with biomolecules.\r\n",
