 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and her postdoctoral fellow together with one graduate student are focusing their research for this grant on the  development, analysis and implementation of novel algorithms for solution of linear ill-posed inverse problems in which both the measured data and the model are error-contaminated. The analysis will provide improved insight for the performance of new and existing algorithms. One direction is analysis of the  linear support vector machine which has already been validated as an effective tool in statistical pattern recognition.   Reformulation of the support vector machine to account for errors that may occur in the features of the patterns to be classified, an example of which might be error contaminated microarray data, utilizing the tools of regularized total least squares, will  better account for  these errors in data measurements. Another direction is the use of a total variation regularized structured  total least squares  algorithm to provide a completely new  mechanism for combining edge preserving  regularization with an errors in the variables model of signal inversion. For multiple, but similarly corrupted, signals, a concurrent solution technique will enhance signal inversion and restoration.  While several approaches for Tikhonov regularized total least squares have  been presented in literature, an effective comparison of their competitiveness  for both synthetic and real data has not been performed. These investigators will determine which of algorithms are most suitable for extensions to realistic problems. All software developed for this project will be disseminated  to collaborators  for their applications and published on the world wide web. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigators have a track record of studying and developing computational tools which can be utilized for many different applications. The successful outcome of this particular research will have  major impact on solution of so-called inverse problems for biomedical applications, genetic data analysis and seismic tomography. These are areas in which the PI is actively collaborating with other practioners, including those at the Translational Genomics Research Center in Phoenix, AZ.  Inverse problems arise in many biomedical situations: for example medical imaging can be used to obtain non-invasive information about the function of an internal organ, potentially also impacted by presence of malignant or benign tumor. Another direction is for the design of   new and improved analysis of seismic data with the intent to  lead to increased understanding of the dynamic nature of the Earth's interior, and in particular the relationship between plate tectonic processes observed at the surface and the thermo-chemical structure of the interior.\r\n",
