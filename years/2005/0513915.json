Their novel properties are intimately related to the unique tubular structures as well as to interactions with guest molecules residing inside or on the surface of the tubes. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and titania (titanium oxide) nanoscrolls are two examples of such novel materials. In this study, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques will be employed to investigate the one-dimensional characteristics of novel electronic properties of SWCNTs.  NMR will also be used to investigate water adsorption and transport inside carbon nanotubes, an issue with relevance to biological processes. A variety of techniques will be employed to characterize the structure of titania nanoscrolls. Structural modifications will be implemented to optimize properties such as optical absorption and surface chemistry. Such study could lead to various important applications including solar cells, efficient photo-catalysis, decontamination of toxic molecules, and drug delivery. The partnership formed with Meredith College, a women's college founded in 1891, will provide excellent opportunities for female students in research and education and to help guide more female students into pursuing careers in science and technology.\r\n\r\n*** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT ***\r\nSingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and titania nanoscrolls are two types of nanotubular materials to be investigated in this study. Characteristics of strongly correlated electron behavior of SWCNTs, such as the Luttinger liquid behavior, will be studied by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Adsorption of water inside SWCNTs confined in a region of nanometer in diameter could lead to ordered structures with unique molecular dynamics. Vapor-liquid equilibrium isotherms will be measured using 1H NMR with simultaneous characterization of molecular dynamics. An important area in the research of titania materials is the effort to reduce their band gaps such that efficient harvesting of solar energy can be realized. Using interactions with guest molecules, titania nanoscrolls offer unique ways for structural modifications that are not possible with titania nanocrystals. Such modified titania nanoscrolls could have red-shifted optical absorption spectra. A variety of characterization techniques and approaches will be used to characterize and optimize the structures and properties of titania nanoscrolls aimed at a wide range of applications. The partnership formed with Meredith College, a women's college founded in 1891, will provide excellent opportunities for female students in research and education. The goal is to help guide more female students into pursuing careers in science and technology.\r\n",
