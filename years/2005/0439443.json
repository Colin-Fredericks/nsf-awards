 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on the one-semester module on chemistry completed in Phase I of \"Foundation Science,\" a comprehensive science curriculum for grades 9-11 is developed in Phase II.  The completed \"Foundation Science\" provides high schools with a scientifically-based, modular science curriculum with supporting professional development and outreach materials that accommodate the variety of approaches that school districts take in their secondary science programs.  The curriculum responds to challenges faced by high schools in meeting state and national standards, preparing students for high stakes testing, accommodating new understandings about how students learn, updating teacher content and pedagogical knowledge and serving an increasingly diverse student population.  The curriculum consists of eight one-semester modules -- two each in biology, chemistry, Earth science, and physics.  Each module comprises four units each developing a particular set of concepts through two to four story-driven learning experiences.  The first module in each discipline develops introductory conceptual understandings appropriate for grades 9 and 10 and skills in critical thinking, problem solving, communications and laboratory techniques.  The second module in each discipline builds on the first to provide deeper, more complex and more extended learning in grade 11.   Students complete all four of the first modules and two of the second.  Thus, students obtain a challenging, rigorous science education that provides a foundation in scientific understanding and literacy skills and prepares them to pursue higher-level learning in science.  The professional development materials support the adoption, implementation and integration of the instructional materials into the classroom and support teachers in the use of multiple assessments to conclusions about the effectiveness of the materials with different populations of students.  Professional development includes a self-evaluation of the content knowledge component with resources available for teachers to increase their understanding.    \r\n\r\n",
