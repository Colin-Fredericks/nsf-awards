 "awd_abstract_narration": "An increasing amount of observational evidence now points to intense, often\r\nlong-lived, aticyclonic eddies as one of the outstanding dynamical features in the\r\ndeeply convecting regions of the world ocean. Yet modeling studies, informed by the\r\nmore limited observations available in the past, have tended to focus on precisely the\r\nopposite case, cyclonic eddies that rapidly disintegrate when subjected to strong\r\nsurface cooling. Anticyclonic eddies could interact\r\nwith deep convection in a variety of ways, but their net effect on convective\r\nwater mass transformation is far from obvious. Their influence must therefore be\r\nconsidered an important unresolved element of the global thermohaline circulation, and\r\nby extension, a research problem of substantial societal concern.\r\nIt is proposed to investigate the interaction between anticyclonic eddies and\r\nconvection using a combined modeling and data analysis approach. The detailed\r\nbehavior of anticyclonic eddies subject to strong surface buoyancy loss will be\r\nexamined throughout a broad range of parameter space. With the aid of newly\r\ndeveloped mathematical and statistical techniques, we will systematically identify and\r\ndescribe coherent eddies in several key convection areas using a variety of high-quality\r\ndatasets. The net result should be a significant step towards a more complete\r\nunderstanding of deep convection in a realistic setting. This process-oriented work will\r\nmake possible improved parameterizations of convection in large-scale models,\r\nand thus more accurate predictions of climate variability.",
