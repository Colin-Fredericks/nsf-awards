 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth Systems Science (40) This project is developing a comprehensive, interconnected series of technologically-advanced, field-oriented experiences for undergraduate women focusing on the Hudson River Estuary, bringing inquiry-based learning experiences to ca. 170 students and 35 faculty in 5 courses yearly.  The activities and pedagogy extend those developed by the Sea Education Association (SEA) for the SEA Semester Program.  Focusing on the river and integrating advanced instrumentation with field and laboratory experiences in courses at both the introductory and advanced level, students are being trained in state-of-the-art field and analytical techniques.  Planning and executing sampling in the field, coupled with analysis in the laboratory, helps students experience scientific discovery and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\r\n\r\nExpected project impacts include: a change in students' understanding of science and how research is conducted; enhanced technical and quantitative skills for women, a demographic group historically underrepresented in the natural sciences; increased enrollment in field- and data-based classes; an increase in the number of field- and lab-based student research projects; and an increased sense of community in the Environmental Science Department as students and faculty work together towards the common goal of understanding the Hudson River Estuary.  Integration of the instrumentation into the jointly taught \"River Summer\" program of the Environmental Consortium extends use of the equipment beyond this project to a broad range of faculty and students at institutions of higher education in the Hudson Valley.\r\n",
