 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is developing an undergraduate course on Digital Signal Processing (DSP) with Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) that includes laboratory experiments. The course presents the most important DSP algorithms appropriate for an undergraduate course and requires no extensive Hardware Description Language (HDL) or DSP knowledge as a prerequisite. Students are learning to develop DSP systems in real world settings with real world problems and state-of-the-art equipment and tools. The investigators are making all material, including online quizzes and tests, available through the Blackboard learning system.  This web-based access enables a continuous information flow between students and the material developers, and it facilitates the use and evaluation of the material by other instructors and industrial advisors.  By providing students with a relevant \"hands-on\" design experience using state-of-the-art equipment in this very important emerging field, the investigators hope to enhance the retention of the large number students from underrepresented populations in their program.  Outside evaluators from academia and from industry are ensuring that the appropriate topic, tools, and procedures are being covered. Students are evaluating the material using the University's course evaluation process and student learning is being evaluated using student exit surveys, focus group evaluations, and alumni surveys. The investigators are planning to disseminate their work via journal publications and major conferences presentations.  In addition, faculty members from four other institutions are committed to use the material in courses at their institutions.",
