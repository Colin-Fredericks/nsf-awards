 "awd_abstract_narration": "Caves remain one of the most endangered ecosystems on the planet because of the unique blind fauna found in the dark underground.  About 95% of cave fauna in the United States is considered endangered, mostly due to the impacts of surface activities and groundwater pollution.  Yet, there are no molecular genetic population-level studies of any obligate cave-dweller in the southeastern United States, an area considered to be a global hotspot of subterranean biodiversity.  Using molecular genetic techniques, this dissertation project addresses the conservation needs of a unique group of blind cave-dwelling crayfishes along the Cumberland Plateau, which spans from eastern Kentucky to northern Alabama.  Information about genetic diversity, population sizes, and gene flow will be gathered to develop management plans for avoidance of inbreeding and isolation, two forces that drive endangered species to extinction.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this study include 1) mapping current groundwater paths, 2) undergraduate training in genetic methods, and 3) a scientific assessment of subterranean biodiversity for conservation agencies.  Hydrological connections between caves and groundwater systems will be elucidated by tracing the current genetic patterns of the highly-mobile blind crayfishes using modern DNA fingerprinting methods.  Undergraduate students will also learn molecular genetic techniques for their independent conservation research projects.  Finally, current cave management practices, such as gating entrances and limiting access, are geared toward overall protection of the cave biome.  It is just as important to protect the individual species, the units of biodiversity, and this research will be the first step in understanding subterranean life.  \r\n",
