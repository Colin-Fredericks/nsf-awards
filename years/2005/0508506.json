Nanomachines are artificial or biological nano-scale devices that perform simple computation, sensing, or actuation. Molecular communication provides a mechanism for nanomachines to communicate over a short distance (adjacent nanomachines to tens of micrometers) using molecules as a communication carrier.\r\n\r\nThe class of molecular communication systems that the PI considers in the project consists of sender nanomachines, receiver nanomachines, carrier molecules, and the environment that these operate in.   Senders and receivers include biological (such as cells or bacteria) and biologically derived (such as molecular motors or sensors taken from biological systems) nanomachines that are capable of emitting and capturing molecules.  Carrier molecules are proteins, ions, or DNA.   The environment is the aqueous solution that is typically found within and between cells.\r\n\r\nIn the project, the P.I. develops research ideas for molecular communication, designs a few possible molecular communication systems, evaluates the feasibility through simulations, empirical studies, collaborates with researchers in the field to identify promising options, and develops a full proposal to submit to NSF for the next year's competition.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merits and broader impacts of the proposed projects are the following:\r\nCreation of new research area: Researchers have so far focused on understanding biological nanomachines and artificially creating counterparts of biological nanomachines. In this project, the P.I. investigates molecular communication as a solution for nano-scale communication between nanomachines. Using molecules as communication carriers is new, and creating such paradigm shifting research is intellectually challenging and rewarding.\r\nInterdisciplinary research: The project is interdisciplinary and involves biotechnology, nano technology and information technology. This is intellectually challenging and rewarding.\r\nCreation of new applications for bio and nano technologies: Communicating nanomachines enables a new set of applications. If multiple nanomachines communicate, they may cooperate and perform complex tasks such as nano-scale sensing, molecular computing, or nanomedicine. The proposed research enables creation of such important applications, and its impact is broad.\r\nCreation of new courses at the graduate program level: The project produces a broad impact on education by identifying a new area of science and technology.  The proposed research leads to the creation of new courses of the multidisciplinary nature at a graduate program level that provides a broad scope of nano scale science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
