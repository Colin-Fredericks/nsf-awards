 "awd_abstract_narration": "The d-bar-Neumann problem may be viewed as the study of the solution\r\nof the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations having minimal\r\nL^2-norm. After Kohn's solution of the problem on strictly\r\nPseudo-convex domains, important advances in the L^2-Sobolev theory\r\nincluded the work of Hormander on L^2-estimates, D'Angelo and Catlin\r\non finite type and subellipticity, Boas and the PI on global\r\nregularity on domains of infinite type, and Kiselman, Barrett, and\r\nChrist on irregularity on worm domains. However, characterizing\r\nglobal regularity remains a fundamental open problem. Likewise, quite\r\ngeneral sufficient conditions are known for compactness of the\r\nd-bar-Neumann operator, but a characterization on general\r\npseudo-convex domains in terms of boundary data remains elusive. These\r\nlong term goals represent two thrusts of this project. The PI\r\nrecently observed intriguing links between sufficient conditions for\r\nregularity properties of the d-bar-Neumann operator and sufficient\r\nconditions for the existence of a Stein neighborhood basis for the\r\nclosure of the domain. Investigating to what extent regularity\r\nproperties of the d-bar-Neumann operator such as compactness imply\r\nthe existence of a Stein neighborhood basis of the closure of the\r\ndomain is a third thrust of this project. During this project, the PI\r\nwill supervise several postdoctoral researchers and several graduate\r\nstudents. He will co-organize a special semester at the Erwin\r\nSchrodinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics\r\ndedicated to topics investigated in this project, and he will give a\r\nlecture course within the Institute's Senior Fellows program\r\nintroducing these topics to graduate students and junior researchers.\r\n\r\nThe study of analysis in several complex variables can be motivated by\r\nthe centrality of the subject within mathematics as well as through a\r\ndirect appeal to its usefulness. For example, one of the basic laws\r\nof nature, causality, when transcribed via a mathematical device\r\ncalled Fourier transform, leads immediately to analytic functions of\r\nseveral (in this case, four) complex variables. The PI has shown that\r\nsome of the problems to be studied in this project have intimate\r\nconnections to issues emanating from quantum mechanics. The central\r\nobject of study in this project, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, form a\r\nmodel problem for a subject central to physics and engineering\r\n(partial differential equations). Finally, the project will\r\ncontribute significantly to the development of human resources\r\nthrough training of highly qualified personnel at the postdoctoral and\r\ngraduate levels, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
