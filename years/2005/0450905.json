The objectives of FOSBE 2005 are: to provide an in depth review and critical assessment of the current state of the art; discussing the current and future needs of research, education and training; and identifying new directions, opportunities, and challenges in system biology.\r\n\r\nThe award is being made to Cache Corporation, a non-profit organization, for only the direct cost (partial support for 12 academic plenary speakers, subsidy for 20 graduate students and postdoctoral associates, and costs of conference publication and administration).\r\n\r\nA conference website exists with detailed information (http://www.fosbe.org).  A brochure had been e-mailed using the combined AIChE-SBE, AIChE-CAST, and CACHE lists to approximately 1000 individuals and departments worldwide.  In addition, hardcopies of the brochure had been widely distributed at national and international conferences and meetings.  A final program and brochure will be distributed using the aforementioned  lists in September. \r\n\r\n",
