 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop an understanding of how nanometer scale (one billionth of a meter) structures affect electrical contact resistance and useful life.  It is known that rough surfaces wear quickly, but how smooth should surfaces be to make better electrical contacts for switches and relays?  The approach is to test surfaces with nanometer-scale roughness to which are applied thin-film coatings, including carbon nanotubes grown directly on the contact testing along with a special apparatus for evaluating coated surfaces samples to choose candidate materials for high-cycle testing.  The contracts will be evaluated at regular intervals to develop an understanding of their long-term surface behavior.  Mathematical models will be made to predict performance and used to help design longer lasting lower resistance miniature electrical switches.\r\n\r\nThe societal impact of this research includes educational and industrial benefits.  Modern society cannot function without electronics, and electronic devices cannot function without reliable high quality switches.   As electronics shrink, so must the switches.  Educationally, a recent MIT Ph.D. graduate, who has been teaching inner-city high school students, and students, from OSU and MIT will work together to develop new nanoscience-centered teaching materials for use in core math an science classes.  Industrially, this research will enable the creation of lower resistance longer life electrical contacts.  The industrial partner will be able to make smaller electrical probes for testing silicon microchips.\r\n",
