 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Mathematical and Physical Sciences Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award supports research in the area of quantum coherence control and quantum computing. The PI plans to initiate collaboration with physicists at the Centre for Quantum Computer Technology in Australia and the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford in the UK. \r\nThe PI will focus on the physics and design of nanoscale electronic devices for quantum information processing, for spintronics, and for probing quantum entanglement, measurement, and transport. Silicon and carbon-based materials will be considered because of their technological potential and good quantum coherence properties. Several key questions will be addressed: \r\no What new and relevant effects emerge in nanoscale silicon devices? \r\no How can the relation between quantum fluctuations and noise be used as a probe of quantum dynamics (for readout) in silicon donor, quantum dot, and carbon nanotube/fullerene systems? \r\no What are the key decoherence mechanisms of electron spin in carbon nanotube/fullerene qubits? Is room temperature quantum information technology possible in a solid-state system? \r\no How can the scalability and control requirements for quantum computing in donor, quantum dot, and carbon nanotube/fullerene systems be reduced? \r\no What is the coherence length of entangled spin pairs in two-dimensional electron gases? Is a transport-based electron spin entangler with detection possible? How might entanglement play an important role in two-dimensional electron gas physics? \r\n\r\nThis Mathematical and Physical Sciences Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award supports research on the purposeful manipulation of quantum mechanical states with quantum computing as a possible application. The PI plans to initiate collaboration with physicists at the Centre for Quantum Computer Technology in Australia and the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford in the UK.  The PI and collaborators will conduct research on key science issues related to controlling quantum mechanical states of electrons, particularly in carbon- and silicon-based materials.  A computer that performs computation through the manipulation of quantum mechanical states, a \"quantum computer,\" would be able to significantly outperform existing computers, particularly in the area of cryptography.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
