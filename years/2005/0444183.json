This is a project to upgrade the existing single-crystal X-ray diffraction system with a two-dimensional detector (CCD) and an X-ray guide device, and to adapt a second P4 diffractometer to the existing 18KW rotating anode source. The upgrades include a Bruker 62 mm square SMART-APEX CCD X-ray detector, an X-ray guide and fine focus anodes to increase X-ray flux at the sample, and adaptation of a second P4 diffractometer, recently acquired as a gift, to the rotating-anode source. The proposed upgrades will allow us to extend the pressure limits for equation of state measurements by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and reduce the sample size limit and data collection times for structure determinations of experimentally produced samples. The CCD detector will also permit high pressure powder diffraction studies to complement our equation of state studies at synchrotron facilities. Upgrading this facility will facilitate the training of research students in mineral crystallography as well as high pressure laboratory methods and powder diffraction in support of on-going projects at national research facilities such as synchrotrons at APS, ALS, and NLS and neutron diffraction facilities at Oak Ridge and Los Alamos National Laboratories. The upgrade will also benefit other small-molecule crystallographic research efforts in the Rocky Mountain Region.\r\n",
