The conference provides physics students with opportunities to interact with world-class researchers and the facilities at which they work.  The purpose is to help develop a stronger and more diverse scientific workforce, with a specific focus on encouraging African American students to go on to graduate school and advanced degrees.  Mentoring and academic problem solving sessions will be provided to the undergraduate students attending, activities aimed at strengthening the graduate student experience.  In addition: professional development activities will be carried out involving high school science teachers; opportunities will be provided whereby high school students will interact with other students already studying science in college; and opportunities will be provided whereby students can be recruited by colleges, universities, and private sector employers.",
