This project was funded by Continental Dynamics during the period 1994 - 2000.  The project was a successful collaboration between U.S. and New Zealand geoscientists.  During the project, extensive field observations were made in several disciplines, and the resulting analyses have produced over 30 substantive peer-reviewed publications with additional ones in review or in preparation.  Over 30 direct participants and an equal number of cooperating scientists and students from both countries have engaged in scientific research funded by Continental Dynamics and the N.Z. Science Foundation programs.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is one step in a larger effort to create a publication volume focused on the Indo-Australian/Pacific plate boundary.  The volume will contain a series of new synthesis papers summarizing and integrating much of the results from the existing published papers.  As such the volume will represent the cumulative knowledge gained by the joint US-NZ project.  The workshop will bring together project members who are actively contributing to and writing manuscripts.  The workshop will be held in New Zealand where US and NZ authors and students will assemble to discuss manuscript content  and writing preparation.\r\n\r\n",
