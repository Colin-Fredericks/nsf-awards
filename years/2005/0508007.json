 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Inorganic, Bioinorganc and Organometallic Chemistry Program are co-supporting a bilateral NSF/EPSRC Workshop on \"The Synthesis of Complex Chemical Systems\"  organized by Dr. Jeffrey S. Moore of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois and Dr. Timothy Swager of the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The proposed workshop will focus on challenging and contemporary research in the design, preparation and characterization of well-defined molecular systems that can be considered complex because of their size, three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, high degree of functionality, or the collection of constituents that self-organize into multimolecular assemblies. Dr. Jason Green (Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, EPSRC) and Dr. Alejandra Palermo (Royal Society of Chemistry) will both serve as the U.K. organizers.  The Workshop is scheduled to extend from Wednesday evening, March 16, 2005 through Friday, March 18, 2005 at the Endicott House (owned by MIT) in Dedham, MA.\r\n\r\nThe workshop aims to expose younger chemists to the broader community of international scholarship and to build long-term bridges for productive international collaboration and knowledge exchange. The workshop is expected to provide a forum for the exchange of research ideas, accomplishments and common problems among the group of chemists.  The setting and the proposed  schedule are designed to encourage formal and informal discussion that will allow participants to become well acquainted with one another. All the U.S. participants are within seven years of their independent careers and have made significant contributions to this field. The participants are evenly drawn from organic and inorganic backgrounds\r\ngeographically from across the United States.",
