 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitochondria are the \"power house\" of the cell and are responsible for more than 80% of the energy our cells need to function. Their demonstrated role in human disease, and their implied role in neurodegenerative conditions in advanced age makes them particularly relevant given the demographic realities of our society. The low variation within the mitochondrial DNA of most systems limits their power to detect the role of mitochondria in determining host fitness. \r\n\r\nDrs Ballard and Katewa propose to study mitochondrial metabolism in a model species with high mitochondrial DNA variation. The proposal links population genetics theory with the modeling approach and hypotheses developed by the aging community to study whether the mitochondrial genotype, or mitonuclear interactions influence mitochondrial metabolism in the fly Drosophila simulans. Completion of these studies will make significant contributions to the understanding of the genetic and biochemical mechanisms underlying mitochondrial influences on oxidative metabolism in animals, including humans. The study will result in the mentoring of female undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher. Results from the studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and additional relevant information will be presented on the laboratory homepage.\r\n",
