 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Nicholas Turro, of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies that will (1) investigate the EPR characterization of the structure and dynamics of molecules adsorbed on the external surface of a series of monodispersed zeolite crystals; (2) study the stereoselectivity of the reaction of singlet oxygen with enecarbamates adsorbed on the internal surface of zeolites; (3) examine the interactions of macromolecules end-labeled with an electronically excited state, a reactive radical or an electron spin polarized state with small molecules (as a model for the propagation step in free radical polymerization) and with the ends of other macromolecular chains (as a model for the termination step in free radical polymerization); and (4) explore the simultaneous absorption of two photons to induce photochemistry with long wavelength light. Each of these research activities will be investigated through a multi-technique approach including time resolved spectroscopic methods (UV-VIS absorption, fluorescence, phosphorescence, infrared, electron paramagnetic resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance).\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support of the research activities of Professor Nicholas J. Turro of Columbia University where in addition to its intrinsic scientific interest, the zeolite characterization project in this proposal is of practical significance given the importance of zeolites as catalysts in various industrial processes. The polymer kinetics project has obvious industrial significance as well. The multiphoton studies could lead to a method of tagging biological macromolecules with fluorescent probes that can be activated in vivo by long wavelength light that is only weakly absorbed by the tissues. Broader impacts of Professor Turro's activities include the integration of research and education through the use of the twin themes of spectroscopy and photochemistry as a conceptual basis for developing chemistry lectures and chemistry laboratories in undergraduate courses. During the past funding period Professor Turro has contributed to diversity in the human resource pool for science by serving as a mentor for 15 graduate students, 23 postdoctoral associates, 10 undergraduates and 3 high school teachers. This group included 11 women and 6 minority students.\r\n",
