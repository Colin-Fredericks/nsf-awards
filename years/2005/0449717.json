 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research aspect of this CAREER project concerns the application of\r\nstochastic modeling and asymptotic techniques toward two problems in\r\nmicrobiology which can be cast within the framework of stochastic\r\nmotion in random environments. First, a stochastic model will be\r\ndeveloped to represent how water molecules interact with the surface\r\nof a protein.  Water plays a crucial role in the functioning of\r\nproteins, and must be accounted for in molecular dynamics simulations\r\nwhich attempt to predict the dynamics of a protein molecule.  The\r\ndetailed inclusion of water molecules in such simulations is however\r\nvery costly and limits the practical scope of these simulations.  The\r\nstochastic model for the water-protein interaction to be\r\ndeveloped in the research is intended to\r\nprovide a more efficient representation of the effects of water and\r\nthereby accelerate protein dynamics calculations.  It will consist of\r\na lattice model parameterization of the chemistry and geometry of the\r\nprotein surface and a generalized diffusion process for the water\r\nmolecules moving in a potential induced by the surface lattice model.\r\nA second component of the proposed research is an extension of the\r\nanalytical and computational methodology for modeling molecular motors\r\nto include more physical realism.  Asymptotic and stochastic\r\ntechniques will be employed to characterize molecular motors operating\r\nin multiple dimensions and/or with multiple degrees of freedom, and to\r\nincorporate random modulations in the force potentials.  The Immersed\r\nBoundary computational method, recently extended to include thermal\r\nfluctuations, will be used to simulate molecular motor processes in a\r\nway which incorporates in a natural way osmotic effects and the\r\ndynamics of the fluid medium.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, this CAREER project comprises a research program and\r\ncourse developments at the undergraduate and graduate levels which\r\nwill apply the principal investigator's prior experience in turbulence\r\nmodeling to new problems in microbiology, and provide more systematic\r\nopportunities to communicate knowledge and problem-solving\r\napproaches to undergraduate and graduate students.  The research\r\nobjective pertaining to the interaction between protein and water\r\nmolecules has the potential for providing a significant speedup in\r\nsimulations of protein dynamics by reducing the cost of modeling the\r\neffects of the water.  Accelerated protein dynamic simulations would\r\nexpedite both our basic understanding of protein dynamics and the\r\ntechnological development of drugs and devices designed to interact\r\nwith proteins.  Analytical and computational research on molecular\r\nmotors will aim to improve the physical understanding of how\r\nbiological cells move and transport material within themselves.  The\r\nbroader impacts of the project include the interdisciplinary training\r\nof graduate students in mathematical and computational modeling in\r\nmicrobiology, the introduction of new graduate courses on stochastic\r\nmodeling, the renovation of an undergraduate course on probability\r\ntheory  to incorporate modern research\r\nefforts and issues as contexts for the learning of mathematical\r\ntechniques, material to be posted on the World Wide Web to disseminate\r\nthese pedagogical applications, and broader opportunities for\r\nundergraduate students to gain experience in mathematical modeling.",
