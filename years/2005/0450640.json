 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop  new methods for achieving  high-speed  sequencing  and  structure  analysis  of  drug  and  biological  molecules . The benefits of high-speed  Molecular Sequencing (MSn) will be broadly applicable to end users through compatibility with ion trap MS instruments in general and specifically for the proposed QitTof MS (quadrupole ion - trap, time - of - flight mass spectrometry), which will provide the highest potential analysis speeds. The technical objectives for Phase II research are  to  (a)  to develop  high-speed  MSn  algorithms,  (b)  to optimize  accurate  mass  neutral  loss performance,  (c) to develop  CE / ESI  (capillary electrophoresis / electrospray ionization) interface,  and  (d)  to demonstrate  CE / ESI / QitTof  MS/MS  for high-speed peptide sequencing. The final outcome of this Phase II work will be an instrument that will clearly achieve the highest speeds for peptide sequencing and overall protein identification. \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will be in the area of proteomics. The  proteomics  market  is  forecasted  to grow  from  $ 0.7 billion  to  $ 5.8 billion  over  the  next  5  years.  There  is  a  tremendous  need  to  develop automated  methods  for  the analysis of proteins   and  peptides  linked to specific cells and tissues, in order  to  better  understand global  biological  function  for  improved  drug  therapy  and  early  detection  of  diseases  such  as cancer.  \r\n",
