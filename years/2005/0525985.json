 "awd_abstract_narration": "Epstein / Ribes - NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (prop #6457371, Feb 2005)\r\nProject Summary\r\nThis project takes the development and deployment of GEON as its object.\r\nGEON, the 'geo-sciences network,' is an American cyberinfrastructure for the solid\r\nearth sciences - a five year National Science Foundation (NSF) project with the goal of\r\nproviding computing, data interoperability and visualization resources for the broader\r\ngeo-sciences. To date GEON is the most ambitious project of its kind, drawing together\r\nsuch diverse disciplines within the earth-sciences as geophysics, paleobotany,\r\nseismology, and geochemistry to name only a few. GEON is only one of many already\r\ninitiated or planned cyberinfrastructure under the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Program\r\n(ACP) . Through shared infrastructure, computer science expertise, and information\r\ntechnologies the impact of GEON stretches beyond the geo-sciences to the larger goal of\r\nscience informatization. Cyberinfrastructure generally, and GEON specifically, is as much a bottom-up\r\nactivity as top-down. In the case of GEON the NSF provides the encouragement and\r\nmulti-million dollar funding 'from above', but the socio-technical structure of GEON\r\nitself was proposed, designed and enacted by practicing scientists 'from below'. How\r\ncan we understand the conjunction and enaction of these two trajectories: state funding,\r\nand geo-science/IT construction and deployment? This project seeks to follow the\r\npractices of information technologists and geo-scientists from below and the policy\r\naction from above in order to understand the resulting transformations in the organization\r\nand practice of science. What are the consequences of mobilizing the geo-scientific\r\ncommunity in its own technological transformation to meet the larger goals of the ACP?\r\nFrom GEON's inception in 2002, Ribes (co-PI) has been an ethnographic\r\nparticipant observer of the negotiations between geo-scientists and information\r\ntechnologists. This research proposal requests the resources to complement the already\r\nproceeding research by tracing GEON's development 'from above': NSF funding and\r\nsupport, and geoscience's vision of an informaticized science of the earth. Funds will be\r\nused to support travel for archival research on the ACP and to conduct interviews with\r\nsignificant 'macro-scale' actors which have provided political and financial support for\r\nthe GEON cyberinfrastructure.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nWithin the field of science and technology studies this research\r\nproject seeks to address the intersection of four themes of growing importance which\r\nhave thus far been taken separately within the field, and which cross traditional notions of\r\n'scale,' but which in GEON appear simultaneously: i- standardization and classification,\r\nii- users and design, iii - the organization of science and changes of practice in relation to\r\ninformation technologies; and iv- science and the state.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n In a broader sense this study contributes to the successful\r\ndevelopment and unfolding of contemporary information infrastructures. Calls from\r\nwithin computer science itself have pointed to the need for a greater research\r\ninvolvement of social science in the production of these large-scale infrastructures.\r\n'Cyberinfrastructure' is already framed as an organizational and institutional endeavor\r\nand offers an inviting site for building relationships with science studies. Finally this\r\nstudy will seek to offer practical, conceptual and analytic resources for practicing\r\nscientists themselves who are currently facing greater transformation through\r\ninformatization.\r\n\r\n",
