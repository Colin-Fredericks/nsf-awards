 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY 2006.  The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"Computational and experimental analysis of gene splicing evolution in primates.\"  Although our genome sequence is about 98% identical to that of our closest relative, the chimpanzee, there are important biological differences between humans and other primates. This research involves the design and use a primate splicing microarrays to investigate one important source of potential difference in regulation of gene function, alternative splicing. These experiments help reveal how the genetic repertoire of primates, that is largely identical among species, is used to generate species-specific alternative isoform profiles.\r\n\r\nThe research training opportunities include splicing array development, database management and analysis, and molecular evolution. Working with a multi-disciplinary and international group at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Anthropology (MPI-EVA) also provides unique training and teaching opportunities. Communicating research results between the various departments within MPI-EVA provides the Fellow the opportunity to hone his scientific communication skills and he gains experience in teaching and developing curricula in the new graduate program in Human Origins at MPI-EVA.\r\n",
