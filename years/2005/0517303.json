 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brain Myosin5 and synaptic plasticity\r\nAbstract of project\r\nThe human brain is a flexible structure that changes in response to experiences but it is\r\nnot fully understood how experience changes the brain at the cellular level and results\r\nin learning and memory. The question posed in this proposal is \"what is the role of\r\nthe actin-dependent molecular motor, brain myosin5, in experience-driven synaptic\r\nplasticity, i.e how does myosin5 participate in synaptic strengthening?\" Brain\r\nmyosin5 (Myosin-Va) has multiple functions that link it to synaptic plasticity. It\r\ntransports vesicles as well as other kinds of cargo at axon terminals and dendritic\r\nspines. In addition, it is a constitutive component of the postsynaptic density.\r\nPrevious studies have shown that myosin5 binds to kinesin (heteromotor complex)\r\nand functions as a molecular motor for the transport of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\r\nvesicles. Those studies led to the following specific question to be addressed in this\r\nproject: How is transport of ER vesicles by myosin5 and kinesin coordinated. The\r\nspecific aims are as follows: The PI and his research group will isolate brain-specific\r\nbinding partners of myosin5 using affinity-based biochemical methods and identify\r\nthe proteins using proteomic approaches (brain-specific myosin5 proteome). The\r\nresults from this proteomics screen will be used to determine which proteins\r\nconstitute the myosin5/kinesin heteromotor complex. From the list of proteins\r\nidentified by proteomics, they will identify signaling proteins that associate with the\r\nmyosin5/kinesin motor complex and determine which of these signaling proteins\r\nfunction to coordinate kinesin and myosin5 activity during transport of ER vesicles\r\nusing an in vitro motility assay.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts resulting from the proposed activities: The broader impacts will\r\ninclude mentoring by the PI of minority students through the Ernest Everett Just\r\nProgram at Dartmouth, sponsoring undergraduate students engaged in independent\r\nresearch projects and honor's theses research in his laboratory and working with\r\nstudents from Spelman College and Morehouse College (2 HBCUs) who come to\r\nDartmouth as exchange students. In addition, the PI will continue to sponsor\r\nundergraduate students in his laboratory at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods\r\nHole MA. Each summer he gives lectures on his research and provides mentoring to\r\nminority graduate students enrolled in the SPINES (Neuro) course at the MBL.",
