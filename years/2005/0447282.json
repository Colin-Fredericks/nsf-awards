 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project focuses on comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies of novel magnetic nanocomposite materials. An innovative method based on heterogeneous sonochemistry allows for controllable in situ synthesis of highly magnetic nanoparticles embedded in bulk ceramics. Two major classes of nanocomposites will be studied: 1) Superconducting nanocomposites based on high-Tc ceramics, in which embedded nanoparticles act as efficient magnetic pinning centers leading to a substantial increase in the critical current. The interaction of such ferromagnetic nano-inclusions with surrounding superconductor and Abrikosov vortices will be studied in detail. Several novel effects, such as dynamic pinning and spontaneously generated vortex loops, are expected. 2) Soft magnetic nanocomposites for high-frequency high-temperature applications with refractory ceramics as the structural component and highly magnetic nanoparticles as the active superparamagnetic component. The enhancement of a dynamic resonant permeability and collective effects of superparamagnetic nanoparticles at high frequencies will be investigated in these nanocomposites. The practical outcomes of this CAREER project will be the development of materials for more efficient use of energy in electrical transmission and power-electronics devices. The project provides excellent interdisciplinary research opportunities to students at all levels. An undergraduate solid-state physics course will have an advanced laboratory with experiments based on this project. The use of experimental techniques, such as low-temperature magneto-optical imaging and tunnel-diode susceptometry (with only a few such systems available worldwide), will provide invaluable experience to the students and help in their future careers. A unique summer research program will be organized for minority students (HBCU students, AMP and GAANN scholars), as well as high-school students. Each year, a student workshop will be organized with invited guests from scientific collaborations involved in this project. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project provides a unique opportunity to study fundamental properties of advanced materials and to develop cutting-edge technologies. The practical outcome will be the development of materials for more efficient use of energy in electrical transmission and power-electronics devices. To ensure maximum performance, the fundamental physical properties of these new materials must be thoroughly studied and optimized. This research is particularly urgent In light of recent national power blackouts. The project consists of several research components which will be carried out primarily by students. Minority students (HBCU students, AMP and GAANN scholars) and high-school students will have the opportunity to conduct real-life research, perform data analysis, and present their findings at workshops and conferences.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
