 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to design, implement and prototype a general platform for survivable and secure data storage systems. The platform will provide a set of computation efficient MDS encoders and decoders for general (n,k) schemes, as well as a suite of basic file operations. This project will also explore a few applications of such a platform for storage-based intrusion detection, prevention and restoration. Such a platform can be incorporated, modified, adapted and extended in future research and development of data storage systems and data distribution networks. The proposed research will provide a practical key building block to networked storage systems that form the basis of national cyber security.\r\nThis project is a system practice extension from various theoretical results and tools we have accumulated from related projects.\r\nThe broader impact of this research includes multiple aspects: we will disseminate tools and systems developed in this project to related research communities for wide adoption and adaptation; we will actively incorporate research results into various educational activities; and this project will both make use and provide theory, tools and testbed to the PI's other related NSF-sponsored projects.\r\n",
