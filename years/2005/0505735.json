The importance of such\r\ntheories became clear in late eighties after Witten's\r\npapers. Witten suggested a more general way of construction of\r\ntopological quantum field theories and used it to find new\r\ninteresting models. Among the most important topological theories\r\nare Chern-Simons theory, suggested by PI and Witten and solved by\r\nWitten, and Witten's topological sigma-models (A-model and\r\nB-model).  Chern-Simons theory was very useful in knot theory.\r\nTopological sigma-models, especially mirror symmetry between\r\nA-and B-models, were used to obtain striking results in\r\nenumerative algebraic geometry.  Topological version of gauge\r\ntheories led to remarkable developments in the theory of\r\nfour-dimensional and three-dimensional manifolds.  One can say\r\nthat topological quantum field theories opened the way for\r\napplications of ideas borrowed from physics to pure\r\nmathematics. However, these theories were used also as a powerful\r\ninstrument in string/M-theory. It was shown by Witten that\r\nstarting with any N=2 superconformal theory one can construct\r\ntopological quantum field theories by means of so called\r\ntwisting. This means, in particular,that string theory with N=2\r\nsuperconformal target has topological sectors, that can be\r\nanalyzed more easily than complete theory.  Topological sectors\r\nserved as a testing ground for many important conjectures. From\r\nthe other side, for any critical string we can obtain\r\ntwo-dimensional topological theory considering matter fields\r\ntogether with ghosts. More generally, two-dimensional topological\r\nquantum field theory obeying certain conditions can be \"coupled\r\nto gravity\"; the resulting theory can be considered as string\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe present proposal is devoted to some problems related to\r\ntopological quantum field theories.  In particular, we would like\r\nto relate recent developments in knot theory to the theory of\r\ntopological strings; it seems that this relation should lead to\r\nessential progress both in knot theory and in string theory. We\r\nare planning to apply methods of number theory to topological\r\nstring theory.  Our projects are interdisciplinary; their\r\nrealization will be important both for mathematics and\r\ntheoretical physics.\r\n",
