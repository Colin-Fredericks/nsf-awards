 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies mathematical models for interfacial\r\nphenomena.  The objective is to provide a systematic study for\r\nmulti-phase transitions based on both existing and newly developed\r\nmodels.  These are macroscopic free boundary models, based on\r\nobservable quantities and needed to deal with singularities due to\r\ntopological changes of free boundaries, and microscopic continuum\r\nmodels, derived at the molecular level and (always) well-posed. \r\nOne goal of the project is to derive critical information from\r\ncontinuum models for free boundary models when the latter become\r\nindeterminate.  Another is to develop new microscopic continuum\r\nmodels for phase transitions among phases such as solid/liquid and\r\ndifferent grains in polycrystals.  The project is aimed at the\r\nfusion of mathematics and material science and new developments\r\nfor systems of differential equations.  The main tools used here\r\nare theories of partial differential equations, singular\r\nperturbations, asymptotic expansions, complex analysis,\r\nbifurcation, center manifolds, global analysis, dynamical systems,\r\nand geometric measure.  Computational simulations are used to\r\nstimulate, validate, and further extend theoretical conclusions. \r\n\r\n     The interfacial phenomena studied in this project are\r\ncommonplace in nature.  They occur whenever there is a continuum\r\nthat can exist in at least two different phases and there is some\r\nmechanism that generates a spatial separation of these phases. \r\nThe spatial boundaries that separate these phases, referred to as\r\ninterfaces or free boundaries, evolve with time due to some\r\nmechanisms of transitions between phases.  A typical two-phase\r\ntransition is a solidification process of a liquid.  A classical\r\nmulti-phase transition arises from evolutions of grains in a\r\npolycrystal where alignments of atoms in different grains do not\r\nmatch at grain boundaries.  The growth of a solid polycrystal from\r\na liquid involves a two-phase transition between liquid and solid\r\nand a multi-phase transition among grains.  The use of microscopic\r\ncontinuum models to study phase transitions has undergone a strong\r\ndevelopment in recent years, but major advances have been made\r\nmostly in the case of two-phase transitions.  This project focuses\r\non multi-phase transitions.  These problems motivate new\r\ntheoretical development in free boundary problems, systems of\r\nparabolic/elliptic partial/ordinary differential equations, and\r\ndynamical systems.  Part of the project, involving the Riemann\r\nmapping theorem, is integrated into a graduate/undergraduate\r\ncourse on complex analysis to provide students with a real-life\r\napplication of mathematical theory in material science.  In\r\naddition, graduate students are involved in the project.  New\r\nmodels developed here provide scientists with tools in\r\nunderstanding and designing new materials.",
