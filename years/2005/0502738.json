 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on studies of coherent nonlinear optical phenomena induced by electron spin coherence in semiconductor nanostructures. A main objective is to extend quantum optics concepts originally developed in simple atomic systems to semiconductors.  This project will investigate how manybody interactions, which are inherent in semiconductors but absent in simple atomic systems, affect coherent optical processes induced by the electron spin coherence.  Using interband optical transitions in a semiconductor waveguide, this project will also pursue the reversible mapping between light and electron spin coherence, with the long term goal of storing quantum information for photons as a coherent and robust electron spin wave in semiconductors.  Research conducted in this program provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in semiconductor physics, nanotechnology, and quantum information. The Condensed Matter Physics Program in the Division of Materials Research and the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics program in the Physics Division fund this work jointly. \r\n\r\nWhile storage of classical information has been a well-established technology, storage of quantum information for light has remained a scientific and technological challenge.  Recently, it has been proposed that electron spin coherence in atomic vapors can be used as quantum memory for photons.  A main objective of this project is to extend this approach to semiconductors.  The proposed research includes detailed studies of coherent nonlinear optical phenomena induced by electron spin coherence in semiconductor nanostructures and the use of electron spin coherence in a semiconductor waveguide to store quantum information of light.  Research conducted in this program provides excellent training for graduate and undergraduate students in semiconductor physics, nanotechnology, and quantum information, preparing them for careers in academe, industry, or government. The Condensed Matter Physics Program in the Division of Materials Research and the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics Program in the Physics Division fund this work jointly.\r\n",
