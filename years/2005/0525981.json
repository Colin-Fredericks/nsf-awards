 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this dissertation enhancement research is to generate a three-dimensional model of mineralization of the Navachab gold deposit in Namibia by integrating spectroscopic measurements collected at the surface, from drill core, and from airborne and satellite hyperspectral remote sensing systems.  The geological conditions that led to the formation of this and other related deposits are poorly understood; this project will characterize the lateral and vertical zonation of minerals within the Navachab hydrothermal system and determine how those distributions can be recognized spectrally.  The geological characteristics to be documented at this site will contribute to a better understanding of element redistribution in the Earth's crust and provide improved criteria for exploration using field-based and remote-sensing methods in many regions of the world. Because the Navachab Mine is Namibia's only active gold mine and a major stimulus for economic development in the country, an improved understanding of this formation will enhance efforts to locate and develop such resources in Namibia.   \r\n\r\nThe project builds on a successful international collaboration among the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, the Geological Survey of Namibia, AngloGold Ashanti (owners of the Navachab Mine), and the U.S. Geological Survey's National Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science.  These partners are committed to using new remote-sensing technology to advance understanding of fundamental geological processes as well as to assist Namibia both in sustainable development of its natural resources and in training a technologically-advanced domestic workforce.  For the U.S. doctoral student, the project will provide first-hand experience in the increasingly global practices of scientific research and mineral exploration and production.\r\n",
