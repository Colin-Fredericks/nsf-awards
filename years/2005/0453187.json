 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the project is to construct and estimate an equilibrium model of wages,\r\nemployment and growth. The approach is based on a dynamic model of firm innovation and\r\nevolution developed by Klette and Kortum (2002). In their model, aggregate growth is viewed as\r\nthe result of research and development investments made by firms. The process is one of\r\nSchumpeterian .creative destruction. in which new products replace old ones as in the theories of\r\nGrossman and Helpman (1991) and Howitt and Aghion (1992). There are several reasons for\r\ninterest in the approach. First, it is consistent with empirical evidence on research and\r\ndevelopment investment made and patents filed by firms as wells as the evolution of firm labor\r\nforce size. Second, it provides a model of labor demand that can be used to match the essential\r\ncharacteristics of worker flows into an out of employing firms as well as the size distribution of\r\nfirms. Finally, the model establishes a clear link between labor market policies, the evolution of\r\nproductivity and economic growth and employment.\r\nThe first task among those proposed is to complete a formulation of the model that can be\r\nestimated using matched employer-employee data. The estimation strategy exploits the stochastic\r\nstructure of the model and the empirical fact that firms differ with respect to the productivity of\r\nthe inputs that they employ. These differences allow one to estimate the cost of firm expansion as\r\nwell as the production function relationship between the quantity and composition of workers in\r\nthe labor force of a firm and its value of output. Although initially the PI's intend to use the\r\nDanish Pay and Performance data to estimate the structure of the model, they also hope to estimate\r\nit using Longitudinal Research (LRD) and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)\r\nU.S. databases. Cross country comparisons are essential for the policy applications proposed.\r\nGiven the structural parameter estimates, the objective is to explore the model.s quantitative\r\nimplications for cyclical responses to aggregate shocks and for the welfare effects of labor market\r\npolicy. Does the model explain the observed magnitudes of cyclical variation in investment,\r\nemployment, wages, and worker and job flows and the dynamic relationships among them? What\r\nare the implied magnitudes of the effects of payroll taxes, unemployment benefits, hiring\r\nsubsidies and employment protection on wages, employment and growth? The answer to these\r\nquestions is of critical importance to society at large. For example, the research should provide\r\nnew insight into why employment and productivity growth in many European countries has\r\nlagged that of the U.S. in recent decades.\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe principal investigators will offer the opportunity for undergraduates to engage in the\r\nactivities of the project. The principal way in which they will do so is as research assistants. In\r\naddition, they would like to develop a macro-labor economics course, suitable for upper class\r\nmajors as well as graduate students in economics and policy analysis, based on the project.s\r\nmodeling approach and results.",
