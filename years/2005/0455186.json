 "awd_abstract_narration": "Princeton University continues a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The REU Site has been funded since 1997. The REU Site is affiliated with the Princeton Institute for the Science and Technology of Materials (PRISM). Students interested in physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and engineering participate in research projects that span the breadth of materials science and include topics in electronic materials, biomaterials, polymers, ceramics, materials for energy systems, imaging of materials and materials for architectural conservation. Twenty-five undergraduate students are recruited nationwide every year for a nine-week summer research experience. Complementing the research experience are short courses and seminars on current topics in materials science and engineering, and on science policy, as well as visits to nearby research laboratories. The summer program culminates in public presentations by students about results from their research projects. The program also brings in three secondary school teachers to participate in research activities tailored for the development of curricular material appropriate to introduce materials science and engineering to high school students.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n",
