 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on cluster algebras discovered by the\r\ninvestigator in collaboration with S.Fomin. Cluster algebras are\r\ncommutative of a special kind designed to provide an algebraic\r\nframework for the study of total positivity and canonical bases in\r\nsemisimple groups and their representations. The investigator studies\r\nstructural properties of cluster algebras and their quantum\r\ndeformations. This study uncovers unexpected connections with such\r\ndiverse subjects as the structural theory of Kac-Moody algebras,\r\nrepresentation theory of finite dimensional algebras, geometry of\r\nmoduli spaces, and the theory of superpotentials. One of the main\r\ninstruments of the study is polyhedral combinatorics.\r\n\r\n    This project is motivated by two classical areas of mathematics:\r\nrepresentation theory and the theory of total positivity.\r\nRepresentation theory is a mathematical approach to studying symmetry;\r\nmore specifically, it encodes the symmetry properties of various\r\nphysical and biological systems that occur in nature. Total positivity\r\nis a remarkable property of matrices (square arrays of numbers) that\r\ngeneralizes the familiar notion of positive numbers. Both theories\r\nfind numerous applications in physics, chemistry and other sciences,\r\nas well as in other mathematical disciplines. In fact, representation\r\ntheory serves as the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics,\r\nwhile total positivity is a major tool for explaining oscillations in\r\nmechanical systems. During the last decade, deep connections were\r\nfound between the two fields, and the scope of their applications was\r\ngreatly extended. This project explores the modern framework of\r\nrepresentation theory and total positivity, with the goal of making\r\nits formalism more explicit and understandable.\r\n",
