 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative effort between Indian River Community College and the Martin County School District, Project CAPSTONE seeks to create and implement an interdisciplinary, project-based model to prepare high school students for technical careers.  Based at the Clark Advanced Learning Center (CALC), a joint high school/college facility in South Florida, the CAPSTONE project can potentially serve as a model for providing exemplary technician-related curricular and practical experiences to high school students. Over the course of three years, 200 high school juniors and seniors are directly served by the project.  Activities include the development of integrated math, science and technology curriculum; the creation of industry relevant technical experiences that develop career pathways; improvement and enhancement of high school programming that articulates to associate degrees; and provision of relevant professional development experiences for CALC teachers.  By partnering with the South Florida Water Management District, the project utilizes a school-wide project focused on local restoration efforts to develop student learning in mathematics, science and technology.   Career pathways are supported through e-mentoring with industry professionals as well as student internships with the Martin County business community.",
