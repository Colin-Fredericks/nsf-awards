 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-0428284\r\nDr. Richard Ladner is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Washington; the nomination indicates that he has been active in mentoring since 1985. Ladner has pioneered improved computer networking for the deaf-blind using large print and paperless Braille displays. He spends a week each year working with the University of Washington's DO-IT program, and has done so since 1994. He presently advises a blind computer science PhD student, and three of his 15 PhD graduates are women. \r\n\r\nThe panel noted that Ladner is one of the few PAESMEM nominees who works closely with students who have disabilities. Dr. Ladner is also supportive of undergraduate students. He has attended all of the undergraduate research talks for the CSE Undergraduate Research seminar since 1999.\r\n\r\nHe has also mentored women at many levels (undergraduate, graduate, post-doc, and faculty) and worked with students with disabilities (high school and graduate students). Ladner supports the WISE group; he encourages women to seek balance between personal and professional life, and provides direct mentoring via informal discussions. He is also a co-chair for the Abused Deaf Women's Advocacy Services (ADWAS) steering committee. Dr. Ladner's mentoring clearly extends beyond the walls of the University of Washington in his efforts to increase the number of students with disabilities who will pursue graduate degrees. \r\n",
