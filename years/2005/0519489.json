 "awd_abstract_narration": "This technical component of this project deals with certain fundamental principles\r\nunderlying the application of ionically functionalized conducting polymers, so called\r\nconjugated ionomers, to electronics. The three primary goals of the project are: (1) to\r\nelucidate the mechanism of current rectification at pn junctions based on conjugated\r\nionomers; (2) to elucidate the mechanism of steady-state rectification in a new class of\r\nheteroionic junctions formed between an undoped anionic and cationic ionomer; (3) to\r\nexplore a non-traditional method of doping conjugated polymers that relies on non-\r\nFaradaic processes. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive suite of electrical and\r\nelectrochemical characterization methods are applied to study a series of rationally\r\ndesigned polymer bilayer structures. These studies are complemented by studies on\r\nsingle layer structures and rely heavily on the availability of a family of conjugated\r\nionomers or varying ionic functional group density. The results of the characterization\r\nmethods are to be compared to both theories developed for inorganic semiconductor\r\nanalogues as well as those developed for molecular systems.\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposal stem from better understanding the relation\r\nof polymeric to inorganic semiconductors as well as the unique properties of interfaces\r\nbetween mixed ionic/electronic conductors. In doing so, these studies will help guide the\r\nfuture development of electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as transistors and lightemitting\r\ndiodes, based on conjugated polymers. The project will also impact the training\r\nof both undergraduates and graduate students in the basic science of materials. Graduate\r\nstudents working on the project will be part of a comprehensive training program that\r\nintegrates chemists and physicists and includes targeted technical training in the area of\r\nsemiconductor devices as well as off-campus internships. A broad range of\r\nundergraduates will be reached by the project both through their contributions to research\r\nand through curriculum development. A new non-majors undergraduate course will be\r\ndeveloped that teaches basic chemical and physical principles using everyday materials\r\nand the devices upon which they are based as a context.",
