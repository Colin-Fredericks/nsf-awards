 "awd_abstract_narration": "George Mason University (GMU) has initiated a new program within the School of Computational Sciences (SCS) centered on space weather. In order to implement and go forward with this program, three new tenure-track faculty positions in space weather are anticipated that will be joint with both the SCS and the Department of Physics and Astronomy (DPA). This proposal is for support for one of the positions. Given the already strong solar physics faculty at SCS, highest priority for the NSF-supported position will be given to a magnetospheric scientist. The new faculty member will work with the senior scientists at GMU to implement a novel curriculum focusing on an end-to-end systems approach to space weather. Students will be trained to have a working knowledge of the Sun, heliosphere, magnetosphere, and upper atmosphere/ionosphere, and how societal activities are affected by changes in the system. Research carried out by the faculty and students will focus on this approach, which is envisioned to lead to new knowledge about how the Sun-Earth system works and how to forecast consequences of space weather. In keeping with the missions of the SCS and the DPA, there will be a strong emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of the space weather program and its applications to other fields. There will be a dedicated focus on exposing undergraduate students in physics and astronomy to space weather, on establishing a PhD track in space weather (as an option within the existing PhD programs), and on developing a strong education and outreach program in space weather. Graduates will meet the growing need for specialists in space weather brought on through the implementation of the National Space Weather Plan by various Government agencies, private industry, and other universities. Existing partnerships between GMU and nearby Federal and industrial laboratories will be strengthened by the new space weather program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary outcome of this activity was the advancement and\ndevelopment of a research scientist to a tenured position at a\nuniversity that was developing a new Space Weather program.  During\nthis time, the support was used to address several major broader\nimpacts related to Space Weather.\n\nThe faculty member worked with senior scientists at GMU to implement a\nnovel graduate curriculum that focused on an end-to-end systems approach to space weather; he helped develop an new program in Space Weather that has grown from 5 students to over 25 graduate students over the past 6 years.  The faculty member also developed an undergraduate curriculum for computational and data sciences and mentored several high school students.\n\nAs proposed, graduate students in the program have been trained to\nhave a working knowledge of the Sun, heliosphere, magnetosphere, and\nupper atmosphere/ionosphere, and how societal activities are affected\nby these systems.  A new graduate course was developed,\nStatistical Methods in the Space Sciences, which placed a heavy\nemphasis on understanding data and the impacts of Space Weather.  One\noutreach project was a student-developed Space Weather Forecasting\nContest [http://swxcontest.gmu.edu/], now in its third year, where\nstudents from across the U.S. learn about space weather by learning how\nto forecast it.  The faculty member has mentored students who have\nspent summers at the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder CO and\nare actively collaborating with the Community Coordinated Modeling\nCenter at NASA/GSFC.\n\nThe faculty member emphasized the interdisciplinary nature of the\nspace weather program and its applications to other fields.
