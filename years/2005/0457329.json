These\r\ninclude the exploration of nuclear processes in an environment\r\nextremely rich of electrons and neutrons, and the formation of new\r\nstates of matter in the cores of such objects, like a plasma of quarks\r\nand gluons which is being sought at the most powerful terrestrial\r\nparticle colliders. This NSF supported research project aims at\r\nexploring such processes from observed neutron star data. It is\r\ndivided into two major activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first activity deals with X-ray neutron stars accreting matter\r\nfrom companions. Such neutron stars accrete typically many millions\r\nof tons of matter per second, which hit the stellar surface at a\r\nsignificant fraction of the speed of light. This leads to\r\nthermonuclear reactions on the stellar surface whose ashes gravitate\r\ngradually inward, causing significant changes (e.g. nuclear fusion\r\nreactions) in the star's crust. The major goal of this activity is to\r\nexplore the impact of these thermonuclear reactions on the thermal\r\nevolution of accreting neutron stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second activity concerns our understanding of the fundamental\r\nphysics realized in the ultra-dense core of neutron stars, where\r\nneutrons and protons might be broken up into their quark constituents,\r\ncreating a new state of matter known as quark matter. If quark matter\r\nexists in the cores of neutron stars, it will be a color\r\nsuperconductor whose condensation pattern is very complex. It has also\r\nbeen theorized that neutron stars could in fact be quark stars,\r\nobjects made entirely of quark matter. In the framework of this\r\nactivity, research on potential astrophysical signatures signaling the\r\nexistence of quark matter in \"neutron\" stars will be carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese research activities are crucial to obtain the full physics\r\npotential of the investments that are made in astrophysical detectors,\r\nat Jefferson Lab, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), as well\r\nas new investments that are recommended for the Rare Isotope\r\nAccelerator (RIA).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe researchers and students involved in this project will develop\r\nmulti-media lectures on how stars work and present them to middle\r\nand high school students and teachers in the San Diego area.",
