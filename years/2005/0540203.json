 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project is aimed to create a Dynamic Data Driven Application aimed at improving the understanding of a complex biophysical system - the flight of bats. The system is comprised of a multi-level hierarchical simulation of bat flight based on parameterized features of bat morphology and behavior. The simulation operates at multiple levels of physical approximation and computational speed, and is capable of very rapid solutions but requires input from measurements to ensure fidelity and optimality. This input will be provided in an integrated fashion, drawing from a parallel series of experiments in which several discrete data streams will be generated, including kinematic wing data, wake velocity data over a series of two dimensional cutting planes, as well as other data such as bone deformation,experimentally-determined material properties, etc. This data will direct the simulation ensuring accurate solutions, but still with high responsiveness. The data streams will be monitored, synthesized, combined and processed using an advanced immersive visualization environment which will be used to guide the interactions between the measurement and simulation and to organize the disparate streams of data. The simulation environment to be developed is the first such system capable of generating timely solutions of complex flows over highly unsteady and deformable structures. This has multiple scientific and engineering benefits ranging from the ability to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology to the design of bio-mimetic structures that draw from the abilities of bats on the wing. The direction provided by the experiment will guide scientists to the key sensitivities of these complex flying systems and provide insight to the complexities of animal flight mechanics. Lastly, the visualization systems will provide a unique tool for the synthesis and management of dynamic data drawn from a wide and disparate variety of data sources each having different qualities.\r\n",
