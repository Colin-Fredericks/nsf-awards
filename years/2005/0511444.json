 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThis interdisciplinary project is adapting and developing powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) laboratory modules for use in chemistry, forensic science and pharmacy curricula. The new powder X-ray diffractometer is safer, more versatile, and easier to use than the outmoded instrument that is currently available, allowing its incorporation into several undergraduate laboratories. This new instrument allows the integration of practical PXRD training into two courses in which the technique is currently utilized, as well as incorporation of the technique into five other laboratory courses in the chemistry, forensic science and pharmacy programs over the next three years. Undergraduate summer research students under faculty supervision are helping to develop several of the proposed laboratory experiments outlined by performing the laboratory exercises and composing written experimental procedures. Proactive early-stage course development based on evaluation of student learning is being conducted. The knowledge gained from this project is being prepared for dissemination to the scientific community. Undergraduate students who are conducting experiments in these laboratory modules are graduating with a greater understanding of PXRD and its numerous applications.\r\n",
