 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Brooklyn Gateway is a collaboration between a two-year college, CUNY Kingsborough Community College, and a four-year college, Brooklyn College,  to improve undergraduate student retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs. It responds to national concerns about the need to increase the number of undergraduate students obtaining degrees in STEM areas, as well as the local college-level concern about high attrition in entry-level science courses.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The project responds to major issues that lead to success or failure in\r\nthe early stages of STEM majors' training including student skills in and content\r\nknowledge of science; peer and social support issues; financial and time management\r\nissues for students who must work; and faculty issues related to computer technology\r\nand pedagogy. The project uses a number of methods to foster student success in\r\nearning a college degree in a STEM area: a winter/summer science immersion program\r\nwith a research component, Peer Led Team Learning (PLTL) workshops and peer\r\ntutoring, web- and technology-enhanced course supports, and financial incentives.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The project serves as a model for other academic institutions trying to\r\naddress similar concerns. The evaluation process includes measuring course\r\nperformance, attitudes and perseverance toward STEM degrees. The summative\r\nevaluation assesses five-year increases in retention and graduation rates, which are\r\nanticipated to be 30%, at the collaborating colleges. The dissemination process includes\r\nactivities designed to make other branches of CUNY, as well as other institutions,\r\nfamiliar with the project, and features local seminars and colloquia, publications, and a\r\ncapstone conference.\r\n\r\n",
