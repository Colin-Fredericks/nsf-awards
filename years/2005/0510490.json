 "awd_abstract_narration": "The simulation of fluid flow in bones has received considerable attention \r\nin the field of biomechanics. Limited studies have been conducted up to \r\ndate to investigate the deformation and fluid pressure of bone under well \r\ncontrolled conditions. A series of experimental studies is proposed to \r\ninvestigate the response of bone specimens under monotonic followed by \r\ncyclic loadings. In the experiment, the bone specimen is confined in a \r\nrubber membrane using an all-around pressure enclosed in a newly developed \r\ndevice. The induced deformation and fluid pressure are measured under \r\ndrained and undrained conditions, respectively. The development of plastic \r\nstrains and accumulated fluid pressure under cyclic loading will be \r\nrevealed for different stress amplitudes and frequencies. The study is \r\nundertaken as a cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional research \r\nbetween applied mechanics (geomechanics) and medical science. The \r\nunderstanding of mechanisms of load-induced fluid flow would lead to a \r\nbetter interpretation of mechanosensory function in bones that has \r\nsignificant clinical implications.\r\n",
