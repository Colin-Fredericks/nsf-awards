The emphasis will be on developing a general multi-scale modeling platform that incorporates known mechanical, physical, and chemical effects for biosystems that can be represented as deformable solid immersed in fluid. Specifically, Navier-Stokes equations will be coupled with protein molecular dynamics in incorporating the effects of cell-cell adhesion and deformability on macroscopic behaviors of immersed solid in aqueous environment. The results will be used to obtain a better understanding of sickle cell diseases and their treatments. \r\n\r\nThe developed models and methods will assist in motivating a new generation of research ideas for computational biomechanics, in particular the formulation of new synthetic materials mimicing nature and the further development of various micromanipulation techniques such as microneedle, micropipet, poker, and optical tweezer.\r\n",
