Galloway\r\n\r\nThe Isaac Newton Institute for the Mathematical Sciences is\r\nrunning a semester long program on Global Problems in\r\nMathematical Relativity (GMR) in Cambridge, England from August\r\nto December, 2005.  The purpose of this award is to provide\r\npartial travel and subsistence support for U. S.  participants.\r\nThe general aim of the GMR program is to bring together experts\r\nin the field, along with early career researchers and graduate\r\nstudents, to discuss recent striking advances in mathematical\r\naspects of general relativity and related theories of gravity,\r\nand to address existing problems and challenges.  The program\r\nconsists of three focused conferences: (1) New Directions in\r\nNumerical Relativity, (2) Global General Relativity, and (3) The\r\nConstraint Equations, together with a series of thematic\r\nworkshops that will run throughout the course of the program. The\r\nGMR program coincides with the 100 year anniversary of Einstein's\r\nSpecial Theory of Relativity.  General Relativity, Einstein's\r\ngeometric theory of gravity, which incorporates the special\r\ntheory, has proven to be an extraordinarily accurate theory of\r\ngravity at both the local astrophysical and cosmological\r\nscales. The results of the collaborative research and analysis to\r\nbe carried out during the program will have a significant bearing\r\non various fundamental physical problems, such as the issue of\r\nthe final state of gravitational collapse, and its implications\r\nfor the detection of gravitational radiation. Participation of\r\ngraduate students and recent PhD's is a key component of the\r\nprogram, and is crucial to the continuing vitality of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
