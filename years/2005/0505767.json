Consistency requirements in superstring theory suggest\r\nthat we live in a 10-dimensional world, where the extra six\r\ndimensions must take the shape of a Calabi-Yau geometry.  For the\r\npast 20 years, this has led to a tremendous effort on the part of\r\nmathematicians and physicists to understand Calabi-Yau spaces,\r\nand the various questions which emerge from their role in string\r\ntheory.  On the other hand, more classical areas of physics such\r\nas general relativity continue to motivate interesting questions\r\nin Riemannian geometry.  In particular, extending the Positive\r\nMass Conjecture has important implications for geometric analysis\r\nand string theory.\r\n\r\nThe first two projects in this proposal examine the geometry of\r\nCalabi-Yau spaces. In studying such objects, one has to take into\r\nconsideration singular Calabi-Yaus. One way to deal with\r\nsingularities is to resolve them. As a result, the geometrical\r\nstructure undergoes changes. The goal of the first research\r\nproject is to give a complete characterization of the changes\r\nwhich can occur under crepant resolutions. In contrast to more\r\ntraditional algebraic methods, the proposed techniques for this\r\nstudy involve an interplay between algebraic and analytical\r\nmethods.  Another way to deal with Calabi-Yau singularities is to\r\nanalyze them from the perspective of various string theory\r\ndualities. In the second project, the PI proposes to study the\r\ntaxonomy of Calabi-Yau spaces for which heterotic/F-theory\r\ndualities hold. Along the way, it is hoped that this study will\r\ngive a geometrical interpretation to a new conjecture of McKay\r\nwhich relates the exceptional simply-laced Dynkin diagrams to the\r\nMonster group and its offspring.  The focus of the third project\r\nis the Positive Mass Conjecture. In the context of general\r\nrelativity it has been proved that the total mass of an isolated\r\nsystem is never negative, provided that the sources of the\r\ngravitational field consist of matter with nonnegative local mass\r\ndensity and that spacetime is asymptotically flat. Witten's proof\r\nis based on the analysis of the Dirac operator along\r\nthree-dimensional spacelike submanifolds in spacetime. The goal\r\nof this research is to extend Witten's approach to prove the\r\nPositive Mass Conjecture in any dimension, in particular for\r\nnon-spin manifolds.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, an assortment of questions in mathematics lie at\r\nthe interface between geometry and physics. This proposal focuses\r\non geometry problems which do not fit nicely into one particular\r\nfield, but require a variety of techniques from different\r\nbranches of geometry. Many of these problems come from physics,\r\nwhere ad-hoc methods need further development.\r\n",
