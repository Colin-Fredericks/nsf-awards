 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nMichael Caterino\r\nDEB 0447694\r\n\r\n\r\nThis CAREERS project, based at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History,\r\nwill build a foundation for synthetic study of the rich beetle fauna of the\r\nCalifornia Floristic Province. It will establish the PI as one of a very\r\nsmall number of arthropod biodiversity specialists of this increasingly\r\nimperiled region. Focusing on the southern Californian Transverse Ranges,\r\nthis project integrates field-based inventory work, DNA-based studies of\r\ngeographic variation, and a cutting edge bioinformatics platform to develop\r\na uniquely deep understanding of the area's biodiversity. The California\r\nFloristic Province is an internationally recognized biodiversity hotspot,\r\nyet its most diverse inhabitants, beetles and other arthropods, remain very\r\npoorly known. This project will discover hundreds of undescribed beetle\r\nspecies, will reveal the extent of genetic diversity across the region, and\r\nwill document the distributions of thousands of species in unprecedented\r\ndetail. The data developed through this study will have far-reaching\r\napplication. The region has long been recognized as an important natural\r\nlaboratory for studying evolution, providing important insights into the\r\nprocess of speciation. But these studies have been taxonomically limited.\r\nExpanding on this body of work through studies of regional beetles will\r\nallow real generalizations to be made about these processes. Additionally,\r\ndespite their ecological significance, invertebrates have received little\r\nconsideration in land use management in the region, due principally to a\r\nlack of applicable and accessible data. This project will produce this data\r\nand an online system for accessing it.\r\n \r\nPromoting knowledge and appreciation of insect biodiversity in the region is\r\none of the project's primary goals. Students at high school, undergraduate,\r\nand postdoctoral levels will be directly involved in the research. They will\r\ngain experience in field biology, modern molecular systematics techniques,\r\nand bioinformatics methodology. All project personnel will share findings\r\nthrough public presentations at the Museum, through professional\r\npresentations at international conferences, and through an attractive,\r\nuser-friendly project web site. The web site will provide the primary portal\r\nfor direct access to project data. The underlying database will house\r\nthousands of georeferenced specimen records, enabling GIS-based mapping  and\r\ndistributional analyses. These data will also be accessible to automated\r\nqueries from remote servers assembling a global biodiversity data\r\narchitecture. For general users the web site will provide access to natural\r\nhistory information and photographs of many species they may find in the\r\narea. Special effort will be also made to make this information readily\r\nuseful by primary school students and educators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
