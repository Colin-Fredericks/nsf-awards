 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current high-end applications usually exploit just a fraction of the theoretical performance of \r\nlarge platforms. Interactions among the hardware, system software, programming interface, and \r\nalgorithm are extremely complex, and the implications for development of hybrid MPI+OpenMP \r\nFortran/C/C++ applications are challenging. The emerging generation of machines will be even \r\nmore complex, as will the applications that exploit them. Typical application development and \r\ntuning scenarios involve the manual and separate use of compilers and performance tools, and \r\nprogram modifications based upon insights laboriously gleaned from their output.  \r\nIn this proposal, we intend to raise the quality of the application development and tuning \r\nprocess by creating an integrated environment for program optimization that reduces the manual \r\nlabor and guesswork of existing approaches. We will develop strategies  and the corresponding \r\ninterfaces that enable the application developer, compiler and performance tools to collaborate to \r\ngenerate optimized code based upon a variety of sources of feedback, including performance \r\ndata from  .offline. development runs as well as  from .online. production runs. We will build \r\nand deploy a flexible, working system that combines robust, existing, open source software . a \r\ncompiler, a program analysis tool and two performance tools with complementary features - into \r\na single, coherent environment for collaborative static and dynamic application tuning. \r\nApplication codes of varying complexity supplied by our application partner will motivate our \r\ndevelopment  work  as well  as  test  and  demonstrate  our  results.  The  result  will  be  a  powerful, \r\nintegrated  environment  that can be used to obtain traditional performance data via program \r\nmonitoring, event tracing  and/or the  extraction of hardware counter information, and to obtain \r\nsupport for the static or dynamic tuning of an application code. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe proposed environment integrates several different existing technologies to provide a new \r\nlevel  of  support  for  optimizing  hybrid MPI+OpenMP codes. Support for experimentation with \r\nthe hybrid programming model is provided. The range of information that may be exploited by \r\nthe  compiler  to  optimize  code  is  expanded  to  cover  many  system  and  application-level \r\nphenomena and a variety of optimization scenarios. Interactions between tools will facilitate the \r\nprovision of an approach that is able to handle extreme-scale computations.  Integration issues \r\nwill be addressed with the goal of creating a deployable, extensible system.  \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe tools, ideas, and results of this project will be freely distributed and made available to the \r\nHPC community, nationally and internationally. Besides the general dissemination of results, the \r\nproject has strong ties to performance engineering experts at NCSA. The tools will be installed \r\non NCSA systems for testing and evaluation and will be made available to other users. The \r\nresearch brings together compiler, performance tool, and application developers, enriching the \r\nresearch experience of graduate students to create a well-rounded IT workforce. The PI is active \r\nin the OpenMP community and the project team has close working relationships with DOE and \r\nDOD. New knowledge generated will be integrated into advanced graduate coursework.",
