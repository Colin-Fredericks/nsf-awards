 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical simulations have suggested that a stable (non-reversing) \r\ngeodynamo may be more efficient at generating stronger dipole fields, \r\nand that this condition can arise from a favorable pattern of \r\nlaterally varying heat flux across the core-mantle boundary. Thus it \r\nis important both for understanding how the geodynamo works and for \r\ninferring past lower-mantle conditions to find out whether or not the \r\naverage field strength really was unusually high during the \r\nCretaceous Normal Superchron (CNS), the span of time from around 121 \r\nto 83 Ma during which the geodynamo stopped reversing. The \r\ninvestigators propose a major effort to characterize the \r\npaleomagnetic field intensity and directional dispersion during CNS. \r\nThey plan field work to collect lava samples in Madagascar, Korea, \r\nCosta Rica, N. Greenland, and Svalbard erupted during, just before, \r\nand just after the CNS. They will also collect basalt of mid-Miocene \r\nage (a time of high reversal rate) from the Columbia River Plateau. \r\nThis research seeks answers to the following important questions that \r\nare still unresolved: (i) whether the average intensity during the \r\nCNS was unusually high, low or unexceptional, (ii) whether there were \r\nlong-term intensity trends within the CNS, and (iii) whether the \r\nfluctuation of intensity on time scales of order 104 yr resembled \r\nthat of the recent field or was distinctly different. An alternative \r\nconjecture for the occurrence of the CNS is that the geomagnetic \r\nfield can switch abruptly into and out of a non-reversing state, \r\nsimply by virtue of the highly nonlinear geodynamo processes \r\noperating in the core. The investigators will test this hypothesis by \r\nseeing whether there is an identifiable temporal trend in \r\npaleointensity or dispersion leading up to the beginning or end of \r\nthe CNS. This international collaborative project includes bringing \r\nsenior scientists, postdocs and students to work together and share \r\ntheir knowledge and ideas. The scientific results will be made \r\navailable in the comprehensive paleomagnetic database currently under \r\ndevelopment with NSF support and will be disseminated in journal \r\narticles. The character of the geomagnetic field during the \r\nCretaceous Normal Superchron also has societal relevance and \r\ninterests a broad scientific community trying to understand mantle \r\nbehavior and determine potential causal relationships between plumes, \r\nlarge igneous provinces formation and climatic changes.\r\n",
