 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a Data Management Office for the Southern Ocean Experiment of the Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics Program (SO-Globec), now entering the synthesis, analysis, and modeling phase.  The experiments that formed the U.S. Globec programs are large, multi-disciplinary, multi-year oceanographic effortsinvolving many scientific investigators from many different organizations.  The Southern Ocean Experiment was a study of the winter survival strategy of krill under the antarctic sea ice in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula.\r\nThe Data Management Office will be responsible for providing the data management services required by the scientific investigators of the Southern Ocean component of the U.S. GLOBEC Program as they conclude their field research, analyze the data from their individual efforts, and integrate the results with those from other research components. The office will be coordinated and assisted by the same team as the Northwest Atlantic Georges Bank Program. During the proposal period,  the office will manage data sets (CTD, biomass, meteorological, satellite, model results, etc.) from the Southern Ocean investigators and make these data available via an on-line, World Wide Web based, data management system (JGOFS); maintain an inventory and program thesaurus of data field names; and support and encourage data synthesis by providing on-line, web-based and stand-alone display tools.\r\n",
