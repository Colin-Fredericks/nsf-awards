 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a SGER to support the PI's proposal to explore the possibility of collaborating with communities on the North Slope of Alaska in researching the socio-economic effects of oil and gas development.  As oil development activities increase in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska, located eight miles from the Inupiat village of Nuiqsut, the effects of that development become all the more acute and the proposed research becomes all the more urgent.  Working in Alaska Native communities requires extensive face-to-face contact in order to build the level of community trust that is needed for social science research.  This proposal will support the PI's efforts to work with the community in developing and implementing a research strategy that explores the issues surrounding natural resource development in the Arctic.",
