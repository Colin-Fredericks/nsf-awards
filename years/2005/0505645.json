Despite the enormous progress made\r\nduring the last several decades, there remain many fundamental\r\nproblems.  This project is to study several such problems\r\ninvolving the scalar curvature. The first one is to understand\r\nthe boundary effect on manifolds with convex boundary and\r\npositive scalar curvature. This is closely related to\r\nunderstanding quasi-local mass in general relativity. A key\r\nspecific case is whether a compact three-manifold with scalar\r\ncurvature bigger or equal to six whose boundary is totally\r\ngeodesic and isometric to the standard two-sphere is isometric to\r\nthe three dimensional hemisphere. The second problem is whether\r\non a compact hyperbolic three-manifold the Yamabe number is\r\nachieved by the hyperbolic metric. If true it will be a\r\nremarkable generalization of several deep results in Riemannian\r\ngeometry. It is equivalent to the question whether the hyperbolic\r\nmetric has smaller volume than any other metric with the same\r\nscalar curvature. These problems definitely will serve as great\r\nsource of inspiration and lead to many other fascinating\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nThis project will have a broad impact outside the field of\r\ngeometric analysis. These important problems are closely related\r\nto theoretical physics, particularly general relativity. Their\r\nsolutions will greatly enhance our understanding of spacetime\r\nstructures.  It is also conceivable that understanding boundary\r\neffect under various curvature assumptions will have applications\r\nin other areas of science and engineering. The author hopes that\r\nthe project will also have a positive contribution to\r\nundergraduate and graduate education and training.  It will be\r\npart of the author's joint efforts with his colleagues to\r\nstrengthen the graduqate program in geometric analysis at\r\nMichigan State University.\r\n",
