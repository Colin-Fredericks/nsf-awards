The program will\r\nbe devoted to mathematical subjects motivated by string theory,\r\nand to recent developments in string theory and related physical\r\nfields which are of strong mathematical interest. On the\r\nmathematical side, the aim is to foster interaction between such\r\nareas of mathematics as derived categories, elliptic cohomology,\r\ngeometric Langlands correspondence, quantum cohomology,\r\ndifferential geometry varieties with special holonomy and of\r\nspecial Lagrangian varieties. On the more physical side, the aim\r\nis to foster new progress in the continuing drive towards\r\nunderstanding the foundations of string/M-theory, and in the\r\nwealth of new ideas involving D-branes, BPS states and various\r\ndualities which are of great importance to mathematical subjects\r\nsuch as algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the program is to advance our understanding\r\nof the fundamental questions of physics of the\r\nmicroworld. Probably the most promising application of quantum\r\nphysics contemplated nowadays is the Quantum Computing Project\r\nwhich can potentially lead to creation of computers whose power\r\nexceeds the present-day limits by many orders of magnitude. This\r\ndirection is a part of the proposed activitie and we plan to have\r\na distinguished lecture series (the Blyth Lectures) devoted to\r\nthe subject.  This program represents an excellent opportunity\r\nfor young scholars to experience a high-level interdisciplinary\r\ncollaboration.  In particular, it is going to be a very important\r\ntraining ground for young American scientists.\r\n",
