 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will be broken into various subprojects in algebraic\r\ngeometry. In the first subproject, Arapura intends to study vanishing\r\ntheorems, which are very roughly a collection of techniques for\r\ncontrolling homological invariants. In the second subproject, Arapura\r\nintends to study some problems related to the Hodge conjecture, which\r\npredicts that certain homological entities called Hodge classes can be\r\nrealized in a geometric way. In the fifth subproject, Matsuki plans to\r\nstudy the homological aspects of the minimal model program, and also\r\nto study the automorphisms of the three dimensional space. Several\r\nsubproject involve finding good models, or resolutions, for varieties\r\nand maps between them. For maps this can be formulated more precisely\r\nas the toroidalization problem, and this will be studied by Matsuki in\r\nthe fourth subproject. Finding good models for a variety amounts to\r\nresolution of singularities. Various aspects of the problem will be\r\nstudied by Matsuki and Wlodarczyk in the seventh subproject. In\r\nparticular, Wlodarczyk has found a simplified algorithm for\r\nresolutions of singularities in characteristic zero, which he plans to\r\nrefine. In the eighth project, Wlodarczyk will further develop his\r\ntheory of stratified toroidal varieties, which extends the theory of\r\ntoroidal embeddings.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic varieties are basic objects in mathematics; they are sets of\r\nsolutions of systems of algebraic equations.  They have found\r\napplications in areas as diverse as mathematical physics and\r\ncryptography. The goal of this project is to further the understanding\r\nof these objects. A standard technique involves expressing the objects\r\nby their homological invariants, which are usually more accessible and\r\noften computable. Some of the subproject involve this approach.  The\r\nremaining subproject involves finding good models for algebraic\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n",
