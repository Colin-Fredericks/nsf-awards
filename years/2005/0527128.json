 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing concern with security issues in the world has led to greater interest in improving the technology and methods available for detecting deception.  Under direction from Congress, the NSF and the Office of Science Technology Policy are facilitating a series of six workshops to address current and future research on the science and technology of security evaluations.  This workshop focuses on emerging technologies used in detecting deception.  While the term emerging technologies encompasses a wide range of topics in detecting deception, the specific focus of this workshop will be data-mining and identity management technologies for security evaluations.  Planned topics of discussion include; challenges in combining differently coded databases, the use of credit reports and financial information, use of commercial databases, regional information sharing system (RISS) and the \"Justice Data Dictionary\".  In particular, the workshop will address the integration of automated and manual systems employed in conducting background investigations and security clearance determinations.  Participants will also address the ethical, legal and privacy concerns of current research. The workshop will bring together fifteen leading academic and government experts and practitioners, along with a smaller number of government observers for two days in July, 2005 at the NSF.  Workshop participant will present overviews of cutting edge research and work together to outline a series of research directions.  A final report will be prepared summarizing the presentations and views of the workshop participants.",
