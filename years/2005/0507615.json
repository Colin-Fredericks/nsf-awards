 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies two related but different aspecta of\r\nvortex dynamics in three space dimensions.  The first project\r\nconcerns the global regularity of Euler flows in three dimensions. \r\nThis important outstanding problem of applied analysis is attacked\r\nby the investigator and colleagues with the aim of showing that,\r\nunder appropriate conditions of flow topology, global regularity\r\nis obtained.  In addition an estimate of the time rate of growth\r\nof the maximum vorticity should be accessible.  The approach\r\nutilizes maximization of the growth of vorticity and a variational\r\nconstruction of an artificial structure (the \"cocoon\") near the\r\nvorticity maximum.   The second project concerns analysis together\r\nwith numerical and physical experiments of modes of hovering in\r\nflapping flight.  An oscillating flow facility already in use\r\nprovides the starting point for investigations of the vortical\r\nflow in the vicinity of small flapping hoverers.  The investigator\r\nand the research staff of the CIMS Applied Mathematics Laboratory\r\ndevelop analytical and numerical models for the study of hovering\r\nflight, motivated by the current interest in micro-aerodynamic\r\nvehicles.  \r\n\r\n     The project deals with two related problems involving the\r\ndifficult problem of analysis of three-dimensional fields of fluid\r\nmotion and the complex eddying motions that occur in many\r\nimportant time-dependent flows.  The first problem that the\r\ninvestigator and his colleagues study is the theoretical question\r\nof \"blowup\" of solutions of Euler's equations, wherein the flow\r\ndevelops a rough or singular structure after a finite time. \r\nAlthough much effort has been devoted to trying to find such\r\nbehavior in fluid flows, the question remains open.  The\r\ncontention the investigator explores is that in fact for most\r\nflows, especially those for which the \"knottedness\" of the\r\nvorticity is sufficiently simple, blowup does not occur.  This\r\nregularity property of the flows can be established in some simple\r\ncases, and methods under development by the investigator promise\r\nto be applicable to a larger class, whose size needs to be\r\ndetermined.   The study has important implications for global\r\nanalysis of Euler flows, and perhaps also for the numerical\r\ncomputation of these flows.  The second project is different in\r\nemphasis and brings into play a combination of analysis with\r\nnumerical and physical experiments to study the hovering flight of\r\nsmall flapping flyers of the kind envisioned in the context of\r\nmicro-aerodynamic flight.  This work aims to understand the\r\neddying motions produced by certain kinds of flapping structures,\r\nand the mechanism of lift production in various cases of hovering\r\nflight.  The work has possible applications to the engineering\r\ndesign of extremely small air vehicles, as well as a bearing on\r\nthe understanding of insect flight.",
