 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent years have seen unprecedented deployments of high-speed transport networking technologies, particularly based on advanced, next-generation synchronous optical networks (SONET) and wavelength division multiplexing.  While related carrier provisioning methods for these specific technologies have been well-studied, the emergence of more expansive applications-grid computing, storage networking, virtual private networks-is driving the need for dynamic service provisioning across multiple network domains and granularity layers. This CAREER proposal focuses on research in the area of heterogeneous, high-performance, high-bandwidth, multi-domain networks comprising hundreds of nodes and fielding dynamic connection demands, refereed to as \"Bandwidth-on-Demand\" Services. The key efforts include scalable inter-domain routing, path selection and traffic grooming, service survivability, and high-performance network infrastructure expansion.  Overall, this project is expected to yield fundamental insights into the operation of large-scale, distributed, multi-domain, circuit-switched infrastructures.  As such, it will help accelerating the development of robust next-generation cyber-infrastructure, thereby facilitating the emergence of a wide range of new services and applications.",
