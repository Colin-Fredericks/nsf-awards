 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamics of Postural Control During Precision Manual Activity\r\nMichael Riley (PI) & Kevin Shockley (Co-PI)\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThe control of standing balance is fundamental to other behaviors people \r\nperform, such as the precise hand movements performed by surgeons or \r\nartists.  Since standing upright requires placing the body in an unstable \r\nstate, and because the neuromuscular system is highly complex and \"noisy,\"\r\nthe body's center of mass constantly fluctuates when a person stands \r\n(termed postural sway).  Postural sway is transmitted to the hands and can \r\nthus hinder manual performance (imagine trying to thread a needle while\r\nstanding on one foot).  The purpose of this proposal is to determine how \r\npostural control is modulated when people perform the precision manual \r\naction of lightly touching a surface with a fingertip.\r\nThe research will identify the adaptive postural dynamics associated with \r\nintegrating postural control and precision manual actions.  Experiments are \r\nplanned in which postural stability and the demands of a fingertip \r\nforce-production task are varied. The variability and temporal dynamics of \r\npostural sway are expected to be precisely tuned to the demands of the \r\ntouching task under conditions in which balance is not threatened, but \r\nthreats to postural stability are expected to limit the extent to which \r\npostural control is adapted to the manual task.  The research will shed \r\nlight on fundamental mechanisms of balance control and will also have \r\nimportant applications to physical rehabilitation and efforts to develop \r\nfall-prevention programs.\r\n",
