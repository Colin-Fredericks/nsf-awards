These processes vary with time and space. Effective management\r\nof water resources requires deep understanding of these processes. Due to the lack of data or the\r\ndifficulties in measuring R and BF, however, our current knowledge and understanding of these complex\r\nprocesses are very limited, especially about their temporal and spatial variations. Various assumptions are\r\nmade about spatial variations of R in existing studies and little attention has been given to temporal\r\nvariations of R and BF. While it is difficult to measure R and BF, it is relatively easy to measure the water\r\nlevels in observation wells (h) and runoff in rivers. Extensive groundwater level data sampled at various\r\ntime intervals over periods of years or decades are often available. Fluctuations of the water table in a\r\ngroundwater system are dynamic responses of the system to its recharge and discharge, and thus contain\r\nsignificant amount of information about the recharge and discharge. Our preliminary analyses of the\r\nobserved water levels in seven monitoring wells at the Walnut Creek watershed of Iowa indicate that\r\nfluctuations of the groundwater levels is a temporal fractal whose fractal dimension (D) varies spatially.\r\nBaseflow from this and other four watersheds also behaves as a temporal fractal and, more importantly,\r\nhas a transition time or break in scaling.\r\nOur objectives are: 1) to determine existence of fractal scaling of groundwater level and baseflow and\r\ntheir relationship with recharge; 2) to identify physical causes behind fractal scaling; 3) to study the effects\r\nof aquifers' physical heterogeneity on fluctuations of groundwater level, recharge, and discharge and on\r\ntheir scaling, and 4) to investigate the nature of groundwater recharge process. These objectives will be\r\nreached by testing six hypotheses. These hypotheses will be tested by collecting and analyzing the longterm\r\ngroundwater level measurements in 42 monitoring wells in 6 groundwater regions and the\r\nstreamflow at 58 gauge stations in 11 hydrological units over a period of 50 - 100 years at the USGG\r\nwebsite, and by conducting an integrated hydrologic modeling (IHM), stochastic analyses, and numerical\r\nsimulations. With data mining we will use the extensive data collected by USGS over the years to identify\r\nthe existence of the temporal scaling. With IHM we will be able to assess impacts of temporal and spatial\r\nvariations of P, ET, and ? on fluctuations of h and BF. With stochastic analyses and numerical\r\nsimulations, we will investigate effects of spatial variations of aquifers' physical properties on the\r\ntemporal variations of h and BF and their scaling as well as the nature of R process.\r\nThe intellectual merits. The most important merits of this research are to find the temporal scaling of h\r\nand BF and to provide physical causes behind the scaling. Temporal scaling of h may be pervasive in\r\nmany aquifers as we show in this proposal by the spectra of the longest water level data in 14 USGS wells.\r\nThere may be a simple explanation for the scaling: fluctuations of groundwater levels are due to various\r\ncontributing hydrological variables (e.g., P, ET, and ?) with differing time and/or spatial scales. As a\r\nresult, there is no characteristic time scale in the head fluctuations! We are anxious to do further\r\ninvestigation. Whether processes in the natural world are dependent or independent of the scale at which\r\nthey operate is one of the major issues in hydrologic science . (Sposito, 1998). There has been a significant\r\neffort in searching for scaling in hydrology since an invariance property across scales as a fundamental\r\nshould guide data analysis and modeling methods (NRC, 1991). Significant progresses in searching spatial\r\nscale invariance have been made during the last decade in hydrology. However, less attention was given to\r\ntemporal scaling of subsurface hydrological variables. We have proposed a relatively new direction of\r\nstochastic research, as summarized by the panel on the original proposal, and are trying to make a forward\r\nstep in application of stochastic approaches. The broad impacts include: 1) use of abundant groundwater\r\nlevel and streamflow data in trying to understand the patterns of temporal variations of h and BF make the\r\nmethods and results of the proposed research widely applicable, 2) the proposed research is closely related\r\nto the NSF initiative: Water Cycle Research, 3) the knowledge obtained in this research is needed in longterm\r\nmanagement and planning of water resources and in dealing with climate changes, 4) A current Ph.D.\r\nstudent is working on this topic. Two new students (one graduate and one undergraduate) will participate\r\nin this project if the proposal is funded, 5) Several publications are expected from this research as two\r\npapers have been written (one published and another submitted recently) based on our preliminary results.\r\nFinally, we want to say that addressing the comments made by the reviewers and panel on the original and\r\nsecond-submission of this proposal has greatly improved the proposal.\r\n",
