 "awd_abstract_narration": "In research project, the focus will be on the modeling, characterization and testing of low power, high speed, and anti-radiation capable mixed signal systems for the next generation distributed wireless network applications. The objectives are to: (1) develop a performance evaluation tool that integrates the design of mixed signal systems and higher-layer network protocols for the optimization of distributed wireless network system performance; (2) develop a methodology for computing crosstalk that is targeted for block-level physical design of high-performance, high-speed mixed signal systems; (3) develop an automated wavelet-based real time mixed signal testing algorithms for the efficient production of mixed-signal systems; (4) model the generation and propagation of single event transients in CMOS mixed signal circuits, and (5) determine the radiation sensitivity of CMOS mixed signal circuits\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nA performance evaluation tool that integrates the design of mixed signal systems and higher-layer network protocols for design low power mixed signal systems will be provided. A new distributed network technique that uses the finite element method, for the modeling crosstalk noise in high speed mixed signal systems will be provided. In addition, a novel automated testing technique, based on wavelet transforms, for mixed signal systems will be developed. The models for generation and propagation of single event transients in mixed\r\nsignal circuits will be provided. Furthermore, a wavelet-based technique for characterizing the effects of radiation in mixed signal circuits will be developed. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe proposed project will provide educational training to graduate and undergraduate students through research and hands-on experience. This project will help enhance the Analog Mixed Signal techniques courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The courses will be modified to include technological issues addressed in this project. The proposed project will also provide topics for team of students to work on for their senior design projects and provide a strong tie between Prairie View A&M University and the high-tech industry in the area of mixed signal systems.",
