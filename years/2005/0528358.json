 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometry has become a central notion in algorithm design, in fields\r\nas diverse as bioinformatics and graph partitioning.\r\nThis research is a concerted and unified attack on a large subset of the\r\nunderlying mathematical problems, which often have to do with\r\ngeometric embeddings of finite metric spaces.\r\nThe concrete applications range from clustering and learning to\r\ncompact representation of data to graph partitioning to\r\nnearest neighbor searching. Since the research spans a\r\na variety of fields, the assembled team is multidisciplinary,\r\ninvolving analysts (Johnson and Naor), a geometer (Gromov),\r\na discrete mathematician and combinatorialist (Linial)\r\nand algorithm designers (Arora and Charikar).\r\n\r\nThe research area emerging from the ongoing geometrization of\r\nalgorithms is an exciting new frontier for both mathematics and\r\ncomputer science. For example, deep mathematical results such as\r\nLipschitz extension may turn out to have applications\r\nto the practical problem of compactly representing computer sounds.\r\nIn turn, algorithmic settings provide a fertile new ground for\r\nmathematical theory. The investigators study geometric representations\r\nfor data and low disortion mappings into structured spaces. Metrics that\r\narise in the design of approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems are\r\nstudied, especially to understand their local versus global properties.\r\nThe research develops new understanding for practically\r\nimportant metrics such as earth mover and edit distance\r\nmetrics, which are defined in terms of computational effort and have\r\nthus not been studied in  mathematics.\r\n",
