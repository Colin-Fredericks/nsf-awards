 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe investigator will combine theoretical analysis and applied tools to\r\ndevelop innovative models, methodology, algorithms and data analysis for\r\nfunctional data. A major goal of this proposal is to extend the reach of\r\nfunctional data analysis methods to sparse, noisy and irregularly sampled\r\nlongitudinal data. Functional data and longitudinal data are assumed to be\r\ngenerated by random trajectories that correspond to realizations of an\r\nunderlying stochastic process. These trajectories may be either observable\r\nor hidden. Relevant theory for estimation and inference will be developed.\r\nCurrent functional data analysis approaches and tools require densely\r\nmeasured functions or completely observed functions on a common domain,\r\nand abandoning these assumptions requires new tools. Similarly, extensions\r\nof functional data analysis to situations where one has both longitudinal\r\nand survival time components will lead to new practical statistical\r\nmethods as well as challenging research problems. The development and\r\napplication of new tools for curve warping in cases where a large fraction\r\nof the variability of random curves lies in variation of time scale is\r\nanother challenging problem that will be addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statistical methods that will be developed by the investigator are\r\nmotivated by the need to analyze data that include large samples of gene\r\nexpression profiles, longitudinal studies in medicine and biology with\r\nmultivariate or generalized measurements, and time courses of behavioral\r\nmeasurements, coupled with age-at-death information. It is expected that\r\nthe results of the proposed research will contribute in a significant way\r\nto the analysis and interpretation of such data and will lead to new\r\ninsights into underlying mechanisms of gene regulation, complex dynamic\r\ninteractions in biological systems, and aging and longevity.",
