The Compact for Faculty Diversity (CFD) addresses the serious and chronic problem of the under-representation of minority faculty in institutions of higher learning.  CFD has a proven track record of increasing the number of minorities earning the doctorate and entering faculty positions.  The Institute for Teaching and Mentoring provides an opportunity for NSF Minority Fellows to attend a highly successful forum for learning about teaching and research as a career, networking, sharing information, career positioning, and identifying role models and mentors.  The Institute is being held October 27-30, 2005 in Arlington, Virginia.",
