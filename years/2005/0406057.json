 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to investigate the geometry of several\r\nlarge classes of Poisson structures on Lie groups and their homogeneous\r\nspaces. They include the Belavin-Drinfeld Poisson structures on complex simple\r\nLie groups and their Poisson homogeneous spaces, and Poisson structures on\r\nKac-Moody groups and real simple groups. The project is based on employing novel\r\ntechniques from Lie theory and ring theory which in particular relate\r\nthe above geometric problems to studies of the primitive spectra of universal\r\nenveloping algebras of Lie algebras that are in general neither solvable,\r\nnor semisimple. The principal investigator will work on applications of these\r\nproblems to the study of integrable systems (whose phase spaces are symplectic\r\nleaves of the above Poisson structures) and representations of Hopf algebras,\r\ne.g. algebras of regular functions on non-standard quantum groups constructed\r\nby Etingof-Kazhdan and Etingof-Schedler-Schiffmann by explicit quantizations of\r\nBelavin-Drinfeld r-matrices. He will further address applications to combinatorics:\r\nthe theory of cluster algebras of Fomin and Zelevisky, and intersections of dual\r\nSchubert cells (related to symplectic leaves of special Poisson structures on\r\nflag varieties). The second part of the project concerns applications of the\r\ninfinite dimensional Poisson Lie group of formal pseudo-differential operators to\r\nproblems in the theory of bispectrality of Duistermaat and Grunbaum, e.g. using the\r\ncorresponding dressing action of Semenov-Tian-Shansky to construct subalgebras\r\nof infinitesimal \"additional symmetries\" of the KP hierarchy that preserve manifolds\r\nof bispectral wave functions. The project will further investigate relations\r\nbetween bispectrality and the prolate spheroidal phenomenon of Landau, Pollak, and\r\nSlepian, which first appeared in time-band limiting but consequently played an\r\nimportant role in random matrix theory as well. In particular this proposal targets\r\nintegral operators related to the infinite dimensional class of bispectral algebras\r\nof ranks 1 and 2, all of which posses commuting differential operators, proved\r\nin previous works of the investigator.\r\n\r\nThe major problems in many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics are\r\nrelated to the study of the symmetries (transformation groups) of the\r\nobjects or models, under investigation. Recently generalized symmetries (Hopf\r\nalgebras) have played an increasingly prominent role in many fields. This project\r\ninvestigates geometric structures related to deformations of classical symmetries\r\n(algebraic groups) to generalized symmetries (Hopf algebras) and their applications\r\nto problems in dynamical systems, algebra, combinatorics, and applied mathematics.\r\n",
