 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project from an HBCU, acquiring a parallel and configurable computing framework using conventional PCs equipped with a set of FPGAs, develops application implementations that execute much faster than the best single/parallel PC implementation. Configurable computing systems allow the same hardware to be used for various applications for distinct parallel algorithms. Hence, rather than replacing expensive system hardware, new versions of a hardware architecture can be loaded into the same configurable integrated circuit reducing the system costs. A major goal in developing this system consists in automating the process of mapping algorithms onto a configurable computer in a transparent fashion. Projects using this implementation include:\r\n-Parallel configurable digital signal processing,\r\n-Parallel algorithm development for problems in applied mathematics and the computational sciences,\r\n-Parallel implementation of 3D image reconstruction for PET scanner data,\r\n-Modeling of a configurable digital signal processing subsystem for handheld electronic nose,\r\n-Cubic spline interpolation, and\r\n-Sensor-based supply chains.\r\nEach of these applications will be mapped onto the parallel configurable computing system to perform comparisons with the best single/parallel PC implementation and to make the appropriate optimizations to execute orders of magnitude faster on this parallel configurable computer. Moreover, the infrastructure supports the following research activities:\r\n-Detection of cancerous tumors using 3-D PET image reconstruction,\r\n-Onboard processing for control of spacecraft and other science data processing required by NASA scientists and engineers,\r\n-High performance image processing,\r\n-Odor remediation and assessment, and\r\n-Sensor-based supply chains.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The work exhibits potential to bring serious savings to product tracking through their life cycle. The Auto-ID Center has estimated potential global supply savings between $150 to $300 billion a year. Through RFID deployment, Wal-Mart alone could save $8.36 Billion annually, including $600 million through avoiding stock-outs and $575 million avoiding theft. Furthermore, enabling under-represented students and faculty, this research takes place at a major HBCU with collaboration with other universities and federal agencies.\r\n\r\n",
