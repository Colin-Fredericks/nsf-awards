 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Principal Investigator will perform research in the theory of\r\ndynamical systems, mainly low-dimensional (both smooth and\r\ncontinuous). He will apply analytical, topological and combinatorial\r\ntools in order to investigate real and complex systems. A substantial\r\npart of the project is aimed at providing bridges between real and\r\ncomplex, one- and two-dimensional dynamics. Investigation of a class\r\nof branched coverings of the plane will be continued. Semigroups of\r\naffine maps will be investigated from the point of view of ergodic\r\ntheory. For other systems attractors, periodic orbits, rotation sets\r\nand topological entropy will be in the center of attention.\r\n\r\nFor almost every phenomenon from Physics, Chemistry, Biology,\r\nMedicine, Economy and other sciences one can make a mathematical model\r\nthat can be regarded as a dynamical system. Sometimes the study of\r\nthis system is extremely difficult, but quite often it can be reduced\r\nto the study of a much simpler, low dimensional one. This project is\r\ndevoted mainly to the investigation of the properties of these types\r\nof systems from the mathematical point of view. The results that can\r\nbe obtained are usually much stronger than in the general case and\r\noften lead to much deeper understanding of the original systems.",
