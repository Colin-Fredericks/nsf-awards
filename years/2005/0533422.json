 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a request for Conference support, which does not require external review. The conference is a major international one bringing together the Polymer Societies around the Pacific basin.\r\n\r\nThe PI is requesting funding for a Symposium on Polymeric Biomaterials. The field is indeed one of the most forward-looking and intense areas of research.  It also brings together experts from the physical sciences, engineering, and the biological sciences - and is one of our major priority areas.  Professor Hoffmann is one of the pioneers in that field, and was just elected to the National Academy of Engineering.  The invited speakers are all internationally known researchers who will present the latest developments in this highly interdisciplinary field.\r\n\r\nAs far as broader impacts are concerned, it is evident that exposure of US scientists in this broadly international arena will be highly beneficial in terms of exchange of knowledge and nucleation of new research ideas.\r\n\r\nThe requested $3000 for partial support of the registration fees of US participants is reasonable.  Therefore, because of the superior intellectual merit and broader aspects of this proposal, the Polymers Program is pleased to recommend funding at the requested level.\r\n",
