 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) This project is supporting enhanced student learning in the departments of Geosciences and Engineering Technology and Industrial Studies through the acquisition and instructional use of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) laboratory facility. ICP-MS is used to measure concentrations of chemical elements in minerals, rocks, soils, concrete, and cement at the parts per million and parts per billion levels. The project goal is the adaptation of exemplary multi-disciplinary uses of ICP-MS at other predominantly undergraduate institutions, focused on the emerging field of concrete technology, and on geology curricula and research programs. Curricular impacts on six courses in the two departments, and on 375 concrete industry management and geology majors are resulting in increased student learning, new laboratory experiences, new student research opportunities, and more comprehensive preparation for professional and graduate school careers. The educational impact of the ICP-MS is being assessed by pre- and post-course measures of knowledge of the affected curricula, attitudes and efficacy beliefs about geochemical instrumentation, and intentions to engage in additional research, graduate study and/or professional careers in the affected disciplines. The enhanced opportunities for concrete and geology majors to explore applications of ICP-MS chemical analysis to problem solving are complementing those already afforded by a NSF-funded X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (NSF Award 9950820). The  ICP-MS laboratory facility also is increasing research capabilities for undergraduate majors in other departments, as students from other STEM disciplines are able to use the instrument in their undergraduate research endeavors. A particular Broader Impact of this project lays in cooperative efforts with an active NSF award aimed knowledge transfer  to universities interested in adopting the concrete technology curriculum (NSF Award 0438679), and attracting students in under-represented groups to both the Departments of Geosciences and Engineering Technology and Industrial Studies.",
