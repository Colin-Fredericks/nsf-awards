 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY \r\nThe Skidaway Institute of Oceanography proposes to continue operations of the research vessel Savannah in support of NSF-funded scientific research at sea in the year 2005. The ship works primarily in the coastal area of Georgia. This is a five-year cooperative agreement, and funding for the years 2006-2009 will be renegotiated and will depend on the number of days at sea in support of NSF-funded research programs requiring the use of an Oceanographic platform.\r\n\r\nIntellectual and Technical Merit\r\nThe R/V Savannah is a new 92-foot coastal research vessel, which was delivered from Washburn and Doughty shipbuilders in September 2001. This ship is one of the most capable platforms for conducting oceanographic research and education activities in the continental shelf, estuarine, and riverine environments of the Southeastern U.S. The primary use of the ship to date is supporting federally funded research. The vessel has been used to examine rates of benthic primary production on the West Florida Shelf and\r\nSouth Atlantic Bight, to assess microbial diversity in environments ranging from coastal estuaries to the Gulf Stream, to examine the biogeochemical dynamics within the Long Term Ecosystem Research (LTER) study sites and to develop a regional coastal observing system. In addition, the Savannah has been and will be used for a multibeam survey of the Savannah River. The deck space, a large hydraulic A-frame, which maximizes the cable bend radius necessary to deploy acoustic packages, and generally quiet vessel operations make this vessel ideal for these kinds of projects.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe R/V Savannah is increasing its at-sea educational and outreach activities for 2005 and beyond with greater high school, undergraduate and graduate student participation as well as more opportunities for the public to view the vessel. With a design capacity to sleep 20 scientists plus crew the ship can accommodate a professor and class of students. The NSF-funded CIRE2 program provides opportunities for minority students to experience oceanographic research on board a well-equipped ship with the goal of drawing a greater diversity of researchers into the study of ocean sciences. NSF programs of Taillefert and Sautter will support 18 students going to sea for oceanographic research on each cruise. For many this will be their first experience at sea. Armstrong Atlantic State University students will also be provided at-sea experience as a part of their Introductory Oceanography class. In an effort to inform and educate the public about advances in ocean sciences the R/V Savannah will be open for public tours 8 to 10 times during 2005.\r\n",
