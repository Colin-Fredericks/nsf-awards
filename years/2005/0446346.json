 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\t\t\tE. Macagno, PI\t\tProposal # IOB-0446346\r\n\r\nThis project will address an important question about the development of the nervous system, specifically, what is the role of certain types of interactions among nerve cells in defining how the nervous system is assembled.  Members of the laboratory have identified and are characterizing the group of molecules that are thought to mediate these types of interactions, and will use cutting-edge techniques to affect whether these molecules are present at the right time and place where they are thought to function.  The ideas they will test relate to the formation of specific patterns of connections that are critical for proper function of neuronal circuits  The neuroscientists will use a very simple nervous system to answer these questions, that of the medicinal leech.  In this animal, nerve cells are large and easily identified, which greatly facilitates these experiments.  Since the same types of molecules are thought to exist in and affect how human nerve cells interact as they develop, the findings expected from this research project with non-human tissues will have a strong impact on our understanding of the normal assembly of the both invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems.  \r\n\t\r\nThe proposed research will serve as an excellent training experience for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers.  The leech embryo and nervous system are easy for beginners to master and the laboratory will provide training in biology at various levels, including molecular biology, cellular biology, and physiology.  UC San Diego serves a diverse student population, from which researchers will be recruited.  \r\n",
