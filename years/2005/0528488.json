 "awd_abstract_narration": "Markov random fields (MRFs) provide a very general framework for\r\ncapturing conditional independence in large collections of random\r\nvariables.  The proposal is concerned with the spatial properties of\r\nMRFs, and with two widely used algorithmic paradigms for solving\r\ninference problems in them: Belief Propagation (BP) and Gibbs Sampling\r\n(GS).  Though widely used, these algorithms (especially BP) lack\r\nrigorous performance guarantees in most situations.  One major goal of\r\nthe proposed research is a deeper understanding of the behavior of BP\r\nand GS for different classes of MRFs that arise in applications.  A\r\ncentral thesis is that the performance of these algorithms is\r\nintimately tied to the spatial structure of the underlying MRF.  By\r\nmaking this connection precise the project aims at an improved\r\nunderstanding of the algorithms and their relationship to one another.\r\nBased on this insight, a second major goal of the project is to\r\ninvestigate systematic methods for designing MRFs tailored to a\r\nspecific application; the MRFs should have suitable spatial properties\r\nso that algorithms like BP or GS (or variants thereof) are both\r\nsuccessful in practice and provably effective.\r\n\r\nMarkov random fields are a rich class of mathematical models that are\r\nextremely well suited to capturing the behavior of large systems of\r\nindependent components whose interactions are best described in\r\nstatistical terms (rather than in terms of deterministic laws).  Such\r\nsystems are ubiquitous in today's world.  As a first example, consider\r\nthe millions of computers on the internet: the communication time\r\nbetween your computer and a given website is not a fixed quantity, but\r\nvaries depending on the number of other users, the time of day etc.  A\r\nsecond example is the problem of modeling and predicting global\r\nclimate, which depends on a very large number of factors that interact\r\nin statistically variable ways.  Modeling such applications with\r\nMarkov random fields leads to a number of computational problems\r\nthat---due to their extremely large size---are essentially impossible\r\nto solve exactly.  The primary goal of this research project is the\r\ndevelopment and analysis of efficient algorithmic methods for\r\nobtaining approximate solutions, with rigorous guarantees on accuracy\r\nand running time.  In light of the broad range of scientific and\r\nengineering contexts in which Markov random fields are used, basic\r\nresearch on these algorithms has the potential for very broad impact\r\nin many domains, including modern-day computing and communications\r\ninfrastructure, intelligent systems for medical diagnosis, and the\r\nmodeling of complex physical and biological systems.\r\n",
