 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe dissertation research described in this proposal explores the intersection of labor \r\neconomics and urban/regional economics.  The work is motivated by two key \r\nobservations: (1) Theoretical work in urban economics provides good reasons to expect \r\nprice variation across locations, and empirical evidence verifies that this variation is \r\nsubstantial.  (2) Standard economic models of labor market behavior, such as human \r\ncapital investment, labor supply, or discrimination, are derived under the assumption \r\n(implicit or explicit) that individuals face the same prices.  More importantly, empirical \r\nwork based on these models nearly always uses data from national data sources, but \r\nignore the fact the individuals live and work in local labor markets and thus face different \r\nlocal prices. \r\n \r\nThe researcher proposes to revisit standard theories of the returns to education, labor \r\nsupply, and racial discrimination in models that recognize that people live in different \r\nlocations and thus face different prices.  She then intends to evaluate the likely empirical \r\nimportance of these theoretical insights.  The empirical work will entail evaluations of \r\nlocal labor markets, and thus will require the use of very large data sets.  The researcher \r\nis requested funding from the National Science Foundation to support her use of the \r\nlong-form files of the U.S. Census at the Michigan Research Data Center. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit \r\n \r\nPreliminary theoretical work, presented in this proposal, shows how local price variation \r\nis likely to affect important objects of study in labor economics, including the return to \r\neducation and labor force participation.  Preliminary empirical work demonstrates that \r\nthere are indeed very large differences in the measured returns to education across cities \r\nin the U.S., and also substantial systematic differences in female labor supply.  It is quite \r\npossible that if researchers ignore this variation, resulting empirical work will lead to \r\nserious misunderstandings.  There appears to be little literature on this issue. \r\n  \r\nBroader Impacts \r\n \r\nEmpirical labor economics is an important enterprise, providing key inputs to policy \r\nanalysis on such important issues as the impact of income taxes, the advisability of \r\nsubsidizing education, and the analysis of welfare policy.  The research outlined in this \r\nproposal holds promise of improving our ability to conduct this valuable research. \r\n",
