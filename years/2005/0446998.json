 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in language comprehension have shown that readers interpret sentences word by word, rapidly integrating the meaning of each new word with the preceding context. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Shelia Kennison will investigate the factors influencing how quickly skilled readers can integrate the meaning of individuals words within sentences. The research will test the hypothesis that semantic integration is carried out more rapidly for some words than for others. In the research, participants will read sentences while their eye movements are recorded.  Eye movement recording is the most precise technique for measuring the processing difficulty experienced during reading. With this methodology, it is possible to measure the initial processing of a word separately from any reprocessing that may occur. The research will identify the characteristics of words that are associated with early (versus late) semantic integration.  \r\n\r\nThe research is important because it will broaden our knowledge of how readers coordinate multiple sources of information during comprehension, including syntactic, lexical, and semantic sources of information. The research will also add to our knowledge of the complex cognitive processing involved in perception, memory, and language. The broader impacts of the research include applications to the field of language disorders.  By understanding how skilled, unimpaired readers integrate the meanings of words in sentences, researchers will be better able to identify individuals who carry out semantic processing abnormally. The research may also lead to a better understanding of the different ways language processing can be impaired and may contribute to the development of interventions designed to help impaired individuals increase their reading proficiency.\r\n",
