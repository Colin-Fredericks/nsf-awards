 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is devoted to investigating various facets of interplay\r\nbetween geometry, number theory and combinatorics. The first part concerns \r\nthe theory of geometric graphs and is motivated by the following question \r\nthat remains open for several decades: \"Does every planar drawing of a graph \r\non n vertices and 1000n edges with straight line segments contain four \r\npairwise crossing edges?\" The PI plans to establish the existence of this \r\nand other crossing patterns in drawings of graphs with sufficiently many \r\nedges. Problems of finding good lower bounds on the minimal number of \r\ncrossings over all drawings of a fixed graph, as well as the existing \r\nconnections with algorithmic questions in computational geometry, will also \r\nbe studied. A related investigator's goal is to apply Szemeredi's regularity \r\nlemma in combination with certain tools from real algebraic geometry and \r\ntopology to prove the existence of large, complete or empty, bipartite \r\nsubgraphs in the intersection graphs of segments, curves, or, in general, \r\nsemi-algebraic sets. Another proposed direction of research is Euclidean \r\nRamsey theory. Questions of the type: \"Does any sufficiently large set of \r\npoints in the plane, no three on a line, contain six points forming a convex \r\nhexagon with no other point inside?\", or \"Can one color points of the plane \r\nwith six colors so that no two points, unit distance apart, receive the same \r\ncolor?\", are questions posed many years ago by Erdos and other \r\npioneers of the field, and despite all the efforts are still open. The author \r\ndevises and plans to exploit novel perspectives on these problems, while \r\nintroducing certain machinery from matroid and polytope theory, and \r\ncommutative algebra. \r\n\r\nThe main theme of this proposal is to further explore the beauty of Ramsey \r\ntheory and combinatorial geometry, especially natural and intuitive questions\r\nthat can be easily described in lay terms, but difficult to solve. Fascinating\r\nproblems of Erdos-type continue to be a fertile ground for interactions of \r\nvarious areas of mathematics and provide a theoretical foundation for \r\ncombinatorial optimization, VLSI design, robotics, pattern recognition, \r\ntomography and computer graphics. Furthermore, an important aspect of this \r\nproposal is its educational component. Working with an undergraduate \r\nstudent, the investigator initiates a new discipline of Ramsey theory on \r\nintegers, where one is interested in the existence of rainbow arithmetic \r\nstructures. Questions considered are of the form: \"Does every 3-coloring \r\nof integers from 1 to 3n, with exactly n red, n blue and n green integers, \r\ncontain a rainbow 3-term arithmetic progression?\" The proposed problems are \r\nrainbow analogues of classical van der Waerden-type results in Ramsey theory, \r\nand are well suited for undergraduate research projects. Finally, the PI and \r\nhis mentee discover and inspect a striking dependency of the degree of \r\nregularity of certain linear equations on the axioms of set theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
