 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns the geometry of algebraic curves, both in the \r\nabstract and in projective space. Over the last few decades, we have \r\nlearned a great deal about how abstract curves may be embedded in \r\nprojective space; in particular, we know when a general curve of given \r\ngenus can be embedded in projective space as a curve of given degree. \r\nBut we still don't know as much about the geometry of the embedded \r\ncurves: what sort of equations define them, and what degrees and genera \r\noccur. These questions are intriguing, and have many potential \r\napplications. For example, understanding the polynomials that define \r\nthe embedded curves -- in particular, resolving the Maximal Rank \r\nConjecture -- will have consequences in turn for the geometry of moduli \r\nspaces of abstract curves.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic curves have been the object of study for more than 300 years. \r\nIn some sense, the subject started when mathematicians first moved from \r\nstudying polynomial equations in one variable -- which have just a \r\nfinite number of solutions -- to equations in two variables, whose \r\nsolutions form a curve. The study of these geometric objects has been \r\nthe main source of our understanding of the algebra of polynomial \r\nequations. It has led to many advances in mathematics, both in \r\nalgebraic geometry and many other areas of mathematics, such as \r\ntopology, number theory, complex analysis and mathematical physics.\r\n",
