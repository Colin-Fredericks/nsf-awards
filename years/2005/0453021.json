 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU in Cell Biology and Neuroscience at Montana State University (MSU) is a 10-week summer research program for students with an interest in biological science research. Students will learn the joys and challenges of scientific research by working on projects in cell development, cell biology or neurobiology. The program consists of an initial 2-week hands-on lab session that will teach participants important biological research techniques. For the remaining 8 weeks, students will use these newly learned skills by working in the lab of a faculty member on a research project. Students will have the opportunity to make a poster of their work and present their research at a campus summer student symposium at the end of the program. During the 10 weeks, students will participate in workshops on the methodology of scientific research, the ethics of doing science, and the importance of science in society and presentations about science career options. The program is aimed particularly at students who have an interest in science but who have little or no research experience. Minority, first-generation college students and students who attended high schools in rural areas are especially encouraged to apply. MSU is located in Bozeman, MT, a Rocky Mountain resort town about 80 miles north of Yellowstone National Park with easy access to spectacular outdoor recreational activities. Over 200 students participate in various undergraduate research programs on the MSU campus each summer, making MSU an invigorating environment for both recreation and intellectual growth.
