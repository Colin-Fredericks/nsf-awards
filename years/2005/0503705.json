 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses electron transport properties of self-assembled epitaxial silicide nanowires (NWs) on silicon; these NWs are single-crystal metallic structures with nominal dimensions 1 x 10 x 1000 nm. They have a host of potential applications including: low resistance interconnects; nano-electrodes for attachment of functional elements, including molecules; chemical and biological sensors; and novel electronic devices, such as Y-branch switches or tunneling transistors. Scientific goals are to:  1. Develop a technique for UHV insitu electrical measurement of individual NWs using STM. 2. Understand and control boundary scattering in NWs, with various surface treatments for passivation and/or burial. 3. Measure and model current-voltage behavior of nanoscale Schottky barriers. 4. Characterize transport across NW gaps that provide a basis for three-terminal devices. \r\n%%% \r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. This project is expected to extend understanding of transport in silicides on silicon, in particular, and in self-assembled epitaxial nanostructures in general. Demonstration of self-assembled metallic interconnects and nano-electrodes in a silicon-based platform may provide fundamental enabling technology with a variety of research and technological applications. Experimental tools are available to allow atomic level observation of elementary surface processes which when better understood allow advances in fundamental science and technology. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. \r\n*** \r\n",
