 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to further support the efforts of the PI ro mentor faculty by hosting\r\nthree workshops/mini summits in conjunction with the Center for the Advancement of\r\nScholarship on Engineering Education (CASEE ). The first would bring together selected\r\nAfrican-American faculty at research universities in the summer of 2005 at the National\r\nAcademy of Engineering (NAE). The second workshop will convene a diverse group of faculty\r\nat research universities in the summer of 2005. The third workshop will bring together\r\nselected Hispanic American faculty at research universities in the fall of 2005. The\r\nintent of these workshops is to develop an action plan in support of Dr. Grant's\r\nconception of the Promoting Under Represented Presence On Science and Engineering faculty\r\n(PURPOSE) Institute. In essence, this grant will actively develop, with the input of\r\nsuccessful faculty a peer mentoring infrastructure for underrepresented engineering\r\nfaculty.\r\nKey aspects of this initiative will include:\r\n(1)Identification of obstacles to the recruitment and retention of minority engineering\r\nfaculty.\r\n(2)Identification of critical needs for an interdisciplinary, multicultural faculty peer\r\nmentoring network\r\n(3)Building effective faculty networks and initiating the creation of a roadmap for\r\ninstitutional change.\r\nThe results of the workshops will be presented at professional meetings and made available\r\non web. The outcomes will also be disseminated to Engineering Deans at the ASEE meeting\r\nin 2006 and 2007.\r\n",
