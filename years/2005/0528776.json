 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis brief proposal requests modest funds to help support the participation of\r\nUS-based graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the 9th International\r\nWorkshop on Numerical Modeling of Mantle Convection and Lithospheric Dynamics\r\n(henceforth IWNMC2005), to be held September 8-14, 2005, in Erice,\r\nSicily at the Ettore Majorana Center for Scientific Culture. The workshop is to\r\ntake place as the 25th Course of the International School of Geophysics.\r\nThe IWNMC2005 is the most recent in an established and highly successful\r\nseries of international meetings on mantle convection and lithospheric dynamics.\r\nPrevious meetings in the series were held in 1989 (La Londe les Maures, France),\r\n1991 (Weilburg/Lahn, Germany), 1993 (Oleron, France), 1995 (Vlieland, Netherlands),\r\nand 1997 (Naurod, Germany), 2001 (Aussois, France), and, lastly, 2003\r\n(Hruba Skala, Czech Republic). The organizing committee for IWNMC2001 includes\r\nDavid Bercovici (Yale University), Thorsten Becker (University of Southern\r\nCalifornia), Cinzia Farnetani (IPG Paris), Carlo Giunchi (INGV Roma), and\r\nGiorgio Spada (University of Urbino). The program for the workshop has been\r\ncompleted, and information for participants can be found through the website at\r\nhttp://www.ingv.it/erice2005.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Mantle and lithospheric dynamics is perhaps one of the most\r\nfundamental and global of the geophysical sciences since it studies the basic engine\r\nthat controls the geological behavior of the Earth and terrestrial planets, not\r\nonly in terms of their thermal and chemical evolution, but also with regard to ongoing\r\ntectonics and volcanism. The International Mantle ConvectionWorkshop is\r\nthe longest running series of conferences on this science in existence and has for\r\nthe past two decades provided an unprecedented means for scientists and students\r\nfrom around the world to gather in unique and intimate surroundings, to discuss\r\nthe state of the art of our science, and to argue about the problems that remain to\r\nbe solved. Moreover, the workshop provides students and young researchers with\r\ninternational exposure as well as technical training through lectures and tutorials\r\nfrom some of the world's experts. The benefit to US students and junior scientists\r\nwill also be long-lasting as they meet new colleagues from around the world, and\r\nform new collaborations that will inspire the next important discoveries.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The essential impact of this workshop and the requested funding\r\nis the benefit it brings to junior scientists and students by furthering their intellectual\r\nand professional growth, and by expanding their interaction with schools\r\nof thought from other countries. Moreover, the contact that we make with our\r\nover-seas colleagues facilitates our ability to recruit future excellent students and\r\npostdoctoral scholars from around the world.\r\n",
