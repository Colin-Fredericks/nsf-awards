 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop biocidal nanoparticle additives for thermoplastics, in particular, poly (vinyl chloride). Biocides can now be added as a component during the plastic manufacturing process to make it inherently resistant to microbial attack. PVC is a widely used plastic that requires antimicrobial protection. PVC is often used near water (swimming pool liners and shower curtains) or in areas where sterile or clean surfaces are critical (flooring for hospitals or kitchens and bathrooms). PVC is currently protected from microbial attack by arsenic compounds or organic biocides that slowly migrate out of the protected material. Arsenic-based biocides are being phased out, and the migratory loss of the biocide ultimately renders the PVC unprotected from microbial growth. The team will increase the permanence of biocides by adding biocide-functionalized nanoparticles to PVC. The nanoparticle-based biocides would not migrate out of the thermoplastics, thereby prolonging the lifetime of the PVC. We will start by examining several active organic biocides that have been approved and regulated as biocides for thermoplastics. Our plan is to develop non-arsenic, non-migratory biocides for PVC.\r\n\r\nCommercially PVC is the second largest volume polymer produced worldwide, and many of its applications require antimicrobial protection. Specifically, the antimicrobial additives in vinyl flooring improve sanitation in the room and prevent mold growth underneath the flooring that could sicken its occupants and result in debonding of the floor. Mold growth under vinyl floors is a problem because these areas are dark, have little or no water vapor circulation, and contain adhesives that are a food source for the mold. Biocides and vinyl flooring are both large markets, and replacements for currently used arsenic biocides that remained  imbedded within a plastic (and therefore active for longer periods) would be welcomed by both consumers and manufacturers.\r\n",
