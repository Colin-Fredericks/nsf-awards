 "awd_abstract_narration": "Addressing Student Conceptions of Plate Tectonics Using Physical Models\r\n\r\nPlate tectonics is a guiding paradigm taught in nearly every college-level introductory geology course in the nation.  It is important for students to understand plate tectonics because 1) it influences how non-science majors view processes that shape the world in which they live; and 2) it lays the foundation for geology majors to continue their study of the Earth.  Pictorial models from textbooks are generally used to teach plate tectonics because the processes embodied therein are largely abstract and cannot be directly observed in their entirety.  Yet, constructivists argue that models should be built rather than described.  This project addresses two issues that arise when teaching plate tectonics: 1) students do not have experience building or understanding models; and 2) students bring naive preconceptions to the classroom that interfere with their science learning.  \r\nIn this project, student preconceptions related to the Earth are systematically addressed as students work in groups to create physical models that simulate various aspects of Earth structure, seafloor spreading, plate-boundary interactions, earthquakes, and magma viscosity.  As students compare, contrast, and revise their simple physical models, they are being be taught how to create advanced mental models of the processes involved in plate tectonics.  This approach has been used to address science preconceptions that hinder learning of chemistry, physics and biology.  It is being studied here to see if physical model building facilitates learning of the content, relationships, and processes of plate tectonics.  This project is also determining the extent to which physical model building overcomes preconceptions and promotes development of appropriate advanced mental models in students.  The learning process is being evaluated formatively (during model building) and summatively (after model building) using concept map development, responses to conceptual questions, interviews, and through student self-assessment and reflections on their model building activities. These evaluations are expected to expand the database of known preconceptions that hinder learning of plate tectonics, to determine the efficacy of having students construct physical models in large classroom settings, and to document those modeling activities that facilitate learning of plate tectonics. \r\n",
