 "awd_abstract_narration": "When species are introduced into a new range, their populations can grow quite vast, so that they displace native species.  The mechanisms underlying such biological invasions are just beginning to be untangled.  One hypothesis is that hybridization between unique species that are united in the new range facilitates biological invasion.  This grant focuses on evaluating the role of hybridization in the invasion of two ecologically and economically devastating noxious weeds.  The goals of the project are to (1) develop molecular markers to identify hybrid individuals, (2) use these markers to evaluate the frequency of hybridization in natural populations, and (3) document the vigor of hybrid individuals relative to the parental species.\r\n\r\nWhile invasive species often are of hybrid origin, the link between hybridization and the ability to invade is tenuous, leaving a fundamental gap in our understanding. Filling this gap will lead towards viable management solutions.  For example, we need to know whether hybrids should be targeted for immediate control or whether managers should focus their limited time and money elsewhere.  This project promotes diversity in science through training female graduate and undergraduate students.  Additionally, it links basic scientists with applied problems and land managers.  Land managers across the US will contribute field sites to the project, and in return will gain first-hand knowledge of the findings and their management implications.  \r\n",
