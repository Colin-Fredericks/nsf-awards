 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project establishes an interdisciplinary program for training undergraduates in biology and mathematics at Jackson State University (JSU).  The project will target mathematics and biology students who are interested in the application of mathematics to biology.  Students will be selected to take courses designed to strengthen the mathematical knowledge and skills of biology majors, and increase the ability of mathematics majors to use their quantitative skills to solve biological problems.   They will also participate in a five-week summer intensive course in fisheries stock assessment at JSU, followed by a six-to-eight week internship at a NOAA/NMFS laboratory where they will collaborate on fisheries science projects.  Finally, students will take part in collaborative research work at JSU during the academic year for a minimum of two years under the supervision of faculty teams from biology and mathematics departments. This interdisciplinary training of students will focus on population biology, particularly fish stock assessment. However, students will also have opportunities to conduct research in other areas of biology, and through coursework will acquire knowledge necessary for entry into quantitative aspects of other fields such as genomic science, epidemiology and physiology.  The field of fisheries biology is inherently tied to the mathematical sciences.  In fact, fisheries biology is literally the practice of applying mathematics and mathematical modeling to the biology and structure of aquatic populations.  The proposed project will expand the Fisheries Stock Assessment program developed and run at JSU for the past three years, and use it as a model for introducing students with backgrounds in mathematics and/or biology to the application of mathematical models in fisheries science.  There is currently a critical shortage of fisheries stock assessment specialists in the United States.  Hence, there is a great need to recruit and train students in fish population dynamics/stock assessment to meet the staff needs of the NOAA/NMFS, state agencies, universities, consulting firms and international aid agencies, in this area, in order to more effectively manage our fisheries resources.        \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This program will integrate teaching and research amongst faculty and students from the biological and mathematical sciences.  It focuses on population biology, particularly fishery biology's inherent connection between these two branches of science.  Our program has proven successful in recruiting students into the field of fisheries science.  Five previous participants are currently pursuing graduate studies in quantitative aspects of fisheries science.  This program provides students with an understanding of the world's demand for, and dependence on living marine resources and provides them the necessary background and techniques to assess vital rates in aquatic populations and conduct fisheries stock assessment methods.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Eight undergraduates from JSU will participate in an integrated classroom and research-based curriculum in biology and mathematics.  They will also take part in the JSU's fisheries stock assessment course offered during the summer as well as carry out research projects in population biology at NOAA/NMFS Laboratories.  In addition to the shortage of fisheries stock assessment specialists in the U.S., there is an enormous under-representation of minorities in this field.  The experience students gain in this program will help prepare them for graduate programs and careers in population biology in general and fisheries biology in particular, and help answer the call for more qualified fisheries stock assessment personnel.  At the university level, the interdisciplinary program in biology and mathematics will enhance collaborations between biology and mathematics departments.  It will also result in the development of a concentration in quantitative biology within the department of Biology, and help stimulate interests of many mathematics majors in the area of biomathematics.  The findings of the project will be disseminated via conferences and on the JSU website.\r\n",
