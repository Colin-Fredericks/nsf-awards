 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs propose to develop a Lagrangian Bio-acoustic Drifter system to remotely sense zooplankton in the upper ocean (100 m) and to provide real-time data via satellite telemetry. The PIs hope to integrate this technology into the Global Drifter Program - a global array of approximately 1000 drifters now operated jointly by NOAA and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. This system represents the novel convergence of three mature technologies: high-frequency bioacoustics; Lagrangian drifters; and wireless telemetry together comprise a cost-effective instrument for zooplankton remote sensing. The advance in technology proposed is a wide-band probe that sequentially samples multiple frequencies. Such a probe has been successfully developed for very high frequencies, but is costly and has limited range (<5m). The probe proposed here uses precisely the same acoustic principles, has a much greater range (100 m), and lower cost. Funding of this SGER proposal will provide the proof-of-concept demonstration needed before integrating them into the drifter package. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThis project will collaborate with the .Hawaii Kumu Ola: Source of Knowledge Program at UH, an NSF-funded project (J Vergun, PI) aimed at increasing the number of underrepresented undergraduates (e.g. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders) who earn degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This project will provide one internship to a qualified student who will participate fully in all aspects of the project. On a national and international level, the collaboration with the Global Drifter Center establishes a clear path for integrating new data products into an existing network and facility that serves oceanographic research on a global scale. \r\n",
