 "awd_abstract_narration": "A complex reflection group is a finite group of transformations of a\r\ncomplex vector space that is generated by reflections (i.e.,\r\nfinite-order transformations that fix some hyperplane pointwise).\r\nRecent work by a number of people has revealed surprising parallels\r\nbetween these groups and real reflection groups, or even Weyl groups:\r\nspecifically, they give rise to a number of representation theoretic\r\nobjects, such as Hecke algebras and generic degrees, even though there\r\nis no algebraic group in the background whose representation theory is\r\nbeing described.  Broue and others have conjectured the existence of\r\nmysterious, unknown objects called \"spetses\" as the source of these\r\nphenomena.  The aim of this project is to extend this view: one\r\nspecific goal is to construct an analogue of the Springer\r\ncorrespondence for complex reflection groups.  Our techniques ought to\r\nyield uniform accounts of certain structures coming from Hecke\r\nalgebras of complex reflection groups, and perhaps point the way to\r\ndeveloping a general framework in which to study these groups, in the\r\nspirit of Coxeter theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nA square matrix is called a reflection matrix if (a) some power of it\r\nis the identity matrix, and (b) all but one of its eigenvalues is 1.\r\nA reflection group is a finite group of matrices in which every\r\nelement can be written as a product of reflection matrices that are\r\nalso in the group.  Reflection groups of real-valued matrices, first\r\nstudied in depth by Coxeter in the 1930's, have long played a vital\r\nrole in many areas of mathematics: perhaps most importantly, the\r\nstructure and representations of a large class of Lie groups are\r\nclosely governed by certain real reflection groups (the so-called Weyl\r\ngroups).  Reflection groups of complex-valued matrices, in contrast,\r\nare much less well-studied, but recent work by a number of people has\r\nshown that they exhibit a number of disparate and surprising parallels\r\nwith real reflection groups, or even with Weyl groups.  In this\r\nproject, we propose to further develop the analogy with real\r\nreflection groups, specifically by studying the structure of certain\r\nrelated objects called Hecke algebras.  In the process, we hope the\r\npoint the way to a uniform explanation for these phenomena, and\r\nperhaps to a structure theory for the complex reflection groups\r\nthemselves.\r\n",
