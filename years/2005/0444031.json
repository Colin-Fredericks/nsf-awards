 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tCrop yield is one of the most if not the most important measurement of the productivity of US agriculture. Intensive and impressive breeding efforts and improvements in cultural practices have laid the cornerstone for a history of dramatic yield increases in crops of major importance in this country as well as the rest of the world.  \r\n\tTo aid in continued yield increases, a biochemical/genetic/molecular approach has been taken that focuses on increasing the amount of the major component of the seed,   starch.  This approach focuses on ways to increase the speed of the slowest step in the synthesis of starch, the enzyme adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP).  Past efforts have produced changes in the enzyme that gave rise to increased yield in crops of worldwide importance.  Funds from this grant application will be used to isolate additional changes that should produce even greater increases in plant yield.  These changes will be placed into corn and resulting increases in yield will be measured. Goals of this program also include educational activities of the public concerning genetically modified foods.  Specifically, these involve public lectures, interactions with a particular high school in Florida as well as interactions with undergraduate students on this campus.  \r\n\tEnhanced plant yield is important in this country since the number of people is increasing while the amount of land available for plant agriculture is decreasing.  Worldwide, enhanced plant yield is critical for people presently not having enough food.  The work to be performed should produce real tools for alleviating this present and future food shortage. It should also alleviate some of the concerns of the general public concerning GMO foods. \r\n",
