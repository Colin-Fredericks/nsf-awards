 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nScanlon's work integrates arithmetic, geometry and logic via a\r\nmodel-theoretic study of natural mathematical structures.  Specifically,\r\nScanlon investigates the theory of compact complex analytic manifolds from\r\na model theoretic point of view and extends this research to related\r\ngeometric objects.  In developing the theory of jets of differential\r\nequations, Scanlon hopes to discern the fine structure of dependence on\r\nsolution sets to partial differential equations of infinite differential\r\ndimension and to present a unified treatment of differential Galois theory\r\nfor such equations.  Scanlon plans to refine the study of enriched valued\r\nfields and to draw out the Diophantine consequences of these results.\r\nScanlon works, as well, on purely logical issues and will continue\r\ndeveloping the theory of thorn-independence with an eye towards eventual\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScanlon's work integrates arithmetic, geometry and logic.  Definable sets,\r\nnamely those sets definable within a fixed formal language, are principal\r\nobjects of study in model theory and this special emphasis has been\r\ninstrumental in the success of the model-theoretic approaches to number\r\ntheory, algebra and analytic geometry.  Scanlon works to tighten the\r\nconnection between logical and geometric methods and to find mathematical\r\ninterpretations of theorems in logic.\r\n",
