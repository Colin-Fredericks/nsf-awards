 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator focuses on a mathematical issue in the\r\ndescription of nanocrystal growth: how to properly resolve the\r\nill-posedness inherent in dynamic models involving crystalline\r\nsurfaces with strong anisotropy.  Strong anisotropy in the surface\r\nenergy manifests itself physically in the formation of corners on\r\na crystal.  Traditional mathematical models applied to the\r\nformation of corners are mathematically ill-posed and thus\r\nintractable.  Because the formation of corners during crystal\r\ngrowth is ubiquitous, the ill-posedness of corner formation is a\r\nproblem inherent in simulations of both industrial and naturally\r\noccurring crystal growth.  Moreover, it is of critical importance\r\nto modeling crystal growth of nanoscale materials because of the\r\ndominant role of surface effects at small length scales.  The\r\ninvestigator characterizes and evaluates different methods\r\nproposed to remove or regularize the ill-posedness.  A widely\r\nemployed regularization is a singular perturbation.  A significant\r\nmathematical challenge is to characterize the behavior of the\r\nsingularly perturbed corner.  The investigator studies separately\r\nthe role of the regularization in three dimensions and its effect\r\nin the presence of elastic stress.  Another important scientific\r\nissue is to determine which of many regularization procedures is\r\ntrue to the atomic-scale behavior of different materials.  The\r\ninvestigator also considers this question by studying the dynamic\r\nbehavior of regularizations in relation to experimental\r\nobservations and the relation of regularizations to atomic-scale\r\nmodels.  Overall, the project has the potential for significant\r\nimpact on the understanding of a key mathematical issue regarding\r\nregularization of ill-posedness in a classic moving boundary\r\nproblem, and the impact of the work in a broader scientific\r\ncontext is that it contributes to the understanding of how to\r\nmodel the growth of crystalline solids in materials science. \r\n\r\n     In the growth of crystals for nanotechnology and other\r\nmaterials applications, the formation of structures with corners\r\n(as on a grain of salt) is a natural occurrence.  The physical\r\neffects responsible for the existence of a corner are well\r\nunderstood and a mathematical description of an existing corner\r\ncan be accomplished with a classical mathematical model.  However,\r\nthe classical model is incapable of describing the actual dynamics\r\nof corner formation.  This problem is present in all mathematical\r\nsimulations of crystal growth in which corners form.  Moreover, it\r\nis of magnified importance in the simulation of the growth of\r\nnanoscale structures:  when the crystal decreases in size, corners\r\nbecome an increasingly dominant part of the overall structure. \r\nThus, to correctly describe the growth of nanostructured\r\nmaterials, it is essential to have a correct model for corner\r\nformation.  To obtain tractable models for corner formation,\r\ndifferent \"regularization\" ideas have been proposed to make the\r\nmathematical problem of corner formation solvable, but there are\r\nmany different approaches and no universally accepted procedure. \r\nOne aspect of this project is a critical comparison of the\r\ndifferent regularization approaches and how they behave in\r\nrelation to actual material systems.  A second aspect of the work\r\nrelates to the fact that some of these models are \"singular\r\nperturbations,\" which means that the results obtained when the\r\nregularization effect approaches zero can be different than if the\r\nregularization is not present at all.  This type of unexpected\r\nbehavior can mean that a small regularization that is added to\r\nallow for corner formation might give a different corner shape in\r\nsimulations than should be present from the accepted classical\r\nmodel.  Thus, understanding such singular perturbation behavior is\r\nan important part of validating such regularization methods to\r\nensure that they give the correct overall behavior when used in\r\nlarge-scale crystal growth simulations.  Taken as a whole, the\r\nproject has the potential for significant impact as a building\r\nblock in our ability to simulate the fabrication of nanomaterials,\r\nand by extension could contribute to the creation of\r\npurpose-specific materials, especially those with nanoscale\r\nfeatures, in electronics and other applications.  In addition, the\r\nproject involves the training of a graduate student and includes\r\ntwo undergraduate students, for whom the experience may serve as\r\nstimulus to pursue graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences.",
