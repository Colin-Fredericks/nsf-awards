 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discipline: Biological Sciences (61)\r\n\r\nBased on such proven approaches as Shoestring Biology (NSF:DUE/ATE #9553720) and the principles found in NRC Standards and the BCI (Biology Concepts Inventory1), Bio(k)Now! is improving students understanding of key biological processes. Five courses (Bio 110, Bio 111, Bio 112, Bio 130, Bio 150) are directly affected and project resources are being utilized in other classes as well (chemistry, forensic chemistry, microbiology).  A number of broader impacts are anticipated as this project serves a unique population of students and should help prepare them for jobs in the area or to enter a four-year college well prepared to complete their studies. The average age of students entering this college is thirty and a majority are attending college for job related retraining. Seventy-three percent (73%) are first generation college students and 77% qualify for need-based financial assistance. Experiments are designed to address two key concepts: 1) the impact of biotechnology on society and 2) the importance of monitoring environmental conditions in order to utilize them as resources without damaging the quality of those resources.",
