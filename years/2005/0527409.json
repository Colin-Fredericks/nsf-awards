 "awd_abstract_narration": "The West Virginia Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (WV EPSCoR) seeks to assess its research and education infrastructure and develop a strategic plan to increase the State's research and development (R&D) capacity through the successful submission of a Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) proposal in the next EPSCoR competition.  Specifically, the proposed project, Research Strategies in Science, Engineering and Technology Planning (ReSSET), will enable the State to conduct a comprehensive analysis to:  \r\n\r\n1. evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the WV science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) enterprise;\r\n\r\n2.  address deficiencies identified by the NSF panel review and senior personnel;\r\n\r\n3.  identify barriers and formulate strategies to increase academic R&D competitiveness;\r\n\r\n4.\tstrengthen partnerships, particularly with K-12 and the state's historically black colleges and universities via outreach activities targeting minority and underrepresented groups, including rural students from disadvantaged communities;\r\n\r\n5.\tdevelop thematic areas to maximize their impact in meeting state S&T goals;\r\n\r\n6.\testablish specific and measurable milestones and benchmarks, with clearly delineated timelines and metrics; and \r\n\r\n7.\tassess and strengthen the role and function of the WV EPSCoR management team and advisory groups, and delineate reporting lines.  \r\n\r\nThe primary outcomes of this effort will be: (1) a forward-looking strategic plan to increase research competitiveness, enhance STEM, and bolster participation in science and mathematics career tracks; and (2) a revised RII proposal, submitted to the NSF in the Fall 2005.  The WV EPSCoR Advisory Council will oversee the six-month planning process.  The WV EPSCoR Office, under the leadership of a state director, will lead day-to-day activities.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
