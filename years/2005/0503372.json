 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation proposes to extend its activities\r\ninto Phase II. The Georgia LSAMP Partner institutions include the four United Negro\r\nCollege Fund institutions in Georgia: Clark Atlanta University, the lead institution, and\r\nMorehouse, Paine and Spelman Colleges. Georgia State University, the State supported urban\r\nuniversity and Atlanta Metropolitan College, the 2-year college partner round out the\r\nAlliance. The Georgia LSAMP is one of the nations most productive in terms of being\r\namong the top baccalaureate-origin institutions of Black STEM doctorate recipients: 1991-\r\n1995 and 1997-2001. The unifying themes of the Phase II program include focused\r\nrecruitment and retention, required research participation, student financial support and\r\ngraduate school enrollment. The Georgia LSAMP in Phase II will significantly increase the\r\nnumber of STEM baccalaureate degrees, impact more than 15,000 undergraduates, increase\r\nthe number of undergraduate degree recipients entering graduate school each year by 10\r\npercent and increase retention each year by 10 percent. Student objectives for Phase II\r\ninclude pre-transfer bridge activities for two-year college students, required research\r\nparticipation for all LSAMP scholars, and at least 50 percent of all baccalaureate degree\r\nrecipients will complete research experiences. Faculty objectives include providing\r\nopportunities to improve instruction skills, such as using new technologies and becoming\r\nmore effective mentors. Curriculum objectives are designed to revise introductory courses as\r\na mechanism to improve retention.",
