 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe PIs suggest that carefully selected samples from many ash flow tuffs (ignimbrites) should \r\nyield reliable estimates of the ancient field intensity. Preliminary data from the Bishop Tuff have yielded high quality\r\npaleointensity results with a high success ratio (75%). In addition, the well documented presence\r\nof fine-grained cubic Fe-oxides spanning the superparamagnetic (SP) to single domain (SD) size\r\nrange in silicic glasses from tuffs should be well suited for paleointensity determinations. These\r\nfine grained magnetic minerals in a glassy matrix may also be effectively armored during the\r\nmultiple laboratory heatings necessary for a paleofield determination. Finally, ash flow tuffs are\r\ntypically well suited for high precision 40Ar/39Ar dating that can provide an accurate age\r\nframework for any paleointensity results.\r\nThis project is a pilot study of the Pleistocene Bishop Tuff aimed at evaluating the suitability of ash\r\nflow tuffs for absolute paleointensity studies. Because only portions of a particular ignimbrite will \r\nultimately prove suitable for paleointensity work, a goal of the study will be to develop a strategy \r\nto identify the most likely materials for reliable paleointensities.\r\nThe variability in magnetic mineralogy and cooling history in ash flows will also allow the testing of\r\nseveral additional aspects of paleointensity determinations, including the effects of cooling rate,\r\nmagnetic mineralogy and the influence of chemical remanence on paleointensity results. These\r\nare important controls on paleointensity in all recording media and so these tests will yield\r\nvaluable information for interpreting other paleointensity results.\r\nThe main goal of this proposal is to evaluate whether reliable paleointensities\r\ncan be determined from ignimbrites. If absolute paleointensities can be determined from ash flows, it may\r\nbe possible to compile a much more comprehensive database of past field intensity fluctuations\r\nof the geomagnetic field. All data generated during the present project will be archived in the\r\npaleomagnetic data base (http://www.earthref.org/MAGIC/index.html) and the results will be\r\npresented at international conferences and in published papers.\r\n",
