 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nResearch Plan: A networked dynamic system is a collection of dynamical units that interact via an information\r\nexchange network during their operation. These systems have found many applications in diverse\r\nareas such as multiple space, air, and land vehicles, energy systems, physiology, and medicine. Currently,\r\nthere is an active research effort underway in the control and systems community to formalize these systems\r\nand lay out a foundation for their analysis and synthesis. The objective of this project is to carry out foundational\r\nstudies on a network-centric input-output and robustness analysis framework for distributed dynamic\r\nsystems. The approach adopted for this purpose is based on algebraic graph theory on one hand, and random\r\nand random geometric graphs, on the other. In this direction, we will address problems associated\r\nwith probabilistic moments of system-theoretic objective functionals over uncertain networks, as well as\r\nthe important phenomena associated with time-scales and phase transitions in robustness and performance\r\nmeasures of the corresponding networked systems. An existing computational testbed at the University of\r\nWashington will be augmented for the purpose of validation and evaluation of the proposed methodologies.\r\nEducation Plan: Distributed dynamic systems provide an ideal venue to engage control and systems graduate\r\nstudents in the elegance and power of system ideas, not only as they pertain to engineering problems,\r\nbut also in their relation to biology and information sciences. The education program of this project is\r\nimplemented through a graduate course offering and curriculum development, graduate mentoring, and promoting\r\nresearch collaboration venues via in-class seminars and a workshop. The proposed course, Networkcentric\r\nDynamic System Theory and Applications, will be developed and offered as a two quarters graduate\r\nlevel course in the controls curriculum of the University of Washington. The course will cover aspects of\r\ncombinatorial theory that, in conjunction with system theory, have proved instrumental in the analysis of\r\nnetwork-enabled dynamic systems. The second quarter of the course provides a rigorous bridge between\r\nsystem theory and networked dynamic systems as encountered in a wide array of disciplines such as in biology\r\nand physiology. The workshop on network-centric dynamic systems during the final year of the project\r\nwill not only serve as an exceptional educational outlet for the graduate students, but also as a vehicle to\r\nfurther enhance opportunities for interdisciplinary research.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed research and education program consists of:\r\n(1) foundational contributions to a new sub-discipline in control theory referred to as network-centric dynamic\r\nsystem theory (2) applying novel graph and system theoretic techniques for the analysis of networked\r\ndynamic systems as encountered in life and physical sciences and engineering systems (3) providing a significant\r\nimpetus for collaborations between system and control theorists, combinatorialists, biologists, and\r\nphysicists, at the University of Washington, and (4) development of a new curriculum for graduate program\r\nin systems and control education.\r\nBroader Impact: Our project will lay a fertile ground work for future collaborations between system and\r\ncontrol researchers, graph theorists, and the biological science community. By doing so, it will also bring\r\ninto the horizon a host of new career options for system and control graduate students. Our contributions to\r\nthe emerging field of networks will be well publicized via: (1) a well-organized workshop on the third year\r\nof the project, bringing researchers from across disciplines, from local computer science, engineering, and\r\nbiomedical industries (2) presenting research results, often by graduate students, in professional conferences\r\nand research institutions, and (3) frequent seminars in the educational institutions that are non-Ph.D granting\r\nand/or serve underrepresented groups. These more public seminars will highlight the common complexities\r\nof networked dynamic systems across various disciplines, and how control and system theory is providing\r\nnovel theoretical and algorithmic tools for their analysis and synthesis. These seminars will also be actively\r\nused as a recruitment tool, particularly for attracting potential graduate students from underrepresented\r\ngroups in engineering.",
