 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite its small size and relatively bland coloration, the fish Fundulus heteroclitus has played a critical role in helping biochemists, physiologists, toxicologists, environmental scientists, ecologists, developmental biologists and resource managers protect human health and ecosystem health.  In their individual laboratories, scientists in each of these disciplines have begun to use molecular tools to explore the genome of F. heteroclitus, also known as the mudminnow, mummichog or killifish.  This proposal seeks to bring together the community of researchers working on Fundulus to share existing resources and to develop common molecular and computational resources that would be made available to all.  The immediate goal is to create a library of genes that are important to survival and reproduction in Fundulus by pooling information that is already available among this wide-spread group of researchers.  From this library of genes, thousands of different Fundulus DNA segments could be produced and bound to special microscope slides, called microarrays.  If these microarrays are copied and made widely available, they can be used to evaluate changes in gene activity in Fundulus as a function of the internal or external environment.  Additional goals of this proposal are to develop common bioinformatic tools and platforms for effective exchange of data among the user community, as well as to promote synergistic activities, including printing and quality-control of common microarray formats, and further exploration of the Fundulus genome.  By bringing together those who would share their resources and intimate knowledge of the Fundulus genome with those who would apply these genome-enabled techniques for basic and applied research, the proposed activity will catalyze high-quality science and create new resources for the greater community of scientists.",
