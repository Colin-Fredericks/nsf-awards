 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Control Methodologies for Fuel Cell CHP System Integration and Optimization\", \r\nPI: Jing Sun, University of Michigan\r\nThis proposal focuses on the development of enabling control methodologies for fuel cell based CHP (combined heat power) systems. CHP systems exploit the complementary features of different technologies to provide highly efficient and environmentally friendly power solutions for both stationary and mobile applications. They are characterized by synergetic interactions of heterogeneous subsystems; tight chemical, thermal, mechanical, and electrical couplings; and complex and challenging control tasks. To maintain high efficiency, these systems often operate on or close to their admissible boundary. In addition there are many operational constraints, such as continuous fuel cell reactant supply and heat plant temperature limits, that have to be strictly enforced during transient operations. \r\nThe objectives of this combined theoretical and technological development project are (1) to develop control mechanisms that can maintain the control system modular architecture but are capable of dealing with constraints and uncertainties for nonlinear and interactive systems; (2) to explore the synergetic application of optimization and feedback to assure both constraint enforcement and overall system stability/optimality; (3) to address the computational feasibility issues of optimization-based control for real-time applications; and (4) to develop the enabling control technology for mobile applications of fuel cell based CHP systems through case studies.\r\nThe proposed research will concentrate on developing transient capabilities of the fuel cell based CHP systems, targeting mobile platforms for both low (automotive) and high (marine) power applications. The proposed work will leverage the extensive knowledge and experience of the PI and co-PIs in the areas of automotive powertrain system integration, adaptive control, optimization, constrained control, and model predictive control. The direct involvement of industrial co-PIs facilitated by the GOALI program, combined with the PI's interactions with automotive and marine industries, will assure strong research relevance, smooth technology transfer, and a substantial impact for the proposed project. \r\n\r\n",
