 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\n\r\nExercise science students preparing for careers in medicine or allied health understand the value of physical activity in the prevention of major diseases affecting the US population. This project is providing an exercise physiology course, one of the cornerstone courses in exercise science programs, with the equipment needed for students to acquire the intellectual and technical skills necessary to investigate and understand the physiological implications of activity and inactivity. Implementing the learning objectives established by Project Kaleidoscope, the laboratory component of the course is promoting critical thinking and investigative learning. For the first nine weeks of the course, students familiarize themselves with the equipment and conduct experiments designed by the instructor. During the last six weeks, students engage in independent research projects and present their findings at science conferences on campus and with students from peer institutions in the region. Through these investigative experiences, students are gaining insights into scientific research and experimentation. In addition to enhancing the educational experiences for the Exercise Science majors, the equipment obtained with this grant is having a significant impact in the education of over 200 K-12, service learning, and minority students each year, who use the equipment as part of a service learning program. The educational outcomes are being shared through presentations at regional and national conferences, journal articles, and a course web page.",
