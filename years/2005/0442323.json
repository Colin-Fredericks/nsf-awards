 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Mechanical (56) \r\nThis collaborative proof of concept project between Carnegie-Mellon University and Morgan State University, a HBCU, is developing finite element analysis methods in a mechanics of materials course to expose students early in their academic careers to the practice of engineering by using modern computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools. The project is developing highly simplified finite element methodology that provides conceptual insight into deformed states with a focus on developing students understanding of displacements, forces, stresses and strains at individual points.  \r\n\r\nThe finite element program can be run over the web in a format that students can use with little or no previous training in finite element analysis methods. The program serves as a transition to commercial FEA software by highlighting the key steps taken in any commercial program: specification of domain, material, element type, mesh, and boundary conditions, followed by solution and viewing of results.  In addition, the program emphasizes viewing of the deformed shape of the mesh together with the values of quantities at node points.  This helps students visualize quantities such as displacements and deformations that are central to the mechanics of materials course.\r\n  \r\nThe project focuses on devising and refining assignments, both for use alone and coupled with traditional homework problems. The program is also a valuable tool for use in lectures with a set of pre-defined problems that enables professors to rapidly illustrate important physical concepts. Learning gains associated with various uses of the program are being assessed for students of diverse backgrounds, which include assessing the impact of learning for visual learners. In addition to disseminating the materials through papers and conferences, the materials are being registered with various web-based repositories for educational material.\r\n",
