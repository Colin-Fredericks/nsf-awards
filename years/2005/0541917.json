Work of Furstenberg, Mostow, Margulis and others shows\r\nthat certain dynamical systems are an important tool for studying\r\ngeometric properties of important geometric spaces, particularly\r\nsymmetric and locally symmetric spaces. . One important property\r\nof symmetric spaces is that they have non-positive curvature. The\r\ninvestigator plans to extend this work in several inter-related\r\ndirections. The study of symmetric spaces will be generalized to\r\ninclude more general spaces of non-positive curvature as well as\r\nmore general maps between spaces with an emphasis on infinite\r\ndimensional spaces.  The investigator will attempt to exploit\r\nthese relationships to prove long-standing conjectures of\r\nZimmer. The group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold acts\r\non the space of square-integrable Riemannian metrics, which is\r\nnaturally an infinite-dimensional space of non-positive\r\ncurvature.  In previous work the PI has extensively studied\r\ndynamics of certain groups acting on ``flat\" infinite dimensional\r\nspaces, and some present work can be viewed as generalizing those\r\nresult to spaces that have curvature. Typically if one is a\r\nperturbing a dynamical system one already understands, the study\r\nof nearby dynamical systems can be reduced to properties of a\r\nflat infinite dimensional space. However, if one wants to\r\nclassify dynamical systems which one does not assume are\r\nperturbations of ones that are well-understood, one is forced in\r\na space that has curvature.\r\n\r\nDynamical systems is a young and important field of mathematics\r\nthat investigates the evolution of physical or mathematical\r\nsystems over time (e.g. fluid flow) while differential geometry\r\nis a more classical field that tends to study static\r\nconfigurations of curves and shapes in space. New ideas from\r\ndynamical systems theory such as chaos and fractals have had a\r\nprofound impact on our perception of the world. One of the\r\ndeepest and most influential mathematical applications of\r\ndynamical systems has been to the study of geometric properties\r\nof spaces with \"many symmetries\". The PI's research can be viewed\r\nas part of a general development in modern mathematics in which\r\nideas from dynamics and differential geometry interact to lead to\r\nboth proofs of old conjectures and exciting new discoveries. A\r\nkey idea that appears repeatedly is that spaces that possess many\r\nsymmetries must actually be homogeneous, i.e. any space with\r\nenough symmetry actually looks the same at every point. The PI's\r\nwork on these topics has relationships with diverse areas of\r\nresearch including computer science (expander graphs and property\r\n(T) of Kazhdan) and celestial mechanics (KAM theory and stability\r\nof the solar system).\r\n",
