 "awd_abstract_narration": "What helps us to recognize people on the basis of their speech alone?  Are there properties in the speech signal that will help us recognize people even if they are trying to conceal their identity?  With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Carol Espy-Wilson will conduct research to answer these questions and to develop automatic algorithms that will reliably extract speaker-specific information from the speech signal.  This research will bring together knowledge from speech production and speech perception.  The broader impacts of this project include applications to diagnostic tools for various speech disorders, the development of speech training aids, the development of personalized human-computer interaction, speech recognition, and a deeper understanding of the articulatory-to-acoustic mapping. This project integrates research and education by furthering the development of speech-related courses at the University of Maryland at College Park, and providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in research.",
