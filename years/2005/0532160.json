Giladi\r\nDepartment of Mathematical Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\r\n\r\nThis project involves the purchase and use of a high-speed multiprocessor computing cluster to:\r\n1. Enable computationally intensive research projects to address complex mathematical modeling\r\nand optimization issues, including, in particular, multi-scale problems arising in the\r\nstudy of chemically reacting flows, mathematical biology, numerical optimization, and wave\r\nscattering.\r\n2. Significantly enhance graduate computational courses in the Mathematical Sciences at Rensselaer\r\nand expand our continuing efforts to attract women and other under-represented groups\r\ninto our research programs.\r\nThe proposed equipment will benefit our research projects in several ways. The equipment will (i)\r\nenable us to proceed with our research efforts directed towards the development and testing of new\r\nnumerical methods using parallel computing, (ii) open up new areas for research for our graduate\r\nstudents, and (iii) be essential for running production codes already working on our smaller four\r\nprocessor system. These new avenues of research will strengthen our graduate student education\r\nand career development in computational mathematics, and will become the basis for outreach\r\nactivities such as REUs (Research Experiences for Undergraduates).\r\nThe specific projects for which the cluster will have immediate impact involve: the development\r\nof adaptive mesh refinement methods on composite overlapping grids for multiscale simulations of\r\nchemically reacting flows in exploding and detonating media; the computational modeling of the\r\nnonlinear, three-dimensional, electromechanical processes responsible for transduction of sound\r\nin the cochlea; the development of parallel algorithms based on polyhedral and non-polyhedral\r\ncutting plane methods for solving large-scale semidefinite and integer programming problems; and\r\nthe development of hybrid asymptotic-numeric algorithms for solving scattering problems from\r\ncomplex realistic three-dimensional objects, in the mid frequency regime. On a broader level, the\r\ncomputing cluster will provide us with the ability to develop scalable algorithms that are essential for\r\nanalyzing certain complex mathematical problems that arise in science and engineering applications,\r\nand it will provide us with a computational laboratory that will serve as an invaluable resource\r\nfor the preparation and computational experience of our students and post-docs. As a result, the\r\nbroader impact of the computing cluster will be as a tool used in the career development of our\r\nstudents and post-docs, the dissemination of the new results of our computational research through\r\npublications and talks, and the development of new interdisciplinary collaborations.",
