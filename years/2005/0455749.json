 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three-year exploratory study on schools that have low- and high- retention rates in an urban school district.  This research will address low teacher retention for science and math teachers by comparing the policies and practices of high- and low-retention middle and high schools, and by examining the explicit and hidden costs associated with teacher turnover.  The specific goals of this project are to (1) identify school and district policies and practices associated with high retention rates, (2) determine whether there are differential effects of successful retention policies for middle and high school science and math teachers, and (3) develop a comprehensive model of the cost of teacher turnover.  The anticipated outcomes of the project include:  1. Profiles of the six high- and six low-retention middle and high schools included in the study, 2. A cross-school analysis that describes the policies and practices associated with high- and low- retention schools and how they differentially affect math and science teachers, 3. A cost-of-turnover analysis that includes the specification of the explicit and hidden cost categories associated with teacher turnover and the application of the derived formula to the district, and 4. A plan to replicate this exploratory study in four to six urban districts across the country in order to test its findings.",
