 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a new clone-based physical mapping method to generate accurate and comprehensive clone overlap genome maps. Sequences of up to 100 base pairs adjacent to all Hind III restriction cleavage sites within large insert clones will be determined in a high throughput manner. The collection of sequences from each clone will be compared to all other clones to identify sequences in common and thus clone overlaps. The length of the sequences generated should be sufficient to enable unique assignments in non-repetitive overlaps. Within duplicated and repetitive regions small sequence variations will be used to identify precise map locations. This new method will be developed and validated using clones from the soybean genome physical map.\r\n\r\nThis mapping method has the potential to greatly impact the physical mapping and genomics community, especially in plants. There are many complex genomes yet to be characterized in any detail. These genomes will benefit from new sequencing methods but as the disruptive technologies on the sequencing horizon are focusing on high-throughput generation of inexpensive short reads, comprehensive physical maps will be essential to assemble these reads correctly into long stretches of contiguous sequence. In addition, the distributed sequence sampling that accompanies this map generation method may in itself constitute an affordable whole genome project.\r\n\r\nThe project will afford opportunities for student involvement in both software and protocol development. The execution of this project with a plant genome focus within a primarily medical and mammalian genome environment will expose many students to another area of genome research which will hopefully inspire them to look beyond the mammalian genome world. Although this is a short duration project, there are many\r\nlocal active programs for supporting minority students that will benefit from this added project diversity.\r\n\r\nProject outcomes will be available through the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center  (http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/) and Legume Information System (http://www.comparative-legumes.org/).\r\n",
