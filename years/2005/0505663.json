 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear media host a wide variety of localized coherent structures\r\n(solitons, wavetrains, vortices, spirals, etc.) with complex intrinsic\r\nproperties and interactions that, in turn, give rise to emergent patterns\r\nwith nontrivial dynamics. The theme of the proposed research is a detailed\r\nexamination of vortices generated in dispersive nonlinear media.\r\nThe main focus is to extend and deepen the understanding of vortex\r\nstructures, their existence and dynamical stability as well as their\r\ninteractions and mesoscopic lattices in nonlinear media such as\r\nBose-Einstein condensates and related fields (such as nonlinear optics).\r\nWe propose to follow a step-by-step methodology in studying the\r\ngeneration, stability and dynamics of vortices in a progression of\r\nscenaria of increasing complexity, extending from single vortices, \r\nto few vortices, to vortex lattices. Specifically, we plan to study:\r\n(1) Vortex generation through dynamical instabilities and external\r\nmanipulations such as phase imprinting and via instabilities driven by\r\nrapidly moving impurities (focused laser beams).\r\n(2) Dynamics and stability of single vortices (a.k.a. atoms) in the\r\npresence of external traps and manipulation of vortices by translating the\r\nexternal traps or by using localized optical \"tweezers\".\r\n(3) Interactions between vortices and formation, stability and dynamics\r\nof vortex dipoles (a.k.a. molecules/dipoles).\r\n(4) Finally, we intend to investigate, by cross-fertilizing ideas from\r\nmaterial science, large arrays of vortices, their crystallization and\r\nstructural phase transitions into regular vortex lattices (a.k.a. crystals).\r\n\r\nIn the 1920's Bose and Einstein predicted that a gas at low density and\r\nultra-cold temperatures undergoes a transition towards what is nowadays\r\ncalled a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The most important characteristic\r\nof a BEC is that all atoms occupy the same quantum state creating a macroscopic\r\nlump of coherent matter. BECs are to matter what laser is to light. BECs allow\r\nfor direct manipulation and observation of quantum effects at the macroscopic\r\nlevel, providing ultimate control over matter. Since their recent\r\nexperimental realization (for which the 2001 Physics Nobel prize was\r\ngranted), BECs have been at the focus of an intensive and ever growing\r\nexperimental and theoretical effort. Vortices are fundamental coherent,\r\ntopologically charged, nonlinear excitations that emerge in BECs; but\r\nwhich also play a profound role in exciting and important fields such as\r\nsuperconductivity and superfluidity (which were the theme of the 2003\r\nPhysics Nobel prize). Interestingly enough, they also arise in our daily\r\nlife in the form of hydrodynamic vortices in water or in air. There are\r\nstrong parallels (as well as differences) between such fluid vortices and\r\nthese ultra-cold, superfluid vortices that we plan to examine and\r\ndelineate. The outcome of this research will shed light into the pattern\r\nformation and interaction of such vortex structures in Bose-Einstein\r\ncondensates. Since the underlying equation that describes the BECs also\r\ndescribes the behavior of coherent light embedded in a nonlinear\r\nmaterial, the research hereby proposed will also be applicable to\r\nproblems of optical waveguides and fiber bundles, photonic crystals, and\r\nlight storage in optical traps, all of which are active research areas at\r\nthe forefront of optical technologies. The proposed research has\r\npotential applications to quantum-optical storage\r\nand quantum computing for the next generation of computers.\r\nThe research effort is part of an ongoing collaboration between\r\nthe PI and Co-PI and involves more than a dozen coworkers that blend in\r\nexpertise in fields as diverse as dynamical systems, nonlinear optics,\r\ncondensed matter, materials science and scientific computing. Specially\r\nattractive is the prospect that our results will be partially driven and\r\ncould be relevant to current experimental research conducted in BEC\r\nexperiments. This highly inter-disciplinary research program will also\r\ninvolve a major educational component through the direct involvement of\r\ngraduate research assistants and postdoctoral fellows.",
