 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nCurrently, there is not enough good data on what types of genetic \r\nchanges occur when organisms evolve an adaptation.  This data can \r\nonly come from high-resolution genetic analyses of natural \r\nadaptations.  The fruitfly, Drosophila sechellia, is uniquely suited for \r\nsuch an analysis as it can be manipulated genetically and has an \r\nindisputable adaptation.  A close relative of D. melanogaster, a \r\ngenetic model species, D. sechellia has adapted to consuming the \r\nfruit of Morinda citrifolia, a fruit that is toxic to other fruitflies.  The first \r\ntwo experiments in this grant are in-depth genetic analyses of D. \r\nsechellia's adaptation.  The genes involved in this adaptation will be \r\nprecisely mapped and their effects estimated. This data is a \r\nnecessary first step towards the identification and cloning of the \r\nadaptive alleles.  The final experiment will determine the relative \r\nimportance of standing genetic variation versus new mutations in the \r\nevolution of an adaptation by artificially evolving resistance in related \r\nspecies of fruitflies.\r\nThe proposed research will help us understand how organisms \r\ngenetically change in response to environmental change. \r\nSpecifically, this grant will impact our understanding of how insects \r\nevolve resistance to plant produced pesticides and will give insight \r\ninto how insects choose the plants upon which they feed. \r\n",
