 "awd_abstract_narration": "A departmental honors program at a moderately selective public research \r\nuniversity can play a significant role in the mathematics education of \r\ntalented American students. Such universities cast a wide net. Large merit \r\nawards draw a few students with sterling high school records while thousands \r\narrive each year having, for whatever reason, not amassed the high SAT/ACT \r\nscores and leadership roles needed to gain admission to highly selective \r\ninstitutions. Sifting through the latter group reveals a small but significant \r\nnumber with latent high mathematical talent. These 'sleeper' students come to \r\nlife during their first exposure to abstract math, and their work in advanced \r\ncourses can match or exceed that of their peers who excelled in high school. A \r\nstrong departmental honors program can be the framework that identifies and \r\nsupports this diverse group, drawing on the department's graduate and research \r\nresources as it guides them as rapidly as possible through the transition to \r\nadvanced abstract and applied mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe University of Tennessee Math Honors Program provides early identification \r\nof talent, a flexible curriculum that places undergraduates in graduate \r\ncourses as early as the sophomore year, an honors seminar, and significant \r\nmentoring and advising. The program draws on the surrounding rural Appalachian \r\nregion, providing opportunity to students who may have received little support \r\nand stimulation in high school for their mathematical abilities. More than 75% \r\nof the grant is devoted to direct financial support to students in the form of \r\nmerit and need-based scholarships, research stipends and summer tuition \r\nremission. Scholarships will be awarded to a few incoming freshmen, but mainly \r\nto current UT students who decide to follow an accelerated track through the \r\nhonors program. University cost sharing of close to 10% of the grant total \r\nwill allow the program to offer multi-year scholarships extending beyond the \r\nfive-year term of the grant. Additional funding supports graduate students as \r\nsummer research mentors for undergraduates, administration and assessment of \r\nthe program. A 'math ambassadors' program funded by the grant will send honors \r\nstudents to high schools to increase interest in mathematics in general and \r\nthe UT Math Honors program in particular. The funding is expected increase the \r\nsize of the UT Math Honors program by more than 50%.\r\n",
