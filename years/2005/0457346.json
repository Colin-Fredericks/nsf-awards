 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a novel multi-stage molding process for creating a new class of articulated devices that have mesoscopic features essential to the miniaturization of products in a cost-competitive manner. The approach that will be employed consists of several steps. First, interfacial adhesion phenomena encountered during the multi-stage molding process will be characterized and their relationship to process variables will be established. This knowledge will be utilized to explore alternative ways to limit adhesion at interfaces and hence create articulated joints by easily separating discrete components without breaking them. Second, viability of various cavity shape change methods and ejection mechanisms will be assessed for realizing mesoscopic joints using multi-stage molding. This knowledge will be utilized to optimize tooling configurations for making mesoscopic articulated devices. Finally, an improved understanding of the influence that process parameters for microscale electrical discharge machining have on the resulting surface characteristics and dimensional accuracies will be developed. This knowledge will be utilized to create mold inserts to be used in the new molding process that will be essential to defining the limitations on the size of the mesoscopic features. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project is expected to have the following broader impacts. First, for mesoscopic articulated devices that can be manufactured using the new molding process, the process can be easily scaled down in size and scaled up in production quantity. Hence, this research is expected to enable new possibilities for miniaturizing products.  Second, the new molding process will significantly reduce assembly operations and make manufacturing significantly less labor-intensive. Therefore manufacturing of mesoscopic devices can be done quickly and easily inside the US in a cost-competitive manner. Therefore the proposed research effort will enhance the competitiveness of the US manufacturing sector. Finally, the research results will be integrated in the manufacturing curriculum to educate a new generation of engineers ready to exploit emerging manufacturing technologies to create new products.\r\n",
