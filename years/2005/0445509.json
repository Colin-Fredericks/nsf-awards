 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amphibians are undergoing a world-wide decline; certain species are becoming extinct.  It is known that die-offs of some species are associated with certain viral pathogens, but it is not known why their immune systems are not protecting them.  If amphibian die-offs partially reflect natural or man-made environmental changes that are immunosuppressive, awareness of these environmental factors are necessary to re-establish ecological balance for the health of man and frogs, alike. This project, uses the frog Xenopus as a laboratory model to investigate the mechanisms of viral immunity and how these organisms mount up their defenses. There are two aims: the first is to define the cellular components of viral immunity in adult frogs; and the second is to determine if the tadpoles are more susceptible due to a generalized immaturity of their immune system. This project will contribute to a better understanding of the causes of amphibian decline, which is of public interest. In addition, it will provide opportunity for minority graduate and undergraduate students to study fundamental immunology in the context of viral diseases, particularly in amphibians.",
