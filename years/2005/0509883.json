 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research on the mechanism(s) of iron uptake and release by the iron storage protein ferritin by Professor Donald C. Zapien of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado-Denver. The way in which the protein shell responds to changes in oxidation state of the iron in the core will be determined, as well as how the differences in protein structure affect the electrochemical reactivity of the ferritin. The principal methodology to be employed is cyclic voltammetry of a single layer of ferritin adsorbed on the surface of a tin-doped indium oxide electrode. Changes in composition of the core before and after iron reduction will be determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and changes in protein conformation by immunoassay. Both native and recombinant ferritins will be examined in order to elucidate the role of the H and L-chain subunits with regard to iron sequestration and discharge.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to understand how the protein ferritin carries out its functions. The principal functions are to take up excess iron in biological cells, store the iron and supply it when needed. In addition to obtaining fundamental information on this important protein, the results will provide a basis for non-biological applications such as electrochemical assays. This Research at an Undergraduate Institution project, employing an integrated chemical and biochemical approach, provides an excellent training vehicle for a diverse group of undergraduate students. They will be well-prepared for either industrial employment or advanced study.  \r\n",
