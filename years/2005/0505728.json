 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fractional factorial designs are among the most widely used experimental\r\nplans in practice.  Most existing researches are limited to small\r\nfractional factorial designs. The objectives of this proposed research are\r\nto develop a general theory and to construct efficient large fractional\r\nfactorial designs for practical use.  The concept of moment projection\r\npattern is introduced to study design isomorphism. Linear programming\r\ntechnique is used to study design optimality. Efficient algorithms are\r\nproposed for constructing both regular and nonregular designs.  The\r\nconcept of minimum moment aberration is utilized to study optimal blocking\r\nschemes for both regular and nonregular designs.  Coding theory is\r\nemployed to develop a general theory on minimum aberration blocking\r\nschemes. Catalogs of efficient large fractional factorial designs are\r\nbuilt for practical use.\r\n\r\nExperimental design is an effective and commonly used tool in scientific\r\ninvestigation. Fractional factorial designs are among the most widely used\r\nexperimental plans in practice.  Most existing researches are limited to\r\nsmall fractional factorial designs. Progresses in science and technology\r\nurge the study of efficient fractional factorial designs with both large\r\nrun sizes and a large number of factors. Some recent examples are computer\r\nexperiments in large scale simulation, high throughput screening in drug\r\ndiscovery, and microarray experiments in biotechnology.  The objectives of\r\nthis proposed research are to develop a general theory and to construct\r\nefficient large fractional factorial designs for practical use. \r\nAddressing the fundamental issue of design construction and selection, the\r\nresults of the proposed research can be quickly assimilated into graduate\r\ncourses on experimental design.  New algorithms and efficient designs will\r\nbe made available online for broad and quick dissemination.  The proposed\r\nresearch has wide-ranging impact both theoretically and practically, and\r\nwill lead to remarkable new advances in design theory and better practice\r\nin experimentation.\r\n\r\n",
