 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a two-day, hands-on conference on K-12 outreach from university science departments that is being held in late Spring 2005 in Research Triangle Park, NC.  Led by David G. Haase, Professor of Physics and founding Director of The Science House at North Carolina State University, the conference will engage approximately eighty participants and has as its theme 'Enhancing Science in K-8;' it is being jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and The Burroughs Wellcome Fund.  The goal of this Conference is to bring the efforts of university science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments in North Carolina to bear on STEM education, in particular in grades K-8, which in 2008 will begin state testing of science at the ends of grades 5 and 8.  Specific objectives of this hands-on conference are (1) to help STEM professionals understand fundamental issues in K-12 science and mathematics education, (2) to introduce them to examples of best practices that engage university-based STEM researchers with K-12 science and (3) to facilitate networking among members of this group to build substantive programs to support K-12 STEM education in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this conference include the spreading of its results to other scientists and educators in North Carolina and other states through the published Conference Proceedings, presentations at other science departments, and science society meetings.  The Proceedings will contribute to the intellectual and academic foundation for the involvement of scientists in K-12 education.  The Proceedings will be distributed in hard copy to university administrators and to the education community via the high volume Science House website.  The grantees will also produce a short \"Handbook for STEM's in K-12\" that will be distributed as a primer to enhance the engagement of university-based STEM researchers in K-12 science and mathematics.  \r\n",
