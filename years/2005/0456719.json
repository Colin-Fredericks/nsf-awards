 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Zhibin Guan, Department of Chemistry, University of California - Irvine, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for the development of cyclophane-based late transition metal catalysts for olefin polymerization. First, current and new cyclophane diimine ligands will be optimized for Ni(II) and Pd(II) based olefin polymerization catalysis. This will be done by incorporating electron-donating and withdrawing substituents into the ligands, by changing the backbone structure of the cyclophane diimines; and by introducing fluorinated phenyl rings. Next, Fe(II) and Co(II)  complexes of cyclophane tridendate ligands will be explored as olefin polymerization catalysts. This part of the project aims to define any macrocyclic effects of cyclophane ligands on tridendate late transition metal catalyst systems. Finally, late transition metal complexes of the cyclophane ligands will be tested for ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerizations with polar comonomers. The polymerization properties of the complexes will be correlated to the catalyst structures. The trends observed and insights gained will guide further design of better olefin polymerization catalysts.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts from the proposed activity include interdisciplinary training of students at multiple levels.  Minority and women graduate and undergraduate students will be employed on this project. Additionally, it will impact the polyolefin industry, where the successful development of a commercially viable late transition metal polymerization catalyst would have a tremendous impact. \r\n",
