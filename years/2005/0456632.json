The objectives of these actions are to support the country's drive towards modernization.  This award will support a major international conference to assess the actual and potential contributions that science and technology are making, and are likely to make, to China's modernization and globalization aspirations, as well as to global scientific progress.  Participants will include established scholars working in the area of Chinese science and technology, younger scholars, individuals with working knowledge of multinational firms in China, as well as government officials.
