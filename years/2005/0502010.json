 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental nuclear physics research program, involving undergraduate student participation as a central component, will be carried out at Westmont College and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University. The structure of nuclei produced by fragmentation reactions is investigated using two different approaches. In the first, ground-state magnetic properties of short-lived nuclei that decay by beta-emission are measured using radiation-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (beta-NMR). After production they are implanted in a crystal host located at the center of a high-precision magnet, and their response to alternating magnetic fields is monitored via the directional distribution of their beta-particle emission. In the second approach, properties of ground and excited states of highly neutron-rich nuclei are measured via in-flight breakup reactions, using the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA), which Westmont students helped construct along with students from 9 other colleges and universities. The energies and trajectories of forward moving neutrons are measured in coincidence with the energies and trajectories of the charged fragments, which are deflected out of the main beam by a sweeper magnet. This research program will help advance knowledge of nuclear structure both near to and far from stability, and provide the type of cutting-edge undergraduate student research experiences that help recruit future generations of nuclear scientists. \r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch conducted under this NSF grant is based both at Westmont College and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University, and involves undergraduate student participation at its heart.  The purpose of the program is to investigate light neutron-rich nuclei that are far removed from stability, by measuring properties of both neutron-bound and neutron-unbound ground and excited states in nuclei located at or near the neutron \"drip-line.\"  In order to pursue these investigations we use the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA, constructed by undergraduate students from 9 primarily undergraduate institutions), located in the NSCL N2 vault at the end of one of the accelerator beamlines, coupled with the Sweeper Magnet and Sweeper charged particle detector chamber. \n\nSystems that we have successfully investigated include the following neutron-rich nuclei: 10Li, 12,13Be, 23O (measurement of unbound resonances using fragmentation of a 48Ca beam), 25O (determination of its neutron-unbound ground state energy), 24O (determination of the energy of excited states, 22N (determination of neutron-unbound excited state), 28F (measurement of its neutron-unbound ground and excited states), 21C (measurement of its neutron-unbound ground state).  \n\nAdditionally, we have measured the ground-state magnetic moments of 57Cu and 55Ni located near the line of stability.  These systems are particularly interesting since they are members of isospin multiplets adjacent to the doubly-closed shell nucleas 56Ni. \n\nResearch on exotic nuclei using MoNA and the Sweeper Magnet at NSCL/MSU advances understanding of shell-model structure near the neutron dripline, as well as our understanding of neutron halo nuclei. \nAdditionally, our work in ground state magnetic moments of isospin multiplet members helps with the understanding of single-particle and collective behavior in nuclear near the N=Z line, as well as help delineate the contributions of configuration mixing and mesonic effects in nuclei. \n\nAn additional and very important component of this program is the training of young scientists.  Undergraduate students have opportunity to work at a world-class research laborator alongside professional physicists on research that is cutting edge and highly relevant to our fundamental understanding of nature.  In many cases students are inspired to continue working in the field based on the positive experience of encountering \"real\" science and the pursuit of answers to fundmentally interesting questions. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/25/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Warren F Rogers"
