There is a growing shift in knowledge work, including product design, software development and business processes, to places such as Taiwan, India, China, the Philippines and Ireland, and the trend shows no signs of slowing. Some often argue that the shift of knowledge work offshore will lead to the loss of millions of U.S. jobs. Others make the case that there will be significant cost and efficiency gains for the whole economy, and that jobs will be created in newer entrepreneurial firms and industries even as more mature industries move work offshore. Given these conflicting views and potential impacts, the issue is of great interest and concern to U.S. companies, workers and policy makers. What is currently lacking is a solid empirical understanding of the dynamics underlying this phenomenon, how large it may become, and what its consequences might be. A first step is to look closely at the sourcing decisions of firms and the factors that influence them. The most obvious are economic factors, in particular, differences in wage rates and other costs between the U.S. and other countries. In addition, relational factors associated with geographical proximity or social networks are likely to come into play. Finally, information and computer technologies (ICTs) can be used to improve the productivity of U.S. knowledge workers and help keep work onshore, but also can facilitate offshoring by enabling better coordination of activities across borders and geographic distance. In order to understand the offshore sourcing of knowledge work, and its potential scope and impacts, the proposed research will address the following questions: 1) What are the dynamics of economic and relational factors and ICTs in determining whether knowledge work is moved offshore? 2) How do these dynamics differ depending on the nature and maturity of a knowledge activity, and 3) What are the impacts of sourcing decisions on firm performance, and the potential impacts on employment in the U.S.?  The research will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team from economics, computer science and management in two interrelated activities: (1) intensive qualitative fieldwork in eight companies aimed at generating a theoretical model and formal hypotheses, and (2) quantitative analysis to refine, formalize and test the model on a large-scale survey sample of 800 firms. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe research is socially significant because overseas relocation of knowledge-based activities has important implications for U.S. economic prosperity, potentially affecting jobs, trade, innovation, and industry competition. It is important to know whether there are limits to the amount of knowledge-based work that can be relocated offshore. It is also important to understand whether the deployment of ICTs might be a source of competitive advantage for U.S. firms and workers, or whether their global diffusion will tend to level the playing field with other countries. Finally, it is important to measure the effects of offshore sourcing on firm performance, in order to understand the both costs and benefits. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOffshoring of knowledge work: the case of new product development\n\nThe offshoring of production work is well-known and has been studied extensively, although there are still debates about its overall economic implications.  The offshoring of knowledge work is a relatively newer development and less well understood. It therefore warrants study in order to assess trends and their potential economic implications.\n\nKnowledge work is distinguished from production work in that it involves higher level knowledge and skills as illustrated by scientific, engineering, professional and technical work. We chose to study new product development as a case study of knowledge work.  It usually involves market analysis, business case analysis, hardware and software engineering and other engineering and technical activities.\n\nWe focused on the offshoring of new product development by U.S. computer  hardware and software firms. New product development (NPD) is a multi-stage process of design, build and ongoing technical support. It does not include basic R&amp;D, marketing, distribution or sales.\n\n The goal of the research was to identify the extent to which firms were going offshore for NPD, the factors that influenced their decisions to go offshore, and the outcomes of the decisions.\n\nWe conducted interviews with firms and also studied historical patterns of NPD offshoring given that it has been ongoing since the early 1990s for hardware and since the late 1990s for software. We further surveyed about 300 firms in the software industry and about 400 firms in the electronics hardware industry in 2008.  We summarize the main survey results below.\n\nWe found that about half of all firms had offshored some of their NPD activity.  Software firms tended to offshore coding and testing activities, but to do analysis, design and implementation on shore.  Hardware firms offshored a far greater range of activities, including physical design, testing, prototyping, production engineering and post-production engineering support. Their onshore NPD activities were mainly limited to research and conceptual design.\n\nWe found that the firms went offshore for two fundamentally different reasons: lower cost or market access.  Some firms went for both reasons. \n\nFirms that went offshore for lower cost tended to also outsource development to another firm in the offshore location, whereas firms that went offshore to access new markets tended to keep development in-house at their own subsidiary in the offshore location. Firms that were offshore for both reasons tended to be offshore longer than the firms that went for only one reason. This suggests an evolutionary trend towards greater offshore engagement once a firm goes offshore.\n\nIndia, and to a lesser extent China, was the primary location of software firms seeking low cost.  Europe, Canada and Latin America, and to a lesser extent China, were the main location for software firms seeking new markets. The Asia-Pacific region was the primary location for electronics hardware firms doing NPD offshore.\n\nFirms generally were successful in achieving their goals.  Firms that went offshore for lower cost reported average savings of 25%. Firms that went offshore for new markets reported increased international sales and average cost savings around 10%.\n\nGiven the increased sales and cost savings associated with offshoring, it is unlikely that there will be a sudden or large-scale reversal of the overall trend.  Rather, a declining economy, such as that now being experienced by the U.S., will likely result in more offshoring of NPD in search of growing markets outside the U.S.  However, a declining U.S. economy is likely to make the U.S. labor market more competitive with offshore labor markets resulting in less offshoring of NPD and perhaps even some re-shoring of NPD back to the U.S.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth L Kraemer"
