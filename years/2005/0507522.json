 "awd_abstract_narration": "EVALUATING WIRELESS POCKETPC'S IN INTRODUCTORY GEOSCIENCE COURSES\r\n\r\nIntroductory science teaching, including otherwise engaging geoscience topics such as climate change and natural hazards, traditionally relies on static textbooks and/or course packs, with presentation delivered as a monologue (albeit impassioned) in front of a passive audience. In addition, extensive lecture notes are now available on the Internet. Many students are left with little incentive to attend class, much less participate. Traditional instructional methods do not provide much opportunity for students to critically think through arguments being developed. \r\n\r\nIn the geosciences the concepts being developed are often well illustrated through imagery and/or animation. But even the most stunning of images or movies, while motivating, offers the students only passive participation in their learning. This project couples the rich imagery of the geosciences, forthcoming advances in technology and new pedagogical approaches with the goal of improving student learning and engagement in survey-level geosciences classes. Peer Instruction techniques are being used in two large geosciences classes at the University of Michigan through use of interactive spatial concept challenges utilizing wireless PocketPC computers. While the technologies to be employed (browser, PocketPC, wireless networks) are largely off-the-shelf technologies and the success of Peer Instruction techniques in undergraduate science classes are well documented, the combination is not widely employed due to cost, perceived level of effort to implement and a relatively modest volume of data documenting their value to student learning.\r\n",
