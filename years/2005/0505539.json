 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nThe central theme of the proposed program is the study of  various  \r\naspects of rigidity in dynamics.\r\nNew methods and insights have been recently introduced  by the PI and  \r\nhis collaborators which led to   a significant progress in the problem  \r\nof rigidity of invariant  measures and  the differentiable rigidity of  \r\norbit structure for actions of higher rank abelian groups. Advances  \r\nachieved based on these methods  engendered fruitful applications to  \r\nDiophantine approximation problems in number theory and to the problem  \r\nin arithmetic quantum chaos. There are several major directions in the  \r\nproposed program:\r\n1. Local differentiable  rigidity  for partially hyperbolic actions of  \r\nhigher rank abelian groups with the emphasis on the combination of  the  \r\ndynamical systems,  harmonic analysis/group representation  and  \r\ngeometric methods.\r\n2. Global rigidity of Anosov actions, using various  approaches based  \r\non invariant rigid geometric structures.\r\n3. Rigidity of invariant measures using the  innovative  high entropy  \r\nand low entropy methods in the positive entropy case as well as new  \r\napproaches to the zero entropy case.\r\n4. Problems of quantum unique ergodicity and existence of scars for   \r\nFinsler geodesic flows and billiards in polygons.\r\n5. Precise asymptotic  and  multiplicative lower bounds for  the growth  \r\nof the number of periodic orbits for broad classes of  dynamical  \r\nsystems with non-uniformly hyperbolic behavior.\r\n6. The problem of smooth realization of  measurable dynamical systems.\r\n\r\nMathematical concept of ``rigidity'' has many facets. Its simplest and  \r\nmost basic manifestations can be seen from the following elementary  \r\nexample:  a small number of equations or inequalities of a\r\nspecial type may imply much larger number of equation. For example, if\r\nthe arithmetic mean on  n numbers coincides with the geometric mean\r\n(one equation) then the numbers are all equal ( n-1 equations).\r\nAn example from the PI's earlier research  is conceptually\r\nsimilar albeit technically  much more sophisticated:  a compact\r\nsurface of negative curvature, i.e. a  bounded geometric shape where any\r\ngeodesic triangle has the sum of its angles less than 180 degrees, for\r\nwhich two numbers characterizing global and statistical volume growth\r\n(topological and metric entropy) coincide has constant negative\r\ncurvature, i.e. the sum of the angles of a geodesic triangle is\r\nuniquely determined by the area.  The research under the present grant  \r\ninvolves both deeper\r\ninvestigation of rigidity phenomena for dynamical systems with  \r\nmulti-dimensional time,\r\nand expansion and development of striking  application to several areas  \r\nof mathematics and mathematical physics. Among the latter are: 1)  \r\nproblems of simultaneous approximation of several irrational numbers by  \r\nrationals and 2) connection between the behavior of certain class of  \r\nquantum mechanical systems and their classical limits when Plank  \r\nconstant goes to zero. The central idea is that certain properties of  \r\nclassical limits\r\n(such as hyperbolicity or ``chaos\" on the one hand and presence of  \r\ncertain types of periodic orbits on the other) is reflected in the  \r\nbehavior of quantum systems such as\r\n``unifrom distibution of quantum states \" and ``scars\".\r\n\r\n",
