Klartag\r\n\r\nThis project explores several challenging directions in the study\r\nof high dimensional convex bodies. The unifying theme of the\r\nproject is that high dimensionality, when viewed correctly, may\r\nentail simplicity and order, rather than enormous diversity which\r\nis impossible to control, the so-called ``curse of\r\ndimensionality''. In particular, the PI will address the\r\nfundamental questions regarding distribution of mass in high\r\ndimensions, the typical shape of lower-dimensional sections of a\r\ngiven convex set, and the interplay between convex-geometric\r\ninequalities and functional inequalities, mostly in the category\r\nof logarithmically concave functions. While classical convexity\r\nfocuses on fine properties of bodies or shapes in a fixed\r\ndimension, in the asymptotic theory one views the dimension as\r\nbeing finite, yet tending to infinity.  We aim at bridging\r\nbetween these two disciplines, both by applying classical tools\r\nto the study of asymptotic questions, and by drawing corollaries\r\nof a classical flavor from asymptotic results. These corollaries\r\nare often of an almost-isometric nature, not only isomorphic.\r\n\r\nThe study of high dimensional objects is common to various\r\nscientific disciplines, including statistical mechanics, the\r\ntheory of machine learning and asymptotic combinatorics, to name\r\na few. Connections between these areas and asymptotic convex\r\ngeometry have already begun to emerge.  A better understanding of\r\nthe high dimensional phenomena from the geometric viewpoint has\r\nthe potential to contribute to the development of the\r\naforementioned fields and to others\r\n",
