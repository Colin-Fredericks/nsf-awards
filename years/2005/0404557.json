 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research includes two main projects. The first one, counting\r\nmanifolds, is in a sense a continuous analog of asymptotic group theory.  \r\nThe guiding line is to convert finiteness results about locally symmetric\r\nmanifolds, which follow from rigidity phenomenon and arithmeticity, to\r\nconcrete quantitative statements. It is closely related to some central\r\nquestions in mathematics such as the congruence subgroup problem, and to\r\nthe remarkable finiteness theorem of Borel and Prasad, and it has\r\napplications in Riemannian geometry, number theory and theoretical\r\nphysics. This project continues earlier work of the P.I. and joint work of\r\nthe P.I. with Burger, Lubotzky and Mozes. The second main project concerns\r\nembeddings of free groups into groups with some geometric structure. This\r\nplays a central role in the study of linear and topological groups (in\r\nparticular subgroups of Lie groups over local fields), and impacts some\r\ntopics in differential geometry, ergodic theory, geometric group theory,\r\nunitary representations and profinite groups.  One target, which the P.I.\r\npursues in collaboration with E. Breuillard, is to obtain an effective\r\nversion to Tits alternative, a weak version of which was proved by Eskin,\r\nMozes and Oh, while solving Gromov's exponential growth conjecture. Other\r\nproblems are related to the Auslander conjecture. This project is also\r\nrelated to the study of dense subgroups of analytic Lie groups, and the\r\n``opposite'' problem of classifying the (analytic) metric completions of a\r\ngiven countable group.\r\n\r\nThere are several classical finiteness statement concerning locally\r\nsymmetric spaces which have been known for more than 30 years, and yet\r\nhave no quantitative proofs, or for which the existing estimates are\r\nsuboptimal. One example is the classical theorem of Wang (and its strong\r\nversion due to Borel and Prasad) about the finiteness of the number of\r\nmanifolds with bounded volume; we would like to have good estimates for\r\nthis number. Another example is the fact that the fundamental group of a\r\nmanifold with finite volume is finitely presented; the size of a minimal\r\npresentation can be estimated in terms of the volume. More generally, we\r\nstudy relations between the volume of manifolds and their geometric\r\nstructure. The second project deals with free subgroups. In his celebrated\r\n1972 paper J. Tits proved that any finitely generated linear group which\r\nis not virtually solvable contains a non-commutative free subgroup. This\r\nresult, known today as the Tits alternative, answered a conjecture of Bass\r\nand Serre and was an important step toward the understanding of linear\r\ngroups. Any improvement in Tits' theorem has immediate corollaries in\r\nvarious different fields of mathematics. The P.I. and E. Breuillard had\r\nrecently established a topological version of Tits theorem which answered\r\nseveral questions in dynamics, Riemannian foliations and profinite groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
