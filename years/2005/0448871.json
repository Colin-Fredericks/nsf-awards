 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling of coupled continental tectonics, mantle dynamics, and surface\r\nprocesses will be undertaken to explore surface deformation and deeper\r\nmantle flow during continental collision. Surface erosion will be\r\nincorporated into the models to explore the interaction between tectonics\r\nand atmospheric processes. Model predictions will be compared to data from\r\ncollisional settings to provide a better understanding of continental\r\ncollision. The links between continental growth and the Earth's thermal\r\nevolution will also be explored. A combination of theory, numerical\r\nsimulations, and lab experiments will be used to provide insight into\r\ncoupled planetary cooling and continental growth. Geochemical data will\r\nprovide constraints on continental growth. The methodologies developed to\r\nmodel the interaction between conducting continents and the convecting\r\nmantle will also be used to address hydrothermal convection below\r\ninsulating cap rock and the cooling history of magma chambers within host\r\nrock. The PI's modeling across earth science sub-fields will provide unity\r\nbetween his teaching and research. Lecture demonstrations, i.e., models\r\ndesigned for education, can convey general foundational ideas that students\r\nthen link to approach a range of earth science problems. This will allow\r\nstudents in introductory classes to see that scientific ideas are not isolated\r\nbits of information. The broader impact is that a portion of the student\r\npopulation that will not go into science will have a clearer view of what\r\nscience is. Demonstrations will also be used in a reverse mode. A workshop\r\nwill be developed where advanced students will build demonstrations and simple\r\nexperiments of their own design to convey key ideas from their primary earth\r\nscience field. In presenting their work to each other they will see how many\r\nkey concepts do not care about artificial sub-field boundaries. They will\r\nsee connections and be better prepared to make new ones. The space will also\r\nhouse a scientific visualization studio where students will work on effective\r\nvisual communication of scientific ideas. The workspace/studio will be\r\navailable to K-12 educator colleagues in the Houston area.",
