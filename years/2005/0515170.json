When explicit temporal integration is employed, stability requirements restrict the global simulation time step. The time step bound is driven by the finest mesh patch or by the highest wave velocity, and is typically (much) smaller than necessary for other variables in the computational domain. Improvements in the efficiency and overall simulation capabilities  require the development of new, adaptive, multirate time integration methods. The development of multirate\r\nintegration is challenging due to the conservation and stability constraints which time stepping schemes need to satisfy.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the proposed project is to develop efficient time stepping methods for parallel simulation of large-scale time-dependent PDEs.  Multirate algorithms will be constructed such that: (1) different\r\ntime steps can be used in different subdomains to achieve efficiency; (2) the methods can be constructed with high order of temporal accuracy;  (3) linear and nonlinear stability impose only local restrictions of the step\r\nsize (e.g., local Courant numbers); (4) the methods are conservative; and (5) different methods can be applied to different processes in multi-physics simulations.  The research approach is to employ the\r\nframework of multirate integration for both Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods. The multirate integration techniques will inherit the strong stability properties of the corresponding single rate integrators.\r\nMoreover,  implicit-explicit multirate methods will be constructed, which are appropriate for multiphysics multiscale simulations. The methods will be illustrated in real-life, multi-scale, multi-physics simulations\r\narising in the prediction of atmospheric pollution.",
