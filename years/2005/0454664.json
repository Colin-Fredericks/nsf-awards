 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposers have carried out kinetic simulations of shocks in space plasmas for more than 15 years, and started developing large scale, 2D and 3D kinetic simulations more than 5 years ago. Based upon this experience and the successful results of such work, the proposers plan to investigate the acceleration and evolution of energetic ions at interplanetary shocks through large-scale ion-kinetic simulations, in combination with a detailed analysis of relevant ACE data at shock passage. The prime objective is to understand theoretically and quantitatively how peak fluxes and their spatiotemporal profiles depend on plasma and shock parameters through the solar cycle. The PI's simulations and observations will determine the most important qualitative and quantitative features of the energetic ions and associated turbulence, and address the question of how the various acceleration and scattering mechanisms work together to produce relatively large energetic ion fluxes at medium and low Mach number interplanetary shocks. \r\n\r\nShock acceleration is one of the most widely implicated processes for energetic particle generation in cosmic plasmas. To date, no study of ion acceleration at interplanetary shocks and associated Energetic Storm Particle (ESP) events has been performed under consideration of the large-scale, truly self-consistent, kinetic turbulence present in the far upstream and downstream. A stated goal of the SHINE program is to understand the transport and shock acceleration of ions in the interplanetary medium. With the presence of the MURI and SolarCISM groups at SSL/ UC Berkeley, there is already a significant involvement with the SHINE community, including timely sharing of results, collaboration, and taking on community responsibilities. The proposers will disseminate results broadly through printed and online media, and are preparing to allow remote Internet access to observations and simulation results. A graduate student will be trained in all components of energetic particle observations and modeling. The PI's exceptionally strong background in the creation of interactive pedagogical applications will be retained to start a new educational outreach program surrounding the Space Weather and SHINE themes, building on concrete examples of this project.\r\n",
