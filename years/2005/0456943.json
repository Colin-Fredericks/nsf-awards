 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the primary goals of nuclear physics research is to determine how \r\nthe constituents of a nucleus interact with each other and what phenomena \r\noccur due to these interactions.  New opportunities to explore these\r\ninteractions have emerged with the development of improved experimental \r\ntechniques and facilities.  For example, nuclei whose proton or neutron \r\nnumbers are very different from those of naturally occuring isotopes are now \r\nstudied with high intensity radioactive beams. A comparison of the expermental \r\nresults from these facilities with the predictions of the proposed calculations \r\nwill provide an understanding of the phenomena and their dependence on the \r\nunderlying interaction.  Such calculations also provide a guide for \r\nexperimentalists by telling them which experiments will yield information on \r\nspecific components of the interaction or which experiments will produce a \r\ndesired phenomena.  Many of these calculations will lead to a better \r\nunderstanding of the types of radiation emitted from stars and how elements \r\nare made inside stars.  In addition, a theory of how the protons and \r\nneutrons that comprise a nucleus interact with each other can be extended to \r\nthe interactions among protons, neutrons, and the many unstable particles \r\nthat exist for only fractions of a second.  Therefore, an additional task is to \r\ndevelop and test these more general interactions.  It is likely that the \r\nparticles that are unstable here on Earth can be stable under extreme \r\nconditions such as inside neutron stars and, therefore, alter the properties \r\nof neutron stars.\r\n",
