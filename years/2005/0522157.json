 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dissertation Research- Conceptions of the Fetus in Haitian Immigrant Culture\r\nProject Summary:\r\n\r\nRecent federal legislation has resulted in changes by which fetuses are now considered \r\nrights holders and persons with national identities.  Those changes compel our nation to \r\nprotect our unborn through the recognition of individualrights for the fetus. Most of the \r\nwork exploring the implications of the emergence of fetuses as rights holders has focused\r\non isues of  women's control over their bodies or abortion politics. Women, however, are \r\nimagined generically; the differences among women which could shape the impact of these \r\nissues have not yet been critically examined. For example, very little work has explored\r\nthe important question of what these developments mean for pregnant immigrant women of \r\ncolor with uncertain legal status.  This dissertation research will explore how routine\r\nmedical procedures and recent legal initiatives shape the way Haitian women giving birth\r\nin the United States imagine and redefine rights, national identities, and citizenship in light\r\nof the fetus. \r\n\r\nThis work will use ethnographic data-participant observation in clinics and\r\ncommunity settings in South Florida and the collection of Haitian women's narratives\r\naround their experiences in prenatal care. In addition, this work will be grounded within\r\ntheir pre-existing notions of reproduction and motherhood, and therefore explore the\r\nintertwining of social and biological reproduction. This project will use the comncept \r\nof \"fetal positions\" (Casper 1994), that is, being mindful of the many ways in which the fetus is\r\nconstructed, used or represented, as well as the multiple actors associated with these\r\npositions as a means to incorporate ethnographic data with current legislative and media\r\nrepresentations of the idea of fetuses as rights holders and persons with national identity. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit and Broader Impact of Project\r\nThis research adds to the theoretical and practical issues which have to do with the\r\nadoption and utilization of new technologies (in this case, prenatal care and reproductive\r\nimaging) and the state's ability to define rights holders . Although a fewanthropologists have begun to investigate the construction of fetal personhood in crosscultural contexts, this project inquires how immigrants negotiate differing conceptions of the fetus, and consequently, how these alternative ideas affect their experiences in prenatal care. Although this project addresses larger theoretical issues\r\naround reproduction and identity, one of the most beneficial aspects of science and\r\ntechnology research is its ability to engage larger political issues. At a time when Americans are\r\nconcerned with \"protecting new life,\" the  impact on women's rights as well as women's experiences in\r\npregnancy have become increasingly important. In addition, as Haitians continue to stream into the United States, their existence in America continues to be highly contested. By investigating the (re)production of the next Haitian-American generation, we can begin tosee how current issues in reproductive politics and immigrant identity can be explored through \"fetal positions.\"\r\n\r\n",
