 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, funded jointly by the Divisions of Chemistry and Chemical Transport Systems, provides support to the Council for Chemical Research (CCR) for travel grants to 20 advanced chemistry and chemical engineering Ph.D. students, thereby enabling their participation in the CCR annual conference. The student responsibilities will include assisting the chairs of discussion groups and serving as facilitators in workshops. These activities, will lead to relationships with CCR members that are expected to continue beyond the annual meeting. The Council for Chemical Research is the only organization of its kind, and student participation at the annual meeting will provide a unique learning experience for the students, and put them in contact with leaders in industry, academia, and government. The student participants will be required to write a short report on their participation at the meeting. Special efforts will be made to determine if meeting participation had any influence on the students' career decisions.",
