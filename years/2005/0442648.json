 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project will continue the analysis of data obtained by a network of autonomous magnetometers deployed on the antarctic continent by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS).  The magnetometers provide information on the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetic field, an area of research that is particularly important in the context of space weather, and the effect of solar events on the operation of satellites and ground-based electronic systems.  The data analysis will be a collaborative project among scientists at Augsburg College, the University of New Hampshire, and at BAS, and will focus especially on ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves and transients.  In particular on Pc1 and Pc2 waves, both dayside events triggered by sudden increases in the solar wind dynamic pressure, and dawn-side events apparently related to the injection of ions from the magnetotail.  Studies of irregular ULF waves, especially during magnetic storms and substorm periods are a further area of interest.  These analysis efforts are highly suitable for undergraduate research participation and build on currently strong programs of faculty and student research. \r\n\r\n",
