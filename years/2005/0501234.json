 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Program for IT Acceleration is a technical work based learning program for high school students dually enrolled in computer and information technology degree programs at the Daytona Beach Community College Advanced Technology Center (ATC). The ATC is a public-private partnership of the community college, two K-12 school districts, and the business community. High school juniors and seniors engage in a competency-based occupational and academic curriculum of articulated and dual enrollment courses that enables them to earn a minimum of 12 college credits toward A.S. or A.A.S in one of seven IT programs: Computer Engineering Technology, Electronic Engineering Technology, Computer Support Specialist, Network Services Technology, Computer Programming, Computer Information Technology, and Internet Services Technology, while completing their high school graduation requirements. The ATC opened its doors in August 2001 and had an August 2004 enrollment of 309 secondary students and 1,283 community college students. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The Program for IT Acceleration is improving student learning of important principles by supplementing on-site learning with off-site experiential learning. The program outcomes are establishing research-based evidence of the efficacy of an integrated, competency based academic-occupational curriculum for secondary students. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The Program for IT Acceleration is increasing high school completion rates and postsecondary enrollment by integrating hands-on learning, technical applications, and work-based experiences into the academic programs of the ATC. The project is enhancing student learning by reinforcing skills in a workplace setting with an emphasis on communication, responsibility, and positive work habits, and increasing their knowledge of the IT industry.\r\n\r\n",
