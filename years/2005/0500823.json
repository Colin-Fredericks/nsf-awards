 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focus on problems at the interface of commutative algebra and\r\nalgebraic geometry. Specifically, several commutatative algebraic\r\napproaches to problems in higher dimensional birational algebraic geometry\r\nare proposed. These include building on the PI's prior work on ideal cores\r\nto prove a conjecture of Kawamata's on the existence of a global section\r\nfor any ample line bundle on a smooth projective variety which is adjoint\r\nto an ample bundle. It also includes the development of the theory of\r\nmultiplier ideals in the singular setting, and a study of the commutative\r\nalgebraic properties of jet schemes, especially for combinatorially rich\r\ncases such as monomial schemes.\r\n\r\nThe work proposed here is part of the broader landscape of research in\r\n\"pure\" algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, the fields that study\r\nthe geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) that can be described\r\nby polynomial equations. These fields provide the underpinnings of several\r\nimportant areas of applications of mathematics to problems in government\r\nand industry.  Examples include error-correcting codes based on algebraic\r\nvarieties, and computer-aided design (CAD) which \"draws\" geometric objects\r\non the computer screen by plotting pieces of algebraic varieties. While\r\nthis project does not address specific current problems in applications,\r\nit does contribute to the healthy thriving infrastructure of the subject\r\nnecessary to support applications in the future. Furthermore, it is\r\nexpected that several of trainees in this project will continue later with\r\nmore applied aspects of the subject by moving to positions in industry and\r\ngovernment  (such as the National Security Agency).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
