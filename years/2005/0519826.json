This is the 24th annual conference, a major event in computer communications and networking which brings researchers and practitioners of every aspect of digital communications and networks together to present the most up-to-date results and achievements in the field.  Since its inception, the organizers of this annual conference have endeavored to provide professionals with a cutting-edge forum to exchange and publish their work and ideas.  Participation in events like this is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  The support provided enables the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend INFOCOM 2005.",
