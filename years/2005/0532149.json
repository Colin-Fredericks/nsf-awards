 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ACM/USENIX Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services, to be held in Seattle, WA from June 6th  through the 8th, has established itself as the preeminent venue for mobile and wireless systems work.  It is a single-track conference, with rigorous peer review, and an acceptance rate of less than 25%.  A \"systems\" perspective is particularly important in the mobile setting, because (1) the changing mobile environment requires each component to adapt; doing so in isolation leads to inefficiencies or worse, and (2) applications at this level are generally dependent on context; something that cannot be determined at a single system layer.  Training students in these and related issues is critical in developing the workforce expertise required to maintain leadership in this emerging area.  Participation in events like this is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  The support provided enables the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend MobiSys 2005.",
