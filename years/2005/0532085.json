 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the purchase of a mid-size computational\r\nsystem that will support computational mathematics research\r\nby four faculty members and their student research associates\r\nin the department of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\r\nThe four projects are in distinct areas of science. \r\n\r\nOne project aims to develop and test computational methods to\r\nstudy how mass is accreted onto (sucked into) black holes. \r\nBlack holes are massive compact objects that induce such strong\r\ngravity that not even light can escape them and\r\noccur in our universe in several forms including\r\nas super-massive black holes at the center of galaxies and\r\nat the scale of stars in the form of x-ray binaries.\r\nThe detailed physics of the accretion process and\r\nthe resulting dynamics are not yet fully understood.\r\nThe goal of this project is the development\r\nof accurate and efficient computational methods for further\r\nunderstanding of these processes.\r\n\r\nA second project is to study the impact of `small scale' physical \r\neffects that have not been explicitly included in current\r\ncomputational models of the atmosphere, oceans and the climate.\r\nThose effects are either ignored for lack of computer power,\r\neven on today's -- and tomorrow's-- state of the art supercomputers,\r\nor are indirectly included through crude, semi-empirical formulas.\r\nComputer calculations and theory on `simplified'\r\nmathematical models (i.e. the 3D Boussinesq equations for rotating\r\nand stratified flow) of relevance to weather and climate modeling, have\r\nshown that these small scales effects can be very significant\r\nand contrary to the semi-empirical formulas.\r\n\r\nA third project aims to develop and test numerical methods that can\r\nefficiently deal with multiscale problems in quantum and classical\r\nmechanics. The study of these problems is central to many areas of\r\nmathematical physics and modern technology (e.g. Nanoscience,\r\nplasmas, micro-electro-mechanical-systems [MEMS],...). In recent\r\nyears we have made significant progress in devising robust and\r\nefficient numerical methods to compute multivalued solutions that\r\narise in quantum mechanics and geometric optics.  In this proposal\r\nthat work will be extended to compute solutions with interfaces\r\nthat couple classical and quantum regimes. The goal is to  provide a\r\n semiclassical approach that is slightly more expensive than a\r\n classical approach but much less expensive than a quantum\r\n simulation based on solving directly the Schrodinger equation.\r\n One particularly important application is the nano-scale\r\n quantum dots that are a standard product of modern semiconductor\r\n manufacturing procedures.\r\n\r\nThe fourth project continues the study of recurrent unstable coherent\r\nstates that have been discovered in the flow of simple fluids such\r\nas air or water flowing in pipes, channels or over airplane wings,\r\naround boats, cars or other vessels. Such flows are typically in a complex\r\n`turbulent' state characterized by apparently random eddy motions,\r\nbut the newly discovered coherent states (i.e. structured and well-organized)\r\ncapture many key features and characteristics of turbulent flows.\r\nThese discoveries suggest that some deep theoretical ideas that have\r\nbeen successful for small systems in `chaos'  theory may be applied\r\nand extended to much more complex fluid systems. One aim of the project\r\nis to provide a catalog of key unstable coherent states that might be\r\nconsidered a `turbulence genome project'.",
