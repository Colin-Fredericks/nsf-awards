 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: Remarkable advances have been made in recent years in the development of small,\r\nagile, relatively inexpensive mobile autonomous vehicles and sensors, ultimately intended for a wide variety of\r\npurposes such as search and rescue, exploration, environmental monitoring, distributed sensing, the cleaning\r\nand maintaining of structures, etc. The existence of such devices and the anticipated development of still more\r\nadvanced versions raises compelling questions: Can large numbers of small autonomous vehicles/sensors be\r\nsuccessfully deployed in the form of a swarm or flock as a search team, an exploration group, or something\r\nsimilar, to cooperatively carry out a prescribed task and to respond as a group to high-level management\r\ncommands? Can such a group reliably function with a centralized supervisor, with limited communication\r\nbetween members, with limited power capabilities and/or with the roles of its members not all the same and\r\nperhaps changing with time. In broad terms these are the issues which motivate this proposed research.\r\nIn particular we propose two pronged assault on the issue of coordinating large groups of mobile autonomous\r\nagents/mobile sensors. First, our intention is to continue the work we are already doing with NSF\r\nsupport, on the applications of graph rigidity to the maintaining of vehicle formations and to the localization\r\nof sensors in a large, possible mobile network. Second we propose to continue studying prototype synchronization\r\nand formation forming problems such as flocking and rendezvous, which we considered in prior\r\nwork, with the objective of uncovering new principles of cooperative control and new means to analyze such\r\nsystems. In the former category, we plan to take a hard look at how one might modify the rigidity concept\r\nso as to make in applicable to leader-follower formations. We will also look carefully at just what is required\r\nglobal rigidity wise, to enable one to determine the position of a single sensor in a non-rigid network. We\r\nwill address all aspects of the distance constrained sensor network localization problem, in an e.ort to devise\r\na provably correct distributed localization algorithm, for a moderately general class of networks.\r\nWe will explore synchronization problems and group pattern forming problems using simple high level\r\npoint models. Our aim here is not so much to solve the problems we will pose as it is to rely on them to\r\nsuggest interesting questions about cooperative control, which are potentially applicable to more realistic\r\nmodels in more realistic settings. We will look at rate of convergence issues. We will attempt to generalize\r\nand formalize the concept of analytic synchronization with the goal of creating a means of analyzing a large\r\nclass of asynchronous multi-agent motion control problems. We will be particularly interest in the structure\r\nof the switched dynamical systems which result due to the changing of neighbors in a mobile network of\r\nvehicles. What we want to know is if there are inherent structural properties we can exploit {as we did in the\r\n.ocking problem} to obtain convergence results, so as to avoid the NP hardness associated with convergence\r\nquestions with typical switched dynamical systems.\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training\r\nand learning in at least two di.erent ways. First, graduate students involved in the project will be\r\nexpected to attend and present there results at technical meetings. Second, project graduate students will\r\ncontribute to and participate in a short course on the topic which we envision organizing and giving towards\r\nthe end of the project. We cannot think of any especially unusual way in which this project might broaden\r\nparticipation of under represented groups, although we certainly would encourage such participation. This\r\nproject will enhance infrastructure for research and education in at least two ways. First we expect to\r\ncontinue our cross-disciplinary collaboration with our environmental biologist colleagues with whom we've\r\nalready been working for several years. Second, we expect to continue to collaborate with our experimentalist\r\ncolleagues at Yale and UCSB who are building a mobile sensor network test beds for trying out various\r\ncontrol algorithms. We hope to continue to contribute to broadening dissemination to enhance scienti.c\r\nand technological understanding by organizing and running boni .de interdisciplinary technical gatherings\r\nlike the Block Island Workshop on Cooperative Control we co-organized and which took take place in June,\r\n2003. We also expect to give overview talks on the subject such as the plenary presentation we gave last\r\nJuly at the MTNS meeting in Belgium, and the Penner Lecture we gave last November to the engineering\r\nfaculty at UCSD.",
