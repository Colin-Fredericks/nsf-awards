 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research targets a suite of tools (called \"3D Sketchpad\")\r\nfor creating interactive 3D illustrations. Example applications\r\ninclude a teacher explaining physics, an archaeologist recreating\r\na model of an ancient village, a high school student producing an\r\neye-catching animation, and a physician explaining a diagnosis to\r\na patient. The key innovation is to support 3D modeling by\r\ndrawing. The resulting content looks like the user's drawing, but\r\nis 3D in the sense that the viewpoint can be moved interactively.\r\nThe long-range impact of this research is fourfold. First, tools\r\nthat let ordinary people create 3D content will dramatically\r\nexpand the applications of 3D graphics. Second, expert users will\r\ndesign content that they would not have undertaken with current\r\ntools because it would be too difficult or time-consuming. Third,\r\nthese tools support 3D content that is aesthetically closer to\r\ntraditional illustration than is currently possible. Finally,\r\nthis technology will propagate synergistically with the growth of\r\npen-based computing. Tools for creating 3D drawings will\r\nultimately be commonplace on tablet PCs, palm devices, and even\r\ncell phones.\r\n\r\nA key challenge is to develop new shape representations and\r\nassociated operations that support a drawing-based interface. The\r\nresearchers are developing a new representation, called a\r\n\"layered mesh\", consisting of a multiresolution mesh that is\r\nbuilt up incrementally in layers. Each new layer responds\r\ndynamically to changes in the previous layers. Layered meshes\r\nsupport the addition of new structures (e.g. limbs of a human\r\nfigure) and surface details (bumps or bulges) at any\r\nresolution. They produce piecewise-smooth manifold surfaces of\r\narbitrary topology.  Additional challenges include the\r\ndevelopment of new non-photorealistic rendering algorithms, new\r\ninteraction techniques based on gestural input, new methods for\r\ngenerating animation via sketched input, and pattern synthesis\r\ntools whereby new shape features, stroke patterns, and motions\r\ncan all be generated from provided examples.\r\n",
