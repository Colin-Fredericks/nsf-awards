 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports the biennial Gordon Research Conference in tribology, which is the premiere basic research meeting for tribologists and supporting scientists. Coming from all parts of the world, leading scientists from universities, national labs and industries gather with young scientists and newcomers to tribology for one week of formal and informal discussions on state-of-the art issues in this multidisciplinary and multi-scale subject. The field of tribology is an interdisciplinary science that invokes knowledge and experience over an extremely wide range of size and time scales. Opportunities for Scientific and Technological Advancement is the theme of the conference, attempting to explore how improved instrumentation, computer simulations, and our basic knowledge of physical and chemical principles offers opportunities to advance the field of tribology both scientifically and for technological applications.  A number of tribological systems will be examined, with emphasis on both fundamental issues of wear, friction, and lubrication as well as significant technological advancements.  A lively and provocative meeting is anticipated.  The beauty of the Gordon research conference format is the combination of bringing many of the established intellectual leaders of the subject together to brainstorm the future in an open forum that includes young scientists and practicing engineers.\r\n\r\n",
