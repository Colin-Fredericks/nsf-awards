The workshop will bring together 25 - 30 leading researchers from various relevant disciplines such as computer science, information systems, and psychology from academic, corporate and government research programs, and will also include artists, architects and other creative individuals. The intellectual merit of this workshop and ensuing work is the common understanding how the various constituent groups can work together to (1) accelerate the process of disciplinary convergence, (2) promote rigorous research methods, and (3) increase the ambitiousness of research programs. The broader impact of the workshop stems from the fact that creativity is a key determinant of scientific, engineering, medical, cultural, and economic advancement. Therefore, improved creativity support tools are likely to bring benefits to many fields, and can raise the pace and quality of creative work in many areas. Workshop results will be distributed via the workshop web site (http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/CST) and publications in relevant newsletters, journals and conferences.",
