 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Craig J. Hawker at the University of California- Santa Barbara who proposes to thoroughly investigate the development of Click chemistry for the synthesis of novel polymeric materials. This work will advance click chemistry from a few select reactions to a broadly integrated concept in chemistry. The relative simplicity of click chemistry (very high yields, no protection/deprotection reactions) will allow the synthesis of new polymeric materials. Additionally, the author has chosen appropriate collaborators to carry out aspects of the research outside his expertise.\r\n\r\nThe Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Craig J. Hawker who will develop non-toxic catalysts for click reactions that will be environmentally friendly and extend click chemistry to a variety of applications. The efficiency and quantitative yields of click chemistry will be an appealing option to industry and academia. The proposed research will promote learning through interesting collaborations and a creative research plan. Graduate students will greatly benefit from spending 2-3 months at the laboratory of one of the collaborators. The Science Mentoring Program will help mentor high school chemistry students who are underrepresented minorities and will also benefit the graduate students involved.\r\n",
