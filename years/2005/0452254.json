 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goals of the Harvard Forest REU Site in Forest Ecology are to (1) Enhance the ability of students to undertake high-quality interdisciplinary research in a collaborative, collegial environment; (2) Encourage students to link fundamental and applied issues in their research; and (3) Cultivate the next generation of ecological scientists and educators that reflects the diversity of backgrounds and experiences of students in the United States. Students are involved in a summer research program with a central focus on the ecology of invasive species, through which they will learn how a single broad topic can be approached in depth from different scientific directions and with a variety of methods and techniques. Students interact with each other and with leading scientists from many institutions, all of whom conduct research at the Harvard Forest Long-Term ecological research site. Students and their mentors conduct investigations on a diversity of taxa - from microbes to forest trees - using tools and techniques of genetic analysis, plant and animal physiology, population biology, experimental terrestrial and aquatic community ecology, and ecosystems analysis and modeling. The Harvard Forest Summer Research Program recruits a diverse applicant pool, with particular emphasis on students from cultural and ethnic groups that are traditionally underrepresented in scientific careers. In addition to research, students attend lectures and workshops to enhance their understanding of forest ecology and to improve their verbal and written communications skills. Student research is disseminated widely, as posters and oral presentations at regional and national scientific meetings and through publications in the peer-reviewed literature. The Program incorporates an ethics component that introduces students to ethical issues. Particular attention will be paid to the experiences of students from groups that are underrepresented in scientific careers.
