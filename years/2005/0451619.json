 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Secretary-General of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) will be supported for a two-year period.  The Secretary-General (SG) will function as a member of the IUGG Bureau over this period.  The IUGG has the overarching scientific objective of improving scientific understanding in seven geosciences disciplines while at the same time working to assure that the results of the research that is conducted under the broad IUGG umbrellas can be applied to important societal and economic needs such as those generated by natural hazards.\r\n\r\nThe seven IUGG International Associations address geodesy (IAG); geomagnetism and aeronomy IAGA); hydrological sciences IAHS); meteorology and atmospheric sciences (IAMAS); the physical sciences of the ocean (IAPSO); seismology and the physics of the Earth's interior (IASPEI); and volcanology and the chemistry of the Earth's interior (IAVCEI).\r\n\r\nThese associations will convene meetings ranging from large international conferences and symposia to small focused scientific workshops and planning meetings.  The associations will encourage full access by scientists from all countries to such international meetings and will strongly encourage and promote full international exchange of scientific data and results.\r\n\r\nThe IUGG and its associations will continue to provide opportunities for scientists from developing countries to interact with their colleagues in the U.S. and other industrialized economies.  The Secretary-General will also serve as a liaison between the IUGG and the U.S. National Committee for the IUGG, thus helping to build especially effective communications between the U.S. National Committee and the IUGG.\r\n",
