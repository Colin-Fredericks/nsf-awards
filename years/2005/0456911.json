 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support of the work of Professor Michael Doyle, of the Chemistry Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.  The research will extend the PI's studies of the development and appliations of dirhodium catalysts.  Experiments directed toward gaining an understanding of the factors that control the efficiency of these catalysts will be carried out.  Since many of these catalytic reactions involve a Lewis acid-base association, catalyst efficiency as a function of acidity will be evaluated.  The potential application of dirhodium compounds as redox catalysts for the oxidation of hydrocarbons will be explored.  In addition, the unique ability of dirhodium catalysts to promote multicomponent transformations will be examined in detail.  The mechanistic insights derived from an intrinsic understanding of the properties of dirhodium catalysts are expected to guide the applications of these important materials.\r\n\r\nIn addition to achieving important advances in catalyst science, a major goal of this project is the education and training of students.  Particular attention will paid to the involvement of undergraduate students in the research.  Students engaged in this research are guided on their carrier paths to be knowledgeable and efficient in their scientific undertakings and proficient in their ability to write and communicate. \r\n",
