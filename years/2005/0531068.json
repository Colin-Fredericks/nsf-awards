 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of an award for summer internship support.  HACU, a national, non-profit organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer internship opportunities through the organization's National Internship Program (HNIP).  Through HNIP, academically prepared students throughout the US and Puerto Rico have received quality internship assignments through various federal government agencies. Students who participate in the program are exposed to various career options in the Federal sector that serve as a basis in helping them make informed career choices and solidify career objectives. In an effort to continue its collaboration with HACU, the National Science Foundation, a participating government agency, will offer challenging assignments that will broaden the exposure of students pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  As a result the Foundation actively participates in strengthening the infrastructure to achieve excellence in STEM education, by helping to prepare a diverse and competitive U.S. workforce of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\n",
