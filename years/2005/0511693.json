 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Mechanical (59) \r\nThis project is developing an undergraduate hands-on laboratory course in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) in collaboration with mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and materials engineering departments. The project is investigating two critical barriers that limit advancement of interdisciplinary learning in MEMS: (1) incompatible prerequisite background from differing departmental majors and (2) high overhead in terms of facilities, cost, time, and personnel expertise. The method to overcome those barriers focuses on reducing the cost and equipment barrier by using semi-custom design flow and medium-resolution mask technology to increase the affordability and practice of open-ended student learning processes.\r\n\r\nOutcomes and activities include: 1) Lowering obstacles by articulating pre-requisites as opposed to mere course listings; 2) Adapting MEMS best practices from other institutions; 3) Developing a summary of student contributions; 4) Providing a written evaluation of the progress toward project goals and submitting the results to College of Engineering curriculum committee; 5) Disseminating the results of the project through engineering education publications; 6) Developing MEMS modules that will support the institutions outreach program in hands-on microengineering; 7) Developing a shareable digital library of partially standardized mask sets and process recipes; 8) Developing a written plan for on ongoing assessment and continual improvement of their MEMS laboratory course, process capabilities and how this would contribute to research and independent study, and 9) Institutionalizing results of the project. \r\n\r\nThe project is engaging students collaboratively and evaluating their performance to (1) provide feedback on the effectiveness of student learning, (2) determine how to lower artificial barrier-to-entry for future students interested in MEMS, (3) enhance the flow and technical outcomes of laboratory activities, and (4) create a challenging interdisciplinary environment. The leadership team is collaborating with their strong microelectronics industrial support network.\r\n",
