 "awd_abstract_narration": "John D. Weeks of the University of Maryland, College Park is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for work on the development of a physically motivated and generally applicable theory by which one can understand equilibrium structure, thermodynamics, and phase transitions in nonuniform liquids. Weeks is extending his local molecular field (LMF) approach to allow the consideration of more complex systems such as discrete-charge and charge- and size-asymmetric electrolyte models, charged macromolecules and fluids of polar molecules or charged solutes in polar solvents. Problems in this area are of great interest both because of the serious challenges they present to our present theoretical understanding and because of their practical importance in biophysical and industrial applications. The work is expected to have a broad impact on a number of fields, including biology and materials science.",
