 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will provide a group of six U.S. graduate students and a faculty advisor from Brown University with support for annual summer research visits to the University of Paris VI (Universite Pierre et Marie Curie) and University of Paris VII.  The purpose is to introduce students to mathematical research in analysis, partial differential equations, number theory and scientific computing.  The summer program is led by David Gottlieb of Brown University and Yvon Maday of the University of Paris VI.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe goal of this international research and education effort is to engage students in mathematics research within the context of active research collaborations between Brown University and French mathematicians.  U.S. and French faculty members will develop programs in scientific computing (high order accuracy methods for time dependent problems), functional analysis, and number theory.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will provide research training to graduate students and advance their careers through new connections to leading French mathematicians.  Designed for second year Ph.D. students, the summer program incorporates opportunities to engage students in a wide variety of mathematics research.  After this initial experience in France, U.S. students become eligible to participate in a joint Ph.D. program between Brown University and the University of Paris VI.  This component is a significant and unique aspect to summer research abroad.  Students continue their connections with France until completion of their Ph.D. with the possibility of maintaining their collaboration with French colleagues through their career.",
