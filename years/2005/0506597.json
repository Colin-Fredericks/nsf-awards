 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a SGER to support the PI's proposal to collect, archive and repatriate the Arctic research materials of Dr. Toshio Yatsushiro's collection from 1959 and 1960 field seasons in Nunavut.  Dr. Yatsushiro is eighty-seven years old; part of the proposed project is to not only collect the materials, currently stored in Yatsushiro's private residence, but to interview Yatsushiro about his field research and the collection.  In addition to collecting and archiving the materials, the PI will repatriate the collection to Nunavut.  In the repatriating and archiving of the material, the PI and his assistant will interview the remaining individuals in Nunavut who were participants in the original research project.\r\n\r\nThe PI is dedicated to the return of the materials to Nunavut's capitol, Iqaluit, fulfilling inquiries by local people about the material and exemplifying OPP/NSF \"Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic.\"  In addition, the PI will do outreach through lectures in the local schools, museum, and college.  This is an archive of unprecedented value and this project is a model for other researchers to follow in repatriating and preserving their data for future use by indigenous people in the Arctic.",
