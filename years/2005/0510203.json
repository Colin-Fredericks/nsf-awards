 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of computing a Fourier representation of data is a\r\nfundamental one, that arises in many areas of mathematics, science,\r\nand technology.  Recently, a class of algorithms has been proposed to\r\napproximate the Fourier transform, with provable quality guarantees,\r\nin dramatically less time than required by traditional exact\r\nalgorithms.  The investigator and his colleagues evaluate competing\r\nvariations of the algorithm, both proposed and new, and choose the\r\nbest from among them for general purpose use as well as for specific\r\napplication to Magnetic Resonence Imaging and solution of partial\r\ndifferential equations, including advection-diffusion equations.\r\n\r\nThe Fourier Transform is a fundamental technique with many\r\napplications.  The investigator and his team investigate recent\r\napproximate methods that are dramatically more efficient than\r\ntraditional methods.  The team directly addresses applications to\r\nbiomedical Magnetic Resonance Imaging and the modeling of liquid and\r\ngas behavior, which has further applications to studying the\r\natmosphere and bodies of water in the environment, as well as\r\napplications to manufacturing.  The investigator and his team also\r\nmake available fundamental tools that will be useful to others in a\r\nbroad range of scientific, educational, and engineering settings\r\nincluding modeling the interactions of tiny particles, reliable\r\ntelecommunications, and imaging generally.  The project combines\r\ncutting-edge techniques from several disciplines and trains a graduate\r\nstudent in these techniques and their integration.\r\n\r\n",
