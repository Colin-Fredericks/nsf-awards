 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award integrates a research plan that advances the fundamentals of engineering design methods with an innovative educational plan that includes strong outreach to the K-12 community. Robust design is a set of techniques for systematically exposing designs to adverse conditions and seeking designs with improved reliability.  At present, the principal theoretical foundation of robust design is statistical Design of Experiments.  The current foundations are well suited for efficiently constructing models in the presence of experimental error.  However, in many engineering scenarios, the goal is not model building per se, but efficient improvement of the artifact and/or efficient learning by the experimenter.  Therefore, this project seeks new theoretical foundations for robust design including models of engineering systems, models of the environment in which experiments are conducted, and models of the experimenters' learning and adaptation.  This project also seeks to develop and validate new robust design methods and test them in authentic applications via partnerships with industry.  \r\n\r\nThis research holds potential for direct, near-term impact on corporate product development processes and training programs.  The research will also directly influence the education of professionals who will lead major engineering projects and quality improvement programs within the next five years.  In addition, the project includes outreach through children's educational television.  Working with WBGH, the award winning producers of ZOOM and Nova, we will develop a children's TV program about engineering design.  The program will feature kids engaged in engineering - designing systems, planning and interpreting experiments, and building hardware.  Through this outreach effort, young people will be exposed to the philosophy behind the research - experiment frequently, induce failures, and adapt quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
