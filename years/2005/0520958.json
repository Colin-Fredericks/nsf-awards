 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to support travel for 15 participants from the United States to attend the International Workshop on Biomanufacturing, which will be held in Beijing, China, from June 29 to July 1, 2005.  This workshop will review the recent advances in biomanufacturing with an emphasis on state-of-the-art research and development of bio-manufacturing processes, process science and engineering, novel process equipment, and applications to tissue-engineered substitutes, artificial organs, orthopedic implants, and medical devices.  The workshop topics will also cover new generation of microvasculature networks and biological chips produced by cell/protein printing and patterning.  Particularly, the workshop will focus on solid freeform fabrication and the solid freeform fabrication-based biomanufacturing, bio-coating, micro-fabrication, novel fabrication processes for cell and organ printing, construction of analogy tissue precursor and advanced 3D tissue scaffolds, and computer-aided tissue engineering.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together multi-disciplinary researchers to review an emerging field of biomanufacturing and its applications to biomedical and tissue engineering.  The workshop will identify synergy between engineering design/manufacturing and life sciences as well as challenges and opportunities for future research and development in the field of biomanufacturing.  The workshop dissemination will serve as a reference for investigators currently working in the field of design and manufacturing, biomanufacturing, and for others interested in entering the field of biomanufacturing, as well as for industry and governmental organizations.  In addition, the workshop will help NSF to assess China's current and future technological development in the field of solid freeform fabrication, biomanufacturing and tissue engineering.",
