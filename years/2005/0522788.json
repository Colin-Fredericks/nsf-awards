 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to investigate the thermal shock-induced fracture mode of material removal in a hybrid laser/water-jet manufacturing process for brittle materials and to develop educational and outreach activities that focus on hybrid non-traditional machining processes and enhance the local manufacturing infrastructure. In this project, a synergistic combination of low-power laser and low-pressure water-jet will be utilized to accomplish precise material removal of concrete, granite and other brittle materials by thermal shock-induced fracture mechanism rather than energy-intensive erosive wear or melting and evaporation mechanisms. A thermo-mechanical model coupled with laboratory scale machining experiments will be used to probe the design parametric space and properties associated with the hybrid manufacturing process.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the research will overcome the current limitations of the existing diamond saw, laser, and water-jet methods such as energy inefficiency, rapid tool wear, low-quality surface treatment, hazardous noise, significant waste debris, and mechanical stress-induction, with the resulting societal benefits of energy savings, economics and environment.  This research will contribute to the development of a workforce trained in advanced manufacturing technology by exposing graduate and undergraduate students to scientific and technological underpinnings such as interactions of multiple energy sources, science of fluid flow, mechanical abrasion, heating, and dissolution. Incorporating the results of this research in the required manufacturing courses will enhance the Mechanical Engineering curriculum at Iowa State University. Collaborative partnership with local manufacturer will facilitate broad dissemination of the results to the industrial sector.",
