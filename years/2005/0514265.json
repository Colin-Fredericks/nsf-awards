 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop and characterize carbon nanotubes-based multifunctional composites that merge structural functions with self-sensing and actuation. The proposed approach is aligning carbon nanotubes in a polymeric matrix using an electric field to achieve a high concentration of inclusions while keeping the composite below the percolation limit. Such composite, having well-dispersed inclusions, is expected to exhibit self-actuation and self-sensing capabilities matching those of the best electroactive ceramics while preserving the strength, environmental resistance and manufacturability of polymers. The long-range goal is to integrate all of these functions into a single material during high volume manufacturing processes such as injection molding.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research advances an innovative design paradigm that composites are optimized for a particular application by control at the microscale-level during manufacturing. The superb properties of carbon nanotubes combined with the lightweight, flexibility, and manufacturability of polymers results in multifunctional structural materials that have reduced cost, weight, power consumption, and design complexity yet exhibit superior performance. The impact of such development will spread significantly beyond structural health monitoring and vibration control in aerospace applications to medical diagnosis, self-sustainable medical devices, energy harvesting, high-tech consumer industry and others. Educational benefits are expected by integrating this research results to enhance existing and new courses. Educational efforts will have a broad impact on teaching the next generation of the workforce to utilize modern technology for solving complex engineering problems. Graduate and undergraduate students trained on this project will acquire interdisciplinary research experience and research mentorship skills. \r\n",
