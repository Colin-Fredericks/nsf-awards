 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale distributed systems are now being regularly built and\r\r\ndeployed. Being large-scale, they are comprised of many components\r\r\n- computers, communications infrastructure, storage devices, and\r\r\nso on - all of which are prone to failure (that is, exceptional\r\r\nnondeterministic behavior). Designing large-scale systems to cope\r\r\nefficiently with such failures is a difficult and ongoing problem;\r\r\nto do so effectively requires a much deeper understanding of how\r\r\nthey actually fail. To gain such understanding, the PIs are\r\r\ncollecting information on the failures of three actual large-scale\r\r\nsystems: a data grid, a desktop grid, and a peer to peer cooperative\r\r\nbackup system. This data is being collected either through cooperation\r\r\nwith other funded projects (eg, the BIRN project) or by actually\r\r\ndeploying the system themselves. The collected failure data is being\r\r\nused to develop more abstract failure models that can be used as the\r\r\nbasis of algorithm and system development. The PIs are using these\r\r\nfailure models to understand how the systems being studied can be\r\r\nimproved (for example, by having higher availability, lower overhead,\r\r\nor better performance than the original systems which are based on much\r\r\nless precise failure models). The PIs are making available all the failure\r\r\ninformation that they collect (after being anonymized) via the web.\r\r\nFailure models and protocols are being made available through papers,\r\r\nwhich are also distributed when ready via the project web site. This\r\r\ninformation is of interest to those designing, constructing and\r\r\ndeploying new large-scale systems.\r\r\n\r\r\n",
