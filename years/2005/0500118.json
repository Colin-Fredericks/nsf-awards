 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator studies Galois groups and fundamental groups \r\nin algebraic and arithmetic geometry. In particular, he studies \r\ngeneralizations of the conjectures of Shafarevich and Abhyankar on \r\nGalois groups over varieties; lifting problems for covers, from finite \r\nto mixed characteristic; and Galois extensions of the one-variable \r\nfunction field over the field of rational numbers.  Goals include the \r\ndevelopment of Galois theory in higher dimensions, understanding good \r\nreduction of covers, and computing fields of moduli of covers. \r\nAchieving these goals would increase the understanding of the geometry \r\nof surfaces and the link between number theory and topology.  Methods \r\ninclude formal patching, embedding problems, cohomology, birational \r\ntransformations, and group theory.\r\n\r\nThis project relates aspects of algebra and geometry in a way that makes \r\nit possible to achieve research results that could not be obtained using \r\neither of these two fields alone.  The geometric spaces being studied \r\ncan be defined algebraically using equations, and the project makes use \r\nof both the algebraic and geometric aspects of these spaces.  A \r\nparticular focus of the project concerns the symmetries of these spaces, \r\nwhich in turn correspond to symmetries involving the algebraic functions \r\non these spaces.  The project studies what types of symmetries can \r\noccur, which types of extensions of symmetry are possible, and what \r\ntypes of algebraic numbers are needed in order to obtain a space with a \r\ngiven type of symmetry.\r\n",
