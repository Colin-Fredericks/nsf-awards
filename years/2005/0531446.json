The WSTB's objective is to improve the scientific and technological basis for resolving important national questions and issues associated with the efficient management and use of ground and surface water resources. In carrying out its responsibilities and in serving the national interest, the Board responds to requests for evaluations and advice through ad hoc studies concerning specific and generic issues in water resources. \r\n\r\nIn this context, this project is the first step in a two-part effort by the WSTB to provide advice to NSF on the science plan and other aspects of the proposed joint program of the ENG and GEO directorates for an environmental observatory network that combines the CLEANER and Hydrologic Observatory initiatives of the two directorates. The WSTB will form a committee that will meet and write a consensus report for the NSF on key science challenges appropriate for the CLEANER-HOI program to address, and it also will provide its perspective and advice regarding the general usefulness of the environmental observatory approach for doing environmental research.",
