Analyzing only the complete cases reduces sample\r\n size, often introduces bias, and ignores information concerning \r\nrelationships among variables.  Substituting single values for the \r\nmissing observations produces a complete data set, but treating the \r\ncompleted data as if they all were real leads to an overstatement of \r\nprecision and, potentially, unwarranted conclusions.  Multiple and \r\nfractional imputation are methods that replace each missing value \r\nnot with one but with multiple, say five, plausible values. Results \r\nfrom separate analyses using the multiple completed data sets are \r\ncombined according to theoretically derived rules.  Of concern is \r\nthe performance of multiple imputation methods when sampling from \r\na finite population and when sample sizes are moderate to small.  \r\nRecent theoretical work by Kim (2004) and Kim and Fuller (2004) \r\nntroduced fractional imputation (FI) and elucidated a shortcoming \r\nof multiple imputation variance estimation.  A number of extensions \r\nto their work are feasible and expected to increase greatly the \r\nusability of FI by researchers in the behavioral and social sciences. \r\nModels for missing data can help reduce or eliminate bias and maintain\r\n statistical power by utilizing relationships among variables.  \r\nFI provides a way for researchers to calculate valid standard errors\r\n and resulting confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.  In order\r\n for researchers in the behavioral and social sciences to use FI to \r\nits full advantage, development of FI for categorical data, mixed \r\ncontinuous and categorical data, and general missing data patterns\r\n is needed.  \r\n\r\nMissing data are a serious problem for many research studies in the \r\nbehavioral, economic, and social sciences.  When respondents do not\r\n provide the desired data, subsequent analyses can be biased and \r\nless precise.  Frequently researchers simply ignore the fact that\r\n some observations are missing and report results based on those \r\nthat are observed.  Although expedient, this is not a recommended \r\nprocedure.  In the Family Transitions Study, imputation for missing\r\n responses from men and women have been very important for maintaining\r\n sample size and statistical power.  Another common response to \r\nmissing data is to impute or fill-in the empty space with a \r\nsubstitute value.  Values can be donated from observed similar \r\nindividuals, predicted through a model, or handled implicitly \r\nthrough nonresponse weighting.  These methods, if implemented \r\nappropriately with adequate data, can reduce bias.  Unfortunately,\r\n single imputations if treated as real can lead to understatements\r\n of uncertainty.  Multiple and fractional imputation methods have \r\nbeen developed to reflect uncertainty due to missing information \r\nand aim to allow researchers to both correct for bias due to missing \r\ninformation and reach valid conclusions based on the observed data. \r\n The development of theory, methods, and procedures for fractional \r\nimputation of missing values will greatly enhance the applicability\r\n of fractional imputation to problems in economic, behavioral, and \r\nsocial sciences.  Study of missing data, its causes and effects and\r\n possible remedies, is critical for the maintenance of the high \r\nquality of the Family Transitions Project study and for long-term\r\n research studies at the Mayo clinic. \r\n",
