 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is written to fund five Einstein Fellows, in various divisions of NSF, for three years.  These Fellows will assist with the work of the respective divisions.  The exact duties of each fellow will vary with the division, but typically they involve help with outreach, technical assistance and work with the logistics of the division's activities.  In addition, Fellows can often inform policy making committees of the impact of their decisions on the field.  Fellows receive a monthly stipend plus a cost of living allowance, moving expenses and an allowance for professional travel. \r\n\r\nTeachers who are chosen to be Fellows must demonstrate exceptional expertise in teaching science, mathematics or technology in elementary or secondary schools and have an interest and willingness to be involved in public policy areas.  The selection process is rigorous, involving an application and interviews. \r\n\r\nFellows will provide three written reports to the Triangle Coalition describing the Fellow's responsibilities and on-going activities.  One year after the Fellowship is completed, the Fellow will provide comment on the impact of the Fellowship on his/her career in education.  The entire program will be evaluated by an independent evaluator.  \r\n",
