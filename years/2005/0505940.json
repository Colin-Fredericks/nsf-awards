 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crystallization of polymers has a profound impact on their properties, and underpins many of their applications. Even simple homopolymers show a hierarchical structure when they crystallize, with different properties principally controlled by different structural features, e.g., melting point dependent on crystal thickness, stiffness dependent on crystal continuity and orientation. Ordinarily, only coarse control can be exerted over these key structural features. Our research aim is to synthesize polymers which will spontaneously self-assemble to give crystals whose mesoscopic structure (thickness and orientation) can be precisely directed, and tuned over broad ranges by altering the macromolecular architecture through synthesis. To this end, we will avail ourselves of the architectural control afforded by living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). We seek not to confine crystals within discrete microdomains (spheres or cylinders), but rather to establish microdomain scaffolds, formed either by crystallization or through interblock repulsion in the melt, which permit the crystals to grow for extended distances as in conventional homopolymer crystallization, but with considerably greater control over the final structure. Living ROMP provided access to two allhydrocarbon, highly-crystalline blocks (hydrogenated polynorbornene, hPN, and linear polyethylene, LPE) which are melt-miscible with a range of other noncrystallizable saturated hydrocarbon blocks at high molecular weights. Moreover, the physical properties of the amorphous block can be tuned over a wide range a 200oC range in glass transition temperature, for example via a library of alkylnorbornenes (aN) and tetracyclododecenes (TD) provided by collaborators at Promerus Electronic Materials. Some of the architectures which we propose to explore, and the unusual features which we anticipate, are: hPN-hPaN-hPN triblock copolymers, which should show equilibrium crystal thicknesses tunable through the hPN and hPaN block lengths, as well as thermoplastic elastomer behavior which could rival or surpass that of current all-amorphous block copolymers; glassy-crystalline hPTD-hPN and hPTD-LPE diblocks, where we will elucidate the features which dictate the crystal thickness and melting point; crystallinecrystalline hPN-LPE diblocks, where we seek to demonstrate crystal polymorphism at the mesoscale; and ABC triblock copolymers, where the individual blocks may be rubbery, glassy, or highly crystalline, as a means to generate crystallites with asymmetric surfaces and to control the orientation of the crystallites relative to the microdomain interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will provide an integrated research and educational experience for two to three graduate students and three to six undergraduates over the period of the award, especially including members of underrepresented groups. Students will present their work both internally and externally, while graduate students will have concurrent roles as researchers, students, and mentors, thus ensuring integration between research and education. The PI and students will engage the general public through science outreach at the Liberty Science Center (Jersey City, NJ), by developing and presenting demonstrations illustrating the unusual and useful properties of polymeric materials. The PI and students will also support of kit-based science education for Grades 3-8 in Mercer County, and seek to introduce a kit revolving around organic and polymeric materials, following county and state educational objectives.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:  Our research revolves around polymers:  the materials you commonly encounter as plastics, fibers, and rubbers.  Our overarching goal is to conceive and synthesize polymers with new properties, or a new balance of properties, so as to create materials superior to those in use today.  A key aspect of this process is to understand what microscopic structural features of a polymer are responsible for its behavior, so that these features can be \"built into\" a polymer when a particular property is desired.  For example, conventional rubbers get their strength from \"vulcanization\" (crosslinking)&mdash;but once a material is vulcanized, it cannot be reshaped  or recycled.  An alternative are \"thermoplastic elastomers\" (TPEs), materials where the crosslinks are formed by associations between specific locations on the polymer molecules (\"physical crosslinks\"), rather than by the chemical bonds employed in vulcanization.  TPEs behave like vulcanized rubbers at room temperature, but are easily shaped at high temperatures.  A major drawback of most TPEs is that they dissolve in common organic liquids, and so cannot be used in applications such as gaskets and hoses.  Incorporating crystallinity into a polymer gives it solvent resistance, but at the price of making it less resilient&mdash;the principal quality sought in a rubber. With support from this research award, we synthesized a TPE which has crystallizable, glassy, and rubbery segments, balanced so as to capture the most desirable qualities of each, yielding a soft, resilient rubber, shaped with very low energy input when hot, yet insoluble in solvents.  We are now exploring the range of properties possible with such polymers.  A schematic of how the necessary microscopic structure forms in this material is shown in one of the images which accompany this report.\n\n     Also under support from this award, we synthesized other new TPEs based on different molecular building blocks, which have only crystalline and rubbery components.  At room temperature, the crystals provide the physical crosslinks, while the rubbery matrix provides excellent recovery from deformation&mdash;as long as the material is not stretched to more than about four times its initial length, as which point the crystals start to break up.  An example of a test specimen deformed to three times its initial length, which completely recovers when let go, is shown in another of this report\u00c6s images.  But above the crystals\u00c6 melting point, the polymers flow freely and are easily shaped with little energy input.\n\n     Finally, in order to create new polymers, we often need to use new \"monomers\" (the chemical building blocks that make up the polymer), or put together (\"polymerize\") existing monomers in ways never previously achieved or conceived.  Many chemical mechanisms have been developed for polymerization over the past century, but each of these mechanisms is effective for only a limited range of monomers.  One of our accomplishments under this award was to develop a \"change of mechanism\" route to combine two polymerization mechanisms:  ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and anionic polymerization, as shown schematically in one of this report\u00c6s figures.  This approach allowed us to combine tough polynorbornene with stiff polystyrene, thereby producing a material not achievable with either ROMP or anionic polymerization alone (or by any other polymerization chemistry, for that matter). For additional information on our research and outreach activities, see www.princeton.edu/~polymer.\n\nBroader impacts:  This project provided an integrated research and educational experience for four graduate students, one postdoctoral associate, four undergraduate students, one high school student, and one visiting faculty member, thereby contributing substantially to the nation\u00c6s human resources base in science and engineering while building connections with researchers in other nations (through collaborat..."
