 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a workshop to examine how to best use existing texts to catalyze student learning and how to best shape new texts to support recent pedagogical developments, such as just-in-time-teaching and inquiry-centered instruction.  Key participants in the workshop are the 35 recipients of the Director's Award for Distinguished Teaching Scholar (the DTS awardees) and their invited guests, who are CAREER awardees from their institutions or discipline.  Participants also include representatives of publishing houses and professional societies. The PI is planning pre-workshop and post-workshop activities to build a community of scholars and to gather examples of best practices.  The PI also is planning to post the results of the workshop on the Science Education Research Center's (SERC's) website, to prepare and distribute a complete report on the results, and to charge participants in each discipline to organize special sessions at their disciplinary meetings and to prepare reports for disciplinary newsletters.",
