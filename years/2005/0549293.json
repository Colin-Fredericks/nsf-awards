This issue will serve as an informative resource that summarizes the current state of knowledge about diversity issues in the geosciences and proven strategies to increase participation and retention of underrepresented minorities in these fields, thus serving as a catalyst for scaling up these programs and advancing their impact. \r\n\r\nComplimentary copies of this publication will be distributed to: all 2,500 individual and institutional members of NAGT; the Heads and Chairs of geosciences departments throughout the U.S.; geoscience division directors and program officers at all relevant federal agencies (NSF, NASA, NOAA, DOES, USGS, EPA); all state geologists; and all NASA mission E/PO leads and facilitator brokers. AGU and NAGT will share responsibility for manuscript review and editorial processing, as well as costs involved with publication and distribution. NSF funds are being used to cover publication costs associated with the production of the issue. \r\n",
