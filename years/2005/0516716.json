 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PcsB protein is a conserved, critical and essential protein with murein hydrolyase like features that is present in the gram positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). The long term goal of this project is to determine the functions and interactions of the PcsB protein in murein biosynthesis and cell shape determination. The following two aims are being addressed. First, the localization of the PcsB protein is being determined in wild-type and mutant bacteria by immunofluorescent approaches and phenotypes of pcsB mutants that may give insights into PcsB function(s) are being characterized. Second, the biochemical function(s) of PcsB and its interactions with other proteins, some of which may regulate its activity and binding to the cell surface, are being determined. This project will apply and refine genetic methods for use in S. pneumoniae, and provide new information and insights into the fundamental processes of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and architecture in gram positive bacteria. pneumococcus and other species of streptococcus. In addition, it will provide important new information about the links between murein biosynthesis and cell shape determination in spherically shaped bacteria. The project will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students.",
