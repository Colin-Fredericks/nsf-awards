 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site project allows eight undergraduate students to participate\r\nin a ten-week summer program at Computer Science Department of Utah\r\nState University.  This summer program focuses on several hands-on\r\nstimulating research projects including face recognition, eye tracking,\r\ndigital watermarking, image compression, and content based image\r\nretrieval.  These projects will address the broad spectrums and the\r\nchallenging issues in the field of computer vision and image processing\r\n(CVIP) and will emphasize on several CVIP techniques and their important\r\nutilities in some interesting and crucial applications.  The REU\r\nparticipants will be presented with a broad range of components in these\r\nresearch topics so that each student will be able to choose a component\r\nof a project rather than have one assigned. This research will ensure at\r\nleast four of the eight participants are underrepresented students and\r\nensure at least four students are from other institutions, especially\r\nthose institutions where research programs are limited.  This active and\r\nregional recruitment plan will especially help underrepresented students\r\nand the students who are limited exposed to research to be acquainted\r\nwith interesting research projects and gain confidence in pursuing their\r\ndegrees, seeking industrial technology related jobs, and continuing\r\npursuing an advanced degree in graduate schools.\r\n",
