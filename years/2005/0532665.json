A large number of researchers and postdoctoral fellows will be in residence at the Institute during this period, and more will visit during the program's three workshops.  One of these workshops will focus on percolation, SLE, and related topics.  This proposal requests partial support to substantially increase the number of young American mathematicians gaining access to and participating in this workshop. Researchers, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows from the program on Renormalization will be engaged in the workshop. Workshop participants will interact with them, and may extend their visit to take advantage of other program activities.  The funding will be used primarily for the travel support of graduate students and young PhDs. \r\n\r\n",
