 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning from Dynamic Visual Displays\r\n\r\nThis Science of Learning Center Catalyst research project will establish a multidisciplinary research center at the University of Kansas to study fundamental issues in human learning.  The project will draw on the expertise of cognitive scientists, natural scientists and education specialists who will explore how people comprehend visual displays and representations.  Using a variety of learning tools and supportive environments that have been developed by the KU Center for Research on Learning and the KU Center for Science Education, this SLC catalyst project will focus on the study of specific classes of visual representations including maps, online animations and animated graphics, and virtual three-dimensional environments.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research include building a broad ranging, inter-institutional research team that will initiate in-depth study of the connection between visual stimulus and learning from a variety of dynamic visual displays.  The research team will integrate approaches from human perception, cognitive science, education, and information technology systems to investigate how humans extract, apprehend, and store information from complex graphical and dynamic visual displays.  Pilot studies will examine how eye motion is linked to processes of obtaining and interpreting information from static displays (maps, graphs and charts), and dynamic visual displays (animations).  Understanding how humans acquire information from visual displays, how the mind processes that information, and how humans progress from unskilled interpreters of visual information to experts, will guide the research team in the improvement of these visual displays so that they more effectively support learning.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate that outcomes of this research program will improve the design of visual displays used for learning.  We expect these improvements to provide:\r\n\r\n-New instructional strategies for sharing organizational knowledge\r\n-Software that better supports the development of virtual working and learning environments,\r\n-Continuity in the transfer of knowledge capital in government, business and education,\r\n-Tools to support knowledge generation, rather than knowledge hoarding, as a pathway to economic growth and workforce development,\r\n-Reduced cycle time in problem resolution, product development and the dissemination of information, and\r\n-More effective strategies for online learning assessments.",
