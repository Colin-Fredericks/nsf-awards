From the genome project to cancer research, engineering is providing many of the tools to address outstanding, and challenging research problems.  Service Enterprise Engineering is one of those fields where connections to health care delivery is clear.  The workshop will accelerate the participation of Operations Research faculty and students in this new and vibrant arena.  In addition, this workshop will provide support for graduate students, and junior researchers so that the field can grow rapidly.  By connecting this meeting with the INFORMS conference, the participants will also be able to attend the major SEE conference in the country.",
