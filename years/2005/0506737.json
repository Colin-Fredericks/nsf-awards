Baldridge, Terry Lawson\r\n\r\nThis proposal funds a conference in honor of Professor Ronald\r\nFintushel's sixtieth birthday, to be held in late October or November\r\n2005 at Tulane University. Dr. Fintushel has led a distinguished\r\ncareer as a researcher in low-dimensional topology, particularly the\r\ndifferential topology of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds and\r\napplications of gauge theory to that study. His work with various\r\nco-authors on group actions on low-dimensional manifolds, and more\r\nrecent results with Ronald Stern on the homology cobordism group of\r\nhomology 3-spheres, gauge theory, and constructions of ``exotic''\r\n4-manifolds, has been an inspiration to contemporary topologists and\r\ncontinues to provide new directions for inquiry in these areas. The\r\npast two decades have been a period of remarkable progress in\r\nlow-dimensional topology, particularly the theory of smooth\r\n4-manifolds. This conference, involving leading figures in this area,\r\nwill provide participants with both a context in which to understand\r\nrecent advances and a framework for future endeavors. The speakers\r\nwill include experts in fields that Fintushel has contributed to, with\r\na focus on smooth 4-manifolds, and the audience will include graduate\r\nstudents and recent Ph.D.'s who will benefit from exposure to\r\nFintushel's fascinating and creative work. Both Ronald Stern (UC\r\nIrvine) and Peter Ozsvath (Columbia) have already expressed interest\r\nin giving lectures; other invited speakers may include John Morgan\r\n(Columbia), Tomasz Mrowka (MIT), Allan Edmonds (Indiana), Danny\r\nRuberman (Brandeis), Zoltan Szabo (Princeton), and Clifford Taubes\r\n(Harvard). The final schedule will be determined closer to the time of\r\nthe conference in consultation with Dr. Fintushel; the influence of\r\nthe guest of honor can often sway the balance in a speaker's decision\r\nto attend.\r\n\r\nAs a conference in honor of an individual, the lectures will naturally\r\ncenter on those areas of research most influenced by that\r\nindividual. Dr. Fintushel has made many contributions to an area of\r\nmathematics that has relatively recently become a crossroads among\r\ndisciplines, both within mathematics and in theoretical\r\nphysics. Conferences such as this are therefore increasingly\r\nimportant, providing researchers with a variety of perspectives on\r\nproblems that are nevertheless united by common themes. As a joint\r\nproject of Tulane University, Southeastern Louisiana University, and\r\nLouisiana State University, this conference will provide exposure for\r\nthese mathematics departments on a national level and boost the\r\nreputation of the region as a center of research. This will increase\r\nthe potential for the universities in this area to attract more\r\nhigh-quality faculty and students from around the country. Likewise,\r\nthe conference will enhance the exposure of local current graduate\r\nstudents to the latest developments in research and to the researchers\r\nthemselves.\r\n",
