 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal studies two questions in the Homological\r\nConjectures in Commutative Algebra.  The first is on \r\nintersection multiplicities defined by modules of finite\r\nprojective dimension.  This part of the proposal studies\r\nthe action on thAbstract\r\ne Chow group defined by such a module.\r\nA theorem of the Principal Investigator and V. Srinivas \r\nanswers this question in the case of dimension zero,\r\nand this research will investigate the more complicated\r\nsituation in higher dimension.  The second part concerns\r\nthe question of whether there are small annihilators of elements\r\nof local cohomology groups in finite extensions.  This\r\nquestion was inspired by a recent result of Ray Heitmann,\r\nwho proved that small powers of the prime p achieved this\r\nin rings of mixed characteristic in dimension three and\r\nused this fact to prove the Direct Summand Conjecture in that\r\ncase. In this proposal we consider alternative approaches\r\nin mixed characteristic and whether similar results hold\r\nin characteristic zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the problems that often arises in mathematics\r\nis how to measure the order of tangency, or multiplicity\r\nof intersection, of subspaces of a space.  These numbers are\r\nused, for example, to count how many solutions a given equation has \r\nor how many geometric objects of a certain type there are. \r\nWhile computing the order of tangency may seem simple for \r\ncurves intersecting in the plane, in higher dimension it can\r\nbe quite complicated.  This proposal deals with questions that arise\r\nfrom attempting to measure these algebraically.  More specifically,\r\nthe methods use Homological Algebra, and they have\r\ngiven rise to a set of questions known as the \"Homological Conjectures.\"\r\nThe particular questions in this proposal concern determining\r\nwhether these invariants are zero and studying their consequences for\r\nthe structure of rings and modules.\r\n\r\n",
