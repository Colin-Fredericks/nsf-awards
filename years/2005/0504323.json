They are the key ingredients for the pricing\r\nof financial instruments, portfolio allocation, managerial\r\ndecision-making, and financial risk management. Existing financial \r\nmodeling mostly employs parametric models like GARCH and stochastic \r\nmodels. These parametric models are used for modeling volatility \r\ndynamics of low-frequency interdaily data and generally fail to describe \r\nthe volatility patterns in high-frequency intradaily data, partly because \r\nhigh-frequency data have complex structures such as jumps and market \r\nmicrostructure noise contamination.  The investigator initiates an \r\ninnovative research on modeling and analyzing of high-frequency data.\r\nBy taking advantage of the fact that jumps, volatility and microstructure \r\nnoise tend to behave differently at different scales, he uses wavelets' \r\nmultiscale structure as a platform to realize the fact and perform efficient\r\nvolatility analysis for high-frequency return data. The proposed nonparametric \r\nmultiscale methodology is very flexible and applies to high-frequency data \r\nwith (a) microstructure noise, (b) jumps, and (c) leverage effect. It achieves \r\nthe following goals: (1) utilize all available data efficiently, (2) test and \r\ndetect jumps, (3) construct noise resistant realized volatility for estimating \r\nintegrated volatility, and (4) separate the jump variation from the total \r\nquadratic variation.\r\n\r\n    Financial data are collected at increasingly shorter time horizons. Over \r\npast decade there has been a radical improvement in the availability of \r\nhigh-frequency financial data (which is referred to as  intradaily data, \r\nwhile low-frequency data mean financial data at daily or longer time horizons). \r\nNowadays high-frequency financial data are available for financial instruments \r\non markets of all locations and at scales like minute and even individual bids \r\nto buy and sell. One example of high-frequency data is the currency \r\ntransaction data that are collected at every minute. High-frequency finance \r\nis an emerging new and challenge research field. The proposed research \r\ninvents new statistical techniques to analyze high-frequency financial data \r\nand accurately model and forecast financial markets. It \r\nadvances the understanding of high-frequency volatility and provides better \r\nvolatility evaluation for practitioners in financial industry, where mistakes \r\nand wrong judgments can lead to catastrophic consequence for the industry and \r\nthe rest of society. \r\n\r\n",
