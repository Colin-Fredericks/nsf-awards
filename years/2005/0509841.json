 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting a symposium on Green Chemistry Processes. The 1.5 day symposium, organized by Professors Dennis P. Curran (University of Pittsburgh), Howard Alper (University of Ottawa), Junzo Otera (chair, Okayama University), and Chris Strauss (CSIRO and Monash University), will take place in association with the Pacifichem meeting in Honolulu, HI, Dec 15-20, 2005. The premise of the symposium on Green Chemical Processes is that chemistry should be \"benign by design\" and that benign chemical processes start with efficient chemical reactions. The emphasis is squarely on two areas of high recent innovation and development: new chemical reactions and new chemical technologies.\r\n\r\nThe symposium on Green Chemical Processes is meant to provide a compelling opportunity to broadly simulate thinking and discussion in critical chemical circles about the power, potential and future directions of the field of sustainable chemical development. The symposium features eighteen diverse speakers that span the range of the field and represent all major Pacific rim countries. Participants in the symposium will receive a concentrated dose of cutting edge concepts and research results from the thought leaders of this rapidly advancing field, providing them with the knowledge and tools to begin to incorporate key ideas and principles into their own research. The Pacifichem meeting represents a unique venue for this symposium, bringing together a large number of chemists from a remarkably broad range of countries, both developed and developing.",
