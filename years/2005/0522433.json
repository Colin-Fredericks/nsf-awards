 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bounded Conflict:\r\nThe Consumer Price Index and American Political Economy, 1880 - 1985\r\nSince 1950, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been one of the most potent economic\r\nstatistics, largely because of its incorporation into automatic escalator clauses in union\r\ncontracts and government programs (including everything from tax brackets to\r\nsocial security payments). Yet the CPI has also been very controversial: throughout the last\r\nfifty years, economists, labor officials, politicians have debated the significance and accuracy of\r\nthe index without reaching a clear conclusion. In an award-winning dissertation, Thomas Stapleford \r\nexplored the history of the CPI and its role in American political economy, describing how and why \r\nthis ambiguous and embattled statistic became a central part of labor relations, such that by 1953 \r\na Congressional committee could label it \"the most important single statistic\" in the United States.\r\nBuilding on that project, this research extends the analysis, both chronologically (carrying it\r\nthrough the early 1970s, when Congress began to place automatic escalator clauses in\r\ngovernment programs) and comparatively (by examining the role of price indexes in other\r\ncountries and the formal adoption of other statistics into government programs).  This new work\r\nwill form the basis for a book manuscript. \r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nAlthough economic statistics are a central part of the modern state, historians are only\r\nbeginning to integrate historical study of these artifacts with 20th century political, social, and\r\neconomic history, and no such narratives exist for the United States. Turning to a different field, \r\neconomists have written several short histories of price index theory, but have not examined the\r\nCPI's historical role in industrial relations or economic policy.   By analyzing both theoretical \r\ndebates about price indexes and the changing political function of the CPI, this project demonstrates \r\nhow a rich historical account of economic statistics can illuminate questions in American history, \r\nsuch as how the form of economic statistics both reflected and shaped national economic policy, \r\nand the history of economics, such as why the CPI remained at odds with neoclassical price index \r\ntheory through most of the 20th century.  This study addresses broader issues, including the role of \r\ntechnical expertise and interest-group pressure in public policy, and tensions between reliance on \r\nhighly complex statistics in government and the traditional values of liberal democracy .\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe wide resonance of these questions and the continuing debate over the nature of\r\nthe CPI suggest the potentially large audience for this  work. As the only historical\r\nanalysis of the political context and function of the CPI, for example, this research will be useful\r\nfor public policy analysts and politicians. The investigator intends to attract a general\r\nreadership beyond academic historians by keeping the monograph relatively short (~90,000\r\nwords) and confining technical details to an appendix or academic journal articles. Furthermore,\r\nsome of the key conclusions will be presented in more popular forums (e.g., articles in political \r\nmagazines), and thereby contribute to the continuing public discussion about statistics, public \r\npolicy,  and the cost of living.\r\n\r\n",
