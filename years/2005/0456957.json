 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal requests funds to support the inaugural Northeast\r\nStudent Workshop on Nonlinear and Hybrid Control, to be held at the\r\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute from Friday, April 1, through\r\nSaturday, April 2, 2005. The goal of the workshop is to offer\r\neducational opportunities to graduate students and junior\r\nresearchers to learn about the latest developments in control\r\nsystems research, particularly in emerging application areas; to\r\npresent their research results; and to share and discuss ideas with\r\ntheir peers, as well as with faculty members from other\r\nuniversities. The proximity of the universities in the Northeast\r\nprovides an excellent opportunity to realize this goal with minimal\r\ntravel cost. Upon a successful initiation with the help of NSF\r\nfunds, these workshops will be continued biannually. The\r\nintellectual merit of the proposed activity is that it will provide\r\na stimulus for sustained research in control systems theory, as well\r\nas increased number of applications in other fields of science and\r\nengineering. The broad impact resulting from the proposed workshop\r\nwill be the encouragement of a broader and more diverse group of\r\nstudents (than those who are already able to attend major\r\nconferences in the field) to pursue research careers.",
