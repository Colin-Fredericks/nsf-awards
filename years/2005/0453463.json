 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this NSF REU site proposal is to systematically increase\r\nthe graduation rate of undergraduate students and the enrollment in graduate\r\nschool by involving undergraduate students in state-of-the-art Computer\r\nScience and Engineering research activities. This project emphasizes the\r\nparticipation of minority students belonging to groups with significant\r\ngrowth rates, in particular, Hispanic students from the University of Puerto\r\nRico Mayaguez, students from USF and other minority universities in Florida,\r\nand students from Latin American countries. During a 10-week summer session,\r\nparticipating students will learn to use tools and techniques to solve\r\ncurrent research problems in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Computer\r\nNetworks, and Digital Image Processing, as well as work on other research\r\nprojects in collaboration with the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research\r\nInstitute, the Center for Urban Transportation and Research, and the Center\r\nfor Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue. After an initial week of formal\r\norientation on the topics of research methodology, literature searching,\r\nresearch writing and presentation skills, participating students will spend\r\nnine continuous weeks with a faculty mentor working to solve a well defined\r\nproblem in a selected area of interest. Formal and informal interactions\r\nwith other students, faculty members and industry members will also be\r\nincluded in as students work on projects and attend social events.\r\n",
