 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to continue support for Ship Operations of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) Research Vessel Weatherbird II in 2005.  This proposal covers year 1 of 5 of the cooperative agreement for Jan 2005 to Dec 2009. The RV \r\nWeatherbird II is a general purpose research ship owned and operated by the Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR), Inc., a Bermuda-based United States registered not-for-profit research and education institution. Funding will be renegotiated each year and will be dependent upon the number of days at sea in support of NSF funded research programs. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe mission of the ship is to support funded science research. The vessel is scheduled for 144 days at sea in 2005 with 52 individual cruises. All but 4 of these days are in support of National Science Foundation funded science. The R/V Weatherbird II primarily supports scientific research in the oligotrophic subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic Ocean.  This region is an important modulator of the oceanic cycling of biogeochemical (N, P) and radiatively (e.g., CO2) important elements, air-sea heat and salt transport, and climate. The ease of access to these deep waters has allowed  R/V Weatherbird  II  to  significantly  contribute  to  national  efforts  to  improve  our understanding of ocean processes. \r\n \r\nFour nationally and internationally important oceanographic time-series programs are supported by R/V Weatherbird II operations, including: (1) Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) research program begun in 1988; (2) Hydrostation S begun in 1954; (3) Ocean Flux Program (OFP) begun in 1978, and; (4) Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM) begun in 1994. All four of these research programs have funded ship days in 2005. In addition, R/V Weatherbird II operations support several other NSF funded research activities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of R/V Weatherbird Ship Operations \r\nThe R/V Weatherbird II supports scientific research and technology development that improves scientific knowledge of societal relevant environmental issues. The oceanographic time-series and other scientific research programs directly contribute to improved understanding of such global issues as: (1) global climate change; (2) the complex interaction and feedbacks between climate phenomena, global warming, ocean biogeochemistry, and ecosystem variability and health, and; (3) the variability of greenhouse gases such as CO2, the exchange of CO2 between ocean and atmosphere, and variability of carbon sources and sinks. R/V Weatherbird II operations are an important contributor to education, training and public outreach. Many undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students have received training or conducted their research using the R/V Weatherbird II.  The scientific data for the BATS, Hydrostation S, BTM and OFP research programs also support education and training, being widely disseminated through easy online data access.  The R/V Weatherbird II and its crew regularly contribute to public outreach efforts. For example, the ship is part of the regular weekly BBSR educational tour to the general public. The vessel is also open for general inspection and informational tours on our annual Marine Science Day in September, when approximately 2000 visitors to the Station learn about marine research and the ongoing projects associated with it. The vessel has also played host to media and outreach organizations in 2004 and likely in 2005. \r\n",

Project Activities and Findings:\n\na)  Research \n\nOperational funding for the R/V Weatherbird II and for the R/V Atlantic Explorer, which replaced it in 2006, have supported scientific research, marine education and technology development that improves scientific knowledge of societal relevant environmental issues.\n\nMany of the major research projects that have used these vessels are oceanographic time-series efforts (http://www.bios.edu/research/time_series.html). For example, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) is an oceanographic time-series project funded by NSF.

Given the proximity of Hydrostation \"S\" and BATS to Bermuda, these cruises serve an important educational role in training future generations of potential oceanographers. At a time when fewer and fewer new scientists are going to sea, the importance of recruiting these new scientists and providing sea-going training experience is critical. \n\nThe R/V Atlantic Explorer also contains the only classroom in the UNOLS fleet that has been designed primarily for undergraduate education.\n\nII.  Justification and Cost\n\n NSF Award OCE-0505888 in the amount of $17,321,852 (cumulative amount) has supported the day to day operations of the R/V Weatherbird II and for the R/V Atlantic Explorer beginning in April 2006.
