 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nABSTRACT\r\nMost of the world's explosive volcanism occurs at widely-spaced volcanic centers\r\nalong convergent margins. Basaltic magmas from the subduction wedge are\r\nchanneled to volcanoes separated by tens or hundreds of kilometers and evolve\r\ninto silica-rich compositions associated with dome growth, pyroclastic flows\r\nand explosive eruptions. Decades of geochemical research have outlined a suite\r\nof processes which control the chemical and spatial evolution of these\r\nvolcanoes. These ideas, which rely heavily on processes in the lowermost crust,\r\nhave evolved with limited input from geophysics because the deep crust has been\r\ndifficult to probe with seismics, gravity, and/or electromagnetics. The Colima\r\nDeep Seismic Experiment is one of the first to target the deep crustal\r\nprocesses which create discrete volcanoes and ultimately control eruptive\r\nbehavior. In conjunction with the Observatorio Vulcanologico of Colima\r\nUniversity in Mexico, the PI will install and maintain a seismic array for 18\r\nmonths in the vicinity of Colima Volcano. The Observatorio is responsible for\r\nmonitoring Colima Volcano, which is in the midst of an on-going eruption cycle,\r\nand seismicity throughout the state of Colima which has had two earthquakes\r\ngreater than magnitude 7.5 in the last ten years. This project will be\r\nco-deployed with the arc-scale network of Grand and Ni (EAR #0335782) which is\r\nserendipitously centered on Colima. This array of intermediate-band instruments\r\nwill be wider than a typical volcano monitoring array and is designed to\r\noptimize seismic tomography and receiver functions of the deep crust.\r\nTeleseismic data, together with seismicity in the local crust and subducting\r\nslab, will be used to map the temperature and melt conditions beneath Colima\r\nVolcano. The results will be interpreted in the context of existing geochemical\r\nmodels for the Colima complex to address two primary questions. (i) Is the\r\nlocation and longevity of an arc volcano governed principally by diapirism in\r\nthe mantle wedge or by deep crustal conditions and Moho topography? (ii) What\r\nare the relative roles of magma ponding at the base of the crust and magma\r\nstorage in the lower crust in controlling the evolution of subduction basalts\r\ninto more silicic arc volcanics? These questions, though ideally suited to\r\nColima, have implications at all arc volcanoes. This project is co-sponsored by\r\nthe Americas Program in the International Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
