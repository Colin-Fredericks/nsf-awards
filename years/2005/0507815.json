The remarkable success of the Spark Plasma Sintering/Synthesis (SPS) method in achieving heretofore unattained goals in the consolidation and simultaneous synthesis and sintering of materials has generated considerable interest. This has led to a significant increase in the use of the method over the past decade. At present there are over 200 SPS facilities in the world and several regional and international symposia have been organized in recent years on this topic.\r\n\r\nAs part of Pac Rim 6, the planned symposium will address topics on the use of an electric field (current) in the processing and combustion synthesis of materials. Papers covering both experimental as well as modeling studies on the use of the SPS method will be solicited. The symposium is planned for two to three days (4-6 sessions) and will include several invited talks. NSF is providing travel support for primarily junior faculty and graduate students.  The success of the planned symposium will have considerable impact on fundamental as well as practical arenas related to the synthesis and processing of materials. With respect to the former, it promises to contribute to our understanding of the role of an electric field (current) on mass transport in combustion synthesis, and with respect to the latter, it will provide processing information for the synthesis of unusual products, including nano-structured and functional materials. \r\n",
