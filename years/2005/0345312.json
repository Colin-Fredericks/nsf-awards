 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determination of paleoslopes in ancient fluvial systems has potentially broad, but\r\nlargely untapped, application to quantitatively constraining the history of tectonics and\r\npaleoclimate in continental sequences. The objective of this project is to, first, flesh out a\r\nnew approach to calculating paleoslope and associated information, such as water and\r\nsediment flux, from sandy braided stream deposits. The second objective is to apply the\r\nmethod to the Kayenta Formation (Jurassic) on the Colorado Plateau to demonstrate the\r\nutility of the method in reconstructing aspects of long-term climate change from the\r\nancient record of fluvial deposits found on a regional scale. The key to reconstructing\r\npaleoclimate as proposed here is to estimate paleowater flux from estimates of paleoflow\r\ndepth (as determined from bar forms) and calculations of paleoslope. Paleoslope\r\ncalculation follows a novel approach utilizing the Rouse Number, an indicator of grainsize\r\nfractionation between bed load and suspended load in water flows. The key tool to\r\napplying the method is the use of high-precision, rapid, grain-size determinations\r\navailable using equipment housed at M.I.T. Preliminary results show the approach works\r\nwell in the modern and yields remarkably consistent comparisons with the Kayenta\r\nFormation. Theoretical modeling of climate impact on fluvial systems suggests that longterm\r\nclimate change may produce a very different stratigraphic record than short-term\r\n(Milankovich scale) changes. Hence application of the method to the ancient not only\r\nprovides an example of what the method can do, but will help answer specific questions\r\nregarding how the long-term change from dry to wet to dry conditions represented by the\r\nWingate-Kayenta-Navajo formations of the Glen Canyon Group, respectively, affect\r\nriver systems. By systematically applying the methodology to the Kayenta Formation, we\r\nwill obtain statistically significant probability distributions of aspects of paleoflow (slope\r\nand water flux) that can be compared between sites within the unit to show how river\r\nsystems changed down basin and over time. Such an application will demonstrate the\r\nutility of the paleohydraulic reconstruction approach to paleoclimate reconstruction that\r\ncan be applied to other sandy fluvial deposits in the ancient record.\r\nThe broader aspects of the study include training a female Ph.D. student at the\r\nUniversity of Wyoming in quantitative methodologies of sedimentation. An\r\nundergraduate at M.I.T. will also be trained in field and laboratory techniques as part of\r\nthis project. In addition, the research includes a tie to an NCED (National Center for\r\nEarth-Surface Dynamics) facility, allowing for outreach of this NSF-funded Science and\r\nTechnology Center.",
