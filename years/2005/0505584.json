 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demands on statistical methodology have grown relentlessly\r\nas new technologies for data collection appear.  Many of\r\nthese datasets are unusual by statistical standards:\r\nthey are massive;  they are highly nonlinear;  they are\r\ncontaminated;  they contain data which are in fact functions;\r\nor the data come from a mechanism which is only partially known.\r\nThe tasks of estimation, testing, functional testing, pattern\r\ndiscovery, feature extraction, visualization, and comparison\r\nrequire the statistician look at each problem anew.\r\nNonparametric methodology, which has been widely used in one\r\nand two dimensions, is also appropriate in these higher dimensions.\r\nParticular emphasis will be given to multivariate regression and\r\ndensity estimation problems, and closely related applications such\r\nas clustering, mixture estimation, pattern recognition, robust\r\nestimation, and dimension reduction.  The statistician's view of\r\nthe scientific method is a continuously improving process of model\r\nbuilding, data collection, estimation, criticism, and refinement.\r\nHowever, many practicing statisticians are stymied by an inability\r\nto repair poorly fitting models. Of particular interest in this\r\nresearch are methods which provide critical diagnostic information\r\nas part of the model estimation task.  A focus of this research is\r\na relatively new minimum-distance data-based parametric estimation\r\nalgorithm, which has been investigated for its robustness properties.\r\nThe algorithm can be applied to mixture models and spline fitting.\r\nAn incomplete density model may be fitted, a highly unusual\r\ncapability that will be explored fully in the context of regression,\r\nimage processing, clustering, outlier detection, and density\r\nestimation.  Other novel potential applications include adaptive\r\nwavelet thresholding, solution of the mixture of regression problems,\r\nand application to models which apply to only a subset of the data.\r\ncapability that will be explored fully in the context of regression, image \r\nprocessing, clustering, outlier detection, and density estimation.  Other \r\nnovel potential applications include adaptive wavelet thresholding, \r\nsolution of the mixture of regression problems, and application to \r\nmodels which apply to only a subset of the data.\r\n\r\nResearch in data analysis and statistical modeling provides\r\nintellectual challenges with deep applications in almost every\r\nfield of natural and social sciences and engineering. The field of\r\nnonparametric statistics has made a significant contribution to\r\nthe success of science with algorithms that are hidden but critical\r\neven in the inner workings of cell phones.  At a recent National\r\nResearch Council workshop, numerous scientists identified\r\ncritical statistical needs in their work with massive data sets:\r\nnew dimension reduction algorithms, specialized visualization tools\r\nfor exploring massive data, better clustering algorithms, and\r\ntechniques for handling nonstationary data.  Results from this proposed\r\nresearch directly impact three of these four critical opportunities.\r\nThis program represents a comprehensive and long-term attack\r\non a host of important data analytic problems in multivariate estimation. \r\nGraduate training is significant component of this project.  The results\r\n will be of long-term theoretical interest and will provide short-term \r\nsolutions to real-world problems.\r\n",
