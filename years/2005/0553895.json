 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe focus of this research involves four goals:  First, to develop catalytic processes that involve the alkylation of nickel enolates within a metallacycle framework.  Second, to develop total synthesis applications of [3+2] alkylative cycloaddition of enals and alkynes.  Third, to develop conjugate addition procedures that do not require preformed organometallic nucleophiles. Fourth, to study the role of organozincs and related species in accelerating the rate of nickel-catalyzed processes.  \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. John Montgomery in the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University.  Professor Montgomery will focus his work on development of new processes that involve the generation and functionalization of nickel enolates.  The research will advance the fields of nickel catalysis, conjugate addition chemistry and transition metal enolate chemistry in general.  The project has potential for broader impact in the pharmaceutical industry and the project serves as an excellent training ground for undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctorals.  The inclusion of underrepresented minorities to the project will be stressed.\r\n",
