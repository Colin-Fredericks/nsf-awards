Meristems are the growth centers of plants and embody many exciting concepts for plant developmental biologists. Meristems are small but dynamic structures, where processes of cell signaling and coordination in growth occur.  As the centers of plant growth, meristems are also of great importance to agriculture and crop production. For example, most of our current knowledge about the mechanisms that control flowering in plants has been obtained from studies of meristems.  During this Symposium, the world's leading experts in the biology of meristems will gather on the Iowa State University campus to discuss the latest discoveries in plant development. In a venue designed for discussion and interaction, the symposium will focus on the developmental and genetic processes that encompass growth activity throughout the plant. The symposium will include keynote presentations by internationally recognized speakers, poster sessions, and workshops. This meeting will facilitate opportunities for plant biologists to meet, discuss and interact in an informal and open setting. The program also addresses the current and potential applications of meristem biology for gene discovery and crop improvement. Significant participation and support from researchers in the biotechnology industry is expected. Because of the important role that meristems play in overall growth and crop production, it is expected that scientists from a wide array of disciplines will be attracted. By bringing together researchers interested in various aspects of plant development, this meeting will facilitate the exchange of information and ideas and will encourage participants to reach out in new directions in their future research.",
