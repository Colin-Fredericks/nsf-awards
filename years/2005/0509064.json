 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technological frontier and performance barrier for control and management of\r\nmany present-day engineering systems lie in their complexity. Consequently,\r\ncomplexity management has become an essential part of control systems design. An\r\nemerging approach to controlling such systems consists of a decomposition of the\r\ncontrol actions into a sequence of modes, each of which is defined for a\r\nparticular task, operating point, or data source. The central question is how to\r\nschedule the various modes in order to optimize the system's performance.\r\nRelated questions concern the development of real-time algorithms for\r\nperformance improvement and the tradeoff between the size of the mode set and\r\nthe system's performance.\r\n\r\nThis project will answer the above questions by casting them in the setting of\r\noptimal control, by combining techniques from hybrid systems, motion description\r\nlanguages, and numerical optimization. This new approach to controlling complex\r\nsystems will advance the state of the art of supervisory controller design by\r\nproviding effective algorithms for off-line computation of optimal controls, and\r\nfor real-time implementation of suboptimal controls.\r\n\r\nOn the technological side, the framework for optimal timing control of\r\nmulti-modal systems has far-reaching implications in a variety of application\r\ndomains. For instance, optimal scheduling of robotic tasks can be crucial for\r\nthe success of autonomous planetary explorations, mine sweeping,\r\nsearch-and-rescue applications, and other military missions. On the educational\r\nside, a new controls curriculum will be developed at the Georgia Institute of\r\nTechnology that combines computer-science techniques with the traditional\r\napproach to signals and systems.\r\n",
