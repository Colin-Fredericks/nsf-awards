 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support a one-day workshop on September 3, 2005 in Sesimbra, Portugal, immediately preceding the INTERSPEECH 2005 conference, which will be held in Lisbon on September 4-8, 2005.  The PI posits that in an effort to promote more efficient and safer vehicle operation, next-generation driver-vehicle interfaces will incorporate biometric recognition using speech, video/image and analog behavior signals.  But achieving affordable and reliable biometric capabilities in vehicles is likely to be challenging.  Building upon the success of a prior workshop in 2003 supported by Nagoya University's Center for Acoustic Information Research (CIAIR) under the technical sponsorship of the IEEE Signal Processing Society, participants in this year's workshop will assess the current state-of-the-art in DSP technologies and discuss ways to move the field forward.  Workshop topics will include (but not be limited to) DSP technologies for vehicle personalization, DSP technologies for vehicle and traffic control, DSP technologies for detection of driver fatigue and driving under the influence, audio and video processing for mobile e-commerce applications, multi-sensor applications and data fusion, deployment of multimedia devices in vehicles, and HCI in mobile environments.  The organizing committee will work to bring together key researchers from Europe and Pacific Rim countries working on the latest techniques, standards, and emerging deployment, to present their work to one another through a mixture of invited lectures and poster papers accepted through a peer-review submission process.  Both a hardcopy workshop guide and a CD of the proceedings will be distributed to attendees, and additional copies will be made available for dissemination to the research community and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The workshop will focus particularly on facilitating collaborative research relating to vehicle safety, vehicle personalization, safety of passengers and goods (especially in commercial vehicles), and secure e-commerce from moving vehicles.  The PI expects the workshop will produce recommendations to the scientific community for new research directions and infrastructure, so as to provide a bridge linking the various disciplines related to DSP, human cognition and driving.   Although certain pre-eminent scholars in the field will be invited, the organizing committee will aggressively distribute a general call for participation both via e-mail and on the Web.  The PI is especially keen to assure participation by members of traditionally under-represented institutions, and will pay close attention to inclusion of minorities and women in the workshop.",
