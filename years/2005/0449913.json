 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear physicists love to look inside protons and neutrons by smashing\r\nparticles into them. One goal of this is to understand the force that\r\nholds them together and gives them most of their weight.  Through a\r\nquirk of quantum mechanics, relativity and the uncertainty principle\r\nwhat we see (or rather what a particle sees) inside a proton depends\r\nupon how fast we approach it.  At low speeds the particle typically sees\r\na lot of empty space a few quarks (which carry the proton's electric\r\ncharge and most of its momentum) and some gluons (which carry the color\r\nforce that holds quarks together). These gluons don't carry much\r\nmomentum and so by the uncertainty principle they have a large size.  If\r\na particle hits one of the quarks or gluons then lots of particles will\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nFor collisions at higher speeds more gluons appear out of the empty\r\nspace so that the proton gets crowded. This makes it harder for a\r\nparticle such as an electron to get through the space between the\r\ngluons. At extremely high speeds the gluons are so crowded that they\r\nfuse together to form a glass like state, the Colored Glass Condensate.\r\nEvidence for such a state was first seen in electron-proton collisions\r\nin Germany. On Long Island there is a machine called RHIC that collides\r\ngold atoms together. The nucleus of a gold atom contains many protons\r\nand neutrons close together. In a nucleus it is easier for the gluons to\r\nform a glass since gluons from different protons and neutrons can\r\noverlap.\r\n\r\nMichael Murray is a member of the BRAHMS colloboration which has seen\r\nevidence for this effect at RHIC. NSF funding will enable Michael to\r\nstudy these effects at a higher energy collidor that is currently being\r\nbuilt near Geneva. This work may help us understand the color force in a\r\nnew way. \r\n\r\nMichael is also interested in homeland security. He will be developing a\r\ncourse on \"dirty bombs\" for first responders. Such a bomb could be as\r\nprimitive as a stick of dynamite surrounded by radioactive materials or\r\na sophisticated device that produces  radioactive aerosols that hang in\r\nthe air for days. In either case proper training of police and\r\nfirefighters will help them to alleviate the damager and panic caused by\r\nsuch an attack. \r\n\r\n-- \r\nBradley D.
