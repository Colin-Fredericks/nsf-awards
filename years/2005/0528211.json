 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nIn recent years considerable progress on the interaction between harmonic analysis and ergodic theory has taken place, which benefited both fields. The proposed conference on harmonic analysis and ergodic theory, which will be held at DePaul University, Chicago, December 2-4, 2005, will focus on that interaction. The main talks will be delivered by distinguished mathematicians and top researchers in both fields, who will highlight, among other things, some of the new ergodic theory techniques used in harmonic analysis and vice versa. In order to give graduate students and junior researchers working in one of the areas an opportunity to learn about the other area, we will offer two mini-courses during the conference, one on harmonic analysis and the other on ergodic theory. The courses will be taught by two distinguished experts. \r\nThe conference will serve as a meeting ground for harmonic analysts and ergodic theorists and provide a forum for mutual collaboration between experts in the two fields. In addition, it will give graduate students and young investigators a chance to interact scientifically with specialists of similar interests. The conference will have a positive impact on the scientific community in general, and the mathematical community in particular, because it will give graduate students and junior researchers, who will shape the future of the filed, a chance to learn about new topics and how to apply them in their own research. \r\n\r\n",
