 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rustbelt RNA Meeting (RRM) will be held on October 28-29, 2005 in the Lodge at Deer Creek State Park & Resort in Mt. Sterling, Ohio. The intellectual objective of the RRM is to provide an inexpensive, high caliber, interdisciplinary meeting for RNA researchers in the Midwest. The field of RNA structure/function and processing is growing at a rapid pace, and RNA processing has proven to be a critical step in many important biological phenomena such as carcinogenesis and development. Consequently, research groups need a forum where they can hear and discuss new results and techniques in all areas of RNA research that can result in furthering an individual lab's aims. The size and organization of the meeting has proven to be an excellent environment for active discussions between research groups, including those between PIs, PIs and trainees as well as among trainees themselves. The RRM emphasizes trainee participation. In addition to offering opportunities for interactions with PIs and other trainees, the RRM provides invaluable experience presenting research in an educational and supportive atmosphere.  The topics to be presented will be drawn from the submitted abstracts, and will cover the full interdisciplinary field of RNA research from structural analysis to RNA processing to transcriptional/translational control.",
