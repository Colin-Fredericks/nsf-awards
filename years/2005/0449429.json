 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research addresses outstanding technical and scientific issues related to energy conversion and efficiency as well as material synthesis for emerging technologies.  It proposes to tune electrical, thermal, and optical properties of dense material by introducing nanoscale pores.  The new nanoporous media could be used in various applications including (1) thermoelectric conversion devices, (2) high temperature fuel cells, (3) thermal barrier coatings, as well as (4) energy efficiency of integrated circuits and (5) manufacturing of optoelectronic systems.  Novel manufacturing processes and characterization techniques of nanoporous materials will be developed along with experimentally validated models for their thermophysical and optical properties.  The research is unique in that it explores integration of recent advances in nanotechnology and transport phenomena to the synthesis and characterization of nanoporous materials.  It is multidisciplinary in nature and involves multiscale manufacturing and modeling.  Results and expertise developed during the course of the project will be incorporated into the PI's teaching activities at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Educational modules related to nanotechnology and energy will be developed and shared with faculty of a historically Hispanic and Balck college of Los Angeles.  Working academic and industrial collaborations are already in place and will be expanded.",
