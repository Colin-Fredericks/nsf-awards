About 60% of the researchers will be senior, and 40% more junior emerging scientists.  Each invitee will be expected to participate fully in the Symposium by submitting and presenting a paper either in oral or poster form.  The invited participants will receive support that will cover the major portion of the estimated Symposium travel expense, including airfare, and conference fees, including housing and meals, for the five day event.  The remainder will be provided either from the participant's own funds or the participant's institution.  The funded researchers will be selected by submitting mini-proposals to the organizing committee.   The Conference is the only major interdisciplinary conference on Inverse Problems. Inverse problems arise in all branches of engineering in which the system is represented by a set of mathematical equations with parameters. The inverse problem refers to either the input problem, in which the output and parameters are known and the input is sought, or the parameter estimation problem, in which inputs and outputs are given and the parameters are sought.  The conference is expected to draw applied mathematicians, engineers, and scientists working in all branches of engineering including acoustics, elasticity, electromagnetism, solid mechanics, and heat transfer.  Inverse problems in heat transfer are quite prevalent and are of special relevance in many problems in thermal engineering design, as they are in many other design areas.  Since 40% or more of the funded participants will be emerging scientists, their participation in this meeting will have a significant impact in the training of the next generation of engineers, scientists, and mathematics working in the area of Inverse Problems.  Because the participation will be interdisciplinary in nature, the impact of researchers from different disciplines convening in this venue will be significant.\r\n",
