 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the fundamental physics that is essential to both the success of introducing new materials for conventional FETs and the assessment of proposed novel tunneling-based devices. The approach is to gather experimental data of band-to-band tunneling with extremely steep doping profiles appropriate to future nanoscale devices. Band-to-band tunneling in strained silicon, germanium, and semiconductor nanowires will be studied. Numerical models for band-to-band tunneling will be calibrated/verified with the experimental data and subsequently employed to study the device design space and examine the ultimate scaling limits for nanoscale FETs including the effects of off-state leakage. Novel tunneling-based devices with sharp subthreshold turn-off characteristics will be studied. These devices are clearly beyond the present technology roadmap of the semiconductor industry. The goal is to find solutions to reduce the off-state current of active devices. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts aspects of this program will advance diversity in the nanoelectronics workforce and provide intellectual technology transfer, integration of research and education, public education, and promotion of partnerships. The educational and outreach programs target opportunities in nanoelectronics - an important area to maintain US leadership in a global economy. An integral component of this proposal is public education on nanoscience and nanotechnology. By engaging science journalists in the research program, public understanding of science and technology will be enhanced through improved science reporting in various media. In return, the science journalists will join in educating the future scientist (the students) on effective communication of science concepts to the general public.\r\n",
