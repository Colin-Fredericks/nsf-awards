 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to investigate the electronic and magnetic ground states of a variety of novel intermetallic systems.  These will include rare earth, alkaline earth, and transition metal intermetallics.  By varying the chemical doping of the materials, outstanding questions in the field of strongly correlated electron systems including the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, high temperature ferromagnetism in Kondo insulators, and unconventional superconductivity will be explored.  The project includes the synthesis of the materials followed by their structural characterization and measurement of their physical properties.  The project will involve collaborators at LSU, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and at Southern University.  Aside from training graduate and undergraduate students in synthesis, characterization, and analysis skills that will enable them to find employment in academe, industry, or government laboratories, the education component of this CAREER project includes K-12 outreach to minority students.  In addition the PI will implement curricula reform in physics courses for non-majors.  \r\n%%%\r\nWhen the electrons in a material interact strongly with each other, new phenomena can occur.  It is possible to tune the behavior of such materials in ways different from conventional metals and insulators.  As an example by changing the chemical doping of a material, it is possible to make an insulator into an unconventional superconductor.  The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to provide insight into the physics of the family of strongly correlated materials known as intermetallics.  In the process technologically useful materials may be discovered.  The project includes the synthesis of the materials followed by their structural characterization and measurement of their physical properties.  The project will involve collaborators at LSU, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and at Southern University.  Aside from training graduate and undergraduate students in the synthesis of materials, as well as characterization and analysis, the education component of this CAREER project includes K-12 outreach to minority students.  .
