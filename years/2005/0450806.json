 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will focus on connections between main \r\napproaches to low dimensional topology. Great successes \r\nhave come from the classical topological 3-manifold \r\nprogram (surfaces, foliations and laminations), from the \r\nRicci flow, Floer homology, and from algebraic invariants \r\nin knot theory and topological field theory. In dimension \r\n4 the Donaldson, Seiberg-Witten, and Oszvath-Szabo \r\ntheories have revealed structure of smooth manifolds. \r\nHowever these different threads remain largely unconnected \r\nand, with the notable exception of geometrization of \r\n3-manifolds, few general structural features have emerged. \r\nThis is in contrast with high dimensional topology where \r\ngreat advances between 1950-1980 revealed deep and \r\nrelatively uniform structure dominated by homotopy theory, \r\nbundles, and stable algebra (K and L theory). We hope that \r\na spirited discussion among a range of experts and new \r\nresearchers will help reveal the deep structure of low \r\ndimensions. Can the Ricci flow be coupled to a 2-form or \r\nother gauge-theoretic object on a 4-manifold? Do \r\nnonsingular flows with special dynamics provide a \r\n``singular homology'' analog of the Oszvath-Szabo \r\n``cellular'' Floer homology? Do special metrics associated \r\nto foliations and laminations have implications for the \r\nRicci flow? Taubes' relation between Seiberg-Witten and \r\nGromov invariants of symplectic manifolds raised hopes \r\nthat geometric representatives for Seiberg-Witten could be \r\nfound more generally. So far this has been unsuccessful \r\nbut perhaps it is time to revisit the question. We look \r\nforward to interactions among a wide range of experts and \r\nyoung researchers with fresh viewpoints.\r\n\r\nTopology aims to understand the structure of objects that \r\nlocally look like the ordinary Euclidean space but whose \r\nglobal shape may be rather complicated. Work in the early \r\n20th century focused on dimensions 2 and 3, with the \r\nexpectation that higher dimensions would be increasingly \r\ncomplicated and possibly beyond comprehension. Strangely \r\nthis was not the case: dimensions above 4 are actually \r\neasier and a deep systematic theory was developed between \r\n1950 and about 1980. For the last 30 years the focus has \r\nreturned to dimensions 3 and 4. This has been one of the \r\nmost active areas of mathematics, with deep relations to \r\ngeometry, analysis, algebra and physics. However a \r\nunifying perspective analogous to the one achieved in \r\nhigher dimensions is still lacking. The aim of the \r\nconference is to promote interactions among researchers \r\nworking on different aspects of the subject, in hopes that \r\nunifying perspectives will begin to emerge.\r\n",
