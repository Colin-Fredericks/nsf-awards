 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research team will use a systems biology approach to understand the process of MAP kinase (MAPK) signal transduction in Arabidopsis.  Whole-genome sequencing has indicated that there are 20 genes that encode MAPK proteins in Arabidopsis.  Functional redundancy and cross-talk between these proteins make it difficult to determine which signaling pathways are controlled by a given protein.  In order to overcome this complexity, the research team will use a novel high-throughput genotyping pipeline to create single plants that are heterozygous for mutations in all twenty MAPK genes. The progeny of these 20-tuple heterozygotes should segregate all of the possible combinations of MAPK mutations. By genotyping selected sets of progeny, it should be possible to determine which mutant combinations are causing particular phenotypes. The research team will not search through the population to try and isolate examples of all 1,140 different triple-mutants. Instead they will let the biology of the plants indicate which mutant combinations are informative.  The outcome of this work will be an improved understanding of the many signal transduction pathways controlled by MAPK cascades in Arabidopsis.  Educational materials will also be developed that highlight the concepts of systems biology and high-throughput technology.  Dr. Krysan will incorporate the high-throughput genotyping system into his Plant Functional Genomics course in order to give students hands-on experience with these methods.  At the high school level, a local teacher will collaborate with the research team to develop practical exercises suitable for use in a high school setting that capture the essence of high-throughput genotyping. These materials will be disseminated to other high school teachers through a summer workshop that will be offered.",
