These are essential for\r\nthe development of designer surfactants: monolayer-forming materials\r\nfor specified functions.  It is expected that this project will\r\nprovide (i) a general variational framework for the modeling of\r\ninterfacial flows as well as for the coupling of mesoscale monolayer\r\ndynamics to the macroscale bulk flow; (ii) a robust and reliable\r\nnumerical scheme for simulating the proposed multiscale model. The\r\ncombined efforts of mathematical analysis, computer simulations and\r\nexperimental measurements will significantly advance our knowledge on\r\nthe multiscale interfacial dynamics associated to the monolayer\r\nforming surfactants.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonolayer-forming surfactants are routinely applied in traditional\r\ntechnologies such as material and food processing, in liquid jets and\r\natomization systems, as well as in emerging technologies such as\r\nlab-on-a-chip for parallel, low-cost DNA sequencing.  These industries\r\nhave a major economic impact.  An example of surfactants playing a\r\ncrucial role in biological systems is lung surfactants, without which\r\nrespiration is impossible. In particular, recent developments in\r\nsurfactant replacement therapy, used on premature infants, is a great\r\nsuccess story where significant decreases in infant mortality are\r\ndirectly attributable to the surfactant therapy. Hence, a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the intrinsic physical processes associated with the\r\nmultiscale interfacial monolayer hydrodynamics is of critical\r\nimportance for the Nation's economic growth and well-being.  \r\n\r\n",
