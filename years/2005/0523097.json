The CALIPSO project, a collaborative originally funded through a Continental Dynamics (CD) program grant with co-support from the Division of Earth Sciences (EAR)/Instrumentation and Facilities (lead Voight/Penn State EAR-0116826), aims to investigate the dynamics of the active andesitic magmatic system of Soufriere Hills Volcano (SHV).   The project was initiated in 2002 with drilling and installation of four high-sensitivity borehole seismic and ground deformation (strainmeter, tiltmeter, cGPS) stations around SHV.  All four CALIPSO installations were completed by 2004, and instrumental data have been recovered on Montserrat, including those from a prodigious lava dome collapse (historically the world's largest) in 2003, and explosions in 2003 and 2004.  Continued support for CALIPSO will allow uninterrupted acquisition and archival of CALIPSO borehole and CGPS data as well as completion and enhancement of the hardware and software interface between the borehole and surface sensors to ensure seamless data acquisition for real-time monitoring through the Monserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO).  Data from the CALIPSO facility is unprecedented in physical volcanology and will offer new insights into the deep dynamics related to processes acting within an active magma chamber.  The real-time data will also be useful in developing improved volcanic hazard mitigation strategies.  Graduate and undergraduate students at Arkansas, Penn State and Duke will be exposed to a leading edge science program and state-of-the-art geodetic and seismic technologies.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
