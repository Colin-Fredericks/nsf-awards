 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation \r\nProject Summary \r\n \r\nThe Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PSLSAMP) is a collaborative \r\neffort  sustained  by  seven  universities  in  Georgia  to  increase  the  number  of  underrepresented \r\nminority  students  statewide  who  complete  undergraduate  degrees  in  science,  technology, \r\nengineering  and  mathematics  (STEM)  fields.    Georgia  is  experiencing  explosive  population \r\ngrowth  while  embracing  policies  that  favor  economic  development  in  strategic,  technology-\r\noriented  fields.    There  is  a  compelling  need  for  college  graduates  with  strong  technical  skills.  \r\nThere is also wide recognition that underrepresented minorities must participate significantly in \r\nmeeting  this  need.    The  current  proposal,  developed  by  the  University  of  Georgia  in  close \r\ncollaboration with Bainbridge College, Fort Valley State University, Georgia Perimeter College, \r\nMacon  State  College,  Savannah  State  University,  and  Southern  Polytechnic  University,  is \r\nsubmitted to the National Science Foundation and requests $1,000,000 per year for five years to \r\nsupport Alliance-wide and individual campus-based programming.  The primary impacts will be \r\nto  enhance  the  recruitment  and  retention  of  minority  students  and  double  the  number  of  such \r\nstudents at participating universities overall who earn bachelor.s degrees in STEM disciplines. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe  shortage  of  American  college  graduates  with  technical  and  scientific  training  is  well \r\ndocumented,  and  the  percentage  of  U.S.  students  entering  colleges  and  universities  with  the \r\nintention of majoring in STEM fields has steadily declined.  Strengthening the STEM workforce \r\nand its leadership is a priority concern if the U.S. is to maintain its economic leadership, security \r\nand  quality  of  life.    Preparing  African  Americans,  Hispanic  Americans  and  other \r\nunderrepresented minorities for careers in these fields is a logical component of most strategies to \r\naddress these  needs.    It  has  an  overwhelmingly compelling  logic in a  state like Georgia where \r\nthese  minorities  make  up  approximately  34%  of  the  state.s  population.    Improving  minority \r\ninvolvement in undergraduate STEM fields is a complex problem.  In Georgia, the development \r\nof a dynamic statewide plan to address this problem requires initially that very different types of \r\ninstitutions cooperate closely to achieve a shared, long-term goal in terms of the production of \r\nminority  STEM  graduates.  The  current  proposal  is  the  result  of  such  inter-institutional \r\ncollaboration. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts \r\nIn addition to its primary impacts, PSLSAMP programs will: \r\n \r\nProvide opportunities designed to motivate students to pursue advanced \r\nstudy, \r\nPrepare students for graduate school, \r\nEmphasize career opportunities in STEM fields, \r\nEngage  faculty  and  staff  in  the  planning  process  and  in  professional \r\ndevelopment activities to ensure institutionalization, and \r\nCreate a genuine partnership among institutions and organizations within \r\nGeorgia. \r\n \r\nThe University of Georgia will serve as the lead institution and fiduciary agent on behalf of the \r\nPeach State Alliance and President Michael Adams, a research scientist himself, will serve as the \r\nprincipal investigator and chair of the Governing Board.  The Governing Board, along with the \r\nSteering Committee and research faculty, will provide intellectual leadership to the Alliance.",
