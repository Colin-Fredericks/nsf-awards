The principal objectives of the Midwest Alliance are to increase the number of students with disabilities who are (a) exploring opportunities in STEM, (b) entering and succeeding in STEM disciplines at the associate, baccalaureate and graduate levels, and (c) having careers in STEM. \r\n\r\nMidwest has strong partnerships locally, regionally, and nationally that benefit students, faculty and institutions across the tri-state area, and contribute to the goal of helping students with disabilities connect, persist and achieve in postsecondary education. Midwest efforts and activities center on the following three areas: \r\n\r\n1)   Direct Student Interventions (e.g., mentorships, internships, STEM enrichment and immersion activities such as the Exploration by Design summer camps, and transition and self-advocacy learning) \r\n2)   Indirect Student Interventions (e.g., teacher training in inclusive science instruction and curricular development)  \r\n3)   Systems Interventions (e.g., identifying and defining comprehensive strategies for supporting students with disabilities by improving student access and accommodations, AT development, and reporting on evidence-based interventions and practices).\r\n\r\nMidwest programs and activities are focused on critical junctures, including the transition from high school to postsecondary education; are designed to utilize promising and/or successful practices; and include a dissemination component through journal publications, our website and newsletter, and presentations at conferences.  Midwest uses both formative and summative evaluation in its continuous improvement efforts.",
