 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of our project is to study the process of training new scientists. The presumption among many is that this process is well understood. In fact, the process has remained much the same for the past two centuries. However, our review of the relevant literature reveals a scarcity of research about the transition from student to scientist. A particularly critical, yet under-investigated period is when graduate students enter their advisors' labs to initially help with research and then eventually to carry out original research for their dissertation. Up to this time, graduate students are able consumers of scientific knowledge, with only a rare few who have done original research. During this period, graduate students must become producers of scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The intellectual merit of this project lies in uncovering the mechanisms of how this transition occurs. We propose to study the empirical laboratory sciences of chemistry and physics. The research will address the following questions:\r\n1) Do different faculty advisors share common approaches to educating their graduate students? Are some of these approaches more successful than others in fostering scientific productivity? Are there common characteristics across programs that turn out more productive scientists?\r\n2) What criteria do faculty advisors use to determine that their students are prepared to become independent researchers? Are these criteria common or idiosyncratic within specific labs?\r\n3) How closely matched are the impressions of advisors and graduate students about research independence? Do graduate students realize when they have achieved research independence?\r\n\r\nWe propose a mixed methodological approach coupling a qualitative component with a quantitative component. The qualitative component will include interviews and observations of an array of scientists and graduate students. The information gained from this qualitative component will be used to develop a survey to query a national sample of scientists and graduate students. The statistical models developed from the survey analysis, will be tested for validity by reviewing to the qualitative data corpus. The objective of this study is to provide much needed information about the mechanisms in the training of new scientists during their dissertation research. Through our pilot study of chemistry and physics doctoral programs, we have generated several hypotheses that include:\r\n\r\n A student's past experience focused on science content knowledge rather than on creative inquiry in formal school settings detracts from, rather than facilitates, his or her transition to scientist.  Common themes and approaches to fostering the transition exist for graduate advisors across different laboratories and institutions. These themes vary in their effectiveness in training students.\r\nEffective approaches to teaching and learning scientific research may be identified and connected with scientific productivity. This connection between education and research may inform the development of more scientifically productive and educationally effective research laboratories.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The project outcomes are intended to have the following broader impacts: 1) provide detailed analysis to inform the research training of graduate students in laboratory-based empirical sciences, 2) provide data on the impact of prior science education experiences on the learning of scientific research, 3) provide data to inform policy for mitigating the erosion of US dominance in scientific research, and 4) improve awareness and access for students interested in becoming scientists.\r\n",
