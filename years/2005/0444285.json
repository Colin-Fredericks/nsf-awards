This proposal takes the view that, for a wide range\r\nof applications, the computation efficiency can be substantially improved by a fundamental change to \r\nthe data propagation model in parallel algorithms.\r\n\r\nMany important applications use iterative solvers to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). In such solvers, each data point is iteratively updated\r\nusing the new values of its neighbors.\r\nData values are therefore propagated across the problem domain over the time\r\nsteps. Currently, the predominant way\r\nto propagate the data requires the processor to suspend its computation until all data computed at a predetermined time step have arrived from its neighbors.\r\nSuch a rigid model not only\r\nincurs a heavy performance penalty due to processor waiting, but\r\nit also severely limits the compiler's ability to transform programs to achieve\r\nmore efficient parallel execution and better data locality. \r\nThe PIs propose a software tool which supports a new model called the asynchronous model. \r\nUnder this model, each data point is updated based on whatever the \r\nmost recent values available from its neighbors, instead of waiting for values\r\ncomputed at a predetermined step. The new model will hence overcome\r\nthe difficulties mentioned above. The asynchronous model, nonetheless,\r\nmay change the convergence rate of the algorithm.\r\nHence, based on the tradeoff between the convergence rate and the\r\nparallel execution efficiency,\r\nthe application programmer should tune the frequency at which\r\nthe data propagation is re-synchronized in order to\r\naccelarate the convergence. The proposed tool will make it easy\r\nfor the application programmer to perform such important tuning.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nThe success of this project will contribute substantially to\r\nthe advance of high-end computing.\r\nMoreover, it will also make significant educational and outreach impact.\r\nThe PIs plan to use the proposed software tool in Purdue's educational\r\ncomputational science and engineering (CSE) graduate program. Students and \r\nfaculty in this program will use the tool in courses on parallel computing\r\nand performance evaluation, as well as in research projects that can benefit \r\nfrom fine-tuning performance on high-end parallel computing platforms.\r\nThe software developed in this project can also be an effective tool\r\nin CSE education programs elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe PIs have a track record of transferring research ideas to\r\nindustrial labs and such collaboration will continue to project\r\npositive influences on high-performance computer industries.\r\nThis project will also further enhance PIs' ability to engage a broad community of undergraduate students in various disciplines, through Honor Seminars, special mentoring programs and undergraduate research opportunities.\r\n\r\n",
