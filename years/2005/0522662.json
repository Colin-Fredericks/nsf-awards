 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research is to develop a model validation approach that addresses the need for validating predictive models in the context of design decision making.  Modeling and simulation based design has been increasingly used for designing engineering systems.  However, it remains a challenge on assessing the risks and uncertainties associated with the use of predictive models in engineering design.  Existing model validation approaches are limited in their scopes and lack of stochastic measurements with regard to the confidence of making specific design decisions.  In the proposed research, a rigorous model validation approach will be developed to address the need of validating predictive models for engineering design.  Besides, model validation metrics, statistical modeling, Bayesian inferences, data mining techniques, and decision making strategies will be developed to incorporate model validation as an integral part of design decision making.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will offer a generic model validation approach that can be applied to many domestic and military applications for making reliable decisions with predictive models as replacements of expensive physical part deployments.  The strong collaborations between the research teams, industrial partners, and government agencies will ensure that the developed technologies and results will be transferred and successfully implemented.  The research will contribute to education in the areas of model-based simulation, modeling and optimization of engineering systems under uncertainty, statistical analysis, engineering design, and information technology.\r\n",
