 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nSzarek\r\n\r\nThis project involves continued research on the geometric, \r\nprobabilistic and combinatorial aspects of functional analysis and \r\nconvexity theory, the loosely defined area that has been lately \r\nreferred to as \"asymptotic geometric analysis.\"  Particular attention \r\nwill be paid to non-commutative objects and phenomena on one hand \r\nand, on the other hand, to links with other areas of mathematics and \r\nother mathematical sciences, which motivate most of the problems that \r\nare being considered. Sample research topics that are proposed to be \r\nstudied include: structural properties of high-dimensional convex \r\nbodies and of high-dimensional normed spaces, metric entropy (of \r\nconvex sets or of linear operators) and duality of such entropy and \r\nsome geometric questions related to quantum information theory and \r\nquantum.  The questions are typically expressed in the language of \r\nlocal or finite dimensional geometry of Banach spaces and are to be \r\nanalyzed using mainly the diverse methods that originated or were \r\ndeveloped in that context.\r\n\r\nOn an elementary level, Analysis is a study of functions, or \r\nrelationships between quantities and the parameters on which they \r\ndepend. Since very many naturally appearing relationships are linear \r\nor at least convex, a good understanding of convex functions and, \r\nconsequently, of convex sets is a prerequisite for understanding \r\nthose relationships. The number of free parameters in the underlying \r\nproblem can often be related to the dimension of sets in the \r\ncorresponding mathematical model. Since real-life problems usually \r\ndepend on very many parameters, the high-dimensional setting is of \r\nparticular interest. This is exactly the domain of asymptotic \r\ngeometric analysis, which studies quantitative properties of convex \r\nsets (or other geometric structures) as the dimension goes to \r\ninfinity. For the last two decades or so the asymptotic theory has \r\nbeen quite successful in identifying and exploiting \"approximate\" \r\nsymmetries of various problems that escaped the earlier \"too \r\nqualitative\" or \"too rigid\" methods of classical functional analysis \r\nand classical geometry. (This led, among others, to the discovery of \r\nmany links to computer science.) Finally, to explain our emphasis on \r\nnon-commutativity we point out that it simply reflects the fact that \r\nthe final outcome of a process may depend on the order of operations \r\ninvolved; the best known, but by far not the only manifestation of \r\nthat principle is quantum mechanics.\r\n",
