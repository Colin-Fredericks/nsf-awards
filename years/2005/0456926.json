 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Funding request to help organize a workshop on on the Geometry of String Theory at the Fields Institute\" \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fields Institute is running an intensive program on the Geometry of String Theory from February through July of 2005. The proposal seeks funding of $15,000 from the NSF to support young American physicists who wish to participate. The workshop will be during the second semester of a year-long program on the geometry of string theory. There will be a concentration on physical aspects of the theory in this period and a serious attempt to develop real collaboration between mathematicians and physicists. The program will be devoted to mathematical subjects motivated by string theory and to recent developments in string theory and related physical fields which are of strong mathematical interest. The aim of the program is to foster new progress in the continuing drive towards understanding the foundations of string/M-theory, and in the wealth of new ideas involving D-branes, BPS states and various dualities which are of great mathematical importance. Further, it will foster interactions between such areas of mathematics as derived categories, elliptic cohomology, geometric Langlands correspondence, quantum cohomology, differential geometry varieties with special holonomy and of special Lagrangian varieties. \r\nThis project is being jointly funded between Physics and the Office of International Science and Engineering. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
