 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kawalo Marine Laboratory, a unit of the University of Hawaii, was established in 1971 with funding from the NSF and the state of Hawaii. The laboratory provides infrastructure for research and training in basic biological research, marine biotechnology and conservation biology. This award provides support for 1) the upgrade and renovation of portions of the seawater system and 2) the installation of an emergency notification system for freezers and incubators whose failure could have serious impacts within hours.   Planned improvements in the seawater system include new seawater table supports, a sand filter unit and UV water sterilization equipment.  The permanent research staff at Kewalo includes six University of Hawaii faculty.  In addition, the laboratory hosts 5 to 10 visiting scientists each year.  University of Hawaii students receive training and participate in undergraduate and graduate-level coursework at the Laboratory, which provides access to nearby coral reefs, estuaries, extensive beaches and deep ocean.  Research interests of Kewalo scientists range from biodiversity to invasive species and study of well-developed marine model organisms.",
