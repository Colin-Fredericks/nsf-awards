 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-range goal of this research is to develop theoretical and computational methods to predict accurately\r\nthe properties of many-electron systems and then to apply the methods to important condensed matter\r\nsystems. The focus of this research is primarily on the development and application of quantum\r\nMonte Carlo (QMC) methods. However, part of the research attempts to tie these approaches to other\r\ntheoretical issues such as the fundamental distinction between metals and insulators in terms of the manybodyelectron wave function.\r\n\r\nQMC can provide very accurate results for electronic systems: the most well-known example is the homogenous electron gas where QMC has provided the benchmark upon which are based most density functional (DFT) calculations. DFT-based methods are the only current method feasible for accurate large-scale simulations of realistic systems; however, even the improved functionals have well-known defects. The past few years have seen substantial progress in coupling the simulation of ions at a finite temperature with QMC simulation of the electrons (the CEIMC method). In addition to being more accurate, in cases where other averaging must be performed, the QMC approach can be as efficient as DFT-\r\nbased approaches. Applications to extended systems of hydrogen are now in production. In the near future\r\nthere will be development of QMC methods, with emphasis upon more accurate wave functions, improved\r\nboundary conditions, and new methods able to use much larger computational facilities efficiently.\r\nThe research will enable applications to elements with core electrons using more accurate pseudopotentials.\r\nMethods to calculate electronic forces will enable dynamical calculations of ionic systems.\r\n\r\nApplications of the methods will include hydrogen throughout the whole phase diagram of temperature\r\nand pressure. Although there have been numerous previous QMC and DFT simulations, the CEIMC\r\nmethod removes most of their limitations. The connection between the insulator-metallic transition, the\r\natomic molecular-transition and temperature and zero point effects is still lacking in current approaches.\r\nThe simulations should clarify the situation, especially under conditions where experiment is non-existent\r\nor unreliable. A further challenge is the microscopic simulation of water from first principles, which is\r\nabsolutely fundamental to many scientific questions and which appears to be within reach of QMC simulation.\r\nThe power of this approach can be applied to other problems, for example, new methods to simulate\r\nelectrons and their spin states in real nanostructure devices, potentially more accurately and efficiently\r\nthan with existing grid-based approaches. The entire device can be simulated by coupling two\r\nrandom walks-one to solve the electrostatic equations in a complicated structure and another for the Nbody\r\nquantum equation for the electrons.\r\n\r\nThe computational complexity of the simulation of the basic equations of matter (on\r\nclassical not quantum computers) is a very important and fundamental issue. The challenge is to solve\r\naccurately problems with many interacting particles, including strongly interacting systems and cooperative\r\nphenomena. QMC methods have made it possible to compute the thermodynamic properties of bosonic\r\nsystems, including superfuidity. However, the fermion sign problem is a critical issue limiting\r\npresent work, and steps toward solving or minimizing the sign problem are among the outstanding challenges\r\nin computational science. In addition, development of new computational approaches frequently\r\nleads to new theoretical understanding as well as algorithms useful in other disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe development of these computational quantum methods will have a qualitative impact\r\nupon the course of many fields of science including physics, materials science, chemistry and even\r\nbiology, by enabling much more accurate, and potentially faster, simulation of a broad range of systems.\r\nThe calculations will resolve questions about the properties of hydrogen at high temperatures and pressures,\r\nthe basis of models for the formation of Jovian planets; the microscopic properties of water and\r\nsolutions; and properties of nanoscale systems. The research is carried out primarily by graduate students\r\nand postdocs who often go later to industry, thus transferring the latest computational methods. Algorithms\r\nand software developed as a result of the research will be made available to the general research\r\ncommunity through the Materials Computation Center and used in undergraduate courses, graduate\r\ncourses, and summer schools at the University of Illinois and elsewhere.",
