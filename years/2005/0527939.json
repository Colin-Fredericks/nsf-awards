International participants for the workshop are being contacted and asked to share their experience with various methodologies for the development and use of pulping technologies for the use of various non-woody plants in the manufacture of paper. There will be a particular focus on agricultural waste products in Eastern Europe, Asia Minor and the Middle East. Researchers the United States, Great Britain and Egypt are also expected to participate in the workshop.  The workshop to be planned is likely to be very beneficial for identifying alternative sources of pulp from agrowaste for many wood-poor countries, as well as being beneficial for a large range of countries such as the U.S., where agricultural waste can provide environmental challenges.\r\n",
