 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Virginia Tech research team will draw from the wealth of the wide area measurement information from their frequency monitoring network FNET to study power system dynamics from an entirely new and broader view. Specifically, the proposed research will focus on: (1) analyzing the measurement data and study power system oscillations and disturbance propagation characteristics, (2) developing algorithms to calculate the traveling speed of the disturbance, which is affected by factors such as generator inertia, grid parameters, and topology, (3) developing an automatic on-line generation trip event locator based on FNET data, and (4) finally, creating state-of-the-art education materials. Intellectual merit: With the help of the first-hand FNET measurement data, it will be possible to devise early warning systems and activate control actions to help damp system oscillations and reduce catastrophic power system failures. The event triangulation capability will serve as an important part of the homeland security and national critical infrastructure monitoring system. Broader Impact: FNET should allow the starting point of a blackout to be to pin-pointed within seconds rather than minutes. The proposed activities will foster the integration of research and education through utilization of the monitoring system in coursework. FNET will also serve as a laboratory for developing and testing distance-learning and remote education initiatives.",
