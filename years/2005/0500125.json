 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to advance the fundamental understanding and processing technology of, and to develop three-dimensional modeling and simulation tools for, the mass production of lightweight, high-performance biobased/biodegradable components via microcellular injection molding. The approaches are to (1) achieve a better understanding of the biobased/ biodegradable plastic-supercritical fluid solution behavior utilizing an in-house designed novel in-line high-pressure slit die rheometer mounted on the microcellular injection molding machine; (2) establish guidelines for processing biobased/biodegradable plastics via design of experiments; (3) advance the understanding of cell nucleation and growth mechanisms by employing various nanoparticles and biofibers as fillers, and develop state-of-the-art, three-dimensional modeling and simulation tools; and (4) establish the composition-process-structure-property relationship of various microcellular biobased/biodegradable plastics via extensive characterization and analytical modeling.\r\n\r\nHuman society has benefited tremendously from the use of petroleum-based plastics. However, this prosperity has come at the expense of adverse environmental impacts and at the mercy of depleting fossil-based resources. Although biodegradable biobased plastics have been successfully produced from renewable resources, their commercial application has been limited due to inferior material properties, narrow processing windows, and relatively high material costs. This research could enable a larger processing window for biobased plastics and realize the mass production of environmentally benign biobased/biodegradable plastic components with complex geometries, improved material properties, and reduced material costs, thus broadening their application in many industrial sectors and ultimately helping the U.S. plastics industry gain a competitive edge in the global market. Moreover, research results and activities will be incorporated into existing and new manufacturing engineering curricula, helping to educate students regarding the growing importance of developing environmentally friendly materials and processes. Students of underrepresented groups will be recruited through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates supplement to participate in this research.\r\n",
