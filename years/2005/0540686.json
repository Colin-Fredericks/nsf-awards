A global debate is now in progress concerning the existence\r\nof mantle plumes, the number of deep mantle plumes, and the viability of alternative\r\nmodels. Recent meetings have focused either on plume theory or alternatives, and it is\r\nnow timely to hold a discussion meeting that brings together representatives of both sides\r\nof the debate. The primary objectives will be to:\r\n\r\na) Clarify and define both the plume and alternative theories, their predictions and how\r\nthey may be tested;\r\nb) Match them against one another; and\r\nc) Identify the most important avenues of future research that may ultimately lead to\r\nresolution of the debate.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will be balanced and structured to present both pro-plume and alternative\r\npoints of view in sessions dealing with theory, mantle physics and dynamics, field\r\nevidence, age dating, seismology, temperature, petrology and geochemistry, and\r\nplanetary aspects. The conveners include two who are arranging the pro-plume side of\r\nthe discussion, and two who are arranging the plume-skeptic side. The venue in Scotland\r\nwas chosen to facilitate international participation, and to allow participation in field\r\ntrips. These will be to several of the major central volcanic complexes and intrusive\r\ncenters of the Scottish Hebrides that have long provided many of the important concepts\r\nof igneous structural geology and petrogenesis in what is now termed the North Atlantic\r\nLarge Igneous Province.\r\n\r\nAverage expenses for this meeting for US participants, based on the current\r\ndollars to sterling exchange rate will be about $2100, including $1000 for air fare.\r\nPresently, there are 52 U.S. applicants who have submitted abstracts including 5 students.\r\nMany of these have requested financial assistance. This award ($20,000) will defray costs for 25 participants, especially students and young scientists, by an average amount of $800.\r\n\r\n",
