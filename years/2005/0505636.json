Such kernels provide a distance metric for elements in their domain, which may be functions (as in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces), or, more recently, trees, graphs, images, sounds, DNA and protein \r\nsequences, microarray gene expression data, text messages and other\r\nobjects. A reasonable distance metric is a prerequesite for prediction, classification, and clustering, and methods for obtaining such metrics\r\nare an area of active research. The proposer will introduce, develop and study the properties of a new class of nonparametric methods for obtaining kernels in situations where noisy, crude, incomplete information related to dissimilarity between pairs of objects in arbitrary sets is available. The methods are  called \r\nregularized kernel estimation, since they involve a tradeoff between\r\nfitting the crude information available and a penalty or complexity functional on the kernel, analogous to, but not the same as classical\r\nregularization and the bias-variance tradeoff. Optimal tuning and dimensionality reduction procedures will be proposed and their properties studied. The methods proposed are believed to have new and important computational and theoretical advantages, and these will be\r\ndemonstrated, by development of efficient computational algorithms, by \r\nsimulation, by development of the theory, and by application to \r\na variety of scientific problems.\r\n\r\nThis work is motivated by the goal of obtaining better methods for \r\nclustering and classifying objects mentioned above, by obtaining \r\nimproved ways to describe the \"distance\" betweein objects. \r\nFor example, microarray gene chips may contain information \r\nconcerning, e. g. the type of tumor whose DMA is being studied, \r\nand it is anticipated that this research  will provide\r\nimproved methods for extracting this information \r\nin cases where it is difficult to identify the type of tumor, \r\nand this will ultimately result in better diagnostic and treatment\r\noutcomes. Similarly, it is of interest to cluster protein sequences into functional classes, with the goal of identifying function by associating sequences that are \"nearby\". \r\nIt is anticipated  that the present research will provide a more efficient way of extracting information from crude or incomplete dissimilarity data and, contribute to the long-term technology of \r\nunderstanding protein function. Other potential applications include\r\nimproved classification of weather states, with the goal of clustering\r\nand  classifying local situations that have similar outcomes, signal\r\ndetection in large neutrino detectors, classification of astronomical bodies, and classification and clustering problems in a variety of other scientific fields.\r\n\r\n",
