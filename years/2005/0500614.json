The general theme of the meeting concerns the various aspects of interaction between function theory and scientific computation. Indeed, there is a synergistic relation between these subjects that will be further strengthened by the conference. The individuals to be funded will be selected by a group of outstanding senior researchers who plan to attend the  conference. We expect five new Ph.D's and three graduate students who hold great promise of becoming future leaders in these fields of mathematics will be chosen to form the USA delegation.\r\n\r\nThe conference is the fifth in a series, following CMFT'89 (held in Valparaiso, Chile), CMFT'94 (held in Penang, Malaysia), CMFT'97 (held in Nicosia, Cyprus), and CMFT'01 (held in Aveiro, Portugal). Another common theme of these meetings is to foster the creation and maintenance of contacts between scientists from diverse cultures.\r\n\r\n",
