These US representatives will take part in the international workshop and several panel discussions and present technical papers reporting on significant research in earthquake engineering carried out in the US during the past decade. \r\n\r\nThis grant will also enable 30 scientists and engineers to collaborate with the Institute of Social Safety Science (ISSS) in Japan in the planning the 1st International Conference on Urban Disaster Reduction (ICUDR1) and participation in the conference, January 18 - 20, 2005 to commemorate the Great Hanshin Earthquake in Kobe, Japan.  The conference will be influential in establishing recommendations for future disaster research and disaster mitigation programs and policies in the US and Japan.  \r\n\r\nBoth conferences will generate joint US/Japan resolutions, which will be introduced during a special session of the UN World Conference on Disaster Reduction sponsored in Kobe, January 18 - 22, 2005. It is expected that the resolutions from the ICUDR1 and the International Symposium will influence future programs of the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.\r\n",
