 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to explore the feasibility of (a) formation of micro-scale channels and (b) bonding of bi-layer metals under coordinated internal high pressure and mechanical force application.  The success of this approach will lead to cost-effective, integrated, consistent fabrication of integrated double fuel cell bi-polar plates as an alternative to stamping or composite molding of single bi-polar plates that require further joining operations.  The approach is to first characterize the feasibility of metal-to-metal mechanical bonding of thin stainless steel blanks (0.1-0.5 mm) under localized compressive loading conditions.  Secondly, formation of micro-scale channels using high internal fluid pressure and mechanical force will be tested using a simple tooling.  Both mechanical bonding and micro-feature deformation behaviors will be modeled and validated using numerical analysis codes to obtain optimal process conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main societal benefit of the proposed activity will be vehicles with near-zero-emissions through use of fuel cells at an affordable cost, improved power density, durability, and high performance.  In addition, miniaturized and integrated products such as heat exchangers, reactors, fuel processors and bio-medical devices requiring complex micro-features to achieve an increased surface area-to-volume ratio will also benefit from the results of this study.\r\nShort courses and course modules will be developed and integrated into the existing design and manufacturing related courses.  Results of this work will be presented in workshops among industry, academia and government agencies to discuss fuel cell manufacturing technologies, research issues and economics.  Experimental facilities and apparatus developed during the project will be made available to the benefit of undergraduate and graduate students in these courses for lab exercises and demonstrations.\r\n",
