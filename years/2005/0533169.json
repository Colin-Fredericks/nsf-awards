 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary  Proposal Section B\r\nObjectives and Methods\r\nOceanographic research vessels (ORVs) are a critical element of science, technology,\r\nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) research and education, but their access by\r\npersons with disabilities (mobility, hearing, visual, and cognitive impairments) is\r\nconstrained by physical barriers (gangways, paths of travel about the vessel, vertical\r\naccess, berthing and toilet facilities, communications, and signage) and cultural barriers\r\n(ignorance and attitudes).\r\nWith the participation of a diverse steering committee of persons with disabilities, vessel\r\noperators, shipyards, ship designers, and academia, the project will facilitate the\r\nremoval of barriers by assessing the degree of accessibility of ORVs and the science,\r\ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education programs they support,\r\nand developing specific solutions for barrier removal. The results will be incorporated in\r\nan OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH VESSEL ACCESSIBILITY GUIDE of Best\r\nPractices and disseminated to stakeholders.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe project will advance knowledge and understanding of shipboard accessibility by\r\ndeveloping crosscutting solutions, applying lessons learned from the passenger vessel\r\nindustry to ORVs, and disseminating results to stakeholders. The PI is a licensed\r\nProfessional Engineer and naval architect, and an expert in passenger vessel\r\naccessibility, who will use his expertise, experience, and comprehensive resources to\r\nexplore creative and original concepts for removing institutional and shipboard barriers.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nBroadening opportunities and enabling the participation of persons with disabilities in\r\noceanographic research and education is the essence of this project, which will\r\nenhance the infrastructure for oceanographic research and education by removing\r\nphysical and cultural barriers. Results, in the form of lessons leaned and best\r\npractices, will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific, technological, and cultural\r\nunderstanding and awareness of challenges faced by persons with disabilities. Society\r\nat large will benefit by the transfer of project results to make the nation's 1,100 ferry and\r\nexcursion vessel fleet more accessible to commuters and recreational boaters.",
