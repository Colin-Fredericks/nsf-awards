 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Elizabeth Braker of Occidental College and Terrence P. McGlynn of the University of San Diego to organize an International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program in Costa Rica on the topic of tropical ecology.  The U.S. investigators will coordinate collaborative research efforts with Javier Espeleta at the La Selva Biological Station.  The goal of this activity is to train talented students from underrepresented groups to become field ecologists with experience in international settings.  To accomplish this goal the three senior investigators will mentor four undergraduates each year in long-term tropical-field research projects. Undergraduate students first will conduct research at the tropical rain forest field station, and then they will continue their research at their home institutions in a year-round mentorship.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposal include the promotion of international research collaborations, the creation of mentorships in the sciences for undergraduates of underrepresented groups, extensive field experiences for undergraduates oriented towards ecological research, and bringing undergraduates from primarily undergraduate institutions into an active research environment with graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty.  The project will foster a nascent collaboration between U.S. and Costa Rican scientists and reinforce ongoing research projects of the PIs in Costa Rica.\r\n\r\n",
