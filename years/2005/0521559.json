 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developing a new kind of research instrument and tools for interactive, collaborative, networked 3D visualization, creates a new genre of physical interaction devices, called \"viz tangibles.\" These devices allow users to load and save data, steer parameters, navigate in time, control teleconference links, and perform other key operations. The system can be easily moved between conference rooms or offices, and can be connected with mono or stereo projectors. The effort enables scientists to significantly enhance the utility, usability, and collaborative potential for scientific visualization in research, education, collaboration, and interaction with the general public. The resulting tools will be deployed, utilized, and integrated into research and education at five Louisiana campuses which are already linked together by numerous academic collaborations. The central elements of these platforms, the \"viz tangibles,\" are small, modular interaction devices, typically embedded with different interactors, indicators, and networked microcontrollers. So far, three basic and three specialized viz tangibles, interconnected physically and functionally following a simple grammar, have been implemented. One device loads and saves online information, applications, and parameters, which are referenced with RFID-tagged cards. Another device includes a rebindable \"parameter wheel,\" that supports the manipulation of continuous discrete parameters. A third device provides VCR-like button controls that may drive a variety of interactions. Together, these devices provide core operations for a wide variety of visualization and simulation applications, with functionality resembling the GUI \"file\" and \"edit\" menus, but optimized for simple, collaborative, semi-immersive, divided-attention use. The development includes researchers with expertise in visualization, human-computer-interaction, grid computing, software engineering, and electronic, mechanical, and product design. Collaborators include faculty in biomechanics from LSU Medical, Southern U., LaTech; chemistry; computational fluid dynamics; coastal and hurricane modeling; and numerical relativity. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Application of these viz tangibles range from the laboratory to the science education center. The network links research institutions, a medical center, a historically black university, and a supercomputer center.\r\n\r\n",
