 "awd_abstract_narration": "International scientific conferences unite researchers to discover new knowledge and train new workers in their fields.  Every three years the international community of low temperature physicists meets to coordinate their efforts, discuss controversial findings, and hence plan future directions in research.  From August 10 to 17, 2005, the 24th International Conference on Low Temperature Physics (LT24) will be held in Orlando, Florida, hosted by the University of Florida under the auspices of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics.  The previous conference was LT23 in Hiroshima, Japan (1466 participants from 34 countries), and the last one in the Western Hemisphere was LT20 (1993-Oregon).  This is the most important conference series in an area that is the spawning ground for much of our technological economy due to the development of superconducting magnets for use in various fields including medicine.  The upcoming conference will probably be the largest LT conference ever because of its venue and timing (12 years after the last US conference and following rapid growth in low temperature research).  Major goals of this conference, advanced by this funding, are to include scientists from as many countries as possible and at all stages of scientific development, and to encourage young scientists in the United States.",
