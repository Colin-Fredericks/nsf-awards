 "awd_abstract_narration": "Broader impact We seek a better understanding of the information transfer underlying price determination\r\nin economic activity. Economic activity can be seen as comprising complex chains of exchanges, or markets, for which money and prices are the essential lubricant. Our working assumption and motivation is that a collection of more or less simple procedures underlie the actions of participants in the actual economy. Accordingly, the goal of this work is to better understand price adjustment mechanisms that operate\r\nindependently on each price yet achieve a coordinated outcome. The proposed research has two main parts.\r\nI. To explain why price changes in market economies might work effectively by showing simple distributed\r\nalgorithms that cause prices to converge quickly toward equilibrium values.\r\nII. To consider price (toll) setting in networks, motivated in part by routing and road networks.\r\nIntelectual merit In both areas, the focus will be on tatonnement-style algorithms. These are methods in\r\nwhich each price is adjusted independently. Local algorithms are of particular interest; these are algorithms\r\nin which the price adjustment is based only on information available to the corresponding price setter. A\r\nprime obstacle to such methods is the 1978 lower bound of Saari and Simon which seemingly shows that such\r\nalgorithms have unduly high information requirements. The approach used in this work sidesteps that lower\r\nbound, by using variable rate updates. The following is a summary of the issues that will be investigated.\r\nI. MARKET PRICES\r\nContinuous Markets: Develop fast, convergent, local algorithms, using updates based on excess demand.\r\nDiscrete Markets: What is the effect of indivisibility of goods and discreteness of prices on such\r\nalgorithms?\r\nMarkets over Time: How can time be incorporated into the model, and how does this affect the properties\r\nof the tatonnement algorithms?\r\nProduction: How does incorporating production into the model affects the properties of tatonnement\r\nalgorithms?\r\nMarkets as Networks: Is it useful to view trading relationships as a graph?\r\nThis approach based on local, variable updates shows potential with regard both to enabling asynchronous\r\nprice updates, and yielding a dynamic algorithm (that is one that can respond effectively to external changes,\r\nsuch as in utilities or resources).\r\nII. NETWORK PRICES. Here, the situation is fairly well understood when there is full knowledge of user\r\nutilities. In this work, the focus will be on the situation when these are unknown or changing. This work\r\nasks:\r\nWhen can tolls be set effectively based on user behavior as manifested in congestion?\r\nLocal tatonnement algorithms are again a main interest, although more global algorithms, corresponding to\r\na single network owner, will also be considered. This work will examine a variety of other issues including:\r\nTypes of user traffic: e.g. elastic versus inelastic traffic, and splittable versus unsplittable demands (a\r\ndemand is a single user's traffic).\r\nMeasures of traffic quality: rates of flow versus transit delays.\r\nNetwork mechanisms: In particular, the use of buffering.",
