 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe principal investigator is working on the following two problems:\r\n(A) He is attempting to describe integral models for Shimura varieties at primes \r\nof non-smooth reduction. In particular, he studies ``local models\" for PEL \r\nShimura varieties and their relation with affine flag varieties for infinite \r\ndimensional groups, with symmetric spaces and with deformation spaces of \r\nGalois representations.The motivation is to obtain information that can be used \r\nin the calculation of the Hasse-Weil zeta function of these varieties and in \r\nother arithmetic applications. \r\n(B) He is studying the representations that appear in the cohomology of \r\narithmetic varieties with a group action.In particular, he continues his work \r\non developing fixed point formulas for calculating invariants of such (integral) \r\nrepresentations usingthe theory of cubic structures.\r\n\r\nThe investigator's research is in the field of arithmetic algebraic \r\ngeometry, a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics:\r\nthe geometry of figures that can be defined by the simplest equations, \r\nnamely polynomials, and the study of numbers. This combination has \r\nproved extraordinarily fruitful - having solved problems that withstood \r\ngenerations (such as ``Fermat's last theorem\"). The investigator's work \r\nmainly concentrates on the study of certain polynomial equations that \r\nhave many symmetries. There are connections with physics, the \r\nconstruction of error correcting codes and cryptography.\r\n",
