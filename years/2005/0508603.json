The theme reflects the interdisciplinary character of the host institution, the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, and reinforces the effort to broaden the traditional engineering participation to include applied mathematics, biomedical engineering, nanoscience, computational sciences, and computational electromagnetics, among others. A major emphasis will be placed on complex coupled problems requiring interdisciplinary approaches and the use of large computer resources.\r\n\r\nThe Eight Congress involves 64 mini-symposia which form the backbone of the meeting, and is expected to be the most important meeting to date.\r\n\r\nIt comes at a time in which the entire future of computational sciences and computer simulations is undergoing dramatic changes.\r\n\r\nNew challenges that are developing such as multi-scale modeling, stochastic modeling, and dramatic applications to biomedicine, homeland security, energy and the environment. These challenges have enticed the world's top researchers  to attend the meeting  to discuss new results, trends and important new developments.\r\n",
