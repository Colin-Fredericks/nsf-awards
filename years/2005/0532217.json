Gupta Professor of\r\nStatistics and Courtesy Professor of Computer Science, Purdue University\r\n\r\nThis project studies the building of a computational environment for six\r\nresearch projects that are bound together by the need to model data that\r\nare complex --- large data sets with complex patterns and dependencies\r\nthat require require complex models and algorithms.  Three of the\r\nprojects have as their goal data analysis: using methods of data mining,\r\nstatistical learning, and data visualization to study the problems in a\r\nsubject matter area through the analysis of complex data sets.  The other\r\nthree have as their goal new methods: the development of new approaches\r\nand tools of data mining, statistical learning, and data visualization\r\nfor complex data. For methods to work best for complex data, they must\r\nbe invented with the challenges of complex data in mind.\r\n\r\nThe environment needed for the analysis of complex data and the invention\r\nof new methods for them is quite different than that of grid computing\r\nenvironments, which have received substantial attention in the past. Data\r\nanalysis requires (1) an interactive environment with a good language for\r\nprogramming with data that provides rapid prototyping of new methods,\r\nand (2) a hardware environment that supports interactive computing with large\r\namounts of memory and rapid disk access to large databases.  A goal of the\r\nproject to study how to design such an environment and minimize cost.\r\n",
