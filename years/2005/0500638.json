 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will develop and apply combinatorial methods for \r\nstudying the topological structure of simplicial complexes and cell \r\ncomplexes arising in combinatorics and related fields. A major focus \r\nis to deal with complexes of more general topological type than many of \r\nthe prevalent methods within combinatorics were designed to handle, e.g. \r\nin new techniques for proving connectivity lower bounds. The \r\ninvestigator will continue her ongoing effort to develop techniques for \r\nconstructing discrete Morse functions with few critical cells, with \r\nemphasis on order complexes of partially ordered sets and on related \r\nfree resolutions (both for monomial ideals, and also for resolving a \r\nresidue field over a monomial or toric ring). Substantial improvement, \r\nat least for order complexes, will likely require better understanding \r\nof the very rich structure governing gradient paths between critical \r\ncells. In related work, she also plans to study Poincare' series for \r\nfree resolutions over monomial and toric rings, for instance trying to \r\nbetter understand for toric rings which such Poincare' series will be \r\nrational. She also intends to study modular elements in (non-geometric) \r\nlattices and to try to generalize lexicographic shellability to skeleta \r\nof complexes, motivated again by potential applications to constructing \r\nsmall free resolutions and also to bounding graph chromatic number (via \r\nbetter understanding of characteristic polynomial). \r\n\r\nTopological combinatorics, and in particular connectivity lower bounds, \r\nhave in the past been used to determine and verify complexity theory \r\nlower bounds on the running time for certain types of algorithms, to \r\ndeduce results in commutative algebra about relations among polynomials \r\nvia the theory of free resolutions, and also to give lower bounds on the \r\nnumber of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph in such a \r\nway that no two vertices sharing an edge are the same color. The \r\ninvestigator is interested in further developing combinatorial \r\ntechniques (such as a recently introduced discrete version of Morse \r\ntheory) for studying topological structure, letting potential \r\napplications guide the way. Morse theory is a classical theory which \r\nanalyzes the topological structure of an object by viewing the object \r\nprogressively from bottom to top, keeping track of essential data at \r\nthose moments in time where fundamental changes in structure take \r\nplace; recently Robin Forman introduced a discrete version of this \r\nseemingly inherently continuous notion. One of the investigator's \r\nmajor focuses is to develop to practical machinery for making this \r\ntheoretically very powerful tool convenient to use on real (and in many cases very complex) examples.\r\n",
