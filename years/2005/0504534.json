The PI is pursuing a research program concerning some\r\nbasic problems in these areas: 1. Interplay between positive\r\ncurvature (with Abelian symmetry) and topology. This project is\r\namplified by the amazing fact that among the manifolds of the\r\nsame dimension whose sectional curvature is between two positive\r\nconstants, all but finitely many admit (large) Abelian symmetry.\r\n2. The semi-rigidity of the moduli space of non-positively curved\r\nmetrics on a closed manifold.\r\n\r\nMathematics is the foundation of natural sciences, and\r\ndifferential geometry and Riemannian geometry is one of the most\r\nimportant branches of mathematics. The PI is pursuing solving\r\nsome basic problems in this field which would have a broad\r\nintellectual impact. PI will continue to actively pursue\r\ncollaborations with other mathematicians in US and abroad and to\r\nspeak at several national and international meetings a year.\r\n\r\nThe PI organized Riemannian geometry seminars in summers of\r\n2001-2004, which were designed to provide a forum for the\r\ndissemination of new ideas, in particular for graduate students.\r\nThe PI has had three papers with his graduate students and\r\npostdoctoral fellow which were the products of the summer\r\nseminars.  The PI will continue the Riemannian geometry summer\r\nseminars in the next three years. The PI has been writing two\r\nadvance graduate textbooks for three years (titled: ``The\r\nconvergence and collapsing theory in Riemannian geometry'' and\r\n``Positive curvature, symmetry and topology''). He wishes to\r\nfinish the two books in 2-3 years. This will not only benefit\r\ngraduate students and researchers from these areas (due to the\r\nlack of graduate textbooks in these topics) but also help to\r\nadvertise and disseminate Riemannian Geometry to students and\r\nmathematicians in other related fields, by giving them a quick\r\npicture of some of the research directions of Riemannian\r\ngeometry, and by showing them how the subject vitally interacts\r\nwith differential geometry, analysis and PDE, compact\r\ntransformation group theory and topology.\r\n",
