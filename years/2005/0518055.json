 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor George M. Whitesides at Harvard University who proposes research on understanding the fundamental processes that underlie equilibrium self-assembly, which is the spontaneous aggregation of \"components\" into larger, ordered structures without external (human or robotic) intervention. Components can be anything from ions to microcircuits. Self-assembly is a broad concept: in principle it includes many phenomena, and a range of sizes. Crystallization of water into ice, formation of crystals of colloid particles, formation of lipid bilayers, folding of proteins, growth of organisms, development of weather patterns, and formation of galaxies all involve self-assembly. There are several sub-categories in this host of examples: equilibrium and dynamic (that is, out-of-equilibrium) systems, non-living and living systems, and molecular and so-called meso-scale systems (systems bigger than molecules but still small on a macroscopic scale) are particularly relevant to Professor Whitesides' work. This research will develop equilibrium self-assembly of components having sizes larger than molecules (components with dimensions from millimeters to microns) with five objectives: i) to understand the fundamental processes that underlie equilibrium self-assembly; ii) to explore the scope of self-assembly using meso-scale components; iii) to develop systems (components and interactions) that will form the basis for self-assembly of useful, electrically and optically functional devices; iv) to abstract concepts based on biological self-assembly, and to use these concepts in meso-scale self-assembly; v) to develop design rules for self-assembly. \r\n\r\nThe Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor George M. Whitesides who hopes to extend fundamental understanding of self-assembly and molecular recognition to the meso-scale and the micro-scale. These concepts are well defined at the molecular level.  The most immediate practical impact of this work will be in fabricating microsystems (especially electronic microsystems such as displays and multicomponent circuits) without using robotic systems to position microscopic components. Microelectronics and other high technology industries will benefit from new tools for microscale assembly and three dimensional device integration. Professor Whitesides' research and other related activities have a very strong educational component. This includes both traditional and multidisciplinary training of graduate students and postdocs and working with undergraduate researchers, including ones from minority groups. Graduates from Whitesides' group form a growing group of faculty performing research in self-assembly and related disciplines.\r\n",
