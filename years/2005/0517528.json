 "awd_abstract_narration": "This team of instigators has offered a successful workshop on rigorous research on engineering education under another award (DUE-0341127) but, because of funding constraints, the number of faculty member involved is limited.  In order to leverage the impact, workshop organizers are expanding their approach in two ways.  First they are including \"Leadership Teams\" of experienced engineering education researchers who are acting as change agents on their campus. These teams include \"alumni\" from previous workshops who were able to begin successful individual engineering education research projects.  The project supports three-person \"Leadership Teams\" from five universities. Each team consists of two engineering faculty, joined by a faculty member with expertise in the learning sciences. This mix of engineers and learning scientists fosters collaboration between these disciplines. Each team is organizing two follow-up activities on their own campus.  The second approach is a shortened version of the workshop offered at three sites. These are 1.5 days in length - with the program starting one evening and continuing for the following full day.  Selected sites need to pay for room rental, AV, and advertising costs and guarantee workshop attendance of at least 40 engineering faculty.",
