 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop for young faculty who are potential submitters of CAREER, research, and other education proposals to NSF will be conducted in connection with the 2005 conference of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors. The workshop and associated conference will be held at Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. The workshop will address issues of research and education in an informal setting and will be coordinated by three former NSF CAREER awardees: Pedro Alvarez (Rice University), Susan Powers (Clarkson University) and Andria Costello (Syracuse University). Presentations also will be made by former NSF staff and by senior faculty leaders in the environmental engineering academic community. The workshop will engage young and more senior members of the BES and AEESP academic communities in a meaningful and focused dialogue that will hone the research design and presentation skills of the participants.",
