 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IGERT award at the Arts, Media and Engineering Program at Arizona State University will develop research and training mechanisms for the creation of a new class of media scientists. These scientists will produce new approaches for the integration of computational elements and digital media in the physical human experience.  Their work will result in experiential media systems - hybrid physical-digital environments that address significant challenges in key areas of the human condition such as health, education and everyday living. \r\n\r\nThe knowledge required to create experiential media systems is currently fragmented across engineering, sciences and arts. This IGERT award will train a new generation of hybrid media engineers-scientists-artists who are equipped to transcend this fragmentation.  The training will be realized through a large interdisciplinary network combining expertise from twelve contributing disciplines. This network will allow integrated advanced research in sensing, modeling, feedback, experiential construction and learning.  The research will result in new knowledge in media systems as well as within each contributing area.  It will also result in the development of large-scale applications of societal significance.  The graduate training mechanisms are implemented through formally approved concentrations within the graduate degree programs of participating disciplines.  They combine discipline specific education in one of the IGERT research areas with interdisciplinary training in media development. The framework of this IGERT allows for methodology found in the sciences to be combined with creativity found in the arts.  It will bridge the gap between computation and the physical experience, advance human-centric technologies and produce major advances in education, rehabilitation, communication, and everyday living. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.\r\n",
