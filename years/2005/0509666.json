The emerging field of spin-electronics promises to revolutionize microelectronics, providing lower power consumptions, increased functionality of current devices and the creation of entirely new electronic devices, by using another intrinsic property of the electron - its spin. This project will employ a variety of oxide materials in the fabrication of a set of structures that provide unique opportunities to tackle fundamental basic science issues that lie in the path of technological progress. In essence, the unique features of the oxide materials will be used to access new physics that is both fundamental and important for technology. The broader impacts of the work are provided by the technological relevance, the potential societal benefits of the development of new electronic devices, and the high level inter-disciplinary approach to the education and training of the graduate and undergraduate students involved in the research.     \r\n\r\n*** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT ***\r\nThe emerging field of spin-electronics promises to revolutionize microelectronics by using the spin of the electron in addition to its charge. This individual investigator project will utilize multi-functional perovskite oxides in the fabrication of a set of magnetic heterostructures providing access to some of the most important fundamental issues in spin-electronics. These heterostructures, which will be comprised of electron and hole doped perovskites, ferromagnets, insulators and metals, will enable the investigation of electrical control over magnetic properties, bipolar function with high sensitivity to magnetic fields, and electrical control over the electronic ground state. The broader impacts derive from technological relevance, the anticipated broad dissemination of research results, and the high level inter-disciplinary approach to the education of young researchers. The overall goal is the realization of a family of heterostructures with functionality that cannot be accessed in other materials, followed by the use of these structures to elucidate basic unsolved issues in condensed matter physics.  \r\n",
