 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a classification and monographically revise\r\nspecies and higher-level groups of a tribe of beetles distributed in\r\nAustralia, and the Americas. Over 100 new species are expected to be\r\ndescribed in these taxa. The study will combine morphological and\r\nmolecular analysis to produce taxonomic hypotheses, generic and species\r\n(re)descriptions and diagnoses, full illustrations for internal/external\r\nfeatures, species range maps, habitat data, identification keys for\r\ngenera and species in both internet/CD based and traditional printed\r\nforms, internet accessible specimen data and genus/species web pages.\r\nAll Australian loxandrine species will be revised and described and\r\ntools for identification will be provided for non-specialist. This group\r\nof beetles will then be available for consideration in conservation\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\nThe focus taxa of this study are a group of Australian Carabid beetles\r\nand this work will be the first major carabid clade in Australia to\r\nundergo cladistic analysis and modern classification. Australia is\r\nessential to our understanding of worldwide distribution patterns and\r\nthese beetles are a good model taxon for such studies. In terms of\r\nevolutionary significance, this study will investigate reproductive\r\nbiology and predator avoidance by chemical defense. Using the\r\nphylogenetic hypothesis and ecological information, the history of how\r\ndefensive compound changes have occurred in this lineage will be brought\r\nto light.\r\n\r\nThis revisionary syntheses in systematics proposal for loxandrine\r\ncarabid beetles will bring together data for specimens from major\r\ncollections worldwide and then return to these collections sorted,\r\nidentified and databased specimens. Distributional and life history\r\ndata, and web-based and standard published tools for identification will\r\nbe made available to all biologists. Monographic revision of these\r\ngenera and the tools to identify specimens will allow non-systematist to\r\nidentify these taxa and assess their occurrence in both ecological and\r\nhistorical terms. This will be a significant advance for a set of taxa\r\npresently completely unavailable for study.\r\n\r\nThe project integrates graduate and undergraduate students throughout by\r\ntraining them in field studies, specimen collection, preparation, insect\r\nmorphology, sequence acquisition, data collection and phylogenetic\r\nanalyses. Undergraduates will gain experience working in laboratory\r\nfacilities and museum collections and will learn basic identification\r\nand insect morphology. Graduate students will be fully integrated into\r\nmuseum research, specimen collection, dissection, morphological and\r\nsequence analyses and development and implementation of web resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
