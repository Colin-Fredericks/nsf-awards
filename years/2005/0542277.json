 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\ncDNA microarray analyses have been used extensively in biomedical research, however this research approach has not been developed for nonbio-medical organisms.  A cDNA microarray will be developed for studying brain behavior and socio-sexual behavior in the Tungara frog.   The Tungara frog has long been a model organism for studying sexual selection and the evolution of behavioral communication.  Gene expression profiles will be compared in frogs performing different reproductive behaviors to examine the evolution of those expression profiles within a species group.  The results will have direct application to related studies in  neurobiology, genetics, evolution, and behavior.  The broader impacts are that the technique will have broad application to an area of behavior for which it has not previously been available.  Also,  this research will complement projects in other fields of biology including development and population genetics also aimed at understanding genetic variation and the maintenance of diversity.  The project will involve undergraduates, a graduate student, and a post doc who will be involved in all aspects of the project.",
