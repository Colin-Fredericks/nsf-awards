 "awd_abstract_narration": "The notion that sexual traits are constructed at the expense of other functions (a trade-off) is central to the theory of sexual selection, and it is widely assumed that the expression of many such traits is condition dependent; however, rigorous empirical support for these conclusions is sparse. This project investigates sexual selection in the sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator using integrated laboratory and field observations and experiments. Male fiddler crabs have a greatly enlarged claw that is used in agonistic territorial contests with other males and also is waved in a species-specific display to attract receptive females. Identifying mechanistic links between the development of sexual traits and their associated costs is crucial to advancing understanding of sexual selection. None of the reviewers of this proposal raised any significant criticisms. The strength of this proposal is in the integration of behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, and functional measures of costs of the sexually selected claw.\r\n\r\nCriterion 2: Women and minority undergraduates have participated in this project thus far. Local outreach via the friends of the local pond has also been a part of the project thus far, as well as high school outreach\r\n\r\nConflicts of Interest: None\r\n\r\nPanel ranking: Outstanding\r\n\r\nProgram recommendation: The Program recommends funding of this proposal at the following levels.\r\n\r\n\tFY '05  $9,836\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam E.
