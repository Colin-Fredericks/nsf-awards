 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of the Oglala Lakota College Wayawawicakiya Waste (Good Teacher) \r\nSTEM Teachers of Excellence Education Program is to increase the number of highly qualified \r\nreservation based certified math and science secondary teachers in rural school systems.  \r\nStatistics indicate there is a severe shortage of quality teachers in secondary schools across \r\nreservations in South Dakota (SD).  Oglala Lakota College (OLC) has begun to address this \r\nproblem by creating a composite secondary baccalaureate degree program in Physical Science.  \r\nGraduates earning this degree are certified to teach secondary chemistry and physics in South \r\nDakota, and endorsements exist in math, biology and earth science.   \r\nThe Wayawawicakiya Waste program builds the capacity to graduate 25 new secondary \r\nteachers and sustain a pipeline of future teachers.  OLC has the infrastructure and expertise in \r\nplace to offer degree programs at distance to students across South Dakota.  In addition, the \r\nprogram offers face-to-face summer sessions designed to engage students in methodology \r\ntechniques, hands-on experience in science, opportunities to practice teaching and constructive \r\nevaluation sessions.   \r\nTo properly address the problem in reservation school systems, a project must include in-\r\nservice K-12 teachers.  The Wayawawicakiya Waste program extends the collaborative \r\nrelationships between OLC and partner K-12 schools by providing professional development \r\nopportunities in math and science for K-12 teachers and administrators.  Increasing the number \r\nof high quality secondary teachers and improving in-service teacher skills makes a broad impact \r\nin South Dakota school systems dominated by Native American students.  Partner K-12 \r\nsystems enroll over 14,000 students, approximately 90% of which are Native American.",
