The PI will develop a 40 GHz \"pathfinder array\", to be used for observations of the CMB, and ultimately pave the way for production of a larger-format camera.  With this instrument, it should be possible to increase observational sensitivity to polarization anisotropy, and better constrain foreground polarization contaminants.  The PI will involve undergraduates in her research.  A pilot program, involving a local high school teacher and two students in the PI's research, will also be undertaken - the longer-term goal is to include a student teacher from Columbia's Teacher's College, during each academic year, in the effort.\r\n\r\n",
