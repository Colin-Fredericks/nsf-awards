 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical models, based on atomic coordinates and built using rapid-prototyping technology, are being used in combination with traditional educational materials to engage students in a meaningful exploration of the three-dimensional concepts of biomolecular structure.  The students' use of these models is guided by supporting materials, including:\r\n\r\n(i) the \"Molecule of the Month\" web site, where for the past three years, a different molecular structure from the Protein Data Bank has been featured in a series of pages with concise text and compelling illustrations; \r\n\r\n(ii) a Chime tutorial that introduces students to the use of computer visualization tools; and \r\n\r\n(iii) structure files in the Protein Data Bank that are explored with these computer tools to further investigate the structure and function of each molecular topic.\r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the demonstration of physical molecular models as kinesthetic tools that engage students in an exploration of molecular structure, especially when used along with computer imagery.  The broader impacts of the project arise from the use of the models in a variety of educational settings, and the involvement of pre-service and in-service teachers as well as biology undergraduates.",
