 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for a new network infrastructure technology suitable for Grid Network Systems. The technology takes a diametrically different approach to building and operating distributed, multi-site networks. It is based on a concept of cooperating nodes forming cells that manage the traffic as a collection of distinguishable network segments with predictable traffic characteristics. The resulting network offers significant improvements over traditional IP networks in the areas of predictability, scaling, simplicity of operations, and ease of reconfiguration. It is fully compatible with all Layer 3 devices, protocols, and applications. In particular, it can co-exist with existing networks allowing gradual migration. In Phase I the feasibility of fundamental concepts will be verified and analyzed for practicality of implementation through a set of computer simulation sessions. \r\n\r\nThe technology is a different approach to building and operating networks. It will impact a wide range of applications in several markets and is certain to spawn new research in the areas of large-scale network architectures and distributed computing applications. The company intends to support these efforts through sharing concepts as well as through direct participation through partnerships and contracts in later stages. The first two targets for the technology are government data fusion and distribution systems for homeland security, and scientific research networks at universities and other research institutions. The former has a direct impact on the society by leading to improvements in national security. The latter directly enhances education and scientific research in many areas, most importantly those that utilize extensive computational resources such as molecular research, climate, astrophysics, particle physics, materials, and other.",
