Davis\r\nFlorida State University\r\nProject Summary\r\nThe proposed project is the first biography of Archie Carr (1909-1987), who was one of\r\nthe most revered twentieth-century naturalists, the world's authority on sea turtles throughout much of his career, and a central figure in the development of conservation biology as a scientific study. The intellectual merit of my study of Archie Carr is that it examines a remarkable scientist who led the campaign for the conservation of sea turtles around the world. Carr's story is compelling for three reasons. First, his study of turtles and herpetology spanned five decades (1937-1987) and his work reflected major shifts in the study of ecology and evolution in America across that period. Second, Carr was a nature writer, par excellence, and his stories made accessible the natural history of sea turtles and the culture of places they lived.  Finally, more than any other individual, Carr was responsible for the international conservation of sea turtles of all species.  As a biographical study of a naturalist of the twentieth century, this study will link Paul\r\nFarber's notion of the \"naturalist tradition\" to Thomas Soderqvist's provocative reification of the role of biography in the history of science. In addition to the two primary goals, this project will analyze narratives of science and conservation to bridge the gap between environmental history and the history of biology by demonstrating the significance of the naturalist tradition to the rise of environmentalism in America.\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, my study employs Carr's life and work as a lens through\r\nwhich to explore trends in the history of biology and important links to environmental history.  Through Carr I will consider issues in which he played a crucial role during his long career,  particularly the continued evolution of the naturalist tradition and the emergence of the activist scientist in the twentieth century. In addition to Carr's scientific research, his teaching, writing, and activism influenced a wide audience both within and beyond academia. In a similar vein, his biography has the potential to inspire current educators, nature writers, and conservationists. Sea turtles and their protection continue to fascinate scientists and lay people alike. Beyond the research outlined here, I address all of these issues in a new course I designed for undergraduates and graduate students called, \"Florida Environmental History\" and while directing and serving\r\non graduate committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
