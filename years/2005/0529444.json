 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Sensors and Sensor Networks (NSF 05-526), Sensors Interdisciplinary Research Group (SIRG) project is to conduct fundamental investigations towards the implementation of novel subwavelength microphotonic sensors for applications in manufacturing environments by studying the fundamental limits in the spatial and temporal resolutions of these sensors, developing innovative embedding techniques, and testing sensors in real manufacturing processes. Specifically, the research group will study the fundamental limit in the spatial and temporal resolution of integrated microphotonic sensors for temperature and strain measurements. Microphotonic sensors will be embedded into metals to ensure sensor survivability and reliability in manufacturing environments. An innovative batch fabrication of metal embedded subwavelength microphotonic sensors will be developed. Techniques will be studied and optimized for transferring metal embedded microphotonic sensors into larger metallic structures in manufacturing environments. The research group also seeks to implement these sensors in real manufacturing testbeds and utilize sensing data to achieve a better fundamental understanding of two important processes, chemical mechanical planarization for semiconductor manufacturing and continuous casting for steel production.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will significantly advance sensor technologies through an interdisciplinary study of subwavelength photonic sensors, sensor embedding into metals, and sensing in real manufacturing processes. Novel sub-wavelength microphotonic sensors along with innovative embedding techniques will yield measurements with high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and fast temporal response. The success of this project can significantly advance fundamental knowledge for chemical mechanical planarization and continuous casting of steel processes. The successful implementation of microphotonic sensor arrays could advance the fundamental understanding of numerous other manufacturing processes, thus significantly improving productivity and generating significant cost savings. Industrial testbeds will facilitate immediate technology transfer to industry, in addition to planned publications, short courses to industry, and patents. Undergraduate and graduate students will be able to get hands-on experience in subwavelength microphotonic technology. Summer workshops will be held and suitable science modules will be developed for K12 students and teachers. The PIs will also attract, retain, and engage students from under-represented groups.",
