 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support from a National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation grant will allow researchers at Minnesota State University Moorhead (MSUM) to develop innovative non-invasive approaches for studying our nation's cultural resources. Surface geophysical surveys provide a rapid, non-destructive means of mapping archaeological landscapes. Ground testing efforts to support archaeological interpretation of the geophysical data, however, have concentrated on traditional destructive approaches such as excavation. This grant will allow development of down-hole geophysical and laboratory soil magnetic techniques to drastically reduce the scope of invasive ground-testing operations, to improve the effectiveness of and interpretation of surface geophysical surveys, and to provide information on how archaeological sites and features formed and functioned. \r\n\r\nInstruments purchased will significantly expand an existing soil magnetic laboratory and suite of geophysical exploration equipment. The soil magnetic laboratory is the first of its kind in this country that is dedicated to archaeological application. Situated within the department of anthropology and earth science, one of only a few undergraduate departments in the U.S. that combines anthropology with the geosciences, these resources will allow the formal integration of the burgeoning fields of environmental magnetism and archaeological geophysics in efforts to better study cultural resources without destroying these irreplaceable remains. \r\n\r\nThis equipment provides an opportunity to address a number of critical questions about the past. For example, a common need in cultural resource management is the identification of cemeteries and unmarked graves. A major concern in such studies, especially among Native American groups, is the development of non-invasive techniques. Near-surface geophysical techniques offer a non-destructive means of mapping these resources; however, these techniques often do not provide data sufficient to identify individual grave locations nor to ascertain whether mapped anomalies are indeed graves. Combining down-hole magnetic susceptibility and laboratory magnetic techniques provides a new avenue for improving the ability of near-surface geophysical surveys for identifying unmarked human burials and also for evaluating and preserving them. Other applications include studying ancient settlement patterns and identifying previous land surfaces and locations of human habitation that are deeply buried beneath the current surface. This approach will also be useful in documenting achievements in earth construction of our first Native American landscape architects and for exploring historic places.\r\n\r\nThis combined geophysical approach will be incorporated into National Park Service (NPS) annual training courses attended by archaeologists from universities, Federal agencies, state agencies, Cultural Resource Management firms, Native American staff from environmental offices and cultural resource programs, and members of local archaeological societies. Equipment will be used within four interdisciplinary undergraduate courses and will make possible a number of improvements in curriculum, in opportunities for student growth and development, in research, and in service and outreach at MSUM and within a Tri-College consortium. It will be centered with a program committed to promoting active research as a means of involving its undergraduate students in meaningful research experiences and training. Nearly 200 students will be exposed to approaches developed with this equipment on a biennial basis. \r\n",
