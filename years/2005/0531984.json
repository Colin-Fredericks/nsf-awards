 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Auburn University Robert Noyce Scholarship Program (AURNSP) builds on the existing fifth year Masters Degree program in Mathematics Education that is designed for students who have a degree in mathematics. Over a four year period, AURNSP is providing two-year scholarships to a total of 23 highly qualified students (16 undergraduates and 7 graduate students) to  complete the Masters Degree. The course of study gives the participants the education course work and practicum experience necessary to obtain certification to teach mathematics in Alabama's secondary schools in grades 6-12. The recruitment program includes special attention toward African-American students and male students who could serve as role models for high school students. A mentoring plan being implemented is designed to introduce scholarship students to the teaching environment early and help them to stay in the teaching profession beyond the minimal required commitment. Two Mentoring Workshops are used to identify and train potential mentors. \r\n\r\nAURNSP is included in ongoing research efforts by faculty from the Department of Curriculum and Teaching and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. These researchers examine and study the effects of the increased mathematical content knowledge that the Noyce Scholars have and examine how this knowledge impacts on teacher pedagogical content knowledge, teacher practice, and student learning. Furthermore, with yearly examination of the program, researchers are determining how the content courses can be improved to inculcate pedagogical content knowledge and produce an appreciation for mathematics and how it can be used in the classroom to increase secondary students' interest in the mathematical sciences.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
