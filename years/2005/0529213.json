The network's purpose would be to facilitate a mutual understanding of each other's perspective and knowledge base with the intention of creating collaborative projects that would develop deliverables for the public understanding of engineering and engineering research in particular.  This 18-month effort includes two workshop sessions along with background fact-finding surveys, interviews, museum site visits and data collection about previous and extant informal science education activities and products in this area.  This endeavor is being positioned as a model for other similar collaborations.",
