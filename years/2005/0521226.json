 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports the acquisition of a modern X-ray diffractometer (XRD) system for qualitative and quantitative analysis of novel nanomaterials, organic films, and geological materials to enhance research and teaching at the University of Memphis (UofM), Memphis, TN, a major research institute serving the western region of Tennessee. The XRD will greatly enhance the research capabilities of the PI and co-PIs in the Department of Physics, Chemistry and Geological sciences and will provide excellent research opportunities to researchers from local schools, colleges, and industries. Examples of research projects that will benefit significantly from the requested XRD include: (1) nanostructured magnetic composites for enhanced magnetic materials; (2) protein thin films for understanding protein/surface interactions; (3) organic films for corrosion resistance; (4) nanoporous polymer films for sensor applications; and (5) several geochemistry studies of sediments and clay minerals for analysis of contaminant transport and their effects on soils. The modular design this versatile instrument permits collecting high-resolution x-ray diffraction data for variety of specimens-thin films to small powder samples-in wide variety of environmental conditions. In addition, this system will allow for accurate and efficient analysis of the acquired data using the latest software and databases available. Through participation in related research projects, graduate and undergraduate research students will have the opportunity to train in modern aspects of x-ray techniques. In addition, through the incorporation of laboratory experiments into existing and new classes, academic students will also benefit from the proposed facility. Finally, because the UofM has one of the largest minorities' students population (both African-American and women) in the region, the instrument will present an opportunity for UofM students belonging to an under-represented group to experience one of the most versatile and widely used experimental techniques in materials sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\nRealizing the need to prepare a workforce for industry and academia trained in the field of materials research, the UofM is actively pursuing avenues to improve its research personnel, laboratories, infrastructure, and training programs. The main objectives of these efforts are to build a strong foundation of faculty expertise and experimental facilities that will make UofM more competitive in attracting external research funds and to create a premiere training institute in the Mid-South. The acquisition of modern x-ray instrumentation will enable investigators from the UofM and surrounding institutions to carry out a number of diverse research and training activities, such as magnetic composites, protein thin films, corrosion resistance materials, sedimentology, and mineralogy. This instrument is highly versatile allowing researchers to study variety of materials from small amount of powder samples (for example geological samples) to metal thin films, bioorganic films, and colloidal materials. The system will aid in the present and future collaborative research activities within and between local universities and industries. The UofM ranks in the top 20 among non- predominantly-minority institutions nationwide with highest number of baccalaureate degrees awarded to African Americans, and a significant number of its students are so-called non-traditional.  Thus the proposed instrument will present an opportunity to under-represented groups to learn important experimental techniques in scientific research. The acquisition of the requested instrument is critical to furthering our research capabilities and realizing our student recruitment goals. \r\n",
