 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThis project is attacking the problem of low enrollment and success rates of Latinos and women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses and majors on two levels. First, it is improving college-level preparedness of entering freshmen students; and second, it is expanding academic support services to students in STEM \"gatekeeper\" courses -- courses essential for transfer to further education in any STEM field.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nMeasurable Objectives. The five year project objectives are to increase:\r\n__ The number of students enrolling in STEM courses, generally;\r\n__The number of Latino and women students enrolling in STEM courses;\r\n__Success rates for Latinos and women in STEM courses who participate in the project;\r\n__The number of Latino and women students achieving STEM AS degrees;\r\n__The number of Latino and women students transferring to four year schools in STEM majors.\r\n\r\nMethods. Based on documented, successful models, the project is creating a new summer bridge program for incoming freshmen and expanding supplemental instruction (SI) for current students. In addition, the project has created special academic supports for women in science: mentors and a seminar speaker series to showcase role models. The project builds on, links, and leverages previous and existing support that has recently improved the infrastructure of the College's STEM programs, including facilities, equipment, faculty, curriculum, and instructional materials. It is also addressing the needs of high tech local industry for qualified technological professionals in a broad range of occupations.\r\n",
