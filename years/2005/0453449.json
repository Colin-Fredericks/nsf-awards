 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics at Texas A&M University is sponsoring an NSF-funded international REU program at three sites in Taiwan:  Academia Sinica and National Taiwan University in Taipei, and National Cheng Kung University in Tainan.  The major goals of the program are to prepare undergraduates to pursue graduate training and careers in research, and instill a global awareness of research opportunities.  Students will perform cutting-edge research in biochemistry and molecular biology. At the conclusion of the program they will present their research in both written and oral reports.  Students will gain confidence in their ability to become integrated into unique lab settings conducting original research of importance to Taiwan, an appreciation for the similarities and differences in the conduct of research between the US and Taiwan, and a global perspective through social and cultural immersion in international science.  Up to eight students will be selected to participate in a 10-week summer program that will run approximately from the end of May through early August.  Typically, applicants should have completed their junior year, have domestic research experience, expressed a desire and willingness to gain experience in a foreign lab, and show the flexibility and openness needed to adapt in a foreign environment.  Applications from underrepresented minority groups are encouraged.  The ability to speak a Chinese dialect or mandarin is not required.  Selection will be based on the application, letters of recommendation and a telephone interview. More information is available at http://biochemistry.tamu.edu/?ch=reu&sec=reu or by contacting wayers@tamu.edu.",
