 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major aim of this project is to determine the complete genome sequences of two closely related bacterial endosymbionts that live in obligate symbiosis with the grain weevils Sitophilus zeamais and Sitophilus oryzae.  Although neither of these bacterial endosymbionts have been cultured in the laboratory, their DNA will be extracted directly from insect tissues and sequenced using automated, high-throughput procedures at the University of Utah Genome Center.  The sequence data will be annotated, analyzed and made accessible to the public through the NCBI microbial genomes database.  Comparative bioinformatic analyses will be performed on the complete endosymbiont genome sequences to understand the life histories and lifestyles of the weevil endosymbionts. \r\n\r\nIn the context of the wide array of microbial life on our planet the weevil endosymbionts are important for a number of reasons. They have served as a model system in symbiosis research for over a century, with more than 100 scientific papers describing studies involving this system.   Interaction between host and endosymbiont also will serve as a model for the study of degenerative evolutionary processes known to affect the genomes of both beneficial and harmful bacterial associates of animals and plants.  Finally, the weevils themselves are major insect pests of stored grain products.  Many billions of dollars are lost each year as a result of weevil infestation.  The availability of the complete genome sequences of the weevil endosymbionts will provide an understanding of biological interplay between the weevil hosts and their bacterial partners.  This should prove useful in the development of new pest control strategies.  The current project offers numerous opportunities for the training of high-school students along with undergraduate and postgraduate university students in the fields of bioinformatics, genomics and evolution.  Students will have opportunities to interact with scientists from a wide range of disciplines including biology, computer science and engineering.  \r\n",
