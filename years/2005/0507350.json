 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0507350\r\nRebecca Bernstein\r\nUniversity of Michigan Ann Arbor\r\nMeasuring Detailed Abundances of Extragalactic Globular Clusters\r\nOur understanding of the formation and chemical enrichment processes of normal galaxies is largely\r\nconstrained by evidence from one galaxy: the Milky Way. That evidence is largely revealed in the detailed\r\nabundance patterns of old stars, which bear the fossil record of the Galaxy's gas chemistry at the time they\r\nformed. It has never been possible to obtain similar evidence in even one other normal galaxy. This is simply\r\nbecause old stars beyond the nearest dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Local Group are too faint to be\r\nobserved at the high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution needed for abundance analysis.\r\nUnlike single stars, high-resolution spectra can be obtained of unresolved globular clusters at distances as\r\nlarge as 4 Mpc with current telescopes. Globular clusters are bright enough and have low enough velocity\r\ndispersions that even weak lines could be detected in spectra of their integrated light. Detailed abundances\r\nhave never been obtained for unresolved globular clusters only because current methods of abundance\r\nanalysis only work for individual stars. A method for abundance analysis of integrated-light spectra will\r\nmake it possible to measure detailed abundances in the massive galaxies of the Local Group and well\r\nbeyond.\r\nTo develop this technique, a training set of resolved globular clusters in the Milky Way and Large\r\nMagellanic Cloud will be created. In these training set clusters, color magnitude diagrams and fiducial\r\nmetallicities from single stars can be obtained, supplying a wealth of information for developing and testing\r\nthe proposed method for analyzing the integrated light spectra of unresolved globular clusters. Crucially, the\r\ntraining set includes globular clusters of a wide range of ages and abundances, so that the necessary\r\nstrategies can be developed to deal with such variations in unresolved globular clusters.\r\nPreliminary results demonstrate the potential of this technique, with reasonable abundances being derived\r\nfrom the integrated spectra of NGC 6397 and 47 Tucanae. However, a number of additions/improvements\r\nwill also be added here. These include incorporation of blended lines in the synthesis (including the effects of\r\nhyperfine splitting), profile matching of strong lines, and consideration of possible non-local thermodynamic\r\nequilibrium effects. In addition, issues which may affect the confidence of the results will also be explored:\r\nhorizontal branch morphology and what constraints can be applied through spectral indicators (e.g.,\r\nhydrogen line widths), the sensitivity to the luminosity function of stars at the low mass end, as well as the\r\ngiants, and the importance of assumed alpha-element enhancements in the modeling process.\r\nThis method for measuring abundances will let astronomers study the detailed chemical enrichment histories\r\nof galaxies beyond the Milky Way for the first time. This will dramatically increase the pool of observational\r\nconstraints on galaxy formation theories and therefore have broad impact on our understanding of galaxy\r\nformation. The training set spectra themselves will also provide abundances of Magellanic Cloud clusters\r\nwhich are not yet well known, provide a calibration library for line index systems, and help astronomers\r\nunderstand the initial mass function of stars in globular clusters and the nucleosynthetic yields of supernovae.\r\nThe training set spectra will also be made available through existing database as soon as they are published.\r\nA majority of the funding goes to supporting the training and education graduate students using state of the\r\nart observational facilities and computational tools.",
