Instead of shrinking a standard mass spectrometer, the aim of high performance chemical analysis will be achieved by creating a 3D array of miniature ion traps with a relatively large total ion capacity. Developments at both the nanoscale, such as nano field emitters, and at larger scales, such as the creation of three-dimensional trapping geometries and arrays, are necessary to make a reliable sensor. Hence the need to produce a sensor in a package and to utilize a range of fabrication scales, from micro through meso to macroscale. Answers to fundamental questions that limit performance of micro ion trap mass spectrometers will be sought by a combination of (i) metrology, in order to characterize the mechanical and electrical properties of the operating device (ii) experiment, in order to characterize the overall performance and (iii) simulations, in an attempt to predict performance and identify key limiting characteristics. \r\n\r\nBroad Impact:  The need for reliable detection of toxic chemicals is obvious for national safety concerns, where highly specificity and sensitivity must be combined with low false positive and false negative rates.  In addition, the scaling of the spectrometer to a sensor level will enable the use of these sensors for everyday, non-military environments. For example, a highly sensitive handheld chemical detector usable on a flexible variety of chemicals, will revolutionize the way in which criminal evidence is collected and processed.   However, highly specific yet mobile devices are needed in order for these new classes of law enforcement applications to be developed.  Sensors that become ubiquitous in everyday life might very well result with successful overcoming the fundamental's barring the shrinking of mass spectrometers. As a specific demonstration of this technology, Purdue will work with local law enforcement agencies to demonstrate the specificity needed for use of the devices for law enforcement applications.  Rapid detection of chemicals on-site would allow for decisions to be made in real time without the lag of having to sample and test in a traditional laboratory setting.  One such example would be the on-site identification and documentation of crystal methamphetamine (or other synthetic drugs) production in the increasingly-common makeshift homelab environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
