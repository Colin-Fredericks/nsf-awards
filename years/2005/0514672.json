 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to educate children between the ages of 10 and 18 about the ecology of insects and forests, how human activities affect their interaction, and how scientific research is conducted.  It will disseminate information throughout Indiana based on research award DEB 0345331, Cicadas and Forests Education.\r\n\r\nFor a period during May and June 2004 the United States was captivated by periodical cicadas in an unusual convergence of popular and scientific interest.  This project will use this heightened awareness as a vehicle for informal science education as additional broods emerge in 2007 and 2008 in the Midwest and South.  The project will use existing video footage from the research to produce a documentary film on periodical cicadas for airing on public television stations and distribution on DVDs to schools; an interactive computer-based presentation in PowerPoint; and an interactive 3-D animation of the cicada life cycle for use in a science center.  Project collaborators include local public television stations, Wonderlab (a science museum), the Indiana State Museum and school systems in Indiana. \r\n\r\n",
