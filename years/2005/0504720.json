The first problem is related to the design of absorbing \r\nboundary conditions for nonlinear partial differential equations. The main \r\ngoal is to obtain absorbing boundary conditions for systems such as those \r\nof fluid dynamics. This work will contain numerical computations as well \r\nas advanced microlocal analysis. The second problem deals with the \r\noptimization of the transmission conditions in domain decomposition \r\nmethods. The principal investigator intends to use the absorbing boundary \r\nconditions designed for nonlinear partial differential equations to \r\noptimize the transmission conditions. This project will contain in \r\nparticular numerical computations. The third area of work deals with \r\nlong-time existence for nonlinear partial differential equations on \r\ncompact manifolds. The aim is to improve the estimate on the time of \r\nexistence given by the local existence theory for solutions of nonlinear \r\npartial differential equations. The mathematical techniques will involve \r\nadvanced tools in analysis. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on three problems, two problems being related to \r\nnumerical analysis and one to qualitative properties of nonlinear partial \r\ndifferential equations. The suggested works involve very interesting \r\nmathematical questions and at the same time are important for \r\napplications. The first and the second problem tackle with the numerical \r\ncomputation of huge systems and have therefore applications in numerous \r\nareas such as environmental sciences (oceanography and meteorology) as \r\nwell as medicine (simulation of blood flows in human vascular system). \r\nWhile it is too soon to appraise the wide societal impact of the third \r\nproblem, the last decades have seen stunning applications in many fields \r\n(e. g. environmental sciences and dynamic of populations to name just a \r\nfew) of the study of qualitative properties of partial differential \r\nequations. These three proposed problems will solidify important \r\nconnections between area of modern mathematical research such as numerical \r\nanalysis, nonlinear partial differential equations and advanced microlocal \r\nanalysis. The principal investigator will disseminate results of the \r\nproject among both applied and pure mathematicians.\r\n",
