 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThis department level reform project will investigate how emphasizing student development over knowledge acquisition impacts student learning; how removing legacy material impacts learning; and how engaging current and future faculty in the scholarship of teaching impacts their own development and student learning. This reform effort will demonstrate how to identify legacy material in the broad context of student development rather than through the intrinsic merit of a concept. The reform effort is based on a solid understanding of how students learn engineering, and scientifically based evidence will assess both individual student learning and the impact of the program as a whole. Internal and external assessment is designed to guide the project as well as measure changes in student learning.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nEngineering Students for the 21st Century will demonstrate that students' preparation for-and engagement in-engineering can be increased by creating classes that directly address student development. The model is widely adaptable. Small changes to an engineering program can have a large impact, and the approach used is robust; students' experiences are decoupled from changes in the curriculum, course, or the faculty who teach the course. This project builds resources, communities, and partnerships to engage current and future faculty in curriculum reform. Both graduate and undergraduate students become involved in curriculum reform to prepare them for future roles as researchers, teachers, and scholars. Local and national partnerships will assess the impact of this project on student learning, and will allow PI's to broadly disseminate the results. The curricular changes are based on established educational techniques that are proven to engage and retain under-represented groups, particularly women.\r\n",
