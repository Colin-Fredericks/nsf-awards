Weng\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n        \r\nPreliminary experiments on certain nanocrystalline metals have indicated that, at room temperature, their strength could increase by 4-5 times as compared to the coarse-grained materials that we are using in our industry. But the precise amount of increase for each material and the exact grain size at which such optimal strength could occur, are not known, and there are other factors that could affect the attainment of the optimal strength. In this project we will develop micromechanics-based models to search for such optimal conditions that lead to the highest possible strength and ductility at both room and high temperature, for both metals and ceramics. The outcome of this research will have significant impact to our industry in the production of super strong, high-temperature resistant, and high ductility materials. \r\n\r\n        \tWe also plan to introduce the subject of nano-mechanics to our undergraduate and graduate students, to prepare them for the next generation of nanotechnology.\r\n",
