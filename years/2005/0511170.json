 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric Sciences (41) \r\nThis project is modifying an existing introductory Meteorology course by transforming the method of instruction to one that emphasizes active learning.  Educational materials and pedagogical methods developed and successfully implemented at the University of Illinois and other four-year colleges are being adapted to use a diverse community college student body.  While active learning methods have been effective in promoting successful student learning and countering common student misconceptions, almost no work has been done on adapting active learning methods to meteorology at a community college.  Student misconceptions related to concepts in meteorology are being examined, and active learning modules that entail observation and analysis of physical phenomena related to meteorology are being introduced in class.  The objective is that students develop a better appreciation of science, a deeper understanding of relevant scientific principles, as well as increased scientific literacy as a result of these modules.  This project is also intended to have a positive impact on student retention and performance, as many suffer from math and science anxiety and have had negative experiences with traditional science classes.  If successful, this project could serve as a model for pedagogical reform in other urban community colleges.",
