 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Missouri-Rolla is awarded a grant to enhance MorphologyNet (http://www.morphologynet.org), a digital library of realistic, 3D interactive and customizable images of anatomy. Reconstructions in MorphologyNet illustrate all tissues and structures (including soft tissues) as separate objects, and thus they can be manipulated just as a real biological object, including rotation in all planes simultaneously, and \"dissection\" of tissues and structures. Users can customize the color, texture and opacity of images to make them more realistic. MorphologyNet imports OBJ files, allowing nearly any researcher to contribute 3D reconstructions of anatomy to the depository; thus it is a worldwide community-based resource. All images are available on the web, the user-interface is simple to use, and no proprietary software is required. \r\nThis award funds enhancements to MorphologyNet including generating additional 3D reconstructions and animations to augment the foundational data set, creating an object-oriented database for storage of images and associated materials, further enhancing the user-friendly interface and applet for access, manipulation, and analysis of images, and developing a collaborative network of contributors and users representing all taxonomic groups and promoting contribution to and use of the site. The project will include training of undergraduate and graduate students; developing an accessible and easy-to-use educational resource; building an interactive library of 3D visualizations that will facilitate anatomical research; promoting communication among researchers by providing a digital library for accession of research results (but allowing them to retain ownership); and facilitating further integration of biological sub-disciplines by integrating anatomical data with other data sources. \r\n",
