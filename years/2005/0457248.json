 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tClassical multiple endpoint testing procedures such as Scheffe,\r\nTukey, Bonferroni etc. are oftentimes too conservative.  This is\r\nparticularly true if the number of endpoints is large as in many recent\r\napplications.  In an effort to declare significance of endpoints more\r\nrapidly than classical multiple comparison methods permit, procedures with\r\nstepwise structure were introduced.  Most recent procedures have a\r\nstepwise structure, that is they are either single-step, step-up or\r\nstep-down.  To evaluate and compare procedures the proposers have studied\r\nproperties of these stepwise procedures.  One very surprising result of\r\nconsiderable practical value is that the popular step-up procedure is\r\ninadmissible, even for a vector risk function consisting of average size\r\nas one component and average type II error as the other component.  The\r\nstep-up and step-down procedures also have a disturbing practical\r\nproperty; namely a small negative change in one variable accompanied with\r\nreasonably sizeable positive changes in other variables can lead from many\r\nrejections to many acceptances.  The current proposal is to find \"smooth\"\r\nprocedures that retain the desirable properties of stepwise procedures\r\nwhile improving on the shortcomings.  By representing the step-up\r\nprocedure as a linear combination of products of indicator functions a\r\nsmooth competitor to step-up is found and will be evaluated.  Another idea\r\nproposed is to find a parametric empirical Bayes procedure that will\r\ncontrol the average size component of the vector risk used to evaluate\r\nprocedures.  A critical aspect of the proposal is to study the amount of\r\nimprovement the new methods have over step-up.\r\n\r\n\tThe investigators study the problem of how to decide which among\r\nmany possible individual entities are significant.  For example, there are\r\nthousands of a person's genes examined in a microarray.  Which genes are\r\ndifferent or expressed differently when one examines cancer patients\r\ncompared to non-cancer patients.  To be able to decide such could provide\r\na valuable diagnostic tool for early detection of cancer.  This example,\r\nis one of many, that illustrates the problem of multiple testing\r\nprocedures.  Other areas of application include detection of covert\r\ncommunications, detection of bioweapons, comparing several treatments with\r\na control, examination of mutual fund data in an effort to single out\r\nsuccessful funds, examining testing methodologies in education and\r\npsychology settings.  New and efficient statistical methodologies are\r\nintroduced and analyzed in this research undertaking.\r\n",
