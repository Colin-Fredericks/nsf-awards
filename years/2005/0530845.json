 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a new collaboration between geoscientists \r\nand mathematicians at two locations: Norman, Oklahoma and Boulder, \r\nColorado. The initiative brings scientists new to the atmospheric \r\nscience community to aid in the development of parallel, adaptive, \r\nunstructured, high-order methods for atmospheric modeling. Established \r\natmospheric modelers will guide the effort, offering their experience \r\nwith numerical modeling of complex weather systems. The collaboration \r\nalso brings together the considerable expertise and resources of the \r\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) located in Boulder, \r\nColorado and the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) located in \r\nNorman, Oklahoma. The NCAR effort will build on its experience of \r\ndeveloping high-order adaptive spectral element solvers for the \r\nshallow water equations, moving to high-order finite-volume adaptive \r\nDiscontinuous Galerkin methods for the nonhydrostatic equation set. \r\nThe NSSL effort will aid in this development by addressing the \r\nadaptivity and parallel computing issues and testing the methods on a suite of \r\ntest problems of increasing complexity with a central long term goal of \r\nmodeling tornadoes.\r\n\r\nWeather simulation is a complex problem involving many different scales\r\nand requiring high resolution solutions of the equations governing the \r\nEarth's atmosphere. Recently, it has been recognized that localized flow \r\nstructures, such as storms, may play an important role in obtaining the best \r\nweather forecast. Higher resolution weather simulations are required in \r\napplications in the atmospheric and air quality communities, at operational centers \r\naround the country attempting to forecast significant weather events, and for \r\nresearch endeavors that focus on the dynamics of severe storms such as \r\nhurricanes or tornadoes. Recent developments in computational mathematics techniques may be \r\napplicable to these models in order to tailor them to treatment of local \r\nstructures such as storms and fronts. This project aims to create a collaboration between  \r\nmathematicians who have developed these methods and meteorologists who \r\nhave modeled and studied such events, that will yield more efficient \r\nand accurate models. Across the globe weather modelers are striving to increase resolution \r\nfor the models, but are limited in their methodology to only reducing \r\nthe spacing, thereby increasing computer time significantly. The US is \r\nalready behind in that race. This project would leapfrog that strategy \r\nby developing more efficient models that can automatically hone in on \r\nlocalized structures with high precision. \r\n",
