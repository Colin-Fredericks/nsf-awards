 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIn recent years, there have been many deep connections found between\r\nhomotopy theory and commutative algebra. This research continues this\r\npursuit in several such directions. First, the study of topological spaces\r\nor structured spectra through algebraic invariants, such as homotopy or\r\n(co-)homology, can be studied from the global perspective on the\r\nalgebraic side via a moduli space of structures. A fine invariant for\r\nstudying such a moduli space is the cotangent complex associated to the\r\ngiven algebra. One part of this research, in joint work with Paul Goerss,\r\nwill look to extend the study of Hopkins-Miller-Mahowald-Goerss on\r\ntopological modular forms from, which realized Lubin-Tate algebras as\r\nE_\\infinity ring spectra and calculated their endomorphisms, to more\r\ngeneral Shimura varieties. In a similar vein, this research will\r\nseek to clarify, in joint work with David Blanc and Mark Johnson, how a\r\nvariation of this cotangent complex controls the question of \r\nrealizing a diagram of\r\n\\Pi-algebras as a diagram of spaces, by looking for ways of connecting\r\ncohomological obstructions to things like Toda brackets.  Finally, this\r\nresearch will seek to extend Grothendieck's program for classifying smooth\r\nschemes to more general schemes in the setting of derived algebraic geometry.\r\nThe driving mechanism will be to take the cotangent complex to be the proper\r\nanalogue of the Kahler differentials and generalize accordingly. This would\r\nframe the approach of characterizing commutative algebras using the\r\nsimplicial resolutions (as ultimately articulated by M. Andre and D. \r\nQuillen) in\r\nan algebraic geometric setting.\r\n\r\nThroughout the history of string theory in theoretical physics, \r\nsurprising connections\r\nhave been made between several areas of pure mathematics - in \r\nparticular, number\r\ntheory and topology. One such connection has been made between the \r\narithmetic of\r\nelliptic curves and modular forms, important in A. Wiles resolution \r\nof Fermat's Last\r\nTheorem, and cohomology theories in topology - the connection\r\nbeing relevant to string theory via the concept of elliptic genera. \r\n From the topologist's\r\nstandpoint, some of the relevant properties being sought can be \r\nexpressed in terms of\r\nwhether the cohomology's associated spectrum possesses a suitable \r\nmultiplicative structure.\r\nThe question of realizing such structures can lead to questions \r\nregarding ways in which\r\ncommutative algebras and homotopical structures in topology interact. \r\nThe goal of this\r\nresearch is to further understand such interactions in two ways. The \r\nfirst is to collectively\r\nstudy all possible multiplicative structures on a spectrum with a \r\nprescribed algebraic data\r\nvia the concept of a moduli space. The other approach utilizes a \r\nglobal geometric device,\r\ncalled a stack, to understand these multiplicative spectra \r\ncollectively in the context of a\r\nmore homotopical notion of algebraic geometry. The aim of this \r\nresearch will then focus\r\non studying other possible multiplicative spectra associated to \r\ncohomology theories which arise\r\nfrom more general arithmetic forms, such as automorphic forms. \r\nInvolved in this project\r\nis also the aim to characterize basic types of objects in this \r\nhomotopical algebraic geometry\r\nand drawing connections to recent homological characterizations of algebras.\r\n\r\n",
