 "awd_abstract_narration": "This leads to education challenges and opportunities. The challenges lie in developing a curriculum which suits the needs of students seeking to be educated in this field, suitably spans the broad interdisciplinary space covered by MEMS, and creates a technically prepared workforce. The opportunity exists to incorporate MEMS into mainstream engineering education or to consider how it might be used as a vehicle to effect change in engineering education.\r\n\r\nWe propose a workshop to bring together academics who teach MEMS courses, along with experts in education and representatives from MEMS industry. The first workshop will precede the MEMS 2005 workshop in Miami, FL, lasting 1 day on January 30, 2005. \r\n\r\nBroad Impact\r\nThe expected outcome of this workshop would be identification of \"best practices\" that may be shared across organizations teaching MEMS courses. In addition, the workshop will seek to identify cross-cutting issues which might be the foundation for a set of recommendations on areas where sponsor organizations could invest in MEMS educational development.\r\n\r\nIntellect Merit\r\nThe intellectual merit of this workshop lies in the dissemination of teaching practices, development of improved MEMS curricula, and the sharing of information across interdisciplinary barriers. \r\n\r\n",
