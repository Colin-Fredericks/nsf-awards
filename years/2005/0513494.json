Scanlon\r\n\r\nThe research supported by this award is to be performed by\r\nMatthias Aschenbrenner, under the sponsorship of Thomas\r\nW. Scanlon.  These projects in model theory and its applications\r\nto algebra and geometry are concerned with asymptotic\r\ndifferential algebra, o-minimal geometry, and bounds and\r\nalgorithms in algebra.  The project on asymptotic differential\r\nalgebra will pursue model-theoretic and algebraic properties of\r\nHardy fields and transseries, and the relationship between them.\r\nA Hardy field is an ordered differential field of germs of\r\nreal-valued, once-differentiable functions defined on\r\nneighborhoods of positive infinity in the real line; they are\r\nimportant in the asymptotic theory of differential equations and\r\nappear naturally in connection with o-minimal expansions of the\r\nreal field.  An example of a field of transseries is the field of\r\nlogarithmic-exponential series over the real numbers, which has\r\nbeen explored by analysts as well as model-theorists.  Among the\r\nalgorithmic issues in algebra that will be investigated are\r\nalgorithms with performance bounds for polynomial rings over the\r\nintegers and for rings of power series; problems for which good\r\nalgorithms are sought include tests for ideal membership.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the branch of logic called model theory is, roughly, that\r\nif we know all of the simply-stated truths about an object then either\r\nwe should know how to recognize that object uniquely, or anything else\r\nsharing the same collection of first-order properties should be\r\nrevealing like the original and might sometimes be easier to study.\r\nTo be more precise, model theory studies mathematical structures by\r\nconsidering the first-order sentences true in those structures, and\r\nthe family of alternate structures that also satisfy all of those\r\nfirst-order sentences.  (Sentences in logic are built out of a small\r\nrepertoire of elements and constructions.  \"First-order\" refers to the\r\nnumber of quantifiers in a sentence, a measure of complexity.)\r\nA model for the algorithms and bounds sought in some of these projects\r\nis long division: if you are given two whole numbers to divide by hand\r\nthen you can estimate the number of steps required by long division\r\nby comparing the number of digits in the decimal expansions\r\nof the dividend and divisor.",
