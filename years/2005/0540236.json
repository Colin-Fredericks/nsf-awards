Ozsvath\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal for a four-day-long, broad conference at\r\nColumbia University on \"Topology, Geometry, and Physics.'' The\r\nconference will focus on the following major themes, and their\r\ninterconnections: hyperbolic manifolds and geometrization gauge\r\ntheory, three- and four-manifolds, Hodge theory, and interactions\r\nbetween mathematics and modern physics. Such a conference is\r\nparticularly timely, in view of the many breakthroughs in each of\r\nthese subjects. In particular, the recent spectacular work of\r\nPerelman on the Poincare conjecture and Thurston's geometrization\r\nconjecture, as well as new developments in hyperbolic geometry,\r\nmake this an especially opportune moment to survey the new\r\nlandscape of three-manifold theory. At the same time, new\r\ntechniques of gauge theory and new combinatorial methods have\r\ndeepened the current understanding of three- and four-manifolds\r\nand it is time to take stock of these developments and their\r\nrelation to other work in the field. Many of the new results in\r\ngeometric topology have been based upon ideas arising in\r\nmathematical physics and geometric analysis, and these kind of\r\ninteractions will serve as a unifying theme for the conference.\r\n\r\nA fundamental problem in mathematics is to describe all possible\r\nshapes. In the case of surfaces (two dimensional objects),\r\npossible shapes include a sphere (the surface of the earth, for\r\nexample), a torus (the surface of a tire) and more complicated\r\ngeneralizations. A great deal of research has been concerned with\r\ndimension three, the dimension of space, and dimension four, the\r\ndimension of space-time.  Because of its relevance to\r\nunderstanding our physical world, understanding all possible\r\nshapes in these dimensions is particularly\r\nimportant. Paradoxically, these cases are much harder to\r\nunderstand and to classify than higher-dimensional objects (which\r\nin turn are much harder to visualize in any meaningful way). The\r\nstudy of dimensions three and four has drawn on a rich variety of\r\nmathematical and physical ideas. Recent work of a Russian\r\nmathematician, G.  Perelman, seems to confirm one of the famous\r\noutstanding conjectures of topology, the Poincare conjecture\r\n(which gives a complete characterization of the three dimensional\r\nanalogue of a sphere), as well as a profound generalization of\r\nthis conjecture, the geometrization conjecture of Thurston, which\r\ngives in principle a scheme whereby one could describe all\r\npossible three-dimensional shapes. A major goal of this\r\nconference is to understand these new ideas, as well as other\r\nrecent work in dimensions three and four, and to evaluate our new\r\nunderstanding of geometry and topology in these dimensions.\r\n",
