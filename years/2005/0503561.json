 "awd_abstract_narration": "Initiative for Equity in the Geosciences: Track 2\r\n\r\nSACNAS is increasing the geoscience content at its annual National Conferences and is providing minority students in disciplines ranging from geology to meteorology an opportunity to build a national geoscience network. At meetings students are exposed to cutting-edge research; geoscience career and fellowship opportunities; exhibitors representing professional associations; venues for presenting research; and mentoring related to the professional demands and concerns shared by minority students and faculty from the larger scientific community. Utilizing its solid network of leading scientists and engineers, SACNAS is accelerating its effort to integrate geoscience research and education and advance the teaching and learning of geoscience at its annual Conference. This project will recruit Native American and Chicano/Latino undergraduate and graduate students in geoscience disciplines each year for five years (2006-11) to attend the SACNAS Conference. Participating students are provided with early mentoring opportunities designed to assist them with their plans for higher education and employment as researchers and educators in the geosciences. Scientific symposia sessions focusing on advances in the geosciences and opportunities for students are open to all.  The SACNAS website and monthly e-nouncements disseminate information about geoscience research opportunities.  A workshop at the conference for K-12 teachers focuses on geosciences is also provided, with mentoring support throughout the year.  The project will be evaluated as to its effectiveness as a mentoring initiative by tracking the educational progress of conference geoscience participants over time. \r\n",
