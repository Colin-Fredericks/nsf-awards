 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researchers propose to use a unique data set, the Survey of International Air Travelers (SIAT),\r\nthat will make possible the doctoral dissertation of the co-PI on the subject of the interaction of\r\ninternational trade with international travel. The SIAT covers all overseas air travel from the\r\nU. S., by destination country, purpose of trip, and characteristics of the travelers including\r\ncountry of residence. These data are available quarterly for the period 1993 to the present.\r\nIntellectual merit. In her dissertation the co-PI will use the SIAT to investigate at least\r\nthree topics. First, the direction of causality between trade and travel will be examined. Using\r\nappropriate panel estimation techniques, it will be determined whether bilateral business travel\r\nhelps to forecast bilateral trade and vice-versa. Second, the dissertation will explore the\r\nmechanisms that underlie the increasingly well-established positive relationship between\r\nimmigration and bilateral trade. The interactions between immigrant stocks and bilateral\r\nbusiness and leisure travel by immigrants will be estimated for both U.S. exports and U.S.\r\nimports. The hypothesis will be tested that the interaction with leisure travel will be stronger\r\nrelative to the interaction with business travel for bilateral imports than for bilateral exports.\r\nThis would confirm the conjecture in the literature that the stronger impact of immigrants on\r\nimports than exports reflects the effect of immigrant taste for goods from their countries of origin\r\nover and above their promotion of trade through business contacts and provision of market\r\ninformation. Third, the co-PI will use the SIAT to extend recent results showing that business\r\nand social networks have a stronger positive impact on bilateral trade in differentiated than\r\nhomogeneous products. It has been conjectured that these results reflect the more informationintensive\r\nnature of differentiated products. If this is true than differentiated products should\r\nrequire both greater sales effort and more after-sales service, and we expect to find stronger\r\ncausal relationships running from bilateral business travel to bilateral trade and vice-versa for\r\ndifferentiated than for homogeneous products.\r\nBecause the SIAT is an unknown data set and we were concerned about its quality, the PI's\r\nobtained a small seed grant and purchased data for the first quarter of 2000 for the purpose of\r\npreliminary testing. The PI's added bilateral business travel to a standard cross-sectional gravity\r\nmodel of bilateral U.S. trade. If bilateral business travel had no explanatory power it would\r\naugur poorly for the usefulness of the full SIAT data set. In fact, the PI's found that bilateral business\r\ntravel has a strong positive association with both U.S. bilateral exports and bilateral imports,\r\nespecially the former. These preliminary results are a positive indicator for the quality of the\r\nSIAT data and suggest there is much insight to be gained from use of the complete data set.\r\nBroader impacts. The qualitative nature and quantitative importance of informal barriers\r\nto international trade remains an important question in international economics. The study will\r\nhelp to gain a better understanding of how informal barriers to trade work and how large they\r\nare. By quantifying the extent to which international business travel causes international trade,\r\nthe study could also help to evaluate the many government programs worldwide that promote\r\nbusiness travel for the purpose of creating trade, including trade missions sponsored by the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Commerce.",
