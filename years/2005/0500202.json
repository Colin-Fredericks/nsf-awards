 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n  The first main theme of the proposal is the study of points on curves \r\nof genus 1, more particularly points which are defined over solvable \r\nextensions of the ground field. This is joint work with Ciperiani and aims \r\nto prove that for genus 1 curves defined over a totally real number field there \r\nare always points defined over a solvable extension of the base field. In \r\nthe first instance we are aiming to prove the existence of such points \r\nwhile assuming that there exist points over all p-adic fields, but this \r\ncondition should be easy to remove. We note that we do not wish to assume \r\nanything about the rank of the Jacobian of the curve. The second theme of \r\nthe proposal is to continue a study of the problem of non-solvable base \r\nchange. For the moment the intent is to restrict attention to the case of \r\nholomorphic forms on GL(2).\r\n\r\n  There are two main problems being investigated in this project. The \r\nfirst problem is to try to extend the ideas used in the nineteenth \r\ncentury to understand equations. For equations of one variable it was \r\nshown by Abel and Galois that those of degree five or more do not \r\nhave easy general formulas like the ones for quadratic equations. The reason \r\nfor this was that the solutions to equations of degree four or less \r\nalways live in what are called solvable extensions i.e. those extensions \r\nobtained by successively extracting square roots, cube roots etc. \r\nSurprisingly it is not known whether the same is true for equations with \r\nmore than one variable. The first aim of this project is to show that \r\nmany of the simpler kinds of equations in two variables do in fact have \r\nthese simple kinds of solutions. Many constructions in number theory at \r\nthe moment require the assumption that the equations involved do have \r\nsuch simple solutions. The second part of the project is an attempt to extend a \r\nparticular and very important one of these constructions to the situation\r\nwhere the equations involved do not have any simple solutions.\r\n",
