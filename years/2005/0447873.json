 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer networks and particularly the Internet are suffering from the lack of security, quality of service, and manageability. A key issue that leads to this situation is the limited flexibility of packet processing in the data path of routers. Novel edge routers that use embedded network processors can be programmed and dynamically reprogrammed for custom packet processing to adapt to changing requirements and to provide a range of advanced network services. The goal of this project is to explore the dynamic aspects of network processing with three objectives. First, the project will focus on development and prototyping of a run-time environment for network processors that supports several network processing applications and allows dynamic reconfiguration of the workload. Second, the research will include modeling of packet processing delay and exploring its impact on networking. Network models and simulation need to consider the impact of processing delay in order to accurately reflect the reality of modern networks. Finally, the project will also include the development of a network service protocol for access and control of network processing. The control protocol allows end-systems to identify the processing that is performed on a data stream and to control this functionality to limit the increase in system complexity due to network processing functions. This project presents a novel approach to providing dynamic support for network processing systems, understanding its impact on the network, and providing an interface to expose and control its functionality. The results from this work will be implemented on a prototype system and will be made available to other researchers",
