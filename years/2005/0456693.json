Dumesic\r\n\r\nInstitution:   University of Wisconsin-Madison\r\n\r\nAnalysis (rationale for decision):\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to produce liquid alkanes ranging from C7-C15 from biomass as a premium fuel for diesel-hybrid electric and hybrid electric-homogeneous charge compression ignition engines.  Therefore, research will be undertaken to develop new processes to prepare large, water-soluble organic compounds from biomass by condensing biomass-derived aldehydes with solid base catalysts in the aqueous phase and by selectively converting biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons to aldehydes so that they can undergo effective aldol condensation reactions.  Oxygenated hydrocarbons such as furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are readily produced from biomass, and it is planned to study aldol condensation reactions of these compounds with other biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons such as glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone and acetone over solid base catalysts.  It is also proposed to study how furfural and HMF can be converted to chemical intermediates that can undergo aldol self-condensation reactions to form C10 and C12 compounds.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed work is the elucidation of reaction pathways and catalytic materials that will produce liquid alkanes from renewable biomass resources.  These studies will address the fundamental issues that control catalytic activity, selectivity and stability for the processing of biomass-derived feedstocks.  In terms of the broader technological impact, the results from these studies will provide a basis to address how new catalysts and catalytic processes can be developed to provide clean-burning liquid alkane fuels from renewable biomass resources.  These results will provide a basis for understanding how heterogeneous catalysts can be developed for selective dehydration, hydrogenation-dehydrogenation, and aldol condensation reactions of biomass-derived reactants, thereby impacting the design of future biorefineries.  This project will thus educate and train graduate students, postdoctoral students, and undergraduate students in the emerging area of heterogeneous catalysis in biorefining.  The educational and outreach efforts of this project will be coordinated with NSF-funded MRSEC and NSEC programs at the University of Wisconsin in areas related to nano-structured materials (of which heterogeneous catalysts are key examples).\r\n\r\n",
