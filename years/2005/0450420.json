 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for: \r\nEvaluating Bridge Reliability Following Natural and Man-Made Hazards in Real-Time: Formulating an International Collaborative Research Program, CMS proposal 0450420\r\n\r\n\r\nPI:  Ahmet Aktan, Drexel\r\n\r\nThis proposal is being submitted to NSF's Structural Systems and Engineering: Structural\r\nSystems and Hazards Mitigation of Structures program of the Division of Civil and\r\nMechanical Systems. Dr. Steven McCabe is the Program Director and Dr. Galip Ulsoy is the\r\nDivision Director. The objective of the proposal is to solicit a small travel grant for a\r\ngroup of academic, government and industry representatives to travel from the US to Japan\r\nfor three related purposes: (a) Participating at the International Association for Bridge\r\nManagement and Safety Conference at Kyoto, Japan (IABMAS?04, 18-22 October, 2004), (b)\r\nParticipating at a meeting of the Executive Council of the International Society for\r\nStructural Health Monitoring and Intelligent Infrastructures (ISHMII) that is being\r\narranged to take place at Kyoto on October 20, (c) Participating at a half-day Workshop\r\nbetween the US and International participants of a problem-focused collaborative research\r\nproject: \"Evaluating the Reliability of Highway Bridges In Real-Time Following Hazards By\r\nStructural Health Monitoring\" during 17 October.\r\n\r\nThe research project for \"Bridge Reliability Following Hazards..\" offers significant\r\npotential for buy-in from bridge owners. This is necessary to overcome the reluctance of\r\nmost bridge owners to embrace new technology and to demonstrate how leveraging recent\r\nresearch and technology development pays by advancing the state-of-practice for\r\npost-hazard emergency response and recovery of the highway transportation infrastructure.\r\nWe note that there is consensus between government engineers from State DOT's such as\r\nCALTRANS, as well as FHWA and USGS that reliable post-hazard condition assessment of\r\ncritical elements of the highway infrastructure is perhaps the single most pressing\r\nproblem urgently requiring research and leveraging of technology for advancing the\r\nstate-of-practice. Based on various meetings between groups of stakeholders at Sacramento,\r\nIrvine and Bethlehem, the outline of a collaborative multi-institutional research project\r\nhas been formulated by a group of academic, government and industry participants. The\r\nresearch will be detailed in a proposal before January '05. The US participants of this\r\ncollaborative project will be soliciting funding from various federal and state government\r\nagencies, and especially the NEES Program, while the European and Japanese participants\r\nalready have or will receive funding from their respective governments. The outline of\r\nthis project and the current participants will be described further in the following.\r\nIn addition to supporting the travel of a US delegation to continue building an extremely\r\nrewarding international collaboration with their counterparts from Canada, Europe and the\r\nFar East, a travel grant requested by this proposal will continue to serve for building a\r\nstrategic relationship between the two U.S. federal government agencies that have\r\nresponsibility for advancing the engineering and management of critical infrastructure\r\nsystems. Since 23 April 2003, NSF and FHWA have been exploring a synergistic partnership\r\nfor launching a holistic and problem-focused research initiative to enhance the\r\noperations, protection and preservation of the highway transportation infrastructure. This\r\nprogram is envisioned to take advantage of actual highways and bridges as test-sites that\r\nwill be transformed into field laboratories for scientific research. There is further\r\nopportunity to expand an NSF-FHWA partnership by including USGS and NIST as we expect that\r\ndelegates from these latter agencies will also be present. Additional information on the\r\nbackground of the proposed partnership for research and collaborations between the\r\nacademic and industry communities associated with NSF and FHWA is presented in the\r\nfollowing sections of the proposal.\r\n\r\n",
