 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nBiological Sciences (61) \r\n\r\nStudents enrolled in ten different biology courses are generating three-dimensional images of biological specimens using state-of-the-art scanning electron microscopy.  The intellectual merit of this project is that students learn how images can be used to answer important research questions in each of these courses.  Students studying taxonomy compare images of extinct, fossilized plants and living relatives to learn about paleoclimatic conditions.  Cell biology students are studying the actions of antibody-labeled enzymes in gene expression using the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster.  Students in plant physiology courses compare images of leaf sections from plants grown in atmospheres of differing carbon dioxide levels to determine the effects of carbon dioxide on oil production.  Plant microanatomy is also being studied to determine evolutionary relationships among vascular and nonvascular plants.  Introductory biology students learn about sample preparation and microscopic imaging, and how this instrument can be used to answer research questions, while advanced students are using the scanning electron microscope in independent research projects.  This educational application of scanning electron microscopy is adapted from work by the principal investigators in other courses at the institution.  The project is having broad impact by integrating teaching and research in courses taught at the institution.  Over 600 students each year will benefit from exposure to this important technique.  In addition, images created by these students are being made available to teachers and other students world-wide using the SEM Stereo Biological Image Resource (SSBIR), part of the BioWeb resource website maintained by the University of Wisconsin.\r\n",
