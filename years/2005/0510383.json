 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seismological studies have revealed the presence of large, low velocity anomalies\r\nin the lower mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific, and there is growing evidence that\r\nthese anomalies may be caused by chemical heterogeneity, possibly due to a more-dense\r\nmantle component. A comprehensive geodynamical study into the development of\r\nthermochemical piles in the lower mantle will be undertaken by performing fully 3D\r\nspherical thermochemical convection calculations at Earth-like convective vigor which\r\nincludes Earth's Cretaceous to present day subduction history. The proposed work\r\ninvolves a joint geodynamics-tomography approach to impose constraints upon\r\nheterogeneous mantle models by direct comparisons between geodynamically-predicted\r\nand seismically-observed tomography. The objectives of this work are to:\r\n(1) develop a method of 'tomographic filtering' and spatial correlation which will\r\ntransform geodynamic output to more closely resemble what it is expected to\r\nappear as from observational tomography.\r\n(2) Investigate the necessity of thermochemical models by determining whether\r\nisochemical models can predict observations from seismology. Previous work\r\nhas hinted that this is not likely, however, only limited parameter sets have\r\nbeen observed.\r\n(3) To perform a comprehensive parameter search to understand how rheological,\r\nthermodynamic, and material properties affect the geographic position, areal\r\nextent, and height of dense thermochemical piles.\r\n(4) To ultimately place constraints upon the density and volume of dense piles\r\nthat have been proposed to reside beneath Africa and the Pacific.\r\nBroader impacts associated with this work include providing resulting data to the\r\nGEON project which has been active in developing new, interactive methods to visualize\r\n3D geodynamical data sets with the ultimate goal of fostering collaborative efforts in\r\nscience and education. In addition, new code development will be shared with the\r\nComputational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG). The proposed research will also\r\nform the basis of a Ph.D. student's dissertation, and will involve collaboration between\r\nseismology and geodynamics.\r\n-- \r\n\r\nRobin Reichlin                                \r\nGeophysics Program Director                                                   \r\nNational Science Foundation     \r\n4201 Wilson Blvd.,  Room 785                    \r\nArlington, VA  22230                                                     \r\nPHONE  (703)-292-8556     FAX  (703)-292-9025\r\n\r\nUpcoming Deadlines:\r\n\r\nGEOPHYSICS:  December 1, 2004 (NEW EAR Program Announcement NSF 04-613)\r\nhttp://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsf04613\r\n\r\nCSEDI:  August 25, 2005  (Program Announcement NSF 04-593) http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf04593/nsf04593.htm\r\n\r\nGuidelines:\r\nNSF's latest Grant Proposal Guide is NSF 04-23 http://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg",
