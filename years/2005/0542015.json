 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0542015\r\nGaier\r\n\r\nDevelopments in semiconductor amplifier technology have made it possible to realize integrated receivers suitable for astronomy applications at frequencies up to 140 GHz.  This technology is readily adaptable to a compact module configuration which can, in turn, be integrated into large arrays of millimeter wave receivers.  Such array cameras can support a wide range of science, including observations of the cosmic microwave background, Galactic molecular line emission, and redshifted molecular lines in distant galaxies.  A recent innovation from this group was to adapt millimeter-wave receiver architectures to integrated circuit style plug-in and surface mount carriers, which are fully compatible with automated capabilities found in the semiconductor industry.  This project will develop new cryogenic detectors at 90GHz and an integrated heterodyne receiver, and will demonstrate the basic feasibility of mass production.  Any developed modules will be available for demonstration at an observatory.\r\n\r\nThese technologies have application outside radio astronomy, such as for remote sensing and telecommunications.  As a development project, this work contributes to the education of physics and engineering students.",
