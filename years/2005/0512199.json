 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the development of an\r\nAdvanced Thermal Chemical Reactor (ATCR) for the Manufacture of Complex Nanopowders.\r\nThe ATCR being developed represents a major departure and advancement in manufacturing\r\ntechnology for producing complex metal oxide nanopowders. The ATCR is unique in that it is a\r\nhigh temperature, convectively heated, turbulently mixed, gas/solid/liquid phase reactor that\r\nutilizes externally heated reactant gases for reaction with the precursor feedstock. This\r\ninnovative reactor utilizes a well-stirred turbulent reaction zone driven by externally heated\r\nreaction gases. This innovative method of mixing and heating allows the precursors to rapidly\r\nreact in a region of uniform temperature and stoichiometry, a capability currently not available\r\nwith existing flame and plasma reactor systems. Gas, solid and liquid precursors can be utilized,\r\nthus providing tremendous flexibility with regard to the nature and variety of ceramic oxide\r\nproducts that can be produced. The primary objective of this Phase I project is to\r\ndemonstrate the technical viability of the ATCR to produce nanosize zirconia/alumina powders\r\nsuitable for processing into wire bonding capillaries and other specialty ceramic components.\r\nThis viability is to be demonstrated via the evaluation of pressed and sintered test specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercially, these powders will enhance the performance of a wide range of specialty ceramic applications including: mechanical components (e.g. wire bonding capillaries, micro-surgical instruments, water-jet cutting tools, fiber optic connectors); electronic materials (e.g. solid electrolytic membranes, dielectrics, ferrites); specialty abrasives; and high performance catalysts. The enhancements in the micro-electronics industry can positively impact virtually every major industry in the United States from farming and medicine to mining, chemicals production, aerospace, metals production, transportation and  information technology. \r\n",
