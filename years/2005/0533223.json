 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThere is an increasing interest in the vibration data-based detection, localization, and\r\nquantification of damage in civil engineering structures exposed to earthquake, wind, and other\r\nloads. Early motivation for this was provided by the discovery of hidden damages in steel\r\nstructures caused by the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Great Hanshin (Kobe) Earthquakes, and also\r\nby the fact that structural element are usually inaccessible after construction. Several analytical\r\nmethods have been proposed in the literature and still more are being developed for this.\r\nCurrently simulated data are being used to check the effectiveness of these methods; however,\r\ntheir validation and comparison on actual experimentally obtained data is yet to be done.\r\nIn this exploratory project, it is proposed to experimentally study and validate the\r\neffectives of the autoregressive with exogenous input model, wavelet transform, eigensystem\r\nrealization algorithms (ERA), and subspace identification (SSI) approaches for comprehensive\r\nmodal and damage identification of civil engineering structures. For damage localization and\r\nquantification the flexibility and rotational flexibility matrices with and without and damage locating\r\nvectors will be used. Further analytical improvements in these methods will also be made for\r\nmore reliable damage quantification. The tests will be conducted on a scaled three-story, nine\r\ndegrees-of-freedom structure model prepared such that its stiffness properties can be changed\r\nby planned changes in one or more braces, by sudden removal of one or two braces in real-time\r\nusing magneto-rheological dampers, and by loosening the connecting hardware at few selected\r\njoints. The major cost of preparing this changeable scaled model will be borne by the PIs\r\ninstitution. The scaled model will be excited at its base by the 5' by 5' shaking table at Virginia\r\nTech. The model would also have the capability of being excited by shakers installed at any of\r\nthe three levels. The dynamic measurements of the acceleration response will be made using\r\nten accelerometers, three placed at each floor level in two orthogonal directions plus one on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThe SGER funding is being sought to identify validated damage localization and\r\nquantification methods which will be needed in a more comprehensive follow-up study. This\r\nfollow-up study to be proposed later will develop an integrated system consisting of the validated\r\ndamage identification techniques with online consequence prognosis followed by online\r\nactuation, if necessary, of a control system to maintain the performance of the structure at an\r\nacceptable level. The successful outcome of this exploratory work will also be a very useful tool\r\nfor direct practical implementation in structural diagnostics and health monitoring.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual merit of this study is in the development of experimentally verified\r\ndamage identification (detection, localization, and quantification) schemes for a comprehensive\r\nstructural health monitoring.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this research will occur at two levels: the\r\neducation and training of graduate and undergraduate students and the availability of a much\r\nneeded tool and data to researchers and practitioners involved in structural health monitoring. A\r\ngraduate student and an undergraduate student will work on this project. The undergraduate\r\nstudent will be supported through the REU program. She/he will be selected through the Center\r\nfor the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity (CEED) at Virginia Tech from the pool of available\r\nAfrican American, Hispanic, American Indian, and women students. The dissemination of\r\ninformation and data generated in this research to other students, researchers and practitioners\r\nwill be done through class room teaching, website creation, presentations in conferences, and\r\npublications in archival journals and conference proceedings.\r\n\r\n",
