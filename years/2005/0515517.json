 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a multimedia initiative designed to increase the public and youth understanding of how scientists work.  Deliverables include \"Pulse of the Planet\" radio programs in both English and Spanish; related web news features and photo galleries at National Geographic.com; and formative and summative evaluations of the project.  The project will select 27 scientists and citizen scientists (7 of them Latinos) to provide first-person \"insider\" stories of scientific endeavor using the \"audio diary\" format.  They will be provided with minidisk field recording kits and digital cameras and given hands-on training by the PI.  Excerpts from their diaries will be used on the nationally broadcast radio programs and website.   Some of these will feature citizen science projects.   The project's partners include The Self-Reliance Foundation and the Hispanic Radio Network that will produce Spanish-language adaptations of Pulse of the Planet programs; the National Geographic will create editorial features for its news website; and Citizen Science project partners including Cornell's Lab of Ornithology, and Earthwatch, among others will encourage direct participation in projects linked to the radio and web information.   It is estimated that 1.25 million people will hear each of the radio programs and 50,000 unique visitors will read the stories on the web site.",
