The research questions to be addressed by the project are:  \r\n\r\nWhat are the similarities and differences between the intended treatment of algebra in the CMP curriculum and in the non-CMP curricula?\r\n\r\nWhat are the key features of the CMP and non-CMP experience for students and teachers, and how might these features explain performance differences of CMP and non-CMP students?\r\n\r\nWhat are the similarities and differences in performance between CMP students and a comparable group of non-CMP students on tasks measuring a broad spectrum of mathematical thinking and reasoning skills, with a focus on algebra?\r\n\r\nThe algebra focus skills/concepts to be assessed are:  conceptual understanding and problem solving; algebraic manipulative skills; solution strategies, representations and mathematical justifications.\r\n\r\n",
