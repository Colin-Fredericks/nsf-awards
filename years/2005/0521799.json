The support to each participant will cover all travel, living, and conference costs. The theme of this school is Problems of Gas Dynamics and Heat and Mass Transfer in Power Plants. The school is organized by Bauman Moscow State Technical University, Kaluga Branch of the Bauman school, The Russian Academy of Sciences/Institute of High Temperatures, and the National Committee on Heat and Mass Transfer of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  The school will focus on basic and applied research in gas dynamics and heat and mass transfer, especially as applied to power generation.  Many relevant research areas arise in these applications, including heat and mass transfer in turbulent flows, multiphase flows, experimental techniques, and high speed convective heat transfer in gas turbines and piston engines.  Junior participants will present their research work in poster sessions and will then be interviewed by senior scholars in during the discussion period of their papers.  Awards will be presented to the best papers.  The junior participants will be selected based on their potential to emerge as leaders in the next generation of U.S. engineering scholars. Participation in the school will enrich their education in training at a key point in their careers. Efforts will be made to continue previous demonstrated success in promoting the participation of emerging U.S. women in the thermal field.  The promotion of international cooperation and understanding will be an over-arching byproduct of the school that will be achievable only through meaningful international cooperation.\r\n\r\n",
