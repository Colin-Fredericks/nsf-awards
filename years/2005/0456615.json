 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal comprises three major projects and several additional smaller \r\nprojects.  The first of the three main projects concerns the approximation of \r\nreal numbers by rationals, a classical subject of research in number theory.  \r\nOver the past few decades many authors have applied ad hoc methods to \r\nobtain highly nontrivial bounds for the approximation by rationals whose \r\ndenominators belong to particular types of sequences, such as the sequence \r\nof prime numbers, or the sequence of squares.  The proposer believes that \r\nresults of this type should hold in a much more general context, and he hopes \r\nto prove a universal result for general  sequences that is of nearly the same\r\nquality as the results that have been obtained in the literature for special \r\nsequences.  The second project concerns the distribution of zeros of \r\nL-functions, a vast area of research motivated by the Riemann Hypothesis \r\nand its generalizations.  In particular, the so-called pair-correlation for the \r\nsequence of such zeros has received much attention in recent years because \r\nof surprising connections with phenomena arising in quantum chaos and the \r\ntheory of random matrices. The proposer plans to investigate a new type of \r\npair correlation, in which a second sequence is introduced, in the hope of \r\nobtaining new results by exploiting the added flexibility provided by the \r\nsecond sequence.  The third project is to apply methods and tools from \r\nnumber theory to certain problems in mathematical physics, in particular, the\r\nso-called Lorentz gas and the Sinai billiard problem.\r\n\r\nThis project falls in the area of number theory, one of the oldest subjects of \r\nmathematics which in recent years has received renewed interest due to \r\nnewly found applications (e.g., to cryptography and coding theory), \r\nunexpected connections with physics (such as the theory of quantum chaos \r\nand statistical mechanics), and major unsolved problems (such as the \r\nRiemann Hypothesis, one of the seven \"million dollar\" problems in \r\nmathematics). The proposed research is concerned with several problems \r\nthat fall at the interface of number theory and mathematical physics and \r\nbuild upon ongoing work by the proposer and his collaborators.  It is hoped \r\nthat deploying the powerful methods and tools of number theory to these \r\nproblems will lead toinsights and results that specialists have not been able \r\nto  obtainand which will be of interest to a broad range of researchers,  \r\nboth in mathematics and in physics.\r\n\r\n",
