The principal\r\ninvestigator will continue his research with D.H. Phong in these\r\nareas: The first project will use techniques developed in earlier\r\nwork to understand the critical exponent set (i.e., the set of\r\nlog canonical thresholds) in n-dimensions. Of particular interest\r\nare the applications of this structure to problems in algebraic\r\ngeometry. The second project concerns the Kaehler-Ricci flow, and\r\naddresses the convergence properties of this flow and the\r\nquestion of when the positivity of the Ricci curvature is\r\npreserved under the flow. The third project is motivated by the\r\nbasic question: When can a Kaehler metric on a compact complex\r\nmanifold be deformed into one of constant scalar curvature? It is\r\nbelieved that the key to this problem lies in the relationship\r\nbetween the finite geometry of the general linear group and the\r\ninfinite geometry of the space of Kaehler metrics. Techniques\r\nfrom pluri-potential theory, developed in earlier work, will be\r\napplied to elucidate this relationship.\r\n\r\nThe laws of nature are written in the language of mathematics,\r\nand conversely, much of the research in modern mathematics is\r\nspawned by fundamental discoveries in science. Prime examples of\r\nthis interplay are seen in the theory of general relativity and\r\nin quantum field theory, which were derived with the help of the\r\ntensor calculus of differential geometry. On the other hand, the\r\nequations which govern our universe (which include the Einstein\r\nequation and the Yang-Mills equation) have a beautiful structure\r\nwhich, for some mysterious reason, has helped elucidate\r\nfundamental questions in abstract mathematics. The problems\r\noutlined in this proposal fall into this very productive and\r\nbeautiful interplay between the understanding of our physical\r\nuniverse and the abstract realm of mathematics.\r\n",
