 "awd_abstract_narration": "Designing practically efficient parallel algorithms with rigorously \r\nanalyzed run time guarantees seems to be difficult for a large class \r\nof problems, commonly known as irregularly structured problems. The \r\nsolutions for such problems typically depend on run time workload \r\nmonitoring and dynamic load balancing, and the run time is often \r\ncritically dependent on the particular instance of the problem being \r\nsolved with no easy way to guarantee optimal, worst-case run times. \r\nThe goal of the proposed research is to design theoretically rigorous \r\nand practically efficient parallel algorithms for selected irregular \r\napplications and to develop software to demonstrate their effectiveness. \r\nResearch will also be conducted in developing distributed tree data \r\nstructures and software libraries to support these and other irregular \r\napplications. Three important classes of applications will be studied:\r\ngrid and particle based methods in scientific computing, sequence \r\nalignment problems in computational biology, and computing aggregates \r\non multidimensional data cubes in data mining. The work in scientific \r\ncomputing will be focused on providing spatial data structure support \r\nfor problems such as molecular dynamics, adaptive mesh refinement \r\nand multigrid methods. Several computationally intensive irregular \r\nproblems in sequence homology detection will be studied including\r\nspliced sequence alignments for gene discovery, multiple sequence \r\nalignments to discover protein motifs and full genome comparisons for \r\ncomparative genomics. The third application area is computation of\r\naggregates on multidimensional data. Using techniques from computational\r\ngeometry, efficient parallel algorithms for computing aggregates and \r\nanswering queries on sparse, multidimensional data sets will be developed.\r\nThe goal is to discover common underlying themes to provide a unifying \r\nway to address seemingly disparate problem areas. For example, spatial \r\ndistribution of the data or the geometrical structure of the problem \r\ndomain is the source of irregularity for most of the problems considered. \r\nSimilarly, tree data structures are often the backbone of parallel \r\nalgorithms for many irregularly structured problems.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research include fundamental\r\ncontributions to solving irregularly structured problems, a major \r\ntheme of research in parallel processing. Student participation in\r\nresearch is pursued using multiple strategies - graduate students \r\nthrough direct funding under the project, undergraduate students \r\nvia senior design projects, female students through Iowa State's Women\r\nin Science and Engineering program, and minority students through\r\ncollaboration with a minority serving institution.\r\n",
