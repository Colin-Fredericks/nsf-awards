 "awd_abstract_narration": "Where the frontier between the quantum and classical worlds lies and what defines the border are some of the most fundamental questions in physics.  This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project concentrates on low-temperature studies of single-molecule magnets and SQUIDs.  Both of these systems are known to exhibit quantum properties such as tunneling on the mesoscopic/macroscopic scale.  In this project, new experiments will endeavor to control these quantum properties and explore how environmental degrees of freedom lead to decoherence of the quantum state.  Experiments on single-molecule magnets will focus on controlling the tunneling process using an applied transverse field or uniaxial stress.   In SQUIDs, experiments will look for the Aharonov-Casher effect, in which tunneling can be modulated with an induced charge, a uniquely quantum effect. In addition, how the SQUID's quantum state decoheres will be studied by using a controlled ohmic environment.  A new mechanism of decoherence due to angular momentum conservation will be investigated.  All of these projects will be performed at Amherst College with undergraduate student participation.  Research will also involve collaborations with faculty and students at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst. The educational aspect of this project involves the revamping of the physics curriculum at Amherst College.  To this end, a new intermediate laboratory course emphasizing hands-on experience in modern physics experiments will be developed.  Furthermore, an advanced laboratory elective course will be introduced to give students experience in a research-style environment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the frontier between the quantum and classical worlds lies and what defines the border are some of the most fundamental questions in physics and are of utmost importance to the development of practical quantum computers.  This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project concentrates on low-temperature studies of single-molecule magnets and superconducting devices to understand how these systems lose their \"quantumness\" through interactions with their respective environments.  Experiments will focus on controlling how these systems change their quantum states and by engineering the environment with which they interact.  How their quantum behavior is altered by a controlled environment will shed light on the nature of the quantum-classical frontier.  All of these projects will be performed at Amherst College with undergraduate student participation.
