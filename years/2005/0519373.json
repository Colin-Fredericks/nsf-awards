 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of about 20 graduate and advanced undergraduate students, postdoctoral students and starting professionals in the Conference on Computational Physics (CCP2005) in Los Angeles March 20-25, 2005. The Conference is jointly sponsored by the Division of Computational Physics (DCOMP) of the American Physical Society (APS), the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and the European Physics Society (EPS) and is held in conjunction with the regular APS March Meeting. Grants target without established lines of support.\r\n\r\nThrough a series of plenary sessions consisting of invited talks by an outstanding set of speakers from a broadly-representative sample of fields covering topics from astrophysics to quantum computers to material modeling, a set of invited symposia and a collection of focus sessions in current high profile endeavors in computational physics, and contributed papers, students will be exposed to the cutting edge of computational physics.\r\n\r\nThis grant will make a substantial contribution to the education and training of young scientists in the field of computational physics and will thereby build human capacity in cyberinfrastructure.\r\n",
