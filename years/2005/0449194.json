 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: A Systems Approach to Networked Decision Making in\r\nUncertain Environments\r\nThis proposal concerns the development of tools for a fundamental system-level framework for\r\nnetworked decision making in uncertain environments. While significant effort over the last decade\r\nin sensor development, physical layer transmission and networking has laid the initial groundwork\r\nfor practical deployment, the full potential for networked sensing systems can only be realized\r\nthrough a fundamental understanding of decision-making in networked and uncertain environments.\r\nIn keeping with this view, the proposed research will represent communications and networking\r\naspects as mathematical constraints and develop methods for a distributed group of decision agents\r\nto reliably detect, localize, and track relevant dynamic and uncertain events under these constraints.\r\nIntellectual Merit: We organize our proposed research into four thrusts based on two funda-\r\nmentally different types of problems that arise in many (environmental) applications: (a) where\r\neach networked sensor/decision agent observes part of a global phenomena; (b)a local phenomena\r\nobservable only by a small number of sensors. While the former case requires sensor collabora-\r\ntion across space, the latter requires rapidly searching for sensors with desired information in a\r\ndecentralized manner. The four major thrusts are:\r\n Consensus Based Approach for Networked Decision Making: This thrust is concerned with\r\ndistributed inference when observations of global phenomena are involved. The approach\r\namounts to local information refinement followed by local message passing. This is both\r\nefficient and practically appealing. The solution techniques rely on properties of dynamical\r\nsystems whose dynamics are characterized by network connectivity.\r\n Adaptive Decentralized Sampling: Here we address the localized information case. We pro-\r\npose a feedback perspective that is inspired by recent developments in testing large number\r\nof hypothesis in the statistics literature.\r\n Estimation under communication constraints: Here motivated by applications we develop\r\nmixed stochastic/deterministic methods for communicating non-ergodic, non-random param-\r\neters observed in stochastic noise.\r\n Dynamical Scenarios: In this thrust control theoretic methods for networked decision making\r\nin highly dynamic scenarios is developed.\r\nBroad Impact: The proposed research has the potential to broadly impact existing knowledge in\r\nthe fields of networking, information theory, estimation, control, and signal processing as well as\r\nthe broader engineering community. In addition to disseminating our results through publications\r\nin scholarly journals, conference presentations and on-line we envision the following outcomes:\r\nSocietal: Successful completion of the program will shed light on the way sensor networks are\r\nconfigured and operated for reliable, seamless and prolonged operation. The program is therefore\r\nexpected to have societal impacts through the diverse applications such as emergency relief services,\r\nsecurity/surveillance and other applications that closely relate to public welfare. Education: We\r\nplan on introducing a first-year graduate level course that will seek an integrated viewpoint of\r\ncontrol, networks and information.\r\n1",
