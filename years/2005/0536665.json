In conjunction with the workshop, an International Conference on Geometric Function Theory, Special Function and Applications will be held in Pondicherry, India in early January 2006.  The workshop will concentrate on Quasiconformal Mappings and the role played by them in Geometric Function Theory.  The conference will focus on Geometric Function Theory and the role played by Special Functions in this area of research.  The primary goal of both activities is to stimulate future interactions among experts in Geometric Function Theory and promote research collaborations among the various participants, particularly those from the U.S. and young Indian researchers.  These topics are of current primary interest to a wide range of function theorists around the globe.  \r\n\r\nScope: This activity will be catalytic in promoting international collaboration as well as developing future research directions in the subject area.  It is expected that collaborative proposals suitable for submission to the Division of Mathematical Sciences at NSF will be developed.  The US delegation will include 6 senior scientists, 6 postdocs, and 8 graduate students.  Distinguished speakers not supported by this award will play a leading role at the workshop and conference to catalyze collaborative research.  The proceedings of the workshop and conference will be published as a special issue of a reputed international journal.  The Division of Mathematical Science is providing cofunding to support this workshop.          \r\n",
