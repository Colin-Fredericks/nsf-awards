 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI and his associates will carry out research to explore the development \r\nof superhard materials, i.e., materials that have a degree of hardness \r\ncomparable to or larger than that of diamond. The search for such materials is \r\ndriven by both their importance in a wide range of applications and by the \r\nchallenge to design and synthesize them. Superhardness has recently been \r\nachieved in a number of nanostructured composites prepared by means of thin-\r\nfilm technology methods. While significant research is being conducted \r\nworldwide on the synthesis and characterization of superhard materials, \r\nfurther developments (such as optimization, modification, and manipulation) \r\nare hampered by the lack of understanding of the atomic-scale mechanisms. The \r\nproposed research will combine experimental synthesis and characterization \r\nwith quantum theory and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the \r\nmechanical, structural, and electronic properties of a series of \r\nnanostructured composite films which are made up of nano-sized crystallites of \r\na titanium nitride or tungsten nitride embedded in an amorphous silicon \r\nnitride or boron nitride matrix. The main objectives of the project are to \r\ninvestigate the relationships between the processing conditions, residual \r\nstress, hardness, microstructure and composition of these materials, and to \r\nelucidate the mechanisms underlying superhardness at the atomic scale. The \r\nrole of the composite structure (type of interfaces, size and volume fraction \r\nof nano-particles, etc.) in inhibiting dislocation activity will be elucidated \r\nand guidelines will be extracted for the optimum design of superhard \r\nnanostructured materials. \r\n\r\nThe successful fabrication of nanostructured superhard materials would have \r\nsignificant impact on industry because they would be less expensive than \r\ndiamond. The new materials would be used as anti-corrosion and wear protective \r\ncoatings, cutting tools, load-bearing components, and micro-mechanical and \r\nmicroelectronic devices. In particular, significant socio-economic benefits \r\nwould be achieved by the applications of the superhard nanocomposite materials \r\non high-speed cutting and forming tools for 'green' machining operations \r\nwithout the aid of toxic coolants, which offers a clean work environment for \r\nmachining processes with reduced wastes. This project will also develop an \r\ninternational collaboration involving both theorists and experimentalists in \r\nthe U.S. and Hong Kong. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be \r\ninvolved in the research. K-12 teachers will participate in the project \r\nthrough Vanderbilt's summer Research Experience for Teachers programs. New \r\nknowledge will be translated into modules and lessons that can be used in K-12 \r\nclassrooms. Thus, the project will contribute to education at various levels.\r\n\r\n",
