 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of human perception is driven by the visual appearance of the\r\nworld.  People are captivated by the effects of natural lighting and\r\nshading patterns, such as the soft shadows from the leaves of a tree\r\nin skylight, the glints of sunlight in ocean waves, or the shiny\r\nreflections from a velvet cushion.  In computer graphics, it is\r\nimportant to be able to accurately reproduce these appearance effects,\r\nto create realistic images for applications like video games, vehicle\r\nand flight simulators, or architectural design of interior spaces.\r\nHowever, it is still very difficult to accurately model complex\r\nillumination and reflection effects in interactive applications like\r\ngames, in image-based rendering applications like e-commerce, or in\r\ncomputer vision applications like face recognition.  In the past, the\r\nabove applications have been addressed separately, by devising\r\nparticular algorithms for specific problems.  In this project, the\r\nresearch focuses on the mathematical and computational fundamentals of\r\nvisual appearance, seeking to understand the intrinsic computational\r\nstructure of illumination, reflection and shadowing, and develop a\r\nunified approach to many problems in graphics and vision.\r\n\r\nThe main thrust of the research will be to develop appropriate\r\nmathematical representations for appearance, along with computational\r\nalgorithms and signal-processing techniques such as Clebsch-Gordan\r\nexpansions, wavelet methods with triple product expansions, and radial\r\nbasis functions.  A major advantage of this approach is that the same\r\nrepresentations, analysis and computation tools can then be applied to\r\nmany application domains, such as real-time and image-based rendering,\r\nMonte Carlo sampling and lighting-insensitive recognition.  This\r\nresearch philosophy builds on the investigator's dissertation, where\r\nhe developed a signal-processing framework for reflection, leading to\r\nnew frequency domain algorithms for both forward and inverse rendering.\r\n\r\n",
