 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constituting a Blue Ribbon Panel to Prepare a Roadmap for Advances in Simulation Based Engineering Science\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n     It is proposed that a Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) on Simulation Based Engineering Sciences be constituted to conduct a detailed study of the potential benefits of interagency support of research and development in this discipline.  The Panel will have a membership of 11 individuals (with one alternate).  The charge of the BRP will be to develop a roadmap for accelerated developments of SBES in a broad list of research areas. The report will delineate goals of SBES research, address the barriers and challenges to advancement in the discipline, make recommendations on how the developments in SBES can be greatly accelerated, and provide a roadmap for fully developing and exploring the potential benefits of SBES research.  The roadmap should serve as a resource for planning the research agendas for agencies and for university and laboratory research units.  \r\n     An important event to take place prior to the work of the BRP is the organization of a two day workshop on the subject.  The workshop will be attended by a larger group of specialists who will be asked to provide direction and advice to the BRP.  An attendance of approximately 35 to 50 individuals is anticipated.  In addition, regular video- and/or teleconference meetings will be held as well as meetings of the Panel and other interested parties at national conferences on simulation and computational science. \r\n     The final product produced by the Panel will be a detailed report that will be made available to the broad research community, to affected agencies, particularly the NSF, and to the general public. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
