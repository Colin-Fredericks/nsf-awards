 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project partnership, composed of the Institute for Systems Biology, four Seattle area school districts, the University of Washington, Seattle Pacific University and RMC Research Corp., proposes a four-year, randomized and controlled study of the effectiveness of the Observing for Evidence of Learning (OEL) professional development model in increasing student learning of standards-based science curriculum for grades 6-8.  OEL will employ an adaptation of the successful Japanese Lesson Study program, a highly structured school-based professional development program.  The program is based on a successfully implemented Local Systemic Change program (MASE) in Las Vegas, NV.  Representatives from Las Vegas will serve in an advisory capacity. Further, representative teachers from Las Vagas and Seattle will travel to each other's school systems so as to ensure continuity of the program.\r\n",
