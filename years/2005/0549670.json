A searchable database will be created and made available to the PAEMST Program Director.  In addition, a booklet will be developed and disseminated to help make education stakeholders and the general public more aware of the program and the award recipients.  Data will be captured via online survey, prior research and archival sources.  Five face-to-face interviews will be conducted to better highlight the accomplishments of the PAEMST program.  The leaders of this proposed plan are uniquely qualified to implement the project given their long history of working with NSF and producing documents for many of the Foundation's programs.\r\n\r\nBROADER  IMPACTS:  This research effort is aimed at obtaining a compilation of key data that will assist the PAEMST program leadership with broadening participation in the mathematics and science award program by synthesizing data on past awardees, targeting areas with few awardees and informing future publicity efforts and dissemination activities.  The proposers intend to complete the data gathering process and produce a document for dissemination by early 2006.    \r\n",
