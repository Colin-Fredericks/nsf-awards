Vipperman, U of Pittsburgh\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to quantify the capabilities of microscale thermoacoustic refrigerators and establish the feasibility limits of using them to cool microelectronic devices.  The approach is to form numerical models of small-scale thermoacoustic devices and associated heat exchangers such that parametric analyses can be performed and performance limits established.  Various design parameters will be investigated and optimized, including geometry, operating pressure, gas mixture, and materials.  Device elements will be fabricated and incorporated into existing thermoacoustic refrigerator models to permit experimental characterization and verification of the numerical models. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research is the direct result of the convergence of several important needs in manufacturing, science, education, and industry.  Little or no work has been done to apply thermoacoustics to the issue of heat removal in electronics, which offers potential for a simple, efficient, and environmentally friendly method of cooling (no chlorofluorocarbons,  hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or other harmful refrigerants). The proposed work identifies a novel technology that will allow manufacturers to reliably provide higher levels of heat dissipation from commercial and military electronics. The proposed technology can be applied in very diverse markets: almost any product that incorporates electronic components can be improved by the proposed research.  It is anticipated that the device could be used for purposes other than cooling electronics as well.\r\n",
