This meeting brings academic, government, and industrial representatives together to present research findings, update international policy, and discuss critical issues concerning emissions of toxic by-products and nanoparticles from the combustion processes. Meeting every two years since 1990, this meeting attracts between 150 and 200 delegates from all over the world. The students are selected based on the quality of abstracts submitted for presentation and need by the standing Executive Committee for the conference. \r\n\r\nResearch, especially environmental research, is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. This meeting is especially designed to bring together engineers, scientists, and health effects researchers to discuss the environmental issues surrounding combustion. Our next generation of researchers must be familiar with these interdisciplinary issues to be successful. By encouraging the participation of students with partial travel support, we are developing and training the next generation of researchers.\r\n",
