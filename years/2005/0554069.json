 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nIt is the intent of this project to focus efforts, during the 2005-06 academic year and 2006\r\nsummer, on enhancing the mentoring capabilities of faculty members at Elizabeth City\r\nState University with regards to their ability to motivate and train minority students\r\nwithin The Mathematics and Computer Science Department and The Geological,\r\nEnvironmental and Marine Science Department.\r\nIn support of the NSF Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and\r\nEngineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) program, this proposed project will increase the\r\nnumber of faculty at ECSU, who are well trained, in mentoring underrepresented groups\r\nin mathematics, computer science, marine and environmental science. The supplemental\r\nfunds will support expansion of faculty mentoring efforts of minority majors within the\r\ntargeted departments. The project will also provide faculty with training based on best\r\npractices of the NSF PAESMEM program.\r\nFaculty members will be expected to work during the academic year or summer with a\r\nteam of undergraduate STEM majors. During the academic year, structured meeting will\r\nbe held between faculty and students on Tuesday and Thursday evenings from mid\r\nSeptember through early April and for 8 weeks during the summer of 2006. The\r\nemphasis will be on promoting the professional development of students while teaching\r\nthem the fundamentals of research within their major fields. The faculty emphasis will\r\nbe on promoting the ability of the faculty in interacting with students, providing\r\nsupportive environment for students, and conveying the techniques of research in their\r\nrespective fields. This will enhance faculty ability to provide the out of classroom\r\nexperience that the students will need to be accepted into and successfully complete\r\ngraduate school. During the summer program faculty will work on an intense 8 week\r\nproject with a team of students. The proposed project will impact a total of 6 STEM\r\nfaculty and 10 STEM students.",
