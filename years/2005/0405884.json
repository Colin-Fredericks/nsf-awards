 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symmetries have played an important role in sciences and arts\r\nand are described in terms of group theory. Two important types of\r\ngroups are discrete groups and Lie groups.\r\nLie groups are closely related to homogeneous spaces.\r\nAn important class of homogeneous spaces consists of\r\nsymmetric spaces, a very distinguished class of special Riemannian\r\nmanifolds. Examples of symmetric spaces include the Euclidean spaces\r\nand the spheres in them. Another type of symmetric spaces\r\nis given by hyperbolic spaces, in which there are infinitely\r\nmany nonparallel lines which do not intersect with each other.\r\nDiscrete groups acting on symmetric spaces give rise to locally\r\nsymmetric spaces; for example, surfaces with constant curvature\r\nare locally symmetric spaces.\r\nThe interplay between the topology, geometry and group theory\r\nof discrete groups, Lie groups and locally symmetric spaces\r\nhas been intensively studied in mathematics.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, the PI proposes to study the Novikov conjectures\r\nfor arithmetic groups using the large scale geometry and\r\ncompactifications of symmetric spaces of noncompact type.\r\nSpecifically, an important invariant of the asymptotic geometry\r\nis the asymptotic dimension, the finiteness of which is closely\r\nrelated to the Novikov conjectures. For a torsion free arithmetic\r\nsubgroup of a semisimple algebraic group,\r\nthe partial Borel-Serre compactification\r\nof the associated symmetric space is the universal covering\r\nof the classifying space of the arithmetic group. For applications\r\nto the Novikov conjectures, we need a large compactification of the\r\npartial Borel-Serre compactification. To study S-arithmetic subgroups,\r\na generalization of arithmetic groups, we also need compactifications\r\nof Bruhat-Tits buildings. Compactifications of symmetric\r\nspaces and buildings are also important for other purposes.",
