 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to conduct three training workshops/conferences and attendance at the joint American Evaluation Association/Canadian Evaluation Society conference in Toronto in 2005/6.  The workshops aims to develop leaders of diverse national and ethnic groups in evaluation and thereby increase the diversity of the STEM workforce. Specific goals of the proposed project are:\r\n\tTo provide training conferences to graduate students in order to develop valuable curricula and evaluation knowledge generation,    \r\n\tTo improve the knowledge base of graduate students from STEM and other social science disciplines interested in evaluation,\r\n\tTo develop a leadership pipeline model guided by social agenda/advocacy evaluation frameworks that address issues of access, opportunity, and power that are faced by non-profit organizations, foundations, and other agencies.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop a format of quarterly training activities to include an orientation and networking in the field of evaluation, advancing the conceptual and methodological tools of becoming a culturally responsive evaluator, and building sustainable communities through evaluation and the role of evaluation in promoting social change.\r\n",
