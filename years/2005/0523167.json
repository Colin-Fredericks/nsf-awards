 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Title: A Field Experiment on Returns to Capital in Sri Lankan\r\nMicroenterprises\r\n\r\nThe December 2004 Tsunami devastated a number of countries, with Sri Lanka\r\none of the hardest hit. The official death toll in Sri Lanka has risen to\r\nover 30,000, with 850,000 people displaced. Donor agencies have responded\r\nto initial needs, and appropriate strategies for rebuilding and recovery\r\nare now beginning to frame the policy debate. This project proposes to\r\nprovide a direct opportunity to help microenterprises in Sri Lanka recover,\r\nand more broadly, to learn about how to help businesses recover from\r\ndisasters. The primary objective will be to estimate returns to capital in\r\nmicroenterprises and study the various determinants of firm investment\r\ndecisions. The PI's propose to sample 350 microenterprises six times each over\r\nthe course of eighteen months. The firms will be surveyed in Colombo and\r\nKalutara, both regions affected by the tsunami, allowing information on the\r\ntimeline of recovery. After each survey, 20 percent of enterprises will be\r\nrandomly selected to receive a cash payment or capital equipment for their\r\nenterprise. The capital treatment will generate changes in capital stock\r\nwhich are not correlated with entrepreneurial ability, against which\r\nchanges in the performance of the enterprise can be compared. The cash\r\ntreatment along with survey questions on risk and expectations will provide\r\ninformation on the the investment decisions of firms. Direct comparison of\r\nthe two treatments will provide information about the way in which\r\nentrepreneurial ability enters into the microenterprise production\r\nfunction, and will additionally provide policy information on the relative\r\nmerits of targeting resources through in-kind versus cash payments. The\r\nproject has a number of potentially large policy implications for recovery\r\nprojects after disasters and for the operation of microlending programs. In\r\naddition, the panel dataset created of microenterprises will be one of the largest\r\n anywhere in the world and will be made available to other\r\nresearchers.\r\n\r\n",
