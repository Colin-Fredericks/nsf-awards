 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project concerns the topology and geometry of manifolds, stratified \r\nspaces, infinite trees, and ultrametric spaces.  The main tools are \r\ncontrolled topology, surgery theory, noncommutative geometry, and \r\nC*-algebras of groupoids. The main focus is on the geometry of infinite \r\ntrees and other non-compact manifold stratified spaces at infinity. \r\nSpecific problems that will be addressed include the Baum-Connes conjecture \r\nfor local similarity groupoids arising from the end spaces of trees, \r\nperiodic structure in the neighborhood of the singular set of a manifold \r\nstratified space, the classification of stratified h-cobordisms, and \r\ncontrolled topology over nonpositively curved manifolds. This last problem \r\nis related to Novikov-like conjectures.\r\n\r\nTopology seeks to classify, characterize, and explore those abstract spaces \r\nknown as manifolds. Manifolds are locally like ordinary euclidean spaces \r\n(the line, the plane, three-dimensional space, etc.); however, they are \r\nallowed to have global twisting, curving and holes (e.g., circles, spheres, \r\ntori). Manifolds arise in many models of physical and biological phenomena. \r\nManifolds with singularities, or stratified spaces, are even more \r\nubiquitous as they appear as solution spaces of algebraic and differential \r\nequations, and as limits and compactifications of manifolds. Mathematical \r\ntrees are the one-dimensional case of stratified spaces and are used to \r\nmodel branching processes. There are many asymmetric infinite trees that \r\nnevertheless have many similar infinite subtrees. One of the goals of this \r\nproject is to study these non-global symmetries of infinite trees using a \r\nfairly new branch of mathematics called noncommutative geometry. More \r\ngenerally, the symmetry and periodic structure of stratified spaces at \r\ninfinity will be investigated.\r\n",
