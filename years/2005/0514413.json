 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for The American Mathematical Society to administer a program for selecting approximately 130 U.S. mathematicians for whom travel awards of about $2,000 each will be provided to attend the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, Spain, August 22-30, 2006 (ICM-06). Held every four years, the International Congress of Mathematicians is one of the most important gatherings of the world's leading mathematicians, where major mathematical developments across sub-disciplines are discussed. The Congress promotes cross-fertilization among the different sub-communities of the mathematical world. Significant U.S. representation at ICM-06 is important to the scientific health of the nation. Applications will be evaluated by a panel of professional mathematicians, who use their judgment both in evaluating professional qualifications and guaranteeing that early career and minority applicants are not overlooked. The awards are intended to cover travel, and a portion of subsistence or registration fees, except in the case of early career mathematicians, who will be awarded more subsistence. The AMS successfully administered similar programs for ICM-90 in Kyoto, Japan, ICM-94 in Zurich, Switzerland, ICM-98 in Berlin, Germany and ICM-02 in Beijing, China. \r\n",
