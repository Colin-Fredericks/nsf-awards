 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the mathematical and computational modeling of\r\nlight as it propagates in photonic micro and nanostructures. In one example,\r\na new and improved model will be proposed and used to describe novel optical\r\npulse propagation in photonic crystal fibers such as the recently observed \r\nphenomena of supercontinuum generation which cannot be well understood with \r\nthe existing slowly varying envelope approximation. A second component of \r\nthis project studies light localization and steering in optical fiber arrays \r\nand in particular the role imperfections in the manufacturing of such devices \r\nhave in enhancing or suppressing light localization. The model considered \r\nhere is a set of coupled stochastic differential equations. Finally, we will \r\nbegin to address the question of which optical phenomena that has been \r\nobserved in micro-devices can also happen in the nano-devices. In all \r\ninstances, the mathematical and computational outcomes will be presented to \r\nand compared with leading experimentalist efforts.\r\n\r\nThis research effort is of interdisciplinary nature and the use of \r\nmathematical modeling will help improve performance of optical devices\r\nused in medical applications such as coherent tomography and in advanced fiber\r\nlasers aimed at producing powers in the multi-kilowatt regime. \r\nState of the art lasers based on the model studied here, will likely prove to be relevant for \r\nhomeland security. This project will support the advancement of  two women \r\n(a PhD student and a junior faculty) in their careers as Applied \r\nMathematics professionals.",
