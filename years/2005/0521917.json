 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to evaluate the utility of retroviruses for the transgenesis of invertebrates. Transgenesis is a powerful technique that allows the manipulation of an organism's genome and experimental access to its genetic function. Despite the fact that among multi?cellular organisms, invertebrates dominate both in terms of biomass and species diversity, most transgenesis studies have been performed in vertebrates due to their possible relevance to human health. The primary challenge in transgenesis is the introduction of genetic material into the cells of an organism. To this end, vectors have been constructed from retroviruses, parasitic microorganisms that permanently (heritably) insert their genetic material into the chromosomes of host cells. This study will determine whether retroviral vectors will function in a diverse group of invertebrate organisms ranging from sponges to insects via a systemic analysis beginning with virus entry and culminating in gene expression in host cells.\r\n\r\nEven though invertebrates overwhelmingly contribute to the Earth's biomass and function as important model organisms for development, evolution, parasite?host relationships, and environmental changes, their genetics as a whole has been grossly understudied. This study will examine the utility of retroviral vectors in invertebrate systems leading to a better understanding of these vectors and the development of generic transgenesis vectors. The routine transgenesis of invertebrates will permit critical functional genetic studies of invertebrate organisms of vast biological, economic, and environmental importance. \r\n",
