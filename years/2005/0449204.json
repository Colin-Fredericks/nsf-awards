On the experimental side, recent developments \r\nin nanotechnology have allowed scientists to follow biological processes on \r\nsingle-molecule basis, providing scientists with powerful means of studying many \r\nbiophysical processes that were inaccessible just a decade ago. This new \r\nfrontier also raises significant statistical challenges. It calls upon an \r\nurgent need for stochastic modeling, because many classical models derived \r\nfrom oversimplified assumption are no longer valid for single-molecule \r\nexperiments. Parallel to the experimental progress, the rapid advance of \r\ncomputing resources and Monte Carlo methods also offers great potential \r\nfor biophysical studies, because in most biophysical experiments inference\r\non the underlying stochastic dynamics is complicated by latent processes, \r\nand many biophysical problems are computing intensive. The proposal \r\nconsists of three projects: (A)  Constructing stochastic models that account \r\nfor the subdiffusion phenomenon in single-molecule biophysics, where the \r\ngoal is to provide models that are not only physically meaningful, but\r\nalso capable of explaining the subdiffusion phenomenon that eludes classical \r\ndiffusion models. (B) Developing data augmentation tools to handle latent \r\nprocesses in biophysical experiments, where the goal is to use the data \r\naugmentation techniques to augment the hidden processes so as to \r\nefficiently infer from the experimental data the biophysical properties \r\nof interest. (C) Developing more efficient Monte Carlo method for computing\r\nintensive biophysics problems, where the goal is to construct new Monte \r\nCarlo methods capable of sampling complicated distributions, and apply the \r\nnew method to study the HP protein folding problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTechnology advances have profoundly changed the society and science\r\nin the recent decades. The field of biophysics benefits from these \r\nadvances in particular, as the technology advances have allowed scientists \r\nto study many biological processes that were inaccessible just a decade \r\nago. These advances also raise significant challenges for statistics, \r\nbecause the unprecedented amount of data brought by the new technology \r\nrequires critical statistical analysis. While the United States leads the \r\nworld in both statistics and biophysics research, future prominence depends\r\non innovations in both fields and the interdisciplinary collaborations \r\nbetween them. The research in this proposal aims at developing new \r\nstatistical models and inference tools that can be directly applied to \r\nbiophysics studies and will lead to new insight about the physics of complex\r\nbiological processes. The development of statistics and biophysics not only\r\npresents many interdisciplinary research opportunities, but also attracts \r\nmany bright students in mathematical, biological and physical sciences. \r\nThe proposed research is integrated with the principal investigator's \r\neducational activities at both the graduate and undergraduate level.\r\nIt seeks to meet high academic standards, while providing graduate \r\ntraining that will prepare students for interdisciplinary research careers.\r\n\r\n",
