 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe \"Advancing Science Excellence in North Dakota\" project seeks to improve the state's research infrastructure, human resource development and technology transfer effectiveness.  North Dakota's plan for research infrastructure improvement targets support for two strategic research initiatives: Spintronics Printing Integrated Network (SPIN) and Sustainable Energy Research Infrastructure and Supporting Education (SUNRISE).  The SPIN initiative will design and fabricate new materials and processes to enable spintronic device manufacture via printing technologies.  Researchers will investigate spin dependent tunneling (SDT) devices with nanometer dimensions using novel precursors via a printing process.  The SUNRISE initiative addresses three components associated with sustainable energy: 1) sustainable coal utilization through improved environmental performance; 2) agricultural-based transportation fuels development; and 3) investigations into a novel approach to hydrogen distribution and storage.  The research infrastructure improvement efforts capitalize on the state's existing research strengths and take advantage of opportunities to integrate research and education as well as technology transfer into the growing economy of the state.  The University of North Dakota (UND) and North Dakota State University (NDSU) serve as the foundation for this effort with participation of Turtle Mountain Community College (TMCC).  Seed grant funding, travel awards and new faculty startup funding support the research areas with programs to support increased collaborative and competitive opportunities.  \r\n\r\nNorth Dakota will improve its human resource development with programs designed to promote disciplinary and education partnerships.  Undergraduate students will participate in hands-on research experiences in the laboratory throughout the year.  A Graduate Student Research Assistantship program will aid in the recruitment and retention of graduate students.  The NATURE program will enhance science and mathematics education at Turtle Mountain Community College in an effort to increase the graduation rate of Native American students in STEM disciplines.  Technology transfer will be facilitated by programs that increase the interaction of university faculty, students and private sector partners.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
