 "awd_abstract_narration": "South  Carolina  State  University  (SCSU)  will implement a Research- Infused STEM Curriculum (RISC) that will have a direct impact on approximately 500 STEM students  per year.  The changes to the curriculum will eventually benefit all STEM students who enroll  at SCSU.  Sixty (60) students will be designated as STEM Scholars and will receive financial assistance  through RISC scholarships provided by grant and university funds.  The RISC project is based on a careful analysis of institutional needs by STEM faculty.  The foundation of the project is the involvement of STEM students in research from  the  freshman  year  through  graduation.  The  redesign  of  the  STEM  curriculum will infuse  and  integrate  current scientific and technological concepts across the disciplines.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to improve the quality of the STEM curriculum and increase the number  of underrepresented STEM undergraduates who are well prepared for STEM careers or graduate studies.   The  overall  objective  is  to  develop  and  implement  a  research-infused  curriculum  that  addresses  the  identified needs of STEM students.  The three strategies that will be implemented to achieve the goal and objective are 1) to identify, recruit and retain talented STEM students; 2) to improve the quality of the  STEM curriculum; and 3) to expand opportunities for student research and to better prepare students for  graduate school.  RISC consists of a set of comprehensive, synergistic activities designed to have a broad  impact  on  the  learning  experiences  afforded  students  and  will  increase  their  preparation  and  competitiveness  for  careers  and  further  study  in  STEM  disciplines.    The  proposed  project  uses  the  successful  IMPEC  (Integrated  Mathematics,  Physics,  Engineering,  and  Chemistry  Curriculum)  model  developed  at North Carolina  State University  to  integrate  curriculum  in  biology, mathematics,  physics,  chemistry,  and  engineering  technology.    A  unique addition to  IMPEC at SCSU will  be  the  addition  of  research topics of current scientific or technological interest.  To ensure successful implementation and  institutionalization of curriculum enhancements faculty development activities are a major component of  RISC.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  RISC will  advance  knowledge  and  understanding  of  how  a  research-infused  curriculum  and  a  program  of  student research can increase participation in STEM careers and raise achievement for African-American  students.  The project has been carefully conceived, has adequate resources, and will be administered by  experienced  staff  and  faculty.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  RISC  supports  both  student  research  and  curriculum  enhancements, it will have a broad impact on the education of minority students in South Carolina. SCSU  has  a  93%  African-American  enrollment  and  is  dedicated  to  developing  a  more  diverse  workforce  of  STEM professionals.  RISC results will be presented in many venues:  conferences, publications, and web  sites.  Society benefits from RISC by insuring that minority students, who make up an increasing fraction  of the workforce, are properly trained to take on the responsibilities of STEM careers.  SCSU will use the  HBCU-UP grant to build upon its legacy by significantly increasing the quality and number of students  that  it  prepares  for  STEM  careers  and  for  STEM  graduate  study  through  improving  the  quality  of  its  curricula, expanding the opportunities for student research, and increasing the number of opportunities for  internships in industry and government labs, and at other universities.     \r\n",
