 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is developing materials for an activity-oriented college algebra course.  The course addresses educational needs of pre-service teachers and the need for better quantitative literacy among the general student population.  The materials for the course are data-driven and deepen the students' conceptual understanding and ability to apply mathematics in real contexts.  One of the features is the inclusion of problem situations emphasizing social and economic issues, including hunger and poverty, energy, and the environment.  \r\n\r\nThe project is creating a learner-centered environment for the college algebra course, and approaches taken are based on current educational research and reforms in mathematics education.  Learning is being enhanced by the use of a mobile computer lab and Fathom Dynamic software.\r\n \r\nAn extensive evaluation plan and student assessment plans are in place.  Materials developed and results of the project are being disseminated nationally. \r\n",
