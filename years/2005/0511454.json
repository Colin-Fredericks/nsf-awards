 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the development of algorithms and\r\nsoftware for the restoration of images degraded by nonlinear and\r\nnonuniform motion blurs.  The problems to be addressed by the\r\ninvestigator and his colleagues include the development of an\r\nappropriate mathematical model for nonlinear motion blurs, analysis of\r\nthe ill-conditioning of the blurring process, development of efficient\r\nalgorithms for removing motion blur, and development of software for\r\nspecific applications.  Algorithm and software development is needed\r\nfor the solution of large scale, severely ill-conditioned linear\r\nsystems that arise in the discrete formulation of these problems. For\r\nnonlinear and nonuniform motion, these systems generally have no\r\nexploitable structure; that is, standard deconvolution techniques that\r\nuse fast Fourier transforms are not applicable. \r\n\r\nImages used for surveillance, medical diagnostic, and other scientific\r\npurposes are rarely perfect.  Imperfections in the imaging system and\r\nenvironmental effects may result in serious degradations, such as\r\nblurring, in the recorded image.  Postprocessing techniques (i.e.,\r\ncomputational methods) are often necessary to obtain better quality\r\npictures.  Designing appropriate algorithms requires accurate\r\nmathematical modeling of the image formation process, and development\r\nof robust, efficient computational tools.  One of the most common\r\ncauses of blurring in images is motion of either the recording device\r\nor the objects being imaged.  Although linear motion, with constant\r\nspeed and direction, is well understood, very little work has been\r\ndone to develop mathematical models and efficient algorithms for the\r\nrestoration of images degraded by nonlinear and nonuniform motion\r\nblurs.  The investigator and his colleagues consider this difficult,\r\nimportant problem.  The software developed through this project can be\r\napplied to many important applications, including medical imaging\r\n(e.g., movement of the heart during cardiac imaging processes), aerial\r\nand video surveillance, forensic investigations, and astronomical\r\nimaging.\r\n",
