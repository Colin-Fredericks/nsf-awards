They will integrate SBE issues and materials into: K-12 educational materials for teachers through Science NetLinks (SNL), an existing site that provides standards-based content for all grades levels and all science disciplines; Science's Next Wave (SNW), a career resource for graduate students, postdocs, and early career scientists (soon to be merged with ScienceCareers.org); and MiSciNet, a specialized component of the careers site aimed at expanding opportunities for minority students by focusing on the undergraduate years and on the undergraduate-to-graduate transition. As part of the project AAAS will identify and review existing exemplary online SBE resources, index these resources in an accessible format for K-12 teachers, create a total of 44 original lessons and activities targeted to specific SBE learning goals, and demonstrate the range of educational pathways and career opportunities in all sectors.\r\nThis project will address the pressing need for scientifically accurate social, behavioral and economic sciences materials in two critical areas: education e-resources for use by K-12 educators and career development resources targeted to undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs and early career professionals.\r\n.\r\nBroader Impact.  The integration of the social, behavioral and economic sciences into Science NetLinks will enhance the capability, audience, and infrastructure to make SBE a more visible part of K-12 education.  Existing SBE resources will be incorporated into the AAAS website, which currently attracts more than 300,000 user sessions each month. SBE careers resources have not been a focus of Internet sites devoted to promoting increased participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, especially among females and racial and ethnic minorities. Career resources will be specifically designed to meet the needs of these groups and made available via Next Wave and MiSciNet, which are utilized by thousands each month.\r\n\r\n",
