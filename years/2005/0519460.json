 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional sensor networks have limitations when applied to support multiple missions or when the network conditions change. Mobile sensors can be used to address these problems as mobility can significantly increase the capability of the sensor network by making it resilient to failures, reactive to events, and be able to support disparate missions with a common set of sensors. To support mobility in sensor networks, this project investigates various research issues in mobility assisted sensing, network monitoring, mobility assisted routing, and integrated mobility management for sensing and routing. The expected results from this project are: (i) Significant theoretical and technical advances in supporting mobility in sensor networks; (ii) Understanding various performance and power tradeoffs in designing and implementing sensor relocation protocols; (iii) Development of network monitoring protocols, coverage hole estimation and failure effect estimation protocols; (iv) Theoretical advances on mobility assisted routing; and (v) Understanding of how sensing and routing interact and how to satisfy different mission requirements and maximize the network capability. The success of this project is likely to have a broader impact on making sensor networks more affordable and amenable to commercial, civilian, and military applications. The results of the project will be disseminated widely and in a timely manner through high quality publications, talks, and interactions with industrial teams. The project is also closely integrated with the education curricula at Penn State by developing new courses on sensor and ad hoc networks.",
