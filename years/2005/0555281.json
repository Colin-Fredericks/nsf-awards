These strategies will build on the understanding of protein-protein interactions and of ways to manipulate and exploit them in designing effective separation pathways. \r\n\r\nThis research will employ numerous approaches developed in earlier grant periods, including: methods to measure protein interactions, such as self-interaction chromatography; methods to calculate protein-protein interactions, including electrostatic, dispersion and hydration interactions; and methods to calculate phase diagrams from complex, anisotropic potentials such as those that apply to proteins. A particular area of emphasis in the research will be to relate the nature of protein interactions to the resulting phase diagram, as well as to the types of amorphous dense phases observed in practice, such as precipitates and gels.\r\n\r\nThe project will support training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, as well as undergraduates. Such trainees in earlier grant periods have been successful in academic and industrial careers, and the undergraduates have been co-authors on numerous publications.\r\n",
