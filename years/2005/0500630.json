 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Ergodic Theory of Dynamical Systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project proposes several research problems in Ergodic Theory of \r\nDynamical Systems. The theory is in a period of great activity, fueled \r\nby both the necessary internal coherence and its many interactions with \r\nother domains of mathematics or of mathematical Physics. The projects \r\nanticipates developments on three topics. One is parabolic dynamics. The \r\nprecise problems of interest here are the characterization of infinite \r\ninvariant measures for horocyclic flows on cover spaces, the new \r\ntheorems of convergence in average along orbits which appear in \r\nconnection with these measures, the speed of convergence in these \r\ntheorems and the possible applications of all these results. The second \r\ntopic  is almost hyperbolic dynamics. This covers questions where the \r\nlack of hyperbolicity is precisely localized. Some of the previous \r\nquestions are related to frame flows, or more  generally compact group \r\nextensions of hyperbolic flows. Another example is the geodesic flow on \r\nrank one manifolds, where the nonhyperbolicity is concentrated on a \r\nsingular invariant closed set.  There is some ongoing progress about the \r\nMartin boundary and the geometry at infinity of the universal cover of a \r\nrank one manifold. The third topic concerns  several ergodic theoretic \r\nquestions related to Quantum Chaos.\r\n\r\nIn general, the evolution of a dynamical system is represented by the \r\naction of a one parameter group -the time- over a space of \r\nconfigurations. Ergodic theory is the study of global statistical \r\nproperties of such actions. The two extreme cases have been flourishing \r\nsuccesses of last century mathematics.  On the  one side, the elliptic \r\ncase, when the motion is periodic or quasi-periodic gave rise to KAM \r\ntheory. The algebraic simple model is the translations on a compact \r\ngroup. On the other extreme, the hyperbolic case is the one where the \r\ntrajectories diverge exponentially. It is also well understood now, with \r\nextraordinarily precise statistical results. The standard  models are \r\nthe geodesic flow in negative curvature or  the algebraic action of an \r\ninteger matrix on the torus, when no eigenvalue has modulus one. Many \r\ninteresting programs  today try to develop new tools to understand the \r\nvast territory between the two extreme cases. As summarized above, the \r\npropositions of this project explore some possible paths. In spite of \r\ntheir apparent diversity, they have  common threads. An unexpected one \r\nis the role of invariant distributions, which appear for different \r\nreasons in several of these a priori unrelated questions.\r\n",
