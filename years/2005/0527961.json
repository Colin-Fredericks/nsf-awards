 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to have a workshop on the subject of \"From Macro to Nano:  Challenges and Opportunities in Integrative Complex Systems Engineering\".  This workshop will attempt to define broadly integrative complex systems in terms of common threads, helping the ECS Division to focus future funding programs and initiatives in research and education in areas that will enable progress in the important areas of systems research.  Integrated complex systems, configured as networks of information-gathering devices, are viewed as critical in meeting a broad range of societal challenges, including those associated with global warming, health care, transportation, manufacturing productivity, environmental quality, and homeland security. Such systems will extend the electronic connectivity represented by personal communications and the worldwide web to information provided directly by the environment.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit and broader impact:  The workshop proceedings will highlight the challenges of integrative systems, and will define key research topics for the coming decade.  The workshop will define what are the macro, micro, and nano systems and it will identify some key examples in support of these systems.  The outcome of this workshop will help define future areas of IS emphasis for the ECS Division and the new IS research topics will impact the interdisciplinary and IS education. And will provide new and additional opportunities for encouraging more of our young people to pursue careers in science and engineering.  \r\n\r\n",
