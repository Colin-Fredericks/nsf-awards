 "awd_abstract_narration": "The understanding of strongly interacting electronic systems is one of the primary goals of condensed matter physics today. Many important physical phenomena arise from strong correlation, including all of magnetism, metal-insulator transitions, the Mott transition and high temperature conductivity. With the constant stream of discovery of novel materials and new phenomena, condensed matter physics is a vibrant and exciting area of science.\r\n\r\nTheoretical work is needed both to interpret experimental discoveries and to guide the search for new materials and new phenomena. This research project is a continuation of our effort to carry on work in this general direction.\r\nThe specific work we propose focuses on the understanding of quantum magnetism in the vicinity of the Mott transition, and its relationship to high temperature superconductivity and a new class of cobalt oxide superconductors.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the proposed activity addresses some of the key issues in physics and certainly holds significant intellectual merit. Results of the proposed research will have broad impact on physics and materials science in that they relate to new materials and novel phenomenon.  In addition, the principal investigator has an excellent record working with students and postdoctoral associates.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
