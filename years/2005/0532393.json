 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of computing the set of irreducible unitary representations of\r\na Lie group is one of the main unsolved problems in representation theory.\r\nThere are two primary goals of this proposal.\r\nThe first goal is to compute the unitary dual of real and p-adic Lie groups,\r\nby a combination of mathematical and computational techniques. In particular\r\nwe plan to develop a set of software packages for computing structure theory of\r\nLie groups and unitary representations.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project is addressed by our second goal, which is to make\r\ninformation about Lie groups and representation theory accessible to the general\r\nmathematical audience. This will be done through a web site which will contain\r\ninteractive tools for accessing data about Lie groups and representations. The\r\nsoftware we will develop will be publicly available, and provided with extensive\r\ndocumentation and a well designed user interface.\r\nThe project will also have an impact on education by providing a mechanism\r\nfor new researchers to learn about the field and make contributions to it. In ad-\r\ndition, it will generate many mathematical and computational problems which\r\nwill be tractable to non-experts, and will centralize and organize the state of\r\nthe field to make it more accessible.\r\nWe hope this project will have as much or more of an impact in Lie theory\r\nas the Atlas of Finite Groups has in finite group theory.\r\n",
