 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the health effects of particulate matter (PM) has been a highly important scientific challenge for many years. This research team is developing a novel method to deliver ambient PM and coal flyash with designated composition to target areas using magnetically controlled transport. If successful, the technology will significantly improve our capabilities and understanding in this area, and the technology also could be useful for targeted drug delivery. The PIs are manufacturing magnetic nanoparticles in the gas phase and studying their behavior with respect to sorbing organics, coagulation and targeted magnetic deposition. The knowledge gained from his study could support public policies related to ultrafine aerosol particles (PM < 2.5) and could help shape new regulatory policies in relation to nanoparticles and ultrafine particles.",
