 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIn 1997 the PI and Kazantsev obtained the first explicit inversion formula \r\nfor the emission tomography problem using the intimate connection between \r\nthis problem and elliptic systems with operator coefficients.In this \r\nproject the PI plans to generalize this method to the following cases: (1) \r\ncases with partial or incomplete data; (2) cases where the unknown function \r\nis replaced by a tensor field; (3) cases where a general scattering term is \r\nalso present in a transport equation; (4) cases where straight line rays are \r\nreplaced by geodesic lines which may be known or unknown; (5) cases where the \r\nattenuation coefficient is also unknown; (6) cases with reflection on the \r\nboundary. We also plan to consider inverse problems with multiple boundary \r\nmeasurements for elliptic and hyperbolic operators with partial Cauchy data \r\nand develop for them the method of Carleman estimates together with the \r\ngeometric optics construction.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Rontgen discovered the so-called X-rays and made the first \r\nradiograph (of his wife's hand).In 1917 Radon considered the problem of \r\nreconstructing a function on the plane from the integrals of this function \r\nover all possible straight lines and obtained an explicit inversion \r\nformula. In the mid seventies these two discoveries joined in the X-ray \r\ntomograph. In 1979 an English engineer, Hounsfield, and an American \r\nmathematician, Cormack, received the Nobel prize in medicine for its \r\ndevelopment. Using X-ray tomography, one can find the attenuation of a body. If \r\nwe replace now the X-rays by more \"soft\" rays we obtain a much more difficult \r\ntomography problems. For example, in a seismic tomography one generates elastic \r\nwaves in the earth using acoustical sources at the earth's surface.The waves \r\nthat return to the surface of the earth are observed. The problem is to \r\nreconstruct the elastic properties of the earth from this data. In this case \r\nrays will be unknown curves that depends on the elastic properties. In the \r\nemission tomography problem it is required to find unknown radioactive source \r\ndistribution in a body with a known attenuation. It was only in 1997 that the \r\nPI and Kazantsev obtained the first inversion formula for this problem with \r\narbitrary smooth attenuation. In this project, the PI plans to generalize this \r\nresult to the following cases: (1) cases with incomplete data and curved rays \r\n(this is important for oil exploration for instance); (2) cases where the \r\nattenuation coefficient is also unknown (this is important for medical \r\nimaging, since we reduce the need to use the X-ray tomography for \r\ndetermination of the attenuation); (3) cases where the unknown scalar function \r\nis replaced by a vector or a tensor field (non-destructive evaluation of \r\nvector and tensor fields in aerodynamics and material sciences \r\nrespectively). The project will integrate research and education since the PI plans to use \r\nnew facts from the project in advanced \"Math and Engineering courses \".\r\n",
