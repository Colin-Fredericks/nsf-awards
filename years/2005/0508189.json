 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nLek mating systems, in which males aggregate and display to attract females, are of great interest to ecologists. In particular, lek mating systems attract the attention of scientists because of the pronounced reproductive skews, in which only a few males in the population are reproductively successful, while most are not. The existence of such reproductive skews calls into question the stability of lekking and cooperative display, but remains an unresolved phenomenon in behavioral ecology. The primary goal of the proposed research is to elucidate how reproductive strategies of male manakins (Aves: Pipridae) are maintained through time. This goal will be addressed through an intensive, three-year study of the reproductive and social dynamics of a lek-breeding manakin, Pipra filicauda, at a lowland rainforest site in Ecuador.  The goals will be achieved by behavioral observations of males at leks to determine the identity of males present and which males cooperate in reproductive displays.  In addition, nests of female manakins will be located to obtain blood samples from the chicks to determine paternity (i.e., which male sired the offspring).  Information on male relatedness at leks and known paternity of chicks provide evidence of direct and indirect reproductive benefits to males for joining leks.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThis study will provide an educational experience for a graduate student and several undergraduate assistants that involve field and laboratory techniques.  The project builds and strengthens the international collaboration of the two host institutions, Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) and the University of Missouri-St. Louis (UMSL). Moreover, this project enables host institutions to build interactive learning environments through the integration and training of their undergraduate students in applicable research techniques.  The project also aids proactive conservation of the Ecuadorian lowlands by providing basic biological information to USFQ and the biological station Tiputini. Ultimately, this project fills gaps in scientific knowledge while building international collaboration and promoting conservation of Ecuadorian ecosystems.\r\n\r\n",
