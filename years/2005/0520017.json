 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current packet networks depend on the fundamental assumption that an end-to-end path exists between a source and a destination. However, in a number of real networks termed Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), for example, inter-planetary networks, wildlife tracking networks and military networks, this assumption does not hold. With this in mind, this project designs a family of efficient routing schemes that are suitable for such networks. The routing approaches are innovative in that they exploit scheduled, anticipated, and ad hoc connectivity. The work also introduces an analytical framework to analyze the performance of routing schemes, compare their behavior and refine their design. Performance metrics of interest include average message delivery delay, energy efficiency, network throughput, etc. Finally, the work includes results from extensive simulations of DTN routing algorithms under realistic scenarios, and implementations of the champion algorithms in simulation packages such as ns-2.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this project will improve the communication capabilities in space explorations, under-sea experimentation, wildlife tracking and habitat monitoring networks, ad hoc vehicular networks for content distribution, etc. The results are expected to improve DTN's readiness for deployment in NASA's deep space research programs, and NSF's south polar programs. It will become possible to provide Internet services to under-provisioned remote areas, high latitude scientific outposts, nomadic communities, etc. Hence, the proposal will have broad social and economic impact.\r\n",
