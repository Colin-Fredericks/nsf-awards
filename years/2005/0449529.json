 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important questions for resource management is, under what \r\nconditions will users conserve the resources on which their livelihood \r\ndepends?  This project studies the forest management \r\nstrategies of different types of forest landowner groups in Maine.  Some \r\nowners are doing a far better job of managing their forests sustainably \r\nthan are others. The quality of management practices is a crucial issues at this time, \r\nbecause the rapid depletion of forests is a world-wide problem. Maine is a \r\nparticularly good laboratory to study forest management issues because it \r\nis the most heavily forested state in the country, and a wide variety of \r\nmanagement practices are being used. In Maine, the rate of cutting is not \r\nsustainable, according to a number of studies. As a result, the amount of \r\nland covered with brush and scrub trees has increased greatly, and the \r\namount of acreage in high quality forests has declined greatly. At the same \r\ntime, Maine's entire forest industry, one of the state's largest \r\nindustries, is undergoing great changes.  Paper mills are being closed, \r\nemployment is declining sharply, and large tracts of land are changing hands.\r\n\r\nThis project involves an anthropologist and a forester studying Maine's \r\npaper companies, timber companies, forest contractors and small private \r\nforest owners.  Two different, but complementary, kinds of studies will be \r\ndone.  First, information will be gathered on the forest management \r\npractices of a sample of landowners in each of the landowner categories, \r\nwith emphasis on the paper companies and the private landowners. This \r\ninformation will be gathered using a number of techniques: mail surveys, \r\nqualitative in-person interviews, archival research, and direct \r\nobservations. This study is designed to understand the forest management \r\nstrategies of these landowners, and the social, cultural, economic and \r\npolitical factors motivating these decisions.  Second, the actual state of \r\nthe forests of these landowners will be evaluated using both field visits \r\nand the analysis of satellite images.  Information from these studies will \r\nbe used to test a number of hypotheses which will give us a greater \r\nunderstanding of the behavior of private forest-owners.\r\n\r\nBroader implications: This study will enhance our understanding of the \r\nfactors motivating people in various landowner categories to conserve or \r\nover-exploit their forests.  Legislators, management \r\nagencies, and local communities would be able to act on this information to \r\nframe better resource management policies.\r\n",
