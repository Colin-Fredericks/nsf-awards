 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAwodey is requesting funding to send two Ph.D. students in Pure and Applied Logic\r\nat Carnegie Mellon University to a week-long summer school in topos theory.\r\nThe school will be held in Belgium, and is partially sponsored by the Department\r\nof Mathematics of the University of Louvain-la-Neuve. In addition\r\nto the PI, several distinguished researchers are participating as instructors.\r\nThe primary aim of the meeting is to provide students with an opportunity\r\nto acquire advanced training in topos theory. Topics to be covered include:\r\ngeneral sheaf theory, classifying toposes, descent theory and groupoid representations,\r\nhomotopy and cohomology of toposes, algebraic set theory, and\r\nrealizability.\r\nThe students have successfully completed M.S. studies in Carnegie Mellon's\r\nLogic and Computation program and are now doctoral students in\r\nCarnegie Mellon's PhD program in Pure and Applied Logic. They are\r\njudged to be promising logicians of outstanding ability, in a field that is\r\nunder-represented in U.S. logic.\r\n\r\nTopos theory occupies a unique position in mathematics, connecting\r\nlogic, topology, and algebraic geometry. The notion of a topos originated\r\nin the Grothendieck school of algebraic geometry as a generalized notion\r\nof \"space\", but in logic it also subsumes Boolean-valued models, Cohen\r\nforcing, and Kripke semantics, as well as topological and sheaf models. It is\r\nalso related to the logical notion of a deductive system of higher-order logic\r\nor type theory.\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed project include not only promoting\r\ngraduate education, but also enhancing infrastructure for research and\r\neducation through international partnerships; and the broad dissemination\r\nof results, enhancing scientific and technological understanding.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
