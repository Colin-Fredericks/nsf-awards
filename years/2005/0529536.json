 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide support for the 16th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research to be held at the University of Wisconsin, Madison on June 15 through 19, 2005. The aim is to provide an opportunity for the exchange of ideas among researchers of the international Arabidopsis community. The conference will include sessions on cell biology, cell signaling, flower and fruit development, shoot and root development, metabolism, proteomics, abiotic interaction with the environment, biotic interaction with the environment, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, novel tools, techniques and resources, evolutionary biology and progress in some Arabidopsis 2010 projects. An important component of the conference is the presentation of current research by approximately 55 speakers. Graduate students, postdoctoral researchers or junior faculty will present the majority of these talks. This will ensure presentation of the latest results, promote education of students and postdoctoral fellows and provide important career development for selected speakers. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the conference lies in its ability to enhance the exchange of information at the forefront of Arabidopsis research creating new research networks and collaborations. Conference abstracts will be available on the conference webpage and at TAIR (the Arabidopsis Information Resource) providing for public access to this information. A workshop on the use of Arabidopsis in the classroom will be organized. Travel subsidies for conference participants from developing countries and full coverage for all conference costs for underrepresented minorities and participants from Minority Serving Institutions will broaden the participation and increase diversity in the Arabidopsis research community.",
