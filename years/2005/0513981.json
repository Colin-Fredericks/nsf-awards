The PI proposes two research\r\nprojects in this area. The first project in collaboration with\r\nR. Spatzier is continuation of recent work with R. Spatzier and\r\nB. Wilking; we showed that a manifold with upper curvature bound\r\n1 and spherical Jacobi fields along every geodesic must be\r\nlocally isometric to a compact, rank one symmetric space. This\r\nhas led to further interesting questions. The second project\r\nproposes to find obstructions on the fundamental group of\r\npositively curved manifolds in the presence of continuous\r\nsymmetry; other than the classical Synge theorem, there are no\r\nknown obstructions. The third project is in the area of geometric\r\ngroup theory. In collaboration with N. Brady, M. Bridson and\r\nM. Forester we constructed many new examples of first and second\r\norder Dehn functions by constructing the so called snowflake\r\ngroups. We hope to pursue further questions about Dehn functions\r\nfor other classes of finitely presented groups (like CAT(0)\r\ngroups, higher Dehn functions etc.)\r\n\r\nMost of us have an intuitive understanding of the term\r\ncurvature. Tabletops and desktops are flat while basketballs and\r\nsaddles are curved. My research concerns the study of objects in\r\nhigher dimensions that admit non-negative curvature. This falls\r\nunder the umbrella of differential geometry which is the language\r\nEinstein used to express the general theory of relativity, our\r\nbest theoretical description of gravity and its effects on the\r\nuniverse. Intuitively a positively curved object has the property\r\nthat all triangles drawn on it are fatter than triangles drawn on\r\na tabletop. Similarly, negative curvature corresponds to thin or\r\nskinny triangles. So (the surface of) a basketball has positive\r\ncurvature while a saddle has negative curvature where the rider\r\nsits. In higher dimensions, matters being much less visually\r\napparent, one uses equations and sophisticated geometrical\r\ntechniques to study the curvature of manifolds which are, roughly\r\nspeaking, objects with no sharp edges. One of the great mysteries\r\nin differential geometry is the dearth of examples of\r\nnon-negatively curved manifolds, and not many structure theorems\r\neither. My work deals with trying to understand the structure of\r\nmanifolds in the presence of certain constraints like\r\nnon-negative curvature or symmetry.\r\n",
