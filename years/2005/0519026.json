Organized by Dr. Gabriel Braunstein of University of Central Florida, the institute will involve approximately 50 participants from the United States and Latin America including graduate students and junior and established investigators, and about 10 instructors (internationally recognized scientists, active in the field).   The activities will consist of a combination of tutorial lectures, advanced-topic presentations, round table discussions, and poster sessions, with the goal of providing the participants with an up-to-date review of the basic theoretical principles of ion-solid interactions, an introduction to ion optics, knowledge of the latest developments and applications of ion beams at the micron scale and below, and familiarity with available commercial equipment and state of the art research systems for reduced dimensionality applications. \r\n\r\nThe wide range of applications, materials, and beam energies, will impart a significant interdisciplinary nature to the Institute, and should foster the cross-fertilization of new ideas to advance the field and, ultimately, increase relations between Latin American junior and senior investigators and their counterparts in the U.S.  Materials presented at the Institute will be posted in a designated web site for further dissemination to the scientific community and the public at large. \r\n\r\n",
