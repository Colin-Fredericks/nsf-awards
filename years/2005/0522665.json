 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nMechanics of nanostructures, like other areas of research, advances through the cross-fertilization of material modelers, simulation experts and experimentalists. The emergence of other countries as important players in science and technology prompts more global interactions for US benefit. The International Conference on Computational & Experimental Engineering and Sciences (ICCES), consisting of the Symposium on Mechanics of Nanostructures and several other mechanics related symposia, will take place in India during Dec 1-6, 2005. This conference is an ideal platform for the synergy of modeling and experimental researches and for international exchange on state-of-the-art technologies that address pressing issues in science and engineering, particularly in mechanics of nanostructures. The NSF sponsorship enables the synergy and the exchange. Through this sponsorship, both senior and junior researchers will be invited to participate in the symposium, and the US participants will be encouraged to interact with their overseas colleagues. In addition to advance US research in mechanics of nanostructured materials, this sponsorship serves to encourage participation of underrepresented groups, such as women, in research.\r\n",
