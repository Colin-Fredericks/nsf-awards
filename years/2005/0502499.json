 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and her students and collaborators use\r\ncomputability theoretic methods to investigate various algorithmic\r\nphenomena on countable mathematical structures.  The project aims to\r\nbetter understand how algebraic properties of structures interact with\r\nthe algorithmic ones.  Topics of investigation include: complexity of\r\nstructures and their isomorphic copies, complexity of additional\r\nrelations on their domains, complexity and structure of partial and\r\ntotal isomorphisms, and the correspondence between computability and\r\ndefinability.  The complexity is often expressed by computable\r\ninfinitary formulae, and measured by Turing degrees or by other\r\ncomputability theoretic degrees.  Since these degrees are not invariant\r\nunder isomorphisms, we investigate their spectrum, which consists of all\r\ndegrees in the isomorphism type of a structure.  An important goal is to\r\nrelate the degree spectra of relations to the degree spectra of\r\nstructures by studying the so-called spectrally universal structures. \r\nThe project involves investigations in general model theoretic setting,\r\nsuch as algorithmic versions of categoricity, but also more concrete\r\nwell-known classes of algebraic structures, such as commutative groups,\r\nnon-commutative groups, rings, fields, vector spaces.  Another goal of\r\nthe project is to integrate computable algebra with algorithmic learning\r\ntheory in Putnam-Gold's framework of inductive inference machines, which\r\nhas so far been developed mainly for computably enumerable sets.  This\r\nstudy is also important in the philosophy of inductive reasoning. \r\n\r\nIn the 1930's, Turing, Goedel, Kleene and others developed the\r\nmathematical theory of computability.  Their results paved the way for\r\nthe invention of modern computers.  Model theory, which emerged as a\r\ndistinct field in the 1940's through the works of Skolem, Goedel,\r\nTarski, Malcev and others, provides a rigorous framework for the notions\r\nof language, meaning and truth.  A model, a concept used in all of\r\nsciences, describes a portion of reality by using a formal language to\r\nexpress properties under study.  Interaction of computability theory\r\nwith model theory, as well as other areas of mathematics, has resulted\r\nin computable model theory and, more generally, in computable\r\nmathematics.  Goedel's incompleteness theorem is a striking early result\r\nin computable model theory.  While some mathematical constructions are\r\nalgorithmic, or can be replaced by algorithmic ones yielding the same\r\nresults, others are intrinsically non-algorithmic.  Problems that can be\r\nsolved algorithmically are called decidable.  Examples of negative\r\nresults in computable mathematics include the undecidability of the\r\nHilbert's tenth problem, and the undecidability of the word problem in\r\ncombinatorial group theory.  Undecidable problems can be more precisely\r\nclassified by considering generalized algorithms, which require external\r\nknowledge.  Turing degrees, which play a significant role in this\r\nproject, provide an important measure of the level of such knowledge\r\nneeded.  An important goal of the project is to use Turing degrees to\r\ninvestigate structures of importance in other areas of mathematics.\r\n",
