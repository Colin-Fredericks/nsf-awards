 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rachel Morgan Theall, University of Arizona, is developing a new collaboration between the University, Tucson public schools, and Flandrau Science Center. \"Science in the City\" will enable teachers and students at urban, minority-serving public high schools to create professional exhibits for the local science museum. Student teams from three to five high schools will each research, design and create an exhibit on some aspect of science in their communities. These exhibits will be judged and the winning exhibits will be displayed in the Flandrau Science Center. Students and teachers involved in the project will gain in-depth understanding of a particular science topic or issue, understand how science impacts their lives on a daily basis, learn how to present their topic in an informal public science education setting, and make a positive contribution to their community. \r\n\r\nThis award is cofunded by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with a service-oriented project. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.\r\n",
