 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mosse-Wu\r\n\r\nTime-critical applications in embedded systems environments often have stringent quality of service (QoS) \r\nand timing requirements that need to be met to ensure proper operation and dependability, even in the \r\npresence of failures and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Achieving this goal, however, brings about a host \r\nof critical challenges which are unique or fundamentally different from those encountered in traditional \r\nwireless sensors and ad-hoc networks.  While significant progress is being made in specific technologies \r\nassociated with micro-sensing and actuation, formidable barriers remain to large-scale deployment \r\nof fault-tolerant and secure embedded wireless systems for time-critical applications. This collaborative \r\nresearch project is pursuing integrated research at three levels: (i) reward-based, trustworthy QoS models, \r\n(ii) secure, fault-tolerant routing and data forwarding, and (iii) fault-tolerant data access and management. \r\nThe emphasis of the proposed methodologies will be on the inter-relationships between different components \r\nand layers of the system and the consequent research and design issues. \r\n\r\n \r\nThis project is developing comprehensive analytical framework to establish bounds on performance guarantees \r\nwhen failure occurs or when the system is under denial of service attacks. In pursuit of dependable,robust and secure \r\nembedded systems, this research also focuses on secure and fault-tolerant routing and data management.\r\nThe project is developing scalable and energy-efficient routing protocols \r\nthat can tolerate both device failures and transient network overload. The project also is \r\ndeveloping dynamic and adaptive risk-based schemes for data aggregation and management. \r\nThe effort spans several research areas: distributed and embedded real-time systems, sensor networks, \r\nsecurity, and information processing. The project aims for impact through a wide range of \r\ntime-critical applications such as: ubiquitous and pervasive health care, infrastructure protection and \r\nhomeland security, and real-time environment monitoring. The project seeks to stimulate cross-area \r\nresearch and include a diverse group of students from Computer Science, Information Science, and Engineering. \r\nResults and software tools are freely disseminated through the project website. \r\n\r\n",
