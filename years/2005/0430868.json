 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: \"Models and Methods for Robust and Conic Optimization\"\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nUncertainty is an inevitable feature of many decision making \r\nenvironments. On a regular basis, engineers, economists, investment\r\nprofessionals, and others need to make decisions to optimize a system\r\nwith incomplete  information and considerable uncertainty. \r\nUnderstanding, quantifying, and managing uncertainty is critical\r\nto the success and effectiveness of their decisions. \r\nRobust optimization refers to the modeling of optimization problems\r\nwith data uncertainty with the objective of  \r\nobtaining a solution that is guaranteed to \r\nperform well under all possible realizations of the uncertain parameters.\r\n\r\nThis project will introduce novel approaches\r\nfor the characterization of robustness in uncertain systems\r\nand develop efficient and reliable optimization algorithms for \r\nidentification of robust solutions. \r\nIn particular, the project will focus on (i) developing methods to \r\nidentify solutions that are ``relative robust'', i.e., solutions that \r\nare good in each scenario, where the quality of the\r\nsolution is measured relative to the best solution of \r\neach scenario; (ii) developing new models and methods for\r\n``adjustable robust optimization'', i.e., for problems with \r\nuncertainty where a subset of the decision variables can be\r\nadjusted after some of the uncertain variables are\r\nobserved. \r\n\r\nIn many cases, robust optimization formulations are expressed\r\nas the problem of optimizing a linear function over a set defined \r\nby linear equalities and cone membership constraints, a so-called\r\nconic optimization problem. Implementation efforts will \r\ninclude the development of structure-exploiting algorithms \r\nfor the solution of large-scale conic optimization problems. \r\nIn particular, problems with fixed variables, cone intersection \r\nconstraints, and quadratic objectives will be studied. \r\nThe resulting algorithms will be carefully implemented and \r\nthe software will be freely distributed.   \r\n\r\nRobust and conic optimization formulations are used to model  \r\na wide array of applications in many diverse fields. \r\nFor example, robust optimization problems arise when some \r\nof the input parameters of a given optimization problem \r\nare unknown or uncertain, which is \r\ncommon in finance, economics, and engineering models. \r\nConic optimization problems are encountered in truss design, \r\ncontrol and system theory, statistics, eigenvalue optimization, \r\nantenna array weight design, and mathematical finance.\r\nGiven their wide applicability, the progress achieved through this\r\nproject in solving these problem classes more efficiently\r\nand effectively, will benefit activities in many of the\r\ndisciplines listed above. In addition, the project work\r\nwill be integrated into the PI's ongoing teaching, training,\r\nand  outreach activities through \r\n(i) the CMU Summer Institute, (ii) the teaching of a \r\nproject-based course that benefits local industries and organizations, \r\n(iii) \"NEC: Give a Day, Make a Difference\" program.",
