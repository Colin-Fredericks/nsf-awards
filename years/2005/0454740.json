 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops and investigates the feasibility of a new methodology for performance assessment that will enable its use in large-scale tests.  This computer-based approach (a variant on an intelligent tutoring system) focuses on explicit measurement of inquiry skills using a large-scale format.  The project focuses on the explicit measurement of inquiry skills and processes that connect content domains for which there are less clear outcomes.  Statistical modeling techniques (based on the work of Mislevy) express how observable variables depend on the knowledge, skills or abilities of the examinees.  The project measures across the middle school science content areas of physical, earth and space, and life sciences.  Tasks will be developed and piloted with students from a wide range of backgrounds.  This is conceived as Phase I of the project.  The PI will then submit Phase II that will investigate the viability of these products to perform as expected in middle school classrooms",
