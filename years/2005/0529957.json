 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nIt has been shown, since the beginning of the  20   century,  by  many  investigators  that  axial strength and ductility of reinforced concrete column can be significantly improved by providing sufficient lateral reinforcement.  In order to improve the strength and ductility or to facilitate the construction of reinforced concrete circular columns, the PI of this proposal has developed a new confinement technique. \r\n \r\nThe proposed  confinement technique is meant to increase the spacing of the confining spiral without jeopardizing the strength and ductility of the column or to improve the ductility and strength without reducing the spiral spacing  and hindering the flow of concrete during construction.  The new confinement technique uses two opposing spirals (cross spirals).   Each of the two cross spirals is spaced twice what a single spiral is spaced to provide equivalent (same) amount of confining reinforcement.  This will provide plenty of room (spiral spacing) so that the flow  of  concrete  is  not  obstructed  by  the  spiral  in  order  to  facilitate  the  construction  of  the columns.  Earthquakes  require the columns, which are the main supporting elements of the structure, to be adequately confined to provide sufficient ductility to dissipate energy without \r\ncollapse, especially when high-strength concrete is used.  The proposed confinement technique may be used to provide two opposing (cross) spirals instead of a single conventional spiral with the same spacing.   This will double the amount of confinement without reducing the spiral spacing  and  violating  the  minimum  allowable  spiral  spacing  as  specified  by  the  ACI  318-02 building code.  This may significantly enhance the ductility of the column.   \r\n \r\nThe PI has already investigated the new confinement technique for circular columns sujected to concentric axial compressive loading.  It was found that the new confinement technique may be used to improve the strength and ductility or to facilitate the construction of reinforced concrete columns and piles. \r\n \r\nThe  objective  of  this  research  is  to  experimentally  study  the  behavior  of  reinforced  concrete circular  columns confined using the proposed  confinement technique  (cross spirals) under constant  axial  loading  and  cyclic  lateral  loading  to  simulate  seismic  loading.    This  will  be compared to columns confined with single conventional spiral in accordance with the ACI 318-02 concrete building code.  This study includes conducting the experimental testing of 12 reinforced concrete circular columns.  The columns will be subjected to constant axial load and reversed cyclic lateral load to simulate seismic loading.  \r\n \r\nThe  current  state-of-practice  in  seismic  design  of  concrete  columns  does  not  meet  the increasingly demanding  standard of post-earthquake serviceability, but rather only  attempts to maintain life-safety. This research will open a new and wide research topic to study the effect of the new confinement technique on the behavior of R/C column subjected to different loads.  The ductility  of  columns  is  a  very  important  issue  in  seismic  design  and  needs  to  be  enhanced  to reduce the seismic hazard and provide more safety during and after earthquakes.  This research will also open a wide door to the PI to do more research in the topic and carefully look at the advantages and is advantages of the new idea.  The application of the findings of the proposed research into practice will help change the course of current earthquake engineering workforce to concentrate more on damage minimization in structures. \r\n\r\n",
