 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conference on Complex Analysis, Differential Geometry, and Partial Differential Equations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a week-long conference on the many aspects of\r\ncomplex analysis, differential geometry, and partial\r\ndifferential equations centered around the theme of\r\ncanonical metrics in geometry. Of particular importance\r\nare recent developments such as multiplier ideal sheaves,\r\nBergman kernels and asymptotic stability in geometric\r\ninvariant theory, Hamiltonian dynamics and complex Monge-Ampere\r\nequations, geometric heat flows, and energy functionals.\r\n\r\nCanonical metrics involve typically a non-linear system\r\nof partial differential equations, where the unknown is a\r\ntensor. They arise from geometry and topology, but they\r\nare also closely to basic equations from theoretical\r\nphysics such as Yang-Mills equations and Einstein's\r\nequations in general relativity. They are usually very\r\ndifficult to solve, but there has been recently an influx\r\nof new ideas from many different directions. This conference\r\nwill help cross-fertilization of ideas between the leading\r\nexperts, and introduce a new generation of young students\r\nand postdoctoral researchers to problems and methods in the\r\narea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
