 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator uses variational methods to study material\r\ndamage, with an emphasis on properties of damaged regions and\r\ntheir time evolution.  Examples of damage include brittle cracks,\r\ncracking due to fatigue, and debonding of thin films.  Some\r\ndiscrete-time models for damage evolution exist in the engineering\r\ncommunity, but these are generally ad hoc and not known to\r\ncorrespond to limiting continuous-time models.  The investigator\r\nstudies the existence of the limiting models, basic properties of\r\nthe damage regions, and the justification for extending numerical\r\nmethods for static problems to methods for the quasi-static,\r\ncontinuous-time problems. \r\n     Damage to materials is of great technological importance not\r\nonly because it results in material failure, but also because it\r\nplays an important role in building certain nanostructures, for\r\nexample by selectively debonding thin films.  The project seeks to\r\ngreatly improve our understanding of these materials by improving\r\nthe mathematical models and studying basic properties of their\r\nsolutions, as well as by developing and justifying numerical\r\nmethods.  Mathematics Ph.D. students are included in the project,\r\nand are trained in the mathematical modeling and analysis of\r\nimportant interdisciplinary problems.",
