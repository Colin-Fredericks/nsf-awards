 "awd_abstract_narration": "A New Innovative Miniature Passive Direct Methanol Fuel Cell\r\nBy Faghri, A.1, and Guo, Z. \r\n\r\n1United Technologies Endowed Chair\r\nProfessor in Thermal-Fluids Engineering & Dean\r\nSchool of Engineering\r\nUniversity of Connecticut\r\n261 Glenbrook Rd.\r\nStorrs, CT  06269-2237\r\n860-486-2221\r\nFaghri@engr.uconn.edu\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal was received as an unsolicited submission to the Chemical and Transport Systems Divisions in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) category.  It was assigned to the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program. The miniature direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) appears to be a promising power source for portable applications.  The existing actively managed DMFCs offer fundamental attractions in relatively simple system design and low-temperature operation.  However, their reliance on moving parts - as well as other issues - prevents their being scaled down to a sufficiently small size to accommodate use in portable power applications.    To solve these problems, we propose a new miniature passive DMFC at 10-20W that includes a fuel cell stack and ancillary systems. The passive approach has no moving parts and significantly reduces the cost and volume/weight (by 1/5) compared to active systems.  The proposed methodology will utilize novel and high-risk techniques such as passive methanol delivery and storage, innovative thermal management for operation at extreme environmental conditions, and methanol concentration control.  \r\n",
