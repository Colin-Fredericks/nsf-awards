 "awd_abstract_narration": "If a U.S. Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory, DUSEL, is built, it will allow scientists to answer fundamental physics questions as to the nature of dark matter, the properties of the neutrinos, the evolution of stars, and the stability of matter. It will provide a unique observatory to explore the microbial processes and evolution under our planet's surface, as well as the complex connection between tectonics, rock properties, and multifaceted reaction and transport phenomena.  It will enable dramatic opportunities for engineers to study underground construction, resource extraction, and environmental remediation.  DUSEL will also provide unique opportunities for cross-disciplinary education and outreach, and for involvement of minority-serving institutions and local communities.\r\n\r\nThis proposal represents the community-wide response to NSF Solicitation NSF-04-595, for proposals to support the meetings and study necessary to develop the site-independent case for the research opportunities afforded by a DUSEL, for establishment of the technical requirements for the various experiments, and for grouping of the experiments into modules with common infrastructural requirements.  The proposal involves members of all eight of the possible sites for a DUSEL that were identified at the time this proposal was written.  The deliverable of this proposal will be a 40-50 page document describing the science and engineering research that a DUSEL would enable, so as to establish the benchmarks against which the capabilities of subsequent site dependent proposals for a DUSEL, in response to subsequent NSF Solicitations, can be measured.  \r\n\r\nThe six PIs of this proposal represent astrophysics, nuclear and particle physics, geology-engineering, geomicrobiology and microbial biology.  The bulk of the work will be performed in fourteen working groups.  Three planned workshops will gather the community to synthesize the conclusions of individual working groups.  The proposal requests support for the various endeavors of the scientists and engineers who will ultimately produce the 40-50 page document that will be the end result of their efforts.\r\n",
