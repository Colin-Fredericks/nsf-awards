 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a theoretical study of the rotational properties of clouds of ultracold atoms.\r\nBuilding on his previous work, the investigator will explore several topical subjects, with the fol-\r\nlowing four objectives. (1) He will calculate the topological structures which will form in a rapidly\r\nrotating gases of spin-1 bosons in the presence of magnetic fields. (2) He will determine the kinet-\r\nics of spinning up small clusters of atoms at the nodes of an optical lattice. (3) He will produce\r\na practical scheme for creating fields which couple to neutral atoms in the same way that the\r\nelectromagnetic fields couple to charged particle. (4) He will study interference between rotating\r\nclouds and demonstrate that an interference experiment can distinguishing condensed and strongly\r\ncorrelated rotating states.\r\nThese projects are motivated by both interest in fundamental physical properties of these cold\r\ngases [topics (1), (2), and (4)] and by a desire to produce experimental protocols to create and\r\nmeasure exotic states of matter [topics (2), (3), and (4)]. Topic (1) addresses the basic ground\r\nstate properties of clouds of rotating atoms. Topic (2) allows the study of fundamental questions of\r\nenergy and entropy transfer in isolated systems, while possibly providing an experimental pathway\r\nto producing analogs of quantum Hall effects. Topic (3) is aimed at producing a valuable tool for\r\nexploring vortex physics, quantum Hall effects, the pinning of vortex lattices, and the interplay\r\nbetween lattices and quantum Hall effects. Topic (4) studies the basic coherence properties of both\r\ncondensed and correlated states, and provides an experimental strategy for distinguishing these\r\nstates.\r\nThe investigator will use an array of analytic and computational techniques, related to those\r\nused in previous projects. These include lowest-Landau-level calculus, field theory, variational\r\nmethods, numerical exact diagonalization, and numerical Monte-Carlo.\r\n",
