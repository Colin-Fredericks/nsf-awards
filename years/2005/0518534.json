 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to prepare the foundation for a Science of Learning Center that will redefine learning in the Social Sciences and provide the catalyst to conduct world-class research on social science learning.  By integrating and developing research and theory from six key areas, Cognitive Learning Theories, Cognitive Modeling, Neuroimaging, Philosophy of Social Science, Virtual Reality Enhanced Perspectives, and Educational Applications, a robust learning model can be assembled that illuminates the acquisition of knowledge in the Social Sciences. The Center will directly address limitations to social science learning that result from how students acquire knowledge. Student preference for predictability over variability and the tendency to make dispositional rather than situational attributions for behavior, for example, both play key roles in limiting learning and flexible thinking in the Social Sciences.  The integration of research will help scholars both to create more effective models for teaching social science concepts and will provide a platform for further investigations and research. During the catalyst grant, working groups will research and review basic issues in each participating field and identify the best possible integrated foundation for moving forward\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this center comes from work on learning in math and science, as well as basic research on social perspectives, learning and thinking. Research on learning in math and science has over the past forty years has demonstrated that prior knowledge and established that patterns of thinking interferes with students' efforts to learn physics, statistics, mathematics, probability and almost every advanced theoretical field. Social psychology has unearthed well-defined patterns of thinking that influence how all people come to understand social events and decisions. Our goal is to bridge results from these two bodies of research. As it stands now, the problem we will address not only prevents students from acquiring a complex understanding of social science, but impedes the construction of social theories and related empirical investigations. We will design a Center and research plan that considers how the corpus of ideas across social science are influenced by patterns of thought, and how the mechanisms we use to teach Social Science can be more effectively developed. Results from the catalyst grant will include:\r\n\r\n-A mapping of social science concepts to the properties of the human mind that learn those concepts \r\n-A comprehensive cross-disciplinary set of protocols for conducting research on social science learning\r\n-An on-line collaborative environment for maximizing interdisciplinary research on social science learning and training social scientists to engage in interdisciplinary research on learning\r\n-New paradigms for understanding the role and influence of perspectives and misconceptions on complex knowledge acquisition.",
