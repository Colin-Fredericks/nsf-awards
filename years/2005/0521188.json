The joint\r\nconference will be held during the period April 3-7, 2005, at the Hilton Hawaiian Village\r\nHotel, in Honolulu, HI.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the joint conference is to provide a forum for discussing and presenting\r\nrecent research results in two of the most enabling technologies in electrical and\r\ncommunication engineering. While the IEEE conference will focus on advances in the\r\nwireless communications technology, the ACES conference usually deals with advances\r\nin applied computational electromagnetics. In a way, the wireless technology provides\r\nvery important application areas for the computational EM research. The complementary\r\nnature of the research areas in the two conferences will hence, provide mutual benefits\r\nfor both collaborating organizations and their participants.\r\n\r\nThe requested NSF funds will be used to cover travel support for graduate students who\r\nwill be presenting papers and portion of the grant will be used to cover travel expenses\r\nfor an invited speakers who are experts in new and emerging technologies in the wireless\r\nand the computational EM areas.\r\n\r\n",
