 "awd_abstract_narration": "Time series with long-range dependence have been recently the focus of\r\nmuch attention. They appear in a number of applications, for example,\r\nin the analysis of traffic in computer networks.  In finite variance\r\ntime series, long-range dependence is characterized by a covariance\r\nfunction which decreases slowly to 0 as the lag increases.  The\r\ndecrease is so slow that the corresponding spectral density blows up\r\nat very low frequencies, a phenomenon also known as ''long-range\r\ndependence'', ``long memory'' or ``1/f noise''.  There are many\r\nempirical procedures which are graphical in nature but rigorous\r\nestimation procedures are few. The better ones use a semi-parametric\r\napproach because long-range dependence does not involve the short\r\nrange dependence structure.  The most successful methods have been\r\nFourier-based. One approach involves a regression on the logarithm of\r\nthe periodogram. Another is the local Whittle approach.  It is a\r\npseudo-likelihood approach which uses the periodogram at low\r\nfrequencies only. The investigator proposes to use a pseudo-likelihood\r\napproach based not on the Fourier spectrum but on wavelets.  The\r\nadvantage of wavelets on Fourier is that there is no need to\r\ndifference the time series if these are not stationary and, in\r\ngeneral, they are much more robust against departure from\r\nstationarity.  Since wavelets are associated with scaling it is,\r\nmoreover, natural to attempt to use wavelets in order to estimate the\r\nintensity of long-range dependence.  Wavelets have been successfully\r\nused as an alternative to the regression on the logarithm of the\r\nperiodogram but wavelets have not been\r\nused as an alternative to the Fourier-based local Whittle approach.\r\nThe investigator proposes to do so. This would provide a robust\r\nsemi-parametic pseudo-likelihood based method to estimate the\r\nintensity of long-range dependence.\r\n\r\nThe subject of time series analysis has sparked considerable research\r\nactivity over the past several decades. Essentially concerned with\r\nmeasurements over time of various kinds of phenomena --- from yearly\r\nincome, exchange rates, to the level of a river --- the goal is to\r\ndevelop suitable models and obtain accurate predictions for such\r\nmeasurements, the core ingredient being the notion of time dependence.\r\nBenoit Mandelbrot in the sixties suggested using models involving\r\nlong-range dependence.  Long-range dependence, to put it concisely,\r\naffects phenomena in which correlations between the present and the\r\npast decay slowly with time and thus they cannot be easily ignored.\r\nTime series with long-range dependence and their variations have been\r\nused in hydrology, geophysics and biophysics, and more recently, in\r\nfinance and in analyzing traffic in computer networks. It is thus\r\nimportant to be able to estimate effectively the intensity of\r\nlong-range dependence. The purpose of this research is to develop a\r\nnew methodology to achieve this goal. It is wavelet-based and hence\r\ninsensitive to the effects of trends and other deviations from the\r\nmodel.\r\n",
