 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many optimization problems are NP-hard, and computing approximate solutions is an attractive way \r\nto cope with NP-hardness. The effort to understand the approximation properties of NP problems has \r\noccupied the center stage of theoretical computer science in the past decade. Despite many successes in this field,  the status of some of the basic problems ---- metric tsp,  vertex cover, graph coloring, sparsest cut etc.---is still open. The project consists of  designing new approaches for computing approximate solutions to these problems.  Any results for these central problems should generalize to many other problems.\r\nThe tools used involve sophisticated geometric arguments, and  \"lift and project\" technique from polyhedral combinatorics. Another goal is to develop a comprehensive framework for designing approximation algorithms without relying  on semidefinite programming (SDP). Many recent approximation algorithms\r\nuse  SDP, which is not particularly efficient in practice. The goal in this project is to replace  SDP with simpler algorithms based upon eigenvalue computations. Another aspect of the project is to prove lowerbounds to complement any new algorithms, or  to  rule out the existence of some of the above algorithms. The  lowerbounds attempted would be both for all polynomial-time algorithms ---this would \r\nuse PCPs---and for specific algorithms arising from lift and project methods. (The latter consists of \r\nviewing lift and project methods as a weak computational model.) \r\n\r\nBroader impact of this project include dissemination efforts such as new innovative courses in graduate and \r\nundergraduate education, new text book, and  survey articles on current research.",
