 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interplay between information theory (IT) and computer science (CS)\r\ndates back to the founding father of information theory, Claude E.\r\nShannon. Ever since Shannon's work on both information theory and\r\ncomputer science, the research in the interplay between IT and CS has\r\ncontinued and expanded in many exciting ways.  In 2003 the first NSF\r\nsponsored Workshop on the IT and CS Interface was held in Chicago,\r\nwhile in 2004 a graduate course on analytic methods in information\r\ntheory and analysis of algorithms was organized at MSRI, Berkeley.  We\r\nbuild on this momentum and propose to work on  problems of information\r\ntheory, combinatorics, and analysis of algorithms.  Following Knuth's\r\nand Hadamard's precept, we study such problems using techniques of\r\ncomplex analysis.  This program, which applies complex-analytic tools\r\nto information theory, constitutes ``analytic information theory''.\r\n\r\nThis research is focused on some facets of source coding, such as the\r\nredundancy rate problem, method of types, entropy evaluation, channel\r\ncapacity, and joint channel-source coding.  The redundancy rate problem\r\nfor a class of sources is the determination of how far the actual code\r\nlength exceeds the optimal (ideal) code length, while the method of\r\ntypes is a powerful technique in information theory, large deviations,\r\nand analysis of algorithms.  It is argued that counting types can be\r\naccomplished efficiently by enumerating Eulerian paths (Markov types)\r\nor binary trees with a given path length (universal types). Likewise,\r\nanalysis of the redundancy rate problem for memoryless and Markov\r\nsources leads us to interesting generating functions such as tree\r\ngenerating functions (e.g., arising in counting labeled rooted trees),\r\nwhich  are studied extensively in computer science.\r\n",
