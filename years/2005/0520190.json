 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create new knowledge on the design, analysis, and optimization of novel system architectures, network protocols, and software algorithms for building robust communication networks.  Examples of such networks include survivable next-generation optical wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) backbone networks that can (1) accommodate connections of diverse bandwidth granularities and diverse path lengths in case of multi-path provisioning, and (2) protect against multiple network failures, including network-area disasters.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Impact: The project has three major research components, as outlined below.\r\n\r\nFirst, the project will study the problem of differentiated protection services in mesh networks. Noting that different connections may have different service-level agreements (SLAs) on their availabilities, the objective is to select a proper protection mechanism (e.g., dedicated or shared or no protection at all) to cost-effectively provision a connection request to meet its SLA.\r\n\r\nSecond, the project will investigate survivable multi-path provisioning. Specifically, new protection and provisioning strategies will be designed to exploit emerging inverse-multiplexing technologies in networks such as Next-Generation SONET/SDH. By splitting up and provisioning a connection over multiple paths through inverse multiplexing, one can achieve degraded service even in case of (multiple) failures (vs. no service at all as in present mode of operation of networks).\r\n\r\nThird, the project will investigate the problem of reprovisioning protection bandwidth. In particular, the investigators will study backup reprovisioning to handle multiple concurrent failures, which means that a new failure occurs before a previous failure is repaired.  Such backup reprovisioning strategies can lead to more efficient use of the bandwidth resources that are needed to protect against network failures.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The approaches and results of this project can have much broader applicability, e.g., bandwidth provisioning in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and other networks. Besides enhancing the national educational infrastructure through student training, this project is expected to have a strong influence on the telecom industry, with which the PIs have a close working relationship. Thus, research results from this project can help to improve the robustness of the national (and global) communication infrastructure, with all the attendant benefits.\r\n",
