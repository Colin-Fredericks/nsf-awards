 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I research project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting a novel nanomagnetic paste for the next generation of ultrahigh DC-to-DC converters for miniaturized electronic applications. Current DC-to-DC converters are the major impediment for miniaturization of electronic components, due to conventional microsized magnetic materials can only be used effectively at low frequencies, while at high frequencies (>1 MHz) there is a significant core loss due to the intrinsic eddy current loss associated with conventional microsized magnetic materials. This work will promote the understanding of nanomagnetics and their applications as ultrahigh frequency embedded inductors in power electronics. Such embedded inductors are expected to possess high inductance, low core loss, and can be operated at ultrahigh frequencies. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed technology is the possibility of developing highly efficient, small size, ultralow loss inductive components for critically needed miniaturized electronics and the telecommunication industry. The anticipated benefits/ potential commercial applications of the proposed magnetic nanocomposite paste will meet this particular need by promoting inductor component working frequency to over 400 MHz or higher with very low losses, enabling device miniaturization as well as low temperature electronic fabrication processes.\r\n",
