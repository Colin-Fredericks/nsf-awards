 "awd_abstract_narration": "Towards a high resolution, three-component velocity field for the central Andes\r\n\r\nThis study will use space geodetic measurements (GPS and InSAR) to\r\ncreate a high spatial resolution, three-component map of crustal\r\nvelocity in the central Andes during the past decade.  The primary\r\ngoal is to image possible along-strike variations in the inter-seismic\r\ndeformation field.  While the inter-seismic deformation field is\r\ninteresting in its own right, and can be used to determine which parts\r\nof the subduction interface are locked (and might rupture in future\r\nearthquakes), the objective is to model this deformation so that it\r\ncan be removed. This study seeks to isolate subtle low-amplitude\r\ndeformation, including: 1) Bulk post-seismic relaxation following\r\nrecent subduction zone earthquakes. 2) Aseismic motion on shallow\r\ncrustal faults related to long-term mountain-building. 3) Magma\r\nmovements in deep sub-crustal reservoirs and at low rates in shallow\r\nchambers.  This study will use methods similar to those of previous\r\nstudies (e.g., Peltzer et al., 2001, Wright et al., 2001), but will\r\nincrease the amount of data and spatial coverage by 1-2 orders of\r\nmagnitude, from the 10's of scenes of InSAR data used in previous\r\nstudies to nearly 1000 scenes.\r\n\r\nThis study will help to better characterize hazards from earthquakes\r\nin two different environments -- subduction zones and within the\r\ncontinents.  This project will also extend our previous surveys of\r\nhundreds of volcanoes for active deformation that could indicate\r\nmagmatic movements and the need for further assessment of eruptive\r\nhazard.  The software that will be developed in this study will become\r\npublicly available. This study will involve the training of graduate\r\nand undergraduate students, and will support an early career\r\nscientist.\r\n",
