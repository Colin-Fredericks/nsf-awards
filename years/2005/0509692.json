 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will determine the performance and operating specifications for a new laser spectrometer suitable for detection of trace moisture at semiconductor process tools. Trace moisture contamination has an adverse, costly, effect on semiconductor manufacturing yields. The sensor will be about the size of a can of soda and provide single digit parts-per-billion (ppb) sensitivity in a few seconds, 0.25 ppb in under a minute. The estimated price point with volume production will be a factor of four to five lower than present trace moisture sensors. The fully developed rugged prototypes will be suitable for detection of moisture in a variety of toxic, corrosive or inert process gases. The significantly improved price point will enable semiconductor manufacturers to deploy the sensors on each process tool throughout the manufacturing facility. \r\n\r\nIf successful this project will reduce the cost of manufacturing microelectronic semiconductor chips. The basic technology shall extend to other trace gas detection applications including biomedical breath diagnosis. Additional applications abound in detection of trace environmental species important to health, occupational safety, and global warming. The performance and price point of the proposed sensor will enable widespread distribution to scientific researchers in various fields of discovery. \r\n",
