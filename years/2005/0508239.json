Decca\r\n\r\nThis proposal will characterize the interaction between two nanocrystals. These nanocrystals are made of CdSe, a semiconductor. Each one of the nanocrystals behave as an \"artificial atom\", where its properties can be controlled by changing its properties. In particular, the discrete energy levels that electrons can take in the nanocrystals are strongly affected by their size. This project will deal with how an \"artificial molecule\" forms, by studying the interaction of two such nanocrystals. Although these interactions have been studied either in ensembles of nanocrystals or between two nanocrystals fixed in space, the novelty of this work is mainly associated with the fact that the separation between the two nanocrystals can be varied and controlled. In this way the dependence of the interaction with respect to the separation can be investigated. \r\n\r\nThis study is important to achieve a complete characterization of the nanoparticles, the effect of non-uniformities on their properties and on their interactions. This is, in turn, important for the implementation of these particles in more advanced systems, as fluorescent markers and even in potential quantum computers.\r\n",
