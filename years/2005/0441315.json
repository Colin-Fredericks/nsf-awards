 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine feasibility of developing a new general-purpose software technology and toolkit for computer-aided engineering (CAE).  The unique feature of this technology is the ability to perform engineering analysis and simulation directly from the native geometric models created by scientists and engineers, while avoiding the usual difficulties associated with finite element meshing and other types of spatial discretizations.  The patented technology was conceived as part of NSF-funded research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and has already been tested on several applications.  The key link between geometric and analysis information is a parameterization of engineering problems in terms of distance fields that can be constructed automatically from virtually all geometric models.  The approach is theoretically sound and has been experimentally tested on a variety of problems.  Intact Solutions seeks to determine the feasibility of constructing a general-purpose software toolkit that would be seamlessly integrated with a widely available commercial geometric toolkit.  If successful, the project would result in next generation tools for analysis and simulation of scientific and engineering field problems with unprecedented levels of automation and flexibility.\r\n\r\nIntact Solutions addressed one of the most challenging aspects and fundamental limitations of computer-aided engineering.  By all accounts, representation conversions, and meshing in particular, dominate most modeling activities and limit productivity, necessitating substantial human, computer, and real costs.  The proffered technology has the potential of alleviating existing barriers in computer-aided engineering and of opening doors to new products and services.  Prototype two-dimensional software for thermal modeling, plate vibrations, and experimental fully automated Internet analysis service are demonstrated at the home page of Intact Solutions at http://www.meshfree.com.  A commercial strategy will incorporate and market the developed  technology as part of the most popular and widely available commercial geometric toolkit, Parasolid.",
