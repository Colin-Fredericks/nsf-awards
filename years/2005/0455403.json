 "awd_abstract_narration": "ACM's Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) is funded to provide guidance and recommendations on the future of computer science in US schools.  They will assemble a panel of US and international curriculum development experts in the field of computer science.  The panel meets during a special session at the 2005 National Educational Computing Conference (June, 2005).  In addition to the US experts, participants from Canada, South Africa, Israel and Mexico are participating as representatives of countries that have focused efforts to formalize the computer science curriculum.  The goal of the panel is to use the insights and experiences of the participants to build frameworks and recommendations to guide current and future development of CS materials in the US.  The panel's dialogue will be transcribed, published and widely disseminated as a white paper development of curriculum materials.",
