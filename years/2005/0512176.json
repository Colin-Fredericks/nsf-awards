 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops a class of efficient and accurate numerical\r\nmethods for the unsteady viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes\r\nequations (NSE) based a new unconstrained formulation of NSE with\r\nfully dissipation in contrast to the traditional formulation where the\r\nStokes operator is dissipative only in the divergence free\r\nfields. This class of NSE solver is unconditionally stable with\r\nexplicit treatment of both pressure and convection terms. Moreover, in\r\nthis class of finite element methods, there is no requirement of the\r\nso called inf-sup condition. The cost of solving NSE is greatly\r\nreduced to solving a standard heat equation and a standard Poisson\r\nequation at each time step for general three dimensional fluid problems.\r\nThe simplicity of the method also enable the PI to develop a class of\r\nnumerical methods for complex fluids such as magneto-hydrodynamics,\r\nliquid crystal polymers, geodynamo, climate modeling, and large eddy\r\nturbulence simulations;\r\n\r\n\r\nComputational Fluid Dynamics has grown from a mathematical curiosity\r\nto become an essential tool in almost every branch of fluid dynamics,\r\nfrom aerospace propulsion to weather prediction and has received\r\nextensive attention throughout the international community since the\r\nadvent of the digital computer.  The accuracy and efficiency of the\r\nproposed schemes will allow us to simulate general three-dimensional\r\ntime-dependent flows with a reasonable turn-over time.  It is expected\r\nthat the proposed fast algorithms will become an important tool for\r\nmany scientists and engineers in numerous scientific and industrial\r\napplications of current interest.\r\n",
