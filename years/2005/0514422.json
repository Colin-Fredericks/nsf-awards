 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL EXPLANATION\r\nThis proposal seeks funds to continue the development of a novel analytical technique for\r\ncharacterizing the organization of anisotropic nanostructures (e.g. lamellae and cylinders)\r\nin optically transparent block copolymer thin films. Quantitative measurement of\r\norganization is critical for many proposed applications of nanotechnology, ranging from\r\nfuel cells to optoelectronic devices. GWDLS allows the low-cost, non-destructive, realtime\r\nmeasurement of order formation and defect density in optically transparent thin\r\nfilms. Among methods for thin-film characterization, GWDLS is unique in that it\r\nprovides an average measure of defect density over macroscopic length scales (~1 cm) in\r\na film. Position-space methods for studying defect structure, such as atomic force\r\nmicroscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), can measure local defect\r\nstructure, but are impractical for obtaining statistical averages over macroscopic regions.\r\nThe GWDLS technique involves the coupling of a laser beam into a guided mode of a\r\nplanar optical waveguide consisting of a block copolymer film deposited on a low\r\nrefractive index substrate. Light coupled into a guided mode propagates through the film\r\nby total internal reflection. As the light interacts with anisotropic grains in the film, it\r\ngenerates depolarized scattered light which propagates in guided modes with orthogonal\r\npolarization. This scattered light is coupled out of the film and detected. In the proposed\r\nwork, we will (1) Modify the current GWDLS apparatus to study the propagation of\r\npolarized light in a symmetric silica-polymer-silica sample environment using a grating\r\ncoupler. (2) Develop a theoretical model for quantifying the relationship between the\r\nGWDLS signal and statistical properties of randomly oriented and partially oriented\r\ngrains in thin films. (3) Use GWDLS to determine the order-disorder transition\r\ntemperature of block copolymer thin films with both lamellar and cylindrical order. (4)\r\nMeasure the kinetics of order formation in thin films after quenching from the disordered\r\nto the ordered state. (5) Obtain a quantitative measure of the average grain size by\r\ncomparing the measured signal with theoretical predictions. All of the polymers and\r\nsubstrates required for the project will be prepared by the students. Complete\r\ncharacterization of the films using complementary techniques such as AFM, SEM, and\r\nSIMS will be carried out.                                                                                                                                        \r\nNON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION\r\nBalsara will serve as a faculty instructor in the Math and Science Summer Academy\r\nwhich brings approximately 60 students from local high schools to the University campus\r\nto participate in a six-week enrichment program in math and science. Typically half of\r\nthe participants are African American, one quarter Chicano, and the remaining quarter\r\nAsian, Caucasian, Filipino and Latino. Garetz will continue his 7-year involvement with\r\nPolytechnic University's David Packard Center for Technology and Educational\r\nAlliances. His activities include conducting workshops at the New York City\r\nScience/Technology Forum where 500 students from New York City public schools\r\ncome to Poly for a full-day program where they meet outstanding engineers and\r\ntechnologists representing centers of higher education, hospitals, and corporations. The\r\ngraduate students working on this project will receive multidisciplinary scientific training\r\nencompassing synthesis and characterization of polymers, optics, lithography, and nonequilibrium\r\nthermodynamics. Their background in characterization and manipulating\r\nnanostructured thin films is relevant for current and future technologies.",
