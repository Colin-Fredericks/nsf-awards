 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research project involves a pilot study to conduct a  comparative ethnobotanical survey of the medicinal flora of the Mopan and Q'eqchi' Maya of Southern Belize. \r\nThe World Health Organization estimates that two-thirds of \r\nthe world's populations rely on plant based medicines for their primary health care. \r\nHowever, to date there is relatively little research on the interaction between cultural knowledge \r\nand use of medicinal plants in relation to the biophysical environment, in a \r\ncomparative perspective. The main premise of this research is that the Mopan and \r\nQ'eqchi' Maya have an in-depth, widely distributed, empirically based knowledge of medicinal plant ecology. What is poorly understood is the relation of the biophysical environment to these two ethnobotanical and ethnomedical systems and how they relate to each other. This project seeks to understand both knowledge and behavior with regards to medicinal plants and how variation across communities and cultures occurs.\r\nBroader Impacts: This research provides a framework to develop a long-term\r\neducation and research project that actively incorporates graduate students in\r\nanthropology and other disciplines; actively recruit indigenous students to the graduate\r\nprogram at the University of Florida; to contribute to an major initiative to\r\ninternationalize the University of Florida; to strengthen educational initiatives in Belize\r\nat the secondary, undergraduate and graduate levels; and to enhance collaborations across\r\ndisciplines. Additionally, it will build on existing collaborations between the University\r\nof Florida and international partner institutions in Belize and also establish new\r\nrelationships. The results will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific\r\nunderstanding, both in interdisciplinary publications and through outreach activities that\r\nintegrate research with education.\r\n",
