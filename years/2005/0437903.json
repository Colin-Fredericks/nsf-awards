This is an annual summer school held in Boulder, Colorado, at the University of Colorado, whose goal is to bridge the gap between graduate training and research by providing advanced graduate students and beginning postdoctoral researchers access to specialized training not readily available through graduate programs that may have limited resources.  The School is also intended to foster a sense of community among junior researchers and, over time, to develop via on-line lecture notes, an educational resource for the community.\r\n\r\nSchools typically run for four weeks in July each year and utilize facilities provided by the University of Colorado.  Each school has about sixty students and twenty lecturers.  Lectures expose the students to a wide range of subjects in forefront condensed matter and materials physics; topics that are often not available at students' home institutions.  Underrepresented students are always in attendance, as well as a number of international students.\r\n%%%\r\n This grant supports the Boulder School for Condensed Matter and Materials Physics.
