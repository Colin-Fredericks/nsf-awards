 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dry tropical deciduous forests found in the Yucatan Peninsula are some of the most threatened ecosystems in the world, yet very little is known about these systems.  The Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico is subject to rapid change because of strong urban pressure, making the availability of fresh water and conservation of natural areas priorities.  The scientific goal of this study is to develop an understanding of how water acquisition patterns of different tree species influence the above and belowground structure and function of these ecosystems. Another significant goal of this research is to provide meaningful international research opportunities for undergraduate students from the United States. \r\n\tThe United Nations' Millennium Ecosystem Assessment released in May 2005 emphasized the importance of understanding the structure, functions, and benefits of threatened ecosystems around the world.  Results from this study will help scientists understand how tropical dry deciduous forests function, as well as which tree species should be used for reforestation. Moreover, our next generation of scientists will acquire hands-on research experience using some of the most modern approaches to answering questions in biology today (stable isotopes and DNA techniques) while at the same time having an opportunity to expand their worldview.  \r\n",
