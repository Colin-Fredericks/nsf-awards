 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problem statement Quantum information theory, the quantum extension of Shannon's classi-\r\ncal information theory, has experienced a surge of interest and rapid technical advance over the past\r\nten years, largely in response to the development of quantum-mechanically based cryptographic\r\nprotocols and algorithms for quantum computing. Very recent work by the Principal Investigator\r\nand collaborators has led to a \\grand unification\" in the two-user setting, and much is now under-\r\nstood about the interplay between the plethora of quantum information processing resources such\r\nas quantum channels, entanglement and classical communication. As progress in the field has been\r\nhitherto guided by experiences from the classical theory, the next natural step is to investigate the\r\nquantum extensions of classical network (or multi-user) information theory. We propose a number\r\nof problems in quantum network information theory, including quantum versions of distributed\r\ncompression, coding for multiple-access channels, broadcast channels and channels with state in-\r\nformation, and channel simulation with side information. Preliminary investigations indicate that\r\nmany of the methods used in quantum two-user information theory apply to the multi-user setting,\r\nwhile revealing interesting new behaviour. Moreover, solutions to certain two-user problems may\r\nbe interpreted in stunning new ways as solutions to long sought after multi-user ones.\r\nIntellectual merit This research will contribute to both quantum information theory and clas-\r\nsical network information theory. Multi-user scenarios shed new light on the properties of quantum\r\ninformation, in particular i) the ways in which two independent sources of quantum information\r\nmay be used, despite their delicate nature, to decode each other; ii) the ways in which a distributed\r\nquantum source may be localized. On the other hand, \\quantizing\" classical results has hitherto\r\nlead to several new techniques and re-interpretations of the classical theory.\r\nBroader impact This research will contribute to developing links between network information\r\ntheory and quantum mechanics. On a more practical level, due to the traditional connection\r\nbetween quantumness and privacy, network quantum information theory bears relevance to multi-\r\nuser quantum cryptography. There is perhaps only a handful of experts in quantum information\r\ntheory currently in the US; the way to improve this it through education. The funding of this\r\nproposal would enable the training of PhD students in this area, and facilitate the introduction\r\nof this new material into the University of Southern California course curriculum. The Principal\r\nInvestigator is developing a course on quantum information theory to be ordered in Fall 2005,\r\ncovering topics not ordered at any other US university. He is also writing a book with co-authors\r\nA. Winter and P. Hayden entitled \\Principles of Quantum Information Theory\".\r\n",
