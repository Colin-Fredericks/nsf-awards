 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU program is a partnership of researchers at the University of Hawaii at Hilo (UHH) and government agencies conducting research on the Island of Hawaii (e.g., USGS-Biological Resources Division, US Forest Service).  The Island of Hawaii, with its diversity and high representation of almost all ecological niches found in the archipelago, presents an excellent living laboratory in which to train future researchers. The goal of this REU program is to provide an exciting and challenging summer research experience for undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary field of conservation biology and prepare them for future careers in science. To increase the diversity of students entering this field, this program targets those students with limited research experience, first generation college students and under-represented minorities in science due to ethnicity and geographic isolation. The program entails a summer component and a continued effort during the academic year. Ten students will be selected for 10-week research experiences during the summer. The program will begin with a one-week orientation that will introduce the students to the university, research design and analysis, and report writing and presentation.  The remaining nine weeks will consist of students working side by side with researchers on their projects. In addition, one day a week will involve lectures and field trips focused on different topics in conservation biology, sessions on statistics, report writing and presentation, and graduate school and career presentations. Students will complete a written research paper and make an oral presentation at the undergraduate research symposium.
