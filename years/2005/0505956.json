Strikingly, LSB galaxies appear to be dark matter dominated, making them an excellent probe of the dark matter distribution, and especially of the steep inner cusp predicted by simulations of the lambda-cold dark matter model, which is (arguably) not seen in the observations.  This lack of a consensus about the cusp-core problem has created an enormous demand for more and better data, which this research will provide.  The work will also address some related issues, notably extending the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation to lower mass galaxies.\r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to a continuing and extensive outreach program, including popular articles and lectures, activities in schools with students predominantly from under-represented communities, and support for graduate and undergraduate students, similarly emphasizing under-represented groups.",
