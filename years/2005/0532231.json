 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators collect new data and develop new analysis methods to measure and study various dimensions of polarization in social networks in the United States.  This project extends the theory and practice of ``How many X's do you know'' surveys as a means of studying relations between social connections and social and political attitudes.\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread perception that American society is becoming more heterogeneous along social, economic, and political dimensions. The investigators develop new methodology to test the extent to which this is true by applying new statistical methods to study patterns of interaction in the United States. The data are collected through the General Social Survey and assess the size of social networks and the level of social integration in the United States based on patterns of acquaintance, friendship and trusting relationships. The investigators use these data to analyze the social and demographic predictors of having a social network that bridges across race, religion, income, and political ideology. By doing so, this work will also enhance  research in network analysis by making new data and data collection instruments available and by proposing new methods for analyzing these data.\r\n",
