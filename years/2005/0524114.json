 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vortex rings and filaments are very fundamental and important objects in nature, manifest on scales from a few billionth of a meter to galactic dimensions. The breadth of the field is large and it spans a wide of range of disciplines such as mechanical, chemical, and aerospace engineering, applied mathematics and physics.  A meeting to discuss latest research advances in Vortex rings, Filaments, and Quantum Turbulence will be held at The Abdus Salam International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, Italy from June 6-10, 2005.  The purpose of this conference is to bring together experts, junior researchers, and students from various disciplines that work in this field, and set a course of further research particularly for younger researchers. This award provides partial support for this conference.  NSF funds will be used to support US participants, particularly graduate students, post doctoral researchers, and junior faculty members who would not otherwise be able to attend.",
