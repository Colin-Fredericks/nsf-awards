 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with the asymptotic enumeration of tilings of \r\nlattice regions with holes. More specifically, using work of Fisher and \r\nStephenson as its starting point, it studies the interaction of the holes \r\nwhen all the leftover portion is tiled, via a certain averaging over all \r\nsuch possible tilings, called the joint correlation of the holes. In \r\nearlier work, the proposer proved that the case of triangular holes on the \r\ntriangular lattice is governed, for large separations between the holes, \r\nby a law closely resembling the superposition principle of electrostatics, \r\nwhere holes correspond to charges of magnitude equal to the difference \r\nbetween the number of unit triangles of each orientation they enclose. In \r\nthe current project, the proposer presents a program of research problems \r\nthat extend his previous work in some new, interrelated directions. One of \r\nthese problems concerns generalizing the superposition principle for \r\ncorrelation to the case when the holes can be arbitrary (not necessarily \r\nconnected) unions of lattice triangles of side two. Another problem \r\nconsiders a finer analysis of the correlation, namely the study of its \r\nvariation under small displacements of individual holes. The proposer \r\nconjectures that these finer changes are also governed by a superposition \r\nprinciple, analogous to the superposition principle for the electric field \r\nin electrostatics. A third problem is concerned with studying boundary \r\neffects. Besides the core research program outlined above, the proposer \r\nalso intends to study the symmetry classes of perfect matchings of a \r\ncertain family of graphs on the lattice determined by the tiling of the \r\nplane by squares, regular hexagons and regular dodecagons, and determine \r\nto what degree a parallel he found between the perfect matchings of these \r\ngraphs and the intensively studied plane partitions extends when \r\nconsidering the action of symmetry groups.\r\n\r\nThis research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of \r\nCombinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete \r\ncollections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems \r\nis extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design \r\nof large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the \r\ndesign of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of \r\nobjects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. The specific \r\nproblems in this project are instances of the dimer model of statistical \r\nphysics.  A basic illustration of this is the real-world process (relevant \r\nto the study of of lubricants) of adsorption of a liquid, consisting of \r\ntwo-atom molecules---the dimers in the model---along the surface of a \r\ncrystal, whose fixed atoms form a lattice pattern, with any two \r\nneighboring positions capable of holding one molecule, and any given \r\ncrystal atom being involved in the adsorption of at most one molecule. The \r\nmain issue in this setting is the asymptotic behavior of the quantities \r\nthat are studied (speciffically, the number of different ways the surface \r\nof the crystal can be covered by molecules). In some of the instances we \r\nencounter, the usually more difficult problem of determining quantities \r\nexactly turns out to allow progress in the asymptotic study.\r\n",
