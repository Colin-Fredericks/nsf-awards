 "awd_abstract_narration": "The solution of large systems of linear equations remains one of\r\nthe main bottlenecks in many numerical simulations throughout\r\ncomputational science and engineering. Despite much recent progress,\r\nthere is still a great need for improved iterative solvers in such\r\nareas as fluid dynamics, radiation transport, magnetohydrodynamics,\r\nimage processing, computational mechanics, acoustics, and so forth.\r\nThe increasingly important area of data mining and information\r\nretrieval also makes heavy use of sparse matrix techniques and\r\nnecessitates reliable and scalable algorithms for linear equations \r\nand eigenvalue problems. The PI will investigate efficient iterative\r\nsolvers with a focus on preconditioning techniques for nonsymmetric \r\nand indefinite problems. The PI proposes to use a blend of algebraic \r\nand problem-specific techniques to construct robust and scalable\r\nsolvers for linear systems arising from discretizations of problems\r\nfrom fluid dynamics and radiation transport, as well as for solving\r\nlarge sparse complex symmetric systems and for computing the stationary\r\nvector of Markov chains.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of research in computational mathematics is to\r\nprovide scientists and engineers the algorithmic and software tools\r\nneeded for the solution of challenging scientific and technical problems\r\nof increasing size and complexity. The competitiveness of American science\r\nand technology greatly benefits from (and to a large extent depends on)\r\nthe creation of innovative computational methods and software and by \r\nthe continuous improvement of existing techniques. Progress in the solution\r\nof the problems targeted by the PI will have a positive impact on science\r\nand engineering by enabling faster and more detailed computer simulations.\r\nIn addition, several graduate students (and possibly a few undergraduates)\r\nwill be impacted by this research either through direct involvement, or\r\nthrough the positive effects this research will have on the PI's teaching\r\nof computational and applied mathematics courses at Emory University.\r\n",
