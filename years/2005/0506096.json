 "awd_abstract_narration": "With NSF support through the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), the University of the Virgin Islands will enhance the quality of their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics instructional and outreach programs as a means to increase participation in the Nation's STEM workforce. Project objectives include increasing the number and percentage of students that persist in STEM majors by increasing academic support and opportunities early in the students' academic careers; paying special attention to at-risk students; strengthening the undergraduate STEM curriculum through development of interdisciplinary major; and, integration of interdisciplinary research experiences.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The proposed project will optimize their institutional characteristics as a small, teaching university and build on the strength of its faculty to create strong interdisciplinary programs that encompass research and curriculum development.  At the same time, the project will pay close attention to the first two years of the student's career and provide the necessary support to ensure the persistence of science and mathematics majors, especially among students who are most at risk for attrition. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This project will develop a model for interdisciplinary collaborations in research and curriculum particularly suitable for small teaching institutions.  Through cross-disciplinary links and links to larger universities and laboratories, the awardee institution will create an exemplary program that will provide sustainable research experiences for students and a fulfilling research environment for faculty.\r\n",
