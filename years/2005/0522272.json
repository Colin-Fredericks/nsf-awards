 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will develop highly miniaturized power converters by developing a functional, scaled-down hardware prototype of a high-temperature multichip power module (MCPM). To achieve this goal, the company has taken advantages of the key benefits of silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors  which include high-temperature operation, high switching frequencies, low switching losses, and high power densities. While Phase I of the project was focused upon successfully proving the feasibility of high-temperature MCPM's, Phase II will be focused on developing full prototype modules. The Phase II project will further develop high-temperature packaging techniques and investigate long term reliability issues associated with high-temperature operation. At the conclusion of Phase II, the company will deliver two high-temperature MCPM modules. The first prototype delivery will be a fully functional 4-hp 3-phase motor drive MCPM capable of 250 degrees C operation, and the second prototype will be a 30 kW 3-phase motor drive that demonstrates an order of magnitude miniaturization over modern state-of-the-art silicon based systems. Since current silicon electronics are typically limited to approximately 150 degrees C maximum temperature of operation, the high-temperature research proposed in this project has the potential to greatly enhance scientific understanding of high-temperature failure mechanisms, thermal induced electronic packaging stresses, and long-term interconnect reliability issues, in addition to technical advancement of state-of-the-art power electronics systems. \r\n\r\nThe commercialization of SiC based MCPM's has the potential to find benefit in nearly every electric motor drive, power supply, or power converter conceivable. The application of such MCPM's could save electrical energy consumption worldwide, due to the improved electrical efficiency of SiC power switches alone. Furthermore, an immediate commercialization application is possible in the development of high-temperature geological petroleum exploration instrumentation and  also in industrial motors.  Other long term benefits would be found with application to complex weight critical power systems (such as in spacecraft), high-temperature systems (such as fuel cell electronics or electric vehicle motors), and other high efficiency power systems.\r\n",
