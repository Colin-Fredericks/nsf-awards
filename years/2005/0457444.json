 "awd_abstract_narration": "REPRESENTATION THEORY OF INFINITE DIMENSIONAL LIE\r\nALGEBRAS AND QUANTUM FIELD THEORY\r\nIGOR FRENKEL\r\nAbstract\r\nThe proposal is dedicated to the development of three interrelated areas in the\r\nrepresentation theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their applications to\r\nquantum field theory (QFT). The first part of the proposal is focused on the vertex\r\noperator algebra structure of a modification of regular representations of affine Lie\r\nalgebras. The author plans to prove, in particular, his conjecture that the zeroth\r\nsemi-infinite cohomology of the reduced vertex operator algebra yields the famous\r\nVerlinde algebra of the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model of 2 dimensional QFT.\r\nThe second part of the proposal consists of a cohomological and K-theoretic realization\r\nof various algebraic constructions of the first part by means of 4 dimensional\r\nclassical Yang-Mills theory. The author proposes to use the geometric construction\r\ndue to Nakajima of representations of affine Lie algebras based on Yang-Mills\r\ninstantons on asymptotically locally Euclidean spaces, and also a new geometric\r\nconstruction related to the first one by the level-rank duality discovered by the\r\nauthor in the algebraic context in his earlier work. Finally, the third part is dedicated\r\nto a new direction in the representation theory of 3 dimensional convolution\r\nand current algebras presently developed by the author. It is based on a new noncommutative\r\ngeometry of quantum Minkowski space-time recently introduced by\r\nJardim and the author in their study of a noncommutative version of the Yang-\r\nMills theory. The three parts of the proposal are related to each other in that they\r\nconstitute a new program: a representation theoretic approach to 4 dimensional\r\nQFT. This is a far reaching extension of the representation theoretic approach to\r\n2 dimensional QFT previously developed by the author and other mathematicians\r\nand mathematical physicists.\r\nThe proposal is devoted to problems at the frontiers of modern representation\r\ntheory: the field of mathematics that studies symmetries and their realizations.\r\nBy its nature representation theory underlies and unifies the structures of diverse\r\nareas in mathematics and physics, and in the past 25 years the author has made a\r\nnumber of important contributions to this field. The present proposal contains a\r\nnew program of development for the representation theory of infinite dimensional\r\nsymmetries which is especially relevant to the most advanced part of the existing\r\ntheoretical physics that is supported by experimental physics; namely, 4 dimensional\r\nquantum field theory. Progress in this direction will enrich our understanding of\r\nthe fundamental mathematical structures that lie at the foundation of the physical\r\nuniverse.\r\n",
