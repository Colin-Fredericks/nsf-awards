 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subarctic coastal communities today face natural and human induced changes in the environment and in access to critical food resources.  How well these communities can adapt is both constrained and facilitated by engagement in local and global social, political, and economic networks.  Understanding the complexity of these interactions is critical to the effective management of human response to change in the subarctic and elsewhere.  This research project will bring together an interdisciplinary team of American, Japanese, and Russian scholars and students to examine the 5,000-year history of human-environmental interactions along the Kuril Island chain in the northwest Pacific.  Evidence of human colonization, persistence and abandonment at various times in the past five millennia and under different social, economic, and technological regimes will be used to study human vulnerability and resilience to both catastrophic and gradual environmental changes, including human-induced changes.  The project's primary objectives include (1) understanding feedbacks among climate, sea ice, marine and terrestrial ecology, and human activity; (2) estimating the degree of human vulnerability to catastrophic events and their ecological consequences at different spatial and temporal scales; and (3) assessing the role of cultural variables both in influencing community survival and affecting environmental changes.  These objectives will be tackled through an ecologically integrated study of archaeological and historic records of human settlement and abandonment; geologic evidence of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis; paleoecologic and oceanographic evidence of past vegetation and marine conditions; and climatological evidence of past temperature, sea ice, and storminess.  Evidence collected in the field over three summers will be used to test and calibrate agent-based computer models and simulations.  Numerical models will be run to detect the most critical social, ecological, and physical variables affecting human resilience and vulnerability.  The project will include education and outreach partnerships with indigenous Ainu communities in Hokkaido, Japan; the development of secondary school education kits and interactive computer simulations through the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture at the University of Washington; and the participation of undergraduate and graduate students throughout the project.\r\n\r\nThis study will make significant contributions to understanding the complexity of coupled human and natural systems.  The research will advance the theory of human ecological dynamics and of the ways social and technological variables buffer or aggravate human vulnerability to unpredictable ecological changes and catastrophic events.  This project will develop new modeling tools to facilitate interdisciplinary integration and understanding.  It will provide models that can be adapted to other contexts and modern conditions where coastal communities appear particularly vulnerable to environmental and social factors beyond their control.  More generally, this research will provide tools in the form of model prototypes that can be adapted to many different regions where human-environmental dynamics are complex.  This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Kuril Biocomplexity Project focused on the Kuril Island chain linking Hokkaido Japan and Kamchatka, Russia.  It was initiated to study the interrelationship between human settlement history, the frequency, intensity, and timing of natural hazard events, and the ecological consequences of human settlement, natural hazards, and oceanographic and climate changes.  American, Japanese, and Russian archaeologists, geologists, ecologists, oceanographers and climate scientists united to understand the coupled natural and human dynamics of the region.  Major ship- and camp-based field expeditions in 2006, 2007, and 2008 (and smaller in 2009 and 2010) provided primary data on the Holocene natural and human history and hypothesized causal dynamics of the coupled human-natural system.  Analyses of primary data was performed at the University of Washington, Idaho State University, Hokkaido University, Hokkai-Gakuen University, Sakhalin Regional Museum, and several institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences Far East Branch.  The large scale and comprehensive approach of the Kuril Biocomplexity Project resulted in major improvements in our understandings of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis, climate change, terrestrial and oceanic ecological dynamics and evolution, human population fluctuation, subsistence, and social networks. Synthesis meetings, comparative analysis and modeling have helped to bring these data to bear on coupled natural human systems.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: We have come to several conclusions through this project 1) Colonization and settlement of the insular central and northern islands commenced in the late Holocene;  population varied over the past 4000 years with two major waves of immigration and sustained occupation followed by abandonment; and economic contacts in Hokkaido and Kamchatka aided island dwellers in mitigating environmental crises.   2) Moderate and major volcanic eruptions occurred throughout the archipelago and through the Holocene.  Throughout the archipelago, eruption history does not appear to have altered the course of human settlement.  One of the peaks of human population corresponds to a millennium of particularly frequent and intense volcanic activity.  Study of the physical and ecological effects of the major explosive eruption of Mt. Sarychev on Matua Island in 2009 showed that geomorphic and ecological impacts can be quite limited and not extend to adjacent islands. Collectively, our research suggests that eruptions rarely impacted multiple islands or would have created insurmountable difficulties for people or biota living beyond the range of local effects. 3) Major seismic events impacted the islands and especially the coastal zones throughout the Holocene.  In late 2006 and early 2007, two earthquakes occurred in the central island region where no historic events had been recorded.  Our teams were able to study the impacts of the resulting tsunamis, which reached 20 meters elevation on coasts close to the earthquake.  Geological evidence proved that Kuril coasts have been subjected to major tsunamis throughout the Holocene.  Even so, the impact on near-shore ecology and human persistence appears minor.  Most archaeological sites were established on terraces more than 30 meters high.  We have no evidence that tsunamis had any appreciable impact on the settlement history. Nevertheless, differences in timing and character would have made tsunamis a significant, unpredictable hazard.  4) Climate change and volcanic eruptions have both impacted terrestrial ecology throughout the islands.  Pollen data from under-lake coring and on-land excavations show major differences between the early and later Holocene, with more subtle changes through the late Holocene.  Cooling in the mid Second Millennium AD may have contributed to human abandonment. 5) Archaeological data on food procurement are patchy. In general the data indicate geographically variable procurement of sea mammals, fis..."
