 "awd_abstract_narration": "EPS 04-47691\r\nUniversity of New Mexico\r\nGosz, James\r\nNew Mexico EPSCoR RII (NM NEW) Proposal\r\n\r\nThe New Mexico EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement plan focuses on two topics of importance to the state and the nation: hydrology and nanoscience.  In hydrology, the goal is for New Mexico to become national and world leader in instrumentation and algorithm development for regional hydrolic modeling and Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation in semi-arid environments.  The project will create a high density ET network with real-time, state-of-the-art instrumentation, integrating with real-time remote imagery and state-of-the-art modeling unmatched in the nation.  In the nanoscience area, New Mexico will establish two research groups.  The nano-water interface group will study the structure and properties of water and aqueous solutions that are confined to or in contact with nanostructured materials.  The knowledge gained will be used to develop improved water purification and sensing methods.  In the nanomaterials energy systems area, investigators will explore how nanomaterials and nanoscale phenomena can be used for energy production, conversion and storage. Participating institutions include:  the University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Eastern New Mexico University, New Mexico Highlands University, Western New Mexico University, and San Juan College.  Collaborations with Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories will benefit from world-class capabilities associated with those facilities.\r\n\r\nAs the nations' first \"minority-as-majority\" state, New Mexico is investing significant resources into an education and outreach component to address the specific challenges faced by the state's rural and minority populations.  New Mexico will build on successful programs and establish new ones to make science education more accessible and attainable and encourage students to graduate from high school and continue on to college.  A variety of activities will increase the skills and knowledge of middle and high school teachers so they can incorporate inquiry-based and locally relevant hydrology and nanoscience experiences into their classrooms.  At the college level, undergraduate student research internships, graduate student support and teacher research internship programs will allow exploration of new research experiences at regional universities and community colleges.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
