 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA program of theoretical and experimental research into the structure, formation and properties of microporous materials will be undertaken. The theoretical work will include the enumeration and classification of periodic topologies and evaluation of strategies for their realization in designed chemical synthesis. This will provide the conceptual basis for design and realization of materials with targeted properties such as sorption and catalysis. Experimental work will be aimed at the synthesis of oxide materials of novel chemical compositions using templated synthetic methods, and to the development of new methods, using X-ray and electron diffraction, of determining problem structures, including those of very porous materials containing a large fraction of disordered guest materials. Essentially, all the research will be performed by undergraduate and graduate students pursuing degrees in chmistry or materials research and will be an essential component of their education in those disciplines. Advanced web-based educational materials in chemical topology and crystal chemistry will be developed. \r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nThe research in this project is aimed at developing the theory of design and developing synthetic methods for preparation of porous materials. Porous materials of this sort (zeolites) are now of very great importance for catalysis and are an key component of the petrochemical industry.  There is a continual need for new materials with specific properties to effect specific reactions converting raw petroleum products to desired chemical compositions. Microporous materials are also now becoming of prime importance for applications such as sequestration of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and for mobile storage media for light fuel gases, such as methane and hydrogen in the next generation power supplies for automobiles and portable electronic devices. The research will particulrly focus on (a) describing the underlying geometry of such materials (b) developing strategies for designed synthesis of materials with targeted properties, and (c) preparation of materials with novel chemical composition. Essentially all the research will be performed by undergraduate and graduate students pursuing degrees in chmistry or materials research and will be an essential component of their education in those disciplines.\r\n",
