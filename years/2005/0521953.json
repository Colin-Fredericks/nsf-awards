 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integer programming is an optimization technique that supports optimal decision making in organizations. Traditionally, it has been successfully applied to strategic planning problems where solution time is not an issue.  The innovation of this research is to extend the applicability to operational and tactical decision making where rapid solution times are necessary.  A key characteristic of problems arising in real-time environments is that consecutive instances typically differ only slightly, indicating a need for technology that supports incremental problem solving.  Further, the algorithms developed will be designed to exploit the computational power and data delivery capabilities of the emerging cyberinfrastructure.  The applicability of the research will be demonstrated in three specific application areas: supply chain management, airline disruption recovery, and radiation therapy treatment planning.\r\n\r\nThe successful development of real-time integer programming technology has huge potential for addressing difficult operational problems.  Its tactical use may dramatically improve airlines' ability to recover from disruptions, significantly enhance the quality of radiation therapy for cancer patients or provide huge economic benefits by increasing the agility of supply chains.  Another high-impact aspect of the research will be its pioneering use of cyberinfrastructure. This proposal will open up new possibilities for the operations research community to exploit the computational, data storage, and communication resources that are now becoming available for use in real-time decision making.  Moreover, the methods and frameworks developed in this research will help to shape how cyberinfrastructure is harnessed to provide decision support in a wide\r\nvariety of application areas.\r\n",
