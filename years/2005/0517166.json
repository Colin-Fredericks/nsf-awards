 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is designed to probe the structure and function of the chlorophyll-binding protein CP 43, which is a component of the photosystem II complex of higher plants, green algae and cyanobacteria.  Photosystem II uses light energy from the sun to drive the splitting of water molecules with release of molecular oxygen to the atmosphere.  Virtually all of the oxygen present in our atmosphere arises from water oxidation by photosystem II.  The CP 43 protein is embedded in the thylakoid membrane; however, it contains several extrinsic loop regions, including the large extrinsic loop E, which protrude from the membrane into the interior (lumen) of the thylakoid and lie close to the site of water oxidation.  Mutagenesis techniques have shown that domains on the lumenal surface of CP43 appear to interact with components of the oxygen-evolving complex, in particular, cytochrome c550 and the inorganic cofactors Ca2+, Cl- and Mn2+.  This project will undertake the expanded characterization of these mutants and the construction and characterization of additional mutations at these sites in order to define the roles of these domains in photosystem II function.  A combination of physiological, biochemical and biophysical techniques will be employed to analyze the mutants. Biochemical methods for analyzing mutants will include measurement of growth rates in media depleted in either Ca2+ or Cl-, measurement of photosynthetic electron transport rates, determination of relative quantum yields for oxygen evolution, determination of photoinactivation rates, assessment of the binding of cytochrome c550 to isolated photosystem II, western blotting and difference spectra to assess photosystem II protein composition. Biophysical methods will focus on analyzing the functional properties of the manganese cluster and will include EPR and FT-IR spectroscopy and measurement of variable fluorescence yields.   Since a very highly resolved crystal structure has not yet been obtained for photosystem II, these studies will provide important information on the exact sites of interaction between the extrinsic proteins and the intrinsic proteins and cofactors required for oxygen evolution.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  It is anticipated that numerous undergraduate and several M.S. students will perform research related to the project.  These students will not only gain research experience in the laboratory, they will also attend and present their work at scientific meetings and appear as authors on manuscripts.  An informal \"exchange\" program with Dr. Alice Haddy (UNC-Greensboro), an expert in EPR spectroscopy of photosystem II, will be initiated.  Students from ECU will visit Dr. Haddy's laboratory in order to learn EPR techniques; while her students will learn the biochemical isolation of histidine-tagged photosystem II at ECU.  This will greatly benefit students from both institutions, as it will allow us to broaden their research experience.",
