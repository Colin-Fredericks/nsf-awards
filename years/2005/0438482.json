By utilizing these strategies in school settings and empirically investigating them the project is intended to develop a model for sustainable change in improving evaluations of programs where cultural context is a salient feature and at the same time broaden the participation of underrepresented groups.  The project objectives are: 1) to develop a framework that will operationalize and provide guidance to evaluators seeking to be responsive to cultural context, 2) build capacity within the educational community by increasing the number of evaluators prepared to work in settings where cultural context is an important feature, and 3) build and refine a model of sustainable change and improvement of evaluation for schools that are underperforming.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
