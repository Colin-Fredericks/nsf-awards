Anderson (Mechanical Engineering) of Union College are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in an interdisciplinary program to develop rapid-response optical sensors for gas-phase analytes based on immobilization of luminescent indicator species in aerogel platforms.  The team previously developed a new rapid supercritical extraction method for fabricating aerogel monoliths. This process is a one-step precursor-to-aerogel method with no solvent extraction. It is also fast, simple, easily-automated and inherently safe.  The team is optimizing the process in terms of temperature ramping, maintaining a single phase thermodynamic state during heating, as well as sealing the mould and venting supercritical gases. They are applying this process to fabricate tailored aerogel platform gas sensors and compare these sensors with those fabricated using conventional supercritical extraction methods. \r\n\r\nAerogels area class of ceramic materials fabricated from a sol-gel procedure, resulting in a material that is approximately 90-99% air by volume.  These new materials are useful for sensors.  The work is particularly suited to undergraduate students as they are learning about the sol-gel process as well as analysis and materials characterisation through experimentation. \r\n",
