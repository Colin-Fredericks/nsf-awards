 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on the development of a mathematical foundation\r\nfor interaction-based computer simulations that can be \r\nrepresented as deterministic, discrete-time dynamical systems on\r\nfinite state sets.  Here, an interaction-based simulation is\r\nconsidered to be a collection of variables, each equipped with an \r\nupdate function or a set of rules which is used to compute the state\r\nof that variable at the next time step, based on the states of all\r\nthe other variables.  Thus, the description of the system is given\r\nvia local interactions, and global dynamics is generated through\r\nthe simultaneous iteration of all local update functions.  Cellular automata\r\nand Boolean networks are examples such simulations.  An important\r\nquestion, that has been studied extensively in the framework of\r\ncellular automata is how one can predict global dynamical features of\r\nsuch systems from the structure of the local update functions.  \r\nBy assuming that the state set for each variable is a finite field,\r\nsuch as the field with two elements used typically for cellular\r\nautomata,this problem can be addressed within the framework of computational\r\nalgebra.  The algorithms developed in this project will become part of\r\na symbolic computation software package for finite dynamical systems,\r\nimplemented in the computer algebra system Macaulay2.  \r\n\r\nInteraction-based simulation is becoming increasingly important in the\r\nanalysis of large biological, epidemiological, and socio-technical \r\nnetworks, such as the immune system, the spread of infectious diseases\r\nin urban areas, or road traffic and wireless communications networks.  \r\nTypically, such networks are understood at the level of individual\r\ninteractions, but global information tends to be sparse.  The software\r\ndesign of such systems is very challenging, and so is the\r\nanalysis of simulation output, due to the size and complexity of the\r\nsimulated systems.  A mathematical foundation for such simulations\r\nwill provide tools for the design of large-scale simulations.  It\r\nwill also help to systematically answer questions about\r\nbiological and other systems, such as optimal ways to treat infectious \r\ndiseases,or how to contain their spread in large populations.",
