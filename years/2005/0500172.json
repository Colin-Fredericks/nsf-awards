 "awd_abstract_narration": "First order logic is suitable for describing and studying classes of\r\n\"discrete\" structures: fields, groups, graphs, etc.  Model theory, and\r\nin particular stability theory, provided several striking structure\r\ntheorems for such classes: for example, the fact that every vector\r\nspace is determined by (the cardinality of) a linear base, while every\r\nalgebraically closed fields is determined by a transcendence base, are\r\nboth special cases of Morley's Theorem: in any class of structure to\r\nwhich this theorem applies, all structures are generated by a suitable\r\nbase.  Shelah's classification theory is a vast generalisation of\r\nMorley's Theorem, yielding structure theorems to many more classes of\r\nstructures.  While all these theories were developed for classes of\r\ndiscrete structures, they seems to hold, at least to some extent, for\r\nclasses of metric, or \"continuous\" structures: for example, compare\r\nMorley's theorem with the fact that every Hilbert space is generated\r\n(as a complete metric vector space) by an orthonormal base.  This\r\nproposal seeks to further adapt classical structure results from\r\nstability and classification theory to classes of continuous\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nThis proposal therefore seeks to extend the results and techniques of\r\nstability theory, and in particular superstability, to the setting of\r\ncontinuous first order logic, aiming towards a generalisation of\r\nShelah's Main Gap Theorem.  Continuous first order logic has the\r\nadvantage of being a natural generalisation of first order logic,\r\nwhile at the time accommodating many natural classes of (metric)\r\nstructures arising in functional analysis and probability theory\r\n(various classes of Banach spaces possibly with additional structure,\r\nmeasure algebras of probability spaces and of adapted spaces, etc.)\r\nNew complications arising from the presence of a non-discrete metric\r\nrequire us to revise the fundamental definitions (superstability,\r\nranks, etc.), and renders most of the classical theory, and in\r\nparticular the notion of regular types, seemingly inapplicable.\r\nNevertheless there has been considerable progress recently in this\r\ndirection, such as an adaptation of Lachlan's theorem to continuous\r\nsuperstable theories, and there are indications that similar\r\ntechniques can be used towards finiteness of weight and its\r\nconsequences, which seem the natural next step towards the achievement\r\nof this programme.\r\n\r\n",
