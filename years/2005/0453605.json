 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) at California State University San Bernardino will invite eight nationally selected students to participate in an eight-week summer research experience in combinatorics and knot theory.  Students from underrepresented groups or from colleges and universities without doctoral programs have had a significant involvement in this program, and are especially encouraged to apply.  Two faculty mentors will provide background and introduce potential research problems in both areas, and will then each collaborate with a group of four students.  At the conclusion of the program, each student gives both oral and poster presentations of their work, and submits a written paper suitable for publication.\r\n\r\nREU students are housed in the university apartments.  Weekly outings, both recreational and educational, build group cohesion and provide breaks from the rigors of research.  Weekly teas, open to the campus community, provide opportunities to meet faculty and students not involved with the REU program, and provide a forum for participants to discuss their projects in an informal setting.\r\n",
