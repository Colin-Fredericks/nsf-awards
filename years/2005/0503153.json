 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to support a three-day commutative algebra conference at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), May 7-9, 2005. The main goals of this conference will be to help recent\r\nPh.D.s and graduate students in the field to meet experienced researchers, to learn\r\nabout recent developments in commutative algebra, to exchange ideas with one another,\r\nand to develop collaborations for future research. The primary topics will be aspects\r\nof representation theory, homological algebra, computational algebra and ideal theory\r\nthat interact with commutative algebra. Speakers will be invited to discuss connections\r\namong these topics.\r\n \r\nWe seek support primarily for a target group of participants: those who are recent\r\nPh.D.s, graduate students or women, as well as faculty from under-represented groups or\r\nprimarily teaching institutions. Most of the talks will be accessible to graduate students\r\nand will demonstrate the main problems and techniques in the discipline.\r\n\r\nOver the last fifteen years there has been intense and ground-breaking activity in commutative algebra, activity which has been rapidly transforming\r\nthe field. There is also extensive interaction with researchers in areas as diverse as\r\nalgebraic geometry, coding theory, combinatorics, homotopy theory, K-theory, and rep-\r\nresentation theory. The proposed gathering will provide an opportunity for algebraists\r\nto interact and establish research connections with each other; in particular the targeted\r\nparticipants will benefit from the interaction and from seeing recent developments in the\r\nfield and its relationships with other areas.\r\n",
