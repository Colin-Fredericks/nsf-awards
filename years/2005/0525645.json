 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summary and Intellectual Merit\r\nA group led by the PI will develop a highly sensitive adhesion experiment designed to assess\r\nthe interactions between well characterized model surfaces in water. The measurement is based\r\non the contact between a synthetic polymer membrane and a quartz crystal resonator. The\r\nmembrane consists of an elastic layer at the air/water interface, and is an excellent model for a\r\nvariety of materials ranging from synthetic polymer gels to living tissues. The membrane\r\nsurface and the surface with which it interacts will both be coated with molecules that are\r\ndesigned to eliminate non-specific background adhesion between the two surfaces. Specific\r\nadhesion molecules will then be added to both surfaces, and the adhesion energy will be related\r\nto the interaction potential of the individual bonds, and to their surface concentration. The\r\nexperiments are conceptually similar to dewetting experiments, with contact of the membrane\r\nand the surface corresponding to a region where water has been largely excluded from between\r\nthe contacting surfaces. The experimental geometry is designed to give sensitivity to very small\r\ncontact angles, and hence to very small adhesive interactions. Membrane elasticity serves two\r\nimportant functions. The first of these is to extend the range of adhesive interactions that can be\r\nprobed so that the molecular origins of mechanical toughness of soft, highly deformable\r\nmaterials can be thoroughly investigated. The second function of membrane elasticity is to\r\nprovide a means for fixing the adhesive molecules in place while isolating the system from the\r\nsurrounding air environment so that the surfaces remain hydrated, even while in mechanical\r\ncontact with one another. A detailed mechanical analysis will be developed for cases where the\r\nadhesion energy is large enough so that elastic effects must be taken into account. Additional\r\ninformation about the nature of the mechanical contact will be obtained by monitoring the\r\nfrequency shift and dissipation of the quartz crystal resonators in the vicinity of a mechanical\r\nresonance of the crystal. The experimental methodology can be applied to a wide variety of\r\nadhesion problems in polymer physics and in biology, but experiments will begin with studies\r\nutilizing adhesive molecules that are very well characterized at the single molecule level.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe PI has developed a unique online multimedia text in polymer science that will undergo\r\ncontinued revision during this funding cycle. Additional contributions to undergraduate and\r\nundergraduate education will result directly from the proposed work, with three Ph.D. students\r\nand between 6 and 8 undergraduate students being trained in various aspects of mechanics,\r\npolymer physics and polymer synthesis. International experience will also be obtained as part of\r\na collaboration with Prof. Diethelm Johannsmann at the University of Clausthal in Germany.\r\nTwo Ph.D. students will conduct research in the Johannsmann laboratory during the course of\r\nthis project, and two students from the Johannsmann laboratory will visit the PI's lab at\r\nNorthwestern. Existing outreach activities will continue at local high schools and middle schools\r\nin Evanston and Chicago. The enhancements in mechanical characterization capabilities\r\nresulting from the proposed work will benefit a variety of research groups at Northwestern, in\r\naddition to scientists and engineers at local companies who utilize the micromechanics lab\r\nsupervised by the PI. The broader scientific impact of the work will be felt most strongly in the\r\nbiomaterials community, by providing a means for quantifying adhesion in practically relevant\r\nbiological systems that are amenable to the membrane geometry.",
