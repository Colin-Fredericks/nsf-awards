 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Solid State Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Houston is to develop an understanding the critical factors that determine the performance of high temperature electrochemical devices including fuel cells and separation membranes and thereby developing new high performance materials. This proposal, received in response to the Materials World Network announcement NSF 04-599, will combine the synthesis of oxide thin films of variable composition and different structural perfection, atomic level information of interfacial structure, defects and strain and surface reactivity. The complementary information on aspects of the surface structure, chemistry and reactivity of conducting oxides will make clear the factors controlling surface oxygen exchange, the key to improving both membrane performance and fuel cell efficiency. This collaborative project with research teams at Imperial College and University College of London is for material development of oxygen generators and ion transport membranes, as well as fundamental study of oxide surfaces.  Synthesis and characterization of oxide thin films of variable composition and different structural perfection, and atomic level information of surface structure and chemistry will be carried out with this collaboration.  These efforts toward cross-disciplinary education are aimed at training and developing scientists suitably equipped to contribute to the advanced technology industries being based on new materials.\r\n\r\nThe award will provide multidisciplinary research leading to advanced electrochemical technologies that minimize environmental consequences of using fossil fuels in energy production. The specific focus of the study is on solid oxide fuel cells and separation membranes where materials improvements are needed for commercial viability. Device performance is determined by both the bulk and the surface properties but because of the current industry trend towards thick films, better understanding of oxide surface chemistry is becoming increasingly important and is the main focus. The research program will broadly impact science and education through the incorporation of minority and traditionally underrepresented groups at all levels. Planned exchange of students among University of Houston, Imperial College and University College of London in multiple components of the research activities of the program would benefit in training future scientists. These efforts toward cross-disciplinary education are aimed at training and developing scientists suitably equipped to contribute to the advanced technology industries being based on new materials.\r\n",
