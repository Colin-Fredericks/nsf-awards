The theme of the REU Site is Functional Materials. Ten undergraduate students are recruited nationwide every year for a two-month summer research experience, with recruiting emphasis on students from the Appalachian region of Kentucky and members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering. In addition to participating in individual research projects, REU students attend weekly seminars on current major research topics, career opportunities, professional ethics, and effective communication skills. Students present the results of their research in in-house mini-conferences, and have the opportunity to attend the annual Regional Undergraduate Chemistry Research Poster Competition as well as a professional conference.\r\n\r\n",
