Since its inception, the IEEE/ASME AIM Conference has been held biennially, rotating the host country among Japan (AIM'97, AIM'03), the United States (AIM'99), Europe (AIM'01), and, in the future, other Asian Pacific-Rim nations as well. The conference has been co-sponsored by the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES), the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS), and the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division (DSCD). The great prac-tical significance of the conference theme has made past four AIM conferences a success and the conference has been expanded significantly - from predominantly Asians partici-pants in AIM'97 in Tokyo to a good representation of US scientists and engineers in AIM'99 in Atlanta, the European participants in AIM'01 in Como, Italy, and a global participation of researchers from 26 countries in AIM'03 in Port Island, Japan. This year, the conference is returning to the USA in Monterey, California from July 24-28, 2005. Following the footsteps of the previous four successful editions, the conference is to promote activities in various areas of mechatronics by providing a forum for exchange of ideas, presentation of technical achievements, and discussion of future directions. The theme of the conference is \"Intelligent Mechatronics in Micro/Nano Technologies\". The AIM brings together an international community of experts to discuss the state-of-the-art, new research results, perspectives of future developments, and innovative applications relevant to mechatronics, robotics, control, automation, and related areas. Active partici-pation of the conference by students in US institutions will thus no doubt provide a great learning experience for these students to significantly expand their horizons and to gain insightful guidance to their future research. \r\n\r\n",
