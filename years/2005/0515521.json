 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kim R. Williams of Colorado School of Mines and Dr. Thomas D. Hahn of National Starch and Chemical Company are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate fundamental and applied aspects of thermal field-flow fractionation (ThFFF).  An extensive systematic study will be conducted on model polymers to determine the effect of polymer composition, polymer architecture, and solvents on polymer thermal diffusion coefficients (DT).  Regression methods will be used to obtain equations that relate DT to different polymer and solvent properties.  Insights gained from these studies will lead to better understanding of thermophoresis, ThFFF, and industrially important polymer materials.  Molecular weight and structural information of the ThFFF-separated polymers will be measured using a multiangle light scattering-quasielastic light scattering-refractive index-detector combination.  \r\nThe demand for complex polymers and polymer mixtures exhibiting diverse performance requirements increases with the steady increase in societal needs for specialized products. \r\nDevelopment of ThFFF to a stage where analysis can be readily performed on commercially viable, mixed-class polymers will be a key analytical technology advancement, impacting both cost and availability of these products to the consumer.  This project will train students in modern methods of polymer analysis and provide them with multiple opportunities to interact with scientists and technicians at an industrial facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
