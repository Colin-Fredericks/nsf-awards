 "awd_abstract_narration": "0526649\r\nMadou  \r\nDescription: This is an International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) award to US PI Mark Madou that will enable 12 graduate and undergraduate students from the University of California, Irvine to engage in international research on Fast DNA Hybridization in Microfluidic Platforms at the premier Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur(IITK).  The research topic for all student participants is the theoretical and experimental development of a set of design rules for the fabrication of the fastest and most sensitive DNA arrays in a microfluidic platform.  This study will contribute to understanding fundamental issues such as DNA hybridization enhancement mechanisms.  The potential chemical and biomedical applications include DNA analysis, drug discovery, and on-the-spot analysis of the medically relevant parameters of disease.  There is growing interest in the miniaturization of complex and fully functional systems that take advantage of latest developments in microfabrication and promise the fabrication of lab-on-a-chip analysis systems in which various chemical processes are accommodated onto a small chip.  \r\n\r\nScope: This project will combine the experimental strengths of the US investigators with the modeling expertise of Indian counterparts and provide a unique opportunity for US students to gain international experience in an exciting research area.  Support for this project from the Department of Science & Technology (DST) will enable an exchange of students so that US students will gain fluidics and modeling experience at the IITK and Indian students will have exposure to the experimental work in bio-MEMS fabrication at Irvine.  The US student participants, which include minorities and females, will gain greater cultural and global perspective, as well as opportunities for professional growth through international cooperative research training, networking and mentoring.  \r\n",
