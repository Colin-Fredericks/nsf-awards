 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-day workshop will help organize the Antarctic Regional Ecological Observatory (AREO), which will support the development of the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON; http://www.neoninc.org/). AREO is envisioned as a means of monitoring ecological processes on the continent of Antarctica and adjacent near-shore marine environments. The AREO will be organized to answer regional- to continental-scale scientific questions and to facilitate the interdisciplinary participation necessary to achieve credible ecological forecasting and prediction.  AREO is seen as an observing system that will provide a continental-scale perspective and integration for individual projects, in addition to NEON sponsored projects. The AREO workshop will encourage social scientists, educators, ecologists, and physical scientists to participate in AREO planning and design, as well as to participate as Observatory users. For Antarctica, a continent without national boundaries, the participation of international scientists and educators is important. A broad and diverse group will be invited to participate. Women are currently well represented in AREO and therefore a good gender distribution is expected for the workshop. Minorities will be identified to the fullest extent possible. Key non-governmental agencies and international organizations will also be encouraged to participate",
