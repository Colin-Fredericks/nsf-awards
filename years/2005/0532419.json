 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was funded to hold two informational meetings on the new CISE Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) initiative.  In order to have the most impact, BPC aims to build broad Alliances of institutions and organizations that will design and carry out comprehensive programs that address underrepresentation in the computing disciplines. These Alliances will join academic institutions of higher learning with secondary schools, government, industry, professional societies, and other not-for-profit organizations. The purpose of these meetings is provide participants with information about the program, and to enable them to meet for dissemination of information about successful programs and to establish connections that will lead to the formation of larger Alliances. The first meeting is an in-person meeting on April 13, 2005 in Baltimore, MD and the second is an Access Grid, virtual meeting on April 20, 2005.",
