 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last quarter of the 20th century was marked by rapid urban growth and demographic projections consistently indicate that urbanization will accelerate in this century. It is estimated that by 2025 two-thirds of the world's population will reside in urban areas and a substantial proportion of this growth is expected to occur in developing countries. Despite a historically low rate of urbanization, African now is the fastest urbanizing continent in the world. Urban expansion requires not only the absorption of additional physical territory, but also the reorganization and redevelopment of much of the space already inhabited. This has a profound implication for Africa's peri-urban agricultural communities that are often displaced without adequate compensation, in order to make way for the construction of 'modern' residential housing, industrial and commercial zones. Since 1994, investments in development infrastructures have been growing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia-a metropolitan area of approximately three million people-through the annual conversion of over 200 hectares of suburban agricultural and forest land to urban land use. As a result, a substantial number of peri-urban communities have been displaced and more are expected to be displaced in the near future. \r\nThis dissertation research project by a cultural anthropologist from the University of Kentucky examines the social and economic impacts of peri-urban displacement on individuals and households, particularly youth. Until very recently, no study has systematically examined how individuals within the household are differentially affected by this type of displacement and how their responses in turn affect household social relations and livelihood security. To better understand individual responses and their impacts on livelihood security and social relations, this study will compare a sample of displaced households from Yeka Tefo Peasant Association (PA) with non-displaced households from Yeka Bole (neighboring PA). A combination of participant observation, survey questionnaire, unstructured interviews and case histories will be used in order to measure and compare the contribution of youth to on-farm labor and income; identify sources of conflict within the household; and examine changes in inter-generational relations between youth and elders. \r\nThis research will contribute to four areas of social science research: urban based development-induced displacement studies, peri-urban studies, anthropology of youth, and household studies. This will be the first research to examine how youth are affected by displacement in a peri-urban area and how their responses affect household livelihood security and intrahousehold relationships. In addition to the training of research assistants from Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, the broader significance of the project includes contribution to government policies on urban expansion. Without sound policies informed by social and cultural analysis, development-induced displacement and its negative impacts will only add to the high rate of urban poverty and unemployment that characterize cities such as Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. \r\n",
