 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\t\r\nDeBacker\r\n\r\nThe investigator will continue his research into a number of topics in \r\nharmonic analysis for Lie groups over nonarchimedian fields.  The first \r\ngoal is to establish Murnaghan-Kirillov theory for depth zero \r\nsupercuspidal representations.  At its most basic level, \r\nMurnaghan-Kirillov theory asks for a connection between the \r\nsupercuspidal representations of our group and the Fourier transforms \r\nof certain coadjoint orbital integrals.  Because of their intimate \r\nconnection to finite groups of Lie type, the problem of establishing \r\nMurnaghan-Kirillov theory for these representations reduces to the \r\nproblem of associating regular semisimple orbital integrals to \r\ngeneralized Green functions.  The second objective is to investigate \r\nquestions about stability.   For example, it would be useful to \r\nexplicitly understand, in a uniform way via Bruhat-Tits theory, the \r\nspace of stable distributions supported on the nilpotent set.  Thanks \r\nto various homogeneity results, this problem can be addressed by \r\nassociating (as above) regular semisimple orbital integrals to \r\ngeneralized Green functions.\r\n\r\nHarmonic analysis on Lie groups traces its roots to the following \r\nproblem from physics:  Describe the motion of a plucked guitar string.  \r\nEventually, people realized that this problem --- and rather more pure \r\nproblems like calculating Gauss sums or studying the density of primes \r\nin arithmetic progressions --- could be understood by studying certain \r\nwell-behaved functions on the circle (or other groups).   These \r\nwell-behaved functions are called characters, and the resulting theory \r\nis called harmonic analysis.  By the 1930s mathematicians had a firm \r\nunderstanding of harmonic analysis on many types of groups (for \r\nexample, compact or abelian groups).   During the 1940s problems from \r\nrelativistic physics led people to think about harmonic analysis on a \r\nmore general class of groups, called Lie groups.  Initiated by the work \r\nof Bargmann, Gelfand--Naimark, and Harish-Chandra,  the goal was, as \r\nfor the guitar problem, to understand functions on the group by \r\nstudying characters.  Thanks mostly to Harish-Chandra this goal was \r\nlargely realized. Based at least partially on his understanding of this \r\nwork, in the late 1960s Langlands was led to formulate his program; \r\nthis program is a vast, remarkable web of conjectures and ideas --- a \r\nkind of mathematical theory of everything. For example, the celebrated \r\nworks of Harris--Taylor, Kim--Shahidi, and Lafforgue provide a small \r\nsampling of the deep results it anticipates.  As harmonic analysis on \r\nLie groups plays a central role in our understanding of many of the \r\nproblems in this area, the investigator hopes his research will \r\ncontribute to future progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
