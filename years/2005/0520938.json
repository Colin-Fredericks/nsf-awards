 "awd_abstract_narration": "0520938\r\nAllen\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports upgrade of a wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF), and the acquisition of an ultrasonic-nebulizer-based aerosol generation and deposition system at the Keene State College (KSC) Center for Environmental BioGeoChemistry.  Specific XRF upgrades will include a new beam filter, synthetic spectrometer crystals designed to allow for analysis of low atomic number element (e.g., B, C, N), and a new analysis software package.  The aerosol generation and deposition system will be assembled from commercially available equipment including an ultrasonic nebulizer, vacuum pumps, temperature controller and plumbing fixtures.  Research and research training activities that will employ this  instrumentation include: (1) training of undergraduate students in scientific research through courses in Geology,  Environmental Studies, Chemistry, Biology, and Safety Studies; (2) studies of the occurrence, transport, and environmental fate of toxic trace elements in river sediments; (3) characterization of ambient airborne fine particulate matter from different source regions; and (4) study of Neotropical migratory bird populations using combined trace element and stable isotope signatures to improve understanding of their ecology and biology.   KSC specializes in the training of undergraduates for future careers in K-12 teaching. This equipment will assist faculty in their efforts to engage students in hands-on research experiences of local relevance and is likely to stimulate student interest in scientific research and better prepare them for possible graduate study in the physical sciences.  It is noteworthy that roughly 1/3 of KSC students are first generation college students.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
