 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant provides the resources for representatives of the Native American community colleges and PETE/ATEEC to formalize an organizational structure and develop a concrete plan to strengthen environmental technology education at Native American community colleges. This plan is designed to strengthen STEM education at Tribal colleges while acknowledging there is a deep historical component to the study of environmental science by Native Americans. These Tribal colleges seek to promote and acknowledge that history in a manner that will motivate Native students to develop an interest in environmental science and to choose environmental careers.  There is widespread acknowledgement and understanding of the need to strengthen environmental technology education at Native American community colleges.  Many Tribal/Native American governments are striving to identify economic development and employment opportunities for their sovereign lands that are consistent with and supportive of their culture and heritage. The development of high quality, specialized environmental education and technical training programs has been recognized as one important avenue for economic development.  Native American Community College leaders have identified the following needs regarding environmental science education: strengthening the curriculum, developing case studies specifically focused on environmental issues faced by Tribal communities, faculty training, networking with other environmental programs, strengthening 2+2 programs, and creating field experiences relative to Native American issues.  This award enables an expert panel of educators, both Native American and non-Native American, to jointly design an efficient and effective plan to address the environmental education needs of Native American community colleges.",
