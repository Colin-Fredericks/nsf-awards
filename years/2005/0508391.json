The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility and limitations of a new concept, called ferromagnetic seeding, for magnetic targeting of drugs or radiation in the human body. Superparamagnetic particles, no larger than 100 nm in diameter, will be used to enhance the force on and hence retention of magnetic drug carrier particles (MDCPs) or radioactive particles at a specified site in the body.  On a tumor, this nanoscale magnetic drug targeting (MDT) implant will be non-invasive and only require the use of an external magnet, the magnetic seeds and the MDCPs. Three tasks are proposed to demonstrate proof-of-concept.  First, in vitro experiments will be devised and carried out to verify the hypothesis that small superparamagnetic nanoparticles have the ability to capture the far larger magnetic drug carrier particles in surrogate capillary tissue. Second, the two-dimensional mathematical model recently developed by the PI will be further extended to three dimensions and validated with the in vitro experiments.  The models will help gain a fundamental understanding of the underlying, controlling and limiting phenomena in this non-invasive MDT approach. Third, superparamagnetic nanoparticle seeds will be prepared with the most optimal physical and biological properties for MDT using novel sonochemical techniques.  The broader impact of this work lies in the application of these ideas to other important biomedical applications, like in the treatment of tumors by using magnetic nanoparticles as hyperthermia agents under the influence of an alternating magnetic field or by using them to starve a tumor through localized embolization or necrosis of affected capillaries under the influence of an external magnetic field.\r\n",
