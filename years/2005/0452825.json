 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin Oshkosh will host an REU Site in Proteomics and Functional Genomics.  Nine students will work on their own research project with faculty mentors and utilize techniques in proteomics and functional genomics to investigate diverse, interdisciplinary questions in microbial physiology, plant biology, plant physiology, plant biochemistry, molecular parasitology, vertebrate vision physiology, environmental microbiology, cell and developmental biology, and virology. REU students will become familiar with state-of-the-art instrumentation housed within the Proteomics and Functional Genomics Core Facility at UW Oshkosh.  A two-week laboratory course at the beginning of the program provides students with the necessary set of basic skills to succeed in their research projects.  Students are expected to make presentations of their research results, participate in research group meetings, professional development seminars, and journal clubs.  Additional activities are included to ensure collegiality.  The specific objectives of this REU Site are to: 1) provide undergraduates with practical experience in the timely and powerful methodologies that define the frontiers of life science research today, 2) increase the global competitiveness of tomorrow's life science workforce by augmenting the number of undergraduates trained in essential techniques in proteomics and functional genomics, 3) increase numbers of members of under-represented groups pursuing careers in advanced biological research, and 4) foster development of diverse, collegial research communities of aspiring scientists.  Interested students are invited to visit http://reu.uwosh.edu.  The point-of-contact for interested students is Dr. Todd Sandrin (phone: (920) 424-1104; email: sandrin@uwosh.edu).",
