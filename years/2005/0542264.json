 "awd_abstract_narration": "SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AMONG NON-SCIENTISTS:\r\nSOURCES ON MEDIEVAL WOMEN\r\n\r\nExploratory research will determine the feasibility of a new, major project on the\r\ndissemination of scientific knowledge in the Middle Ages. The theoretical and historical basis of\r\nthe research has been established; funding is sought to survey the extent of accessible empirical\r\nevidence.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nAs the basis for a comparative study of men's and women's familiarity with scientific and\r\nmedical concepts from the ninth through the fifteenth centuries, the research will identify texts\r\nwritten by women that contain references to or discussions of learned concepts about the natural\r\nworld. The exploratory research will permit preliminary mapping (in space, time, social locus,\r\nand scientific discipline) of women's knowledge.\r\nThe project draws upon a significant literature concerning 1) natural philosophy and\r\ntheoretical medicine produced by men; and 2) the participation of women in other domains of\r\nmedieval society and culture. It will establish a primary source base from which to examine the\r\nscientific literacy of medieval women and the ways in which they deployed their knowledge.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nIf the proposed research is successful, it will lay the foundation for innovation concerning\r\ngender and the command of systematic knowledge about nature. It will thus contribute to the\r\nhistory of science, as well as to medieval studies and women's/gender studies, It will have\r\nimplications for the place of science in medieval culture, and, more generally, for the study of\r\npublic awareness of scientific ideas. In addition, the study will provide historical context for a\r\nbroad range of studies relating to gender in scientific education and scientific personnel.\r\nThe proposal is time-sensitive, because of the PI's research schedule and the availability\r\nof a graduate student Research Assistant with the appropriate skills and expertise.",
