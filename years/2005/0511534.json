This project is developing an \"educational Emulab in a box\" facility (called Edulab) by working with the University of Utah to tailor their recent work on lightweight Emulab systems (Emulab-lite) for use in education. This is making these inexpensive lightweight systems, along with newly-developed course materials, readily and freely available to colleges and universities worldwide. The project is adding new features to the Emulab software (including a Web interface) that are making it easier for faculty to create and grade assignments, reducing the steep learning curve for both faculty and students and making it easier for students to debug their projects.",
