 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to continue work on several problems in set theory, using the\r\nmethods of set and class forcing, infinite combinatorics, infinitary logic,\r\nand fine structure.  Previous work has shown that certain combinatorial\r\ncharacterization problems do not have first-order solutions.  For example, in\r\ngeneral there is no first-order definition of the set of subsets of omega-2\r\nthat, in some omega-1 and omega-2 preserving outer model, have a closed\r\nunbounded subset.  Other examples regarding subsets of other cardinals,\r\nbranches through trees of certain sorts, and large homogeneous subsets for\r\ncertain partitions are known.  One line of work concerns settling some further\r\ncases.  Another line of work concerns a more fundamental question. Can this\r\nphenomenon can be mitigated by working relative to some reasonable extension\r\nof ZFC, for example, one that is consistent with all large cardinal axioms.\r\nThe logically most simple case of incompleteness of the third kind lies\r\n(necessarily) just beyond the scope of Woodin's celebrated generic\r\nabsoluteness theorem: Assume CH.  Consider Sigma-2-1 sentences of analysis\r\nwith sets of reals as parameters.  In general the set of such sentences that\r\nare satisfiable in some outer model having the same reals is not first-order\r\ndefinable. Does there exist an extension of ZFC that is consistent with all\r\nlarge cardinal axioms and relative to which this set is (lightface) Delta-2-2\r\ndefinable?  Finally, the PI is interested in several questions regarding class\r\nforcing.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work centers on incompleteness of a \"third kind\" in set theory.\r\nIncompleteness in set theory is important because all mathematics can be\r\nformalized in set theory.  Propositions that are neither provable nor\r\nrefutable from the axioms of set theory cannot be settled\r\nmathematically, at least in our current understanding. Goedel's famous\r\nIncompleteness Theorems show that such propositions exist. Sentences\r\ndemonstrating this first kind of incompleteness formalize metamathematical\r\nstatements. For example, the formalization of \"ZFC is consistent\" is neither\r\nprovable nor refutable from the axioms of set theory (ZFC), provided those\r\naxioms are, in fact, consistent. Even though \"ZFC is consistent\" is not\r\nprovable from ZFC, there is an obvious reason to favor it over its\r\nnegation---studying mathematics within ZFC presupposes that ZFC is consistent.\r\nIncompleteness results proved using Cohen's method of (set) forcing represent\r\na second kind of incompleteness. Typically, given a \"standard\" model of ZFC,\r\none constructs an outer model in which a given statement is true and one in\r\nwhich it is false.  In the case of this\r\nsecond kind of incompleteness, there is often no reason to favor a statement\r\nor its negation.  Deep work by Woodin, Steel, Martin, Foreman,\r\nand a number of others has suggested reasons to favor certain statements up\r\nthrough a certain level of logical complexity. Just beyond this level of\r\nlogical complexity lies incompleteness of a third kind.  Here it is not\r\npossible even to say which statements are satisfiable in some outer model.\r\n\"Characterization problems\" are the combinatorial form of this phenomenon.\r\nPast work of the PI has highlighted that, in general, it is not\r\npossible to characterize in set theory the \"satiable objects\" of certain\r\nsorts.  Precise statements are technical, but an analogy gives the general\r\nidea.  In this analogy, the \"objects\" correspond to equations. An object is\r\n\"sated\" if the corresponding equation is solvable. An object is \"satiable\" if\r\nthe corresponding equation is potentially solvable, that is, either solvable\r\nor solvable in some larger number system.  In elementary mathematics, there is\r\nno reason to distinguish solvable and potentially solvable equations because\r\ntypically there exist maximal number systems in which every potentially\r\nsolvable equation of a particular sort is actually solvable.  Such \"maximal\r\nstandard models\" do not exist in set theory. The analog of an\r\nanticharacterization result in set theory would be a type of equation for\r\nwhich there cannot be a good criterion for potential solvability.\r\nAnticharacterization is troubling for two reasons. First, in mathematics one\r\nexpects that anything that is true is true for a good reason---so there ought\r\nto be a criterion for insatiability.  Secondly, in their strongest form, these\r\nanticharacterization results hold only if the universe fails to be\r\n\"sufficiently non-minimal\". To some extent this threatens the well established\r\nthesis that all of mathematics is formalizable in first-order set theory,\r\nbecause non-minimality cannot be expressed in this language.  The PI\r\nseeks to explore three aspects of anticharacterization. First, he seeks to\r\ndetermine whether some specific cases of characterization problems are\r\nsolvable.  Secondly, he seeks to discover whether adding auxiliary axioms to\r\nthe usual axioms of set theory might allow satiable objects to be\r\ncharacterized. This could be construed as evidence in favor of these axioms.\r\nFinally, he seeks to continue work on abstract class forcing with an eye\r\ntowards understanding general outer models, at least in the presence of\r\nconditions that render models highly non-minimal.\r\n",
