Deployment of fuel cells requires cost-effective, compact, and reliable units for generating high purity hydrogen for distributed stationary and mobile applications. Moreover, the environmental benefit of fuel cells is especially attractive if the source of hydrogen is renewable. Most research has focused on the conversion of fossil fuels to hydrogen in complex processes involving several reactors, requiring a wide range of conditions with prolonged startup times. This project addresses the need to develop a more compact and responsive hydrogen generation system using renewable fuels.\r\n\r\nMulti-functional reactors combine chemical reaction with one or more operations in order to increase productivity and reduce process complexity. In this project the PI will research and develop a novel multi-functional reactor that combines reaction, energy integration, separation, and purification in a single unit. The autothermal reforming membrane fuel processor comprises catalytic oxidative reforming, axially distributed air addition through porous ceramic membranes, and selective hydrogen separation and purification through permselective composite hollow fibers. The reactor has the potential for achieving a very high volume productivity of high purity hydrogen, rapid dynamic response, and high overall efficiency needed for fuel cell applications. Moreover, this project will focus on ethanol derived from agricultural sources, although the design can accommodate a range of fuels as the hydrogen source.\r\n\r\nThe overall project goal is to understand and to demonstrate the dual membrane reactor for producing hydrogen from a renewable feedstock. The research methods span Pd alloy membrane synthesis and characterization, membrane reactor experiments, kinetic analysis and reactor modeling.\r\n\r\nBroad Impact:\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research is the development of an efficient technology for converting renewable fuels to high purity hydrogen for fuel cell applications. This will accelerate the adoption of fuel cells for distributed electricity generation. The focus on biogenic ethanol as the fuel reduces the net emissions of CO2, which will slow the accumulation of CO2 levels in the atmosphere. The research of ultrathin Pd alloy films supported on ceramic fibers will lead to applications in other reaction systems. \r\n\r\nThe University of Houston has been designated a Minority Postsecondary Institution, which by definition is \"an institute of higher education whose enrollment of a single minority or a combination of minorities exceeds 50% of the total enrollment.\"  This should help the PI's efforts in recruiting a female or underrepresented minority student for the project.\r\n\r\n",
