 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  project will develop a novel integrated approach for improvement of reliability, availability, security, and performance of Web-based systems. In order to handle the intrinsic complexity of Web-based systems, the proposed approach will be scalable and allow measurements and models with different level of details and abstraction to be combined together. The project will focus on the following lines of inquiry:  Empirical characterization of reliability, availability, security, and performance attributes;  Development of performance and reliability/availability models ;  Combining multiple quality attributes based on clustering analysis and hierarchical modeling;  Evaluation based on both real-life case studies, as well as on controlled experiments conducted in a test bed environment.What makes the proposed research unique and different from existing research work in the literature, in addition to addressing the fundamental limitations for quantitative assessment of each quality attribute treated in isolation, is the aspect of combining individual quality attributes within an integrated framework aimed at analyzing their interactions and tradeoffs.",
