 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principle investigator and his collaborators plan to \r\nconstruct, streamline and analyze a suite of multiscale data \r\nrepresentation methods in various nonlinear and geometric \r\nsettings, as well as their applications.\r\nSome of these multiscale representations include: \r\nfree-form jet subdivision surfaces,\r\nmultiscale representation of vector and tensor fields on \r\nfree-form subdivision surfaces, wavelet-like transform of \r\nnonlinear range data, e.g. time series or spatial arrays of \r\ndata taking values at a manifold.\r\nThe PI intends to explore theoretical questions such as:\r\nWhen a traditional spline or subdivision method is modified \r\nto apply to data which satisfy specific nonlinear \r\nconstraints, how would the curviness of the underlying \r\nnonlinear manifold affect the stability, approximation and \r\nsmoothness behavior of the original method? \r\nThe PI and his collaborators are also\r\ndeveloping software tools for the fast prototyping and \r\ncomputational analysis of these novel multiscale methods, as \r\nwell as applying them to real datasets.\r\n \r\nFueled by the advances in various sensing technologies (in \r\noptics, syntheture aperture radar, etc.), new forms of data \r\ntype begin to arise in many different significant fields in \r\nscience and engineering, and it is the task of mathematicians \r\nto help preparing the world to make good use of such data. \r\nObvious application areas include material sciences, \r\ndiffusion tensor imaging, hyperspectral imagery, computer \r\naided design/animation, robotics (motion planning), just to \r\nname a few.\r\nIn each of these technologies, efficient multiscale methods \r\nis a must for processing tasks such as the compression, \r\nregistration, fast search, browsing, structure reconstruction, etc.\r\n",
