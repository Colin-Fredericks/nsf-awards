 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nThree regional studies will address the processes responsible for the tectonic\r\nbehavior in each region.  The study areas are:\r\n1) Southern California.  Study will focus on the cause of mountain \r\nbuilding in the\r\ntransform-fault environment of the San Andreas fault;\r\n2) the Sierra Nevada.  Study will focus on the tectonic strengths of \r\nthe bounding\r\nSan Andreas fault and eastern California shear zone and on the nature of the\r\ngravitationally driven extension of the Basin and Range; and\r\n3) the Pacific Northwest.  Study will focus on the interplay between the shear\r\ntectonics imposed by Pacific-North America interaction and the \r\nsubduction margin,\r\nwhich varies from weakly to strongly compressive.\r\n\r\nThese regional studies will be modeled in a manner consistent with \r\nplate scale stresses\r\nand will be used to improve the current plate scale dynamic model.\r\nThe proposed research will be accomplished in two and three \r\ndimensions with a finite\r\nelement computer simulations that incorporate faults, viscous and \r\nplastic rock deformation\r\nmechanisms, and gravity-driven processes in realistic ways.\r\nThis project will produce results that will help to understand the \r\nrelative importance\r\nof plate interaction and internal buoyancy driven continental deformation.\r\n\r\nAlso, improved models of the distribution and rate of deformation \r\nwill be produced\r\nbased on geodetic and geologic faulting data.  These results will be \r\nused both to evaluate\r\nthe quality of the computer simulations and to constrain lithospheric strength.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nResults will help constrain the strength and behavior of faults, \r\nwhich is important to\r\nunderstanding earthquake processes.\r\nThis project will prepare a graduate student for the future through \r\ncollaborations,\r\nparticipation in a diverse set of disciplines, and integration of the \r\nrange of findings\r\ninto consistent results.  It also will help foster an international \r\ncollaboration.\r\n\r\n",
