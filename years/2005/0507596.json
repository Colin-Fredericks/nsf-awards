This project will carry out very high-resolution N-body and gas dynamic Adaptive Mesh Refinement simulations of individual dwarf galaxies forming at high redshifts, with a dynamic range more than an order of magnitude higher than in previous studies, and including an unprecedented wealth of physical processes critical to galaxy formation.  These simulations will address the effects of cosmological ultra-violet radiation during the epoch of reionization, the star formation histories of Local Group dwarfs, the effects of tidal interactions on the star formation rate in dwarf galaxies, the shape of the dark matter density profile predicted for the cores of dwarfs, and the physics behind observed correlations of properties.  Questions about reionization, about the physics behind galaxy properties, and about the truth of popular cold dark matter models, will be shaping extragalactic astronomy for decades to come, but our own cosmic backyard contains a record in fossils from the early era: this research will help to interpret that record.\r\n\r\nThese research projects will be tightly integrated into academic teaching and public education and outreach activities.  Visualizations describing the fascinating science of dwarf galaxies will be available through the web, planetariums, and other public outreach efforts.  Simulation results will be available to the scientific community as a valuable resource to help interpret future observations.",
