 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glial cells have been implicated in diverse functions including the metabolic support of neurons and maintenance of extracellular ion concentrations.  Recent evidence suggests that glia may play an important role in regulating the extracellular concentrations of neurotransmitters, potassium ions and hydrogen ions (protons).  Acidosis (elevation of proton levels) can occur when respiratory activity is low.  Acidosis stimulates neural cells within the brainstem that respond to elevated CO2 concentrations. The changes in neuronal electrical activity of these cells are determined in part by the extracellular pH (acid levels). Therefore, factors that influence pH in or around these chemosensitive cells may affect ventilatory responsiveness to acidic stimuli.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed work is anticipated to yield the following important  findings: 1) identify pH regulating mechanisms present in brainstem glia; 2) determine the extent to which extracellular pH (pHo) regulation depends on the activation of proton transport in glia; and 3) examine how selective blocking of glial pH regulation can affect pHo and, in turn, affect pHi (the pH within the cells) and the chemosensory stimulus in CO2-sensitive brainstem neurons. \r\n\r\nUndergraduate students participating in the proposed research will be fully immersed in all aspects of experimental design, data collection, analysis and interpretation thereby providing opportunities for the students to explore their own ingenuity and creativity within the context of a scientifically relevant problem. One of the primary goals of this faculty-initiated, student-driven research is to establish a mentoring partnership between the student and faculty member that fosters the student's understanding of the process of scientific inquiry and the refinement of scientific questions through experimentation. The students will gain a clear understanding of the process of doing science and consequently hone many life skills (e.g. critical thinking, oral, visual and written communication) that will serve them well throughout their careers.\t\r\n",
