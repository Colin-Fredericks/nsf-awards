 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop is being organized in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area to introduce\r\nmembers of the local research community who are interested in earthquake engineering\r\nand dynamic system control to the newly-built 6-DOF shake table at the Virginia Campus\r\nof The George Washington University. The Washington metro area is home to a number\r\nof institutions of higher education, including The George Washington University, the\r\nUniversity of Maryland at College Park, Johns Hopkins University and Catholic\r\nUniversity, and to several national laboratories, including the National Institute of\r\nStandards and Technology, the Turner Fairbanks Laboratory, the Naval Research\r\nLaboratory, and NASA Goddard Research Center. Researchers at these institutions and\r\nlaboratories are involved in work.such as earthquake engineering, structural damping\r\nand position control, and vibration control.that could benefit from unique experimental\r\ncapabilities of the shake table.\r\nEach Workshop participant will present a 15-minute talk suggesting possible research\r\nthat he or she could do on the shake table. Each talk will be followed by a brief\r\ndiscussion among all participants about the merits of, and possible improvements to, the\r\nproposed idea. The Workshop is designed to allow the group of participating researchers\r\na maximally, mutually inspiring, intellectual experience.\r\nIntellectual Merit: A number of new research ideas for use of the newly-installed shake\r\ntable will be introduced at the workshop. Topics will include (1) experimental\r\nverifications of analytical prediction, (2) active and semi-active structural control, (3)\r\nnovel sensor technologies, and (4) dynamic and pseudo-dynamic concurrent testing.\r\nThese discussions are expected to lead participating researchers to individual as well as\r\ncollaborative research projects in the areas of earthquake engineering and structural\r\ndynamics.\r\nBroader Impact: One of the most effective forums for exploring the capabilities of the\r\nnewly built shake table and challenging the personnel associated with the shake table\r\nfacility is through a workshop on just these topics. The direct impact of the proposed\r\nWorkshop will be to stimulate use of this modern and unique regional facility, which\r\nprovides capabilities of critical interest to the research community. Other benefits to\r\ncome from the workshop include (1) the pioneering of networking procedures for\r\naddition of sites to the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) grid, and\r\n(2) creating synergy among researchers of the earthquake engineering community and\r\nthose from the structural dynamics community. Research to be conducted will involve\r\nboth undergraduate and graduate student participation. The results of the workshop will\r\nbe made available through the Internet. This information will be advertised in venues\r\nsuch as the NEES Consortium, the National Science Foundation, and the Earthquake\r\nEngineering Research Council. To further diversify the thinking going on at the\r\nWorkshop, we will encourage the participation of under-represented groups whenever\r\npossible.",
