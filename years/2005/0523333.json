The proposed payload project will be conducted in conjunction with the current NEESR project, which is under the direction of Professor Saiidi at UNR, entitled as \"Seismic Performance of Bridge Systems with Conventional and Innovative Design\". The NEESR project makes use of\r\nthe large-scale shake table systems at the NSF NEES site to develop detailed\r\nunderstanding of bridge seismic performance of multi-span bridge models. The testing\r\nprogram encompasses single and two-column bents as well as full-scale bridges.\r\nThe objective for the proposed payload project is to use two different types of distributed\r\nfiber optic sensor systems for real-time health monitoring during seismic activities and\r\nfor post seismic evaluation of beam column joints, abutments, and slab spans. The sensor response will be analyzed to examine the various design issues related to bridges supported on drop cap bents. The proposed distributed sensory system will be effective in development of deterministic tools for assessment of damage and verification of analysis schemes and design parameters. The serially multiplexed fiber Bragg grating\r\nsensors will be used for measurement of dynamic response and real time detection of\r\ndamage. Fiber Optic Long gauge distributed sensors will be used for post seismic damage assessment and safety following of an earthquake. The bridge models currently being tested at UNR include conventional reinforced concrete columns; concrete filled fiber reinforced composite tubes as well as innovative damage reducing materials that are being used in the locations where plastic hinges develop. The post hazard evaluation aspect of the distributed sensor system will be an important aspect of the project providing a deterministic tool for assessing the health and safety of bridges following seismic events.\r\n",
