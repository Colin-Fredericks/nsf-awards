 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research in numeracy suggests that individuals differ substantially \r\nin their abilities to process numbers and that, in fact, many people are \r\n\"innumerate.\" In our increasingly technical world, innumeracy (a lack of \r\nability to understand and use basic probability and mathematical concepts) \r\nmay be a critical disadvantage to making good decisions in financial, \r\nmedical, and other domains.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research examines the roles of numeracy and affect in decision \r\nmaking. We examine the extent to which numerical ability helps decisions in \r\nsome situations and hurts decisions in others. We also examine whether \r\nnumeracy impacts affective feelings, and we attempt to manipulate affect as \r\nwell as to enhance and disrupt calculation ability in order to test \r\nhypotheses. This research will add to the growing body of knowledge \r\nconcerning how affective and deliberative ways of thinking may influence \r\nimportant aspects of decision making such as the effects of describing \r\nfeatures of a decision in different ways (framing). In addition, proposals \r\nfor improving people's decision-making abilities are based primarily on \r\nresearch results based on the population as a whole. It may be, however, \r\nthat individuals will differ in the type of assistance they need. Those low \r\nin numerical ability may need different decision aids than those high in \r\nnumerical ability. In some decisions that involve very complex numbers, we \r\nmay all need assistance. We are increasingly being asked to make our own \r\ndecisions about vital life issues. No longer are health and financial \r\ndecisions left entirely to specialists such as the family doctor. Instead, \r\nall decision makers are faced with more choices and more information than \r\nin previous generations. Thus, research-based advice is essential to help \r\ndecision makers who differ in their preferences and abilities for \r\nprocessing information and who face decisions that differ in numerical \r\ncomplexity.\r\n",
