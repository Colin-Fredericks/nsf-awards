 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Arizona State University under the direction of Dr. Douglas Dennis for partial support of research employing an atomic force microscope.  The research will be conducted by scientists from three institutions, Arizona State University at the west campus, Midwestern University, and Sun Health Research Institute.  Projects include work on the structure of polyhydroxyalkanaote intracellular inclusions found in bacteria, a project on the bending of DNA molecules around charged artificial substrates, an analysis of the unwinding of DNA by the enzyme, helicase and work on imaging the peptides that are responsible for beta amyloid plaque structure in Alzheimer's patients.  All four research projects will be greatly facilitated by the acquisition of an atomic force microscope using funds from this award.\r\n\r\nBecause of the current interest in nanotechnology, and the ease with which an atomic force microscope can be utilized, it will also be employed at ASU in basic chemistry courses for materials sciences laboratories, as well as introductory biology laboratories to provide students with real-time images of biological specimens at the nanoscale.  The instrument will also be used to provide opportunities for advanced high school science students to visit ASU and experience the realities of the nanoworld, as well as demonstrate that high-level scientific research can be initiated by students with relative ease.\r\n\r\nUltimately the project will benefit the northwest part of Phoenix by providing a focus on nanotechnology and serving as a resource for those students wishing to engage in molecular-level research, as well as researchers at other institutions that learn of the capabilities of an atomic force microscope and want to employ it in their research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
