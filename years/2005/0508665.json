 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since Darwin, scientists have continually inquired about the formation of species and their maintenance or breakdown via hybridization. This project addresses recent mechanistic theories and their applicability to a natural species complex.  Research will focus on speciation, mechanisms that maintain the integrity of species, and courtship in one of the most species rich groups of turtles (map turtles). Facial color pattern differences are thought to be a key element in species identification and mate choice. The investigators will examine the interplay of genetics, morphology, and behavior, particularly as they relate to the origins and maintenance of species.\r\n\r\nThe broader goals of this project are 1) to determine the historical relationships of the turtle species in this group, 2) to identify the role of facial color pattern in species identification and courtship, and 3) to evaluate the extent to which facial color pattern has played a role in forming new species. These goals will be addressed using an integrative study combining field and laboratory methods to generate a stronger, broader understanding of speciation and hybridization. The multi-faceted nature of this project provides an important opportunity to mentor undergraduates (including underrepresented groups and women) in both field and laboratory settings.\r\n",
