 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed REU site is in the area of Medical Informatics and will address\r\nissues related to the workflow driven acquisition of image data in an\r\nelectronic medical record environment, and the subsequent post-processing of\r\nthe image information to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the\r\nconsumers of this information, notably radiologists. In particular,\r\nsegmentation, texture analysis, classification and annotation of computed\r\ntomography (CT) images using computer vision and data mining techniques will\r\nbe emphasized.\r\n\r\nSince many racial minorities are significantly underrepresented in computer\r\nscience (CS) departments, the primary educational objective is to promote\r\ngraduate studies for bright, talented undergraduates - especially\r\nfirst-generation college students and undergraduates from groups\r\nhistorically underrepresented in exact sciences.  Furthermore, since the\r\ndemand for individuals who see their career opportunities at the\r\nintersection between Medical Informatics and CS far outstrips the current\r\nsupply, the second educational objective is to promote and encourage\r\ninterdisciplinary undergraduate studies in computer science and medical\r\ninformatics.\r\n\r\nThe MedIX (MEDical Informatics eXperiences in undergraduate research) REU\r\nsite will run for three summers, with eight student participants spending 10\r\nweeks each summer doing research both at DePaul University, Intelligent\r\nMultimedia Processing Laboratory and Northwestern University, Feinberg\r\nSchool of Medicine, Imaging Informatics Laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
