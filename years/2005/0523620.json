 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal concerns policy synthesis and performance evaluation for complex systems. Research\r\nwill focus on the development of methods to achieve reliability in complex networks that\r\nare subject to substantial variability. Speci.c topics include resource allocation, performance\r\nevaluation, and new approaches to fast simulation and adaptation. Power transmission networks\r\nare taken as a primary application of this research, and will guide the directions for theoretical\r\nresearch.\r\nIntellectual Merits\r\nThe proposed research will build upon recent advances in stochastic systems and stochastic networks\r\nto bring new approaches to model reduction and policy synthesis for complex, interconnected\r\nsystems. The project will also serve as a bridge between researchers in economics and\r\ncontrol systems to synthesize recent innovations from these .elds.\r\nThe most basic issue addressed in this project is complexity management. In a variety of\r\napplications one seeks control solutions of reasonable complexity in spite of the complexity of the\r\nsystem to be controlled. It is very important that the solution provide some intuition to the user\r\nfor the purposes of both prediction and policy improvement.\r\nCentralized optimal control solutions will be used as a benchmark in analyzing decentralized\r\npolicies, and as a tool for constructing appropriate market mechanisms to ensure reliability in a\r\ndecentralized setting.\r\nTraditional economic analysis to address reliability in power distribution systems is based on\r\na static (equilibrium) model. While much insight has been gained, just as in the design of a\r\ncontrol system for an airplane, a static equilibrium model is inadequate to address robustness and\r\nreliability. The PIs have shown recently that it is possible to construct tractable dynamic models\r\nof power distribution systems that reveal insight on the sources of low reserves in a decentralized\r\nsetting. The discovery of new methods to combat these de.ciencies is a major goal of this research.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nFundamental research on accelerated algorithms for learning and simulation has potential impact\r\nin various .elds, including computer vision and data mining. Similarly, the control techniques\r\nto be developed are based on minimal structural assumptions, and consequently there is high\r\nprobability of crossover into various .elds.\r\nResearch on large-scale electric power has tremendous potential commercial impact. A clear\r\nunderstanding of the dynamics of deregulated markets will provide for the .rst time a proper\r\nevaluation of the social value of reliability, and the construction of e.ective incentives and policy\r\ntools to ensure e.cient market outcomes. These results will provide forecasting tools for policy\r\nmakers to predict behavior of users and suppliers, and design mechanisms to ensure reliable and\r\ne.cient service.\r\nA CSL-ECE-Economics Department seminar series on distributed networks will be initiated.\r\nProfessors will be invited from across the country, and as far away as India to present recent work.\r\nThis will strengthen existing collaborations within the University of Illinois as well as the broader\r\nresearch community in the networks area. The seminar series will also provide excellent training\r\nfor the students involved.",
