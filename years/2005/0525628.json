 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a decadal study of the field of condensed-matter and materials physics. The study will provide an authoritative assessment of progress in the field, current key problems and issues, and an outlook for the future. Development of a consensus on the intellectual drivers of the field will be helpful to researchers and particularly to graduate students making choices about areas of research to pursue. The study will also describe the increasingly rich connections with other fields and the fundamental role that condensed-matter physics plays in a broad range of scientific areas. The study will treat a number of issues, capitalizing on recent work carried out under the Solid State Sciences Committee and the Board on Physics and Astronomy treating areas such as the complementary roles of investment in principal investigator research, instrumentation, and facilities. Scientific and technical assessments from the Academies give decision makers in Washington confidence that (1) the investment in the field has resulted in important progress in the science as well as significant benefits to society in terms of new technology and enhancement of the technical workforce, and (2) the field will continue to be productive and work to maximize the benefits of investments in it.",
