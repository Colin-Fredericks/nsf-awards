 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\n\r\nThe Cellular and Molecular Biology (CMB) B.S. degree offered by Universidad Metropolitana (UMET) is changing from a traditional to a multidisciplinary program to better prepare students for graduate and professional careers as well as for positions in industry.  Best practices are being adapted from a variety of sources (see NSF # 0087570 and 0088653, the National Research Council's guide to BIO 2010) and implemented in existing and new CMB courses. The curriculum is being expanded to include the following elements: (a) mathematical and computational modules applicable to biology, (b) a strong emphasis on verbal and written communication skills, and (c) laboratory experiences that lead to discovery-based learning.  A biotechnology track is being created within the CMB program that offers a multidisciplinary approach to biological courses with an emphasis on skills required by the biotechnology industry. This track also features the following in an effort to prepare students for employment in the biotechnology industry: (a) hands-on experiences based on widely practiced techniques within this industry, (b) a course in entrepreneurship designed to provide a basic understanding of the business aspects of biotechnology, and (c) a course on bioengineering processes, which prepares students to successfully interact with engineers as part of an industrial team.  Advice concerning these changes is being given by faculty from Penn State University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, University of Alabama - Huntsville, University of Michigan, and West Chester University, each of whom has implemented similar projects at their institutions.  Additional advice regarding assessment is being provided by the Puerto Rico Industry - Academia Association (INDUNIV).\r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes of this project are: (a) the creation of a unique CMB program that meets the demands of current scientific developments for the global and Puerto Rican markets; (b) the implementation of modules and courses that lead to the training of scientists with improved communication and mathematical skills; (c) an increased capacity of UMET's science faculty to prepare professionals capable of succeeding in multidisciplinary technical environments; and (d) manuals, a web site and other materials in both English and Spanish for the dissemination of this project's accomplishments among the scientific community.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of Proposed Activity: These course are providing underrepresented, socioeconomically disadvantaged Hispanic students with inquiry-based, multidisciplinary courses that will better prepare them for graduate studies in CMB or for a successful career in the biotechnology industry.  Students are being challenged to think critically and communicate clearly, forging free-thinking individuals capable of becoming leaders in their fields.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts from the proposed activity: Participating faculty are broadening their understanding of CMB and how it interrelates with other fields, and are becoming more adept at including inquiry-based, multidisciplinary activities in their courses. Finally, dissemination of this project's results coupled to an elevated number of graduates succeeding in their careers will help UMET to attract talented students and ensure the continued success of the CMB program.\r\n\r\n",
