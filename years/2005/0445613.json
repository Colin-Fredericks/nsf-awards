 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is to investigate the structural basis of RNA tertiary assembly in the solution state.  Thus far, RNA tertiary structure has been elucidated for a number of RNAs in X-ray crystal structures, but not in solution.  In other words, most NMR structures of RNA are helical secondary structures that are not assembled into higher order (tertiary) structure.  For Aim 1, the NMR structure of the 31 kDa tetraloop receptor RNA complex will be determined.  This is a ubiquitous helical packing motif that mediates tertiary structure formation of many large, catalytic RNAs.   For Aim 2, the dynamic motions and ion binding involved in the assembly of the tetraloop receptor complex will be investigated.  For Aim 3, the objective is to develop a combined ESR (electron spin resonance)-NMR approach for the structural studies of large RNA complexes.  For Aim 4, NMR structures will be determined for two RNA assembly motifs for which no X-ray or NMR data exist.  A key strategy for the success of this work relies on the rational design of RNA constructs.  RNA motifs that mediate tertiary structure formation will be phased one helical turn apart to form homodimers, with dissociation constants that are ~100,000-fold lower than those of the individual tertiary interactions.\r\n\r\nThis project is an interdisciplinary effort involving personnel with advanced training in molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, and chemistry.  Collaborative interactions involve multiple universities, institutes and resource centers.  These interactions enhance the vigor of the research and teaching efforts of all participants, increase the opportunity for dissemination of new technology and research methods, and expand the impact of this program to a national scope.  The training of graduate and undergraduate research assistants will be an integral aspect in the execution of the proposed research.  Moreover, and consistent with the previous efforts of the PI, this research will continue to involve undergraduates and women, and will strive to recruit members from underrepresented groups.\r\n",
