 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Fuel cells are being actively developed because they can provide a more efficient and pollution-free method for converting chemical energy to electricity.  While fuel cell electrodes typically have a complex micro- or nano-structure that is critically important in determining their performance, current methods for measuring electrode structure are quite limited.  The aim of the proposed project is to develop analysis and simulation tools to characterize the three-dimensional electrode microstructure and to understand microstructural evolution and the resulting electrochemical performance.  \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: A main aim of this research is to fully understand the relationships between electrode processing, structure, properties, and performance.  This will ultimately allow design of higher performance and more stable electrode microstructures, as well as providing processing information needed to achieve these structures.  The new methods and understanding will be included in new university course materials and in educational modules designed to reach a broad spectrum of age groups. This research is a collaborative effort with Northwestern University and University of Washington.\r\n",
