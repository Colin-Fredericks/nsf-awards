Each program will last 3 weeks and  comprise \r\noverlapping \"tutorial\"  and\r\n\"research workshop\" parts. The tutorial part will involve 30 graduate students\r\n  and post-doc's, who will stay for the whole duration of the program, and 10\r\ninstructors, who may stay for 2 or 3 weeks. The research workshop part will\r\nalso involve about 15 more senior participants. Each summer program will be\r\norganized around a specific interdisciplinary theme and will be held at or\r\nclose to an academic institution. The 2006 program will be held at the\r\nKavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP) in Santa Barbara, CA, on the\r\ntheme: \"Constraints on the fluxes of mass, heat and chemicals in the \r\nmantle, with a\r\nparticular focus on the upper mantle and transition zone\". Location and\r\nthemes for the subsequent two workshops will be determined in coordination\r\nwith the CIDER Steering Committee.",
