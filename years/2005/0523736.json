 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide diversity of microbes live on or in the tissues of plants, including bacteria, fungi, nematodes and fungus-like organisms called oomycetes. All of these microbes, whether beneficial or pathogenic (disease-causing), have developed mechanisms to neutralize the defense systems used by plants to protect themselves against infection. Understanding the similarities in the ways these diverse microbes attack plants will help us understand the vulnerabilities of plants to infection, which will in turn help design new and effective methods for controlling plant disease. Currently, genome projects focused on a variety of plant pathogenic microbes are uncovering large numbers of genes that the microbes may use to attack plants. However, because these genome projects are going on in different research communities, the terminology that is used to describe the functions of the genes varies so much that it is very difficult to compare the functions of genes in the different microbes. This project will establish a standardized set of terms, called a Gene Ontology, for describing the functions of genes used by microbes that live in or on plants, including pathogenic microbes. The work of establishing the terms will be carried out in collaboration with the Gene Ontology Consortium, which is a group of institutions involved in creating standardized terms for describing all the functions of genes in living organisms.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this work will be to establish a means for greatly facilitating the exchange of information among researchers studying plant-associated microbes. The work will also be of value to researchers studying animal- and human-microbe interactions. Members of many different research communities will be trained in the use of the standardized terms, through training workshops, internships, presentations at meetings, and on-line training documents.  Training will emphasize graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty, especially those who are minorities, or are from undergraduate institutions. Information about the standardized terms will also be incorporated into courses for graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis project is being supported through a collaboration of the National Science Foundation and the National Research Initiative of the Cooperative Research, Education, and Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture.\r\n",
