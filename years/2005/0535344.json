These real-world full-scale tests\r\nprovide information that would be very difficult to duplicate in laboratory experiments and it seems logical to study the damages that take place. From this information and from inferred wind speeds occurring during such events it should be possible to develop countermeasures to eliminate or reduce potential future damage. In view of the pressing needs in the area of wind hazards reduction and benefits of coordinated damage investigations demonstrated by the earthquake engineering community, over the past two years American Association for Wind Engineering (AAWE) undertook three initiatives in the area of wind damage documentation. In 2003 two research teams were sent to investigate representative damages due to significant tornadoes and a major hurricane. In 2004, a one-day workshop was organized, following the hurricane season. This proposal seeks reimbursement of travel costs associated with the three initiatives. A brief presentation of the background information, the scope of the research effort and justification of the requested funds are included in this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this SGER proposal is the ability to systematically address issues of wind damage investigations and damage documentation. Both these broader impacts will aid development of guidelines for analysis and design of wind-resistant buildings and structures. These efforts will ultimately lead to reduction in loss of human life and property due to wind.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal will include the ability to develop methodology for systematic and coordinated acquisition, documentation and dissemination of data on wind\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\n",
