 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAn emerging challenge pursuant to acquisition of genomic sequences is the need for \r\nefficient tools for specific and regulatable disruption of gene expression to establish gene \r\nfunction. This SGER project aims to use a strategy for targeted and tightly controlled \r\ndegradation of any cellular RNA in plants, using Arabidopsis as a test organism. The method depends on using RNase P, a ubiquitous enzyme involved in tRNA biogenesis, as a reagent that specifically cleaves \r\nan endogenous target RNA and disrupts either its translatability or other biological \r\nfunction(s). This RNase P-mediated cleavage depends on the expression of another small \r\nRNA called an external guide sequence (EGS), which when bound to the target mRNA \r\nrenders the resulting complex a substrate for RNase P. By comparing the efficacy, \r\nsequence specificity, inducibility and cell autonomy of the RNase P- and EGS-based \r\nmethod versus RNAi in disrupting the expression of target mRNAs of reporters \r\n(luciferase, green fluorescent protein) and tissue-specific transcription factors \r\n(WEREWOLF and GLABROUS1), the pros and cons of these potential gene-function \r\ndiscovery tools will be elucidated. In addition to serving as a functional genomics tool \r\nfor plant biologists, the EGS method could be used to enhance agricultural productivity \r\nby engineering disease resistance or altering metabolic/physiological traits. \r\nBroader impacts of the proposed research .  \r\n\r\nThe proposed studies are based on a solid foundation of promising preliminary results in a monocot and a dicot. The project will enable (i) multi-disciplinary state-of-the-art training for researchers at various stages in their careers, (ii) a network of academic \r\nresearch collaborations and enhancement of the research infrastructure at a pioneering \r\nland-grant institution, and (iii) the development of a new, exciting technology with \r\nsignificant payoffs in agricultural biotechnology.   \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that after two years all the necessary experimental protocols to \r\nhelp other researchers design their own studies for targeted disruption of gene \r\nexpression using the EGS method will become available. To ensure that the results of \r\nthis study will have maximum impact in the research community, reagents and tools \r\nneeded for the EGS strategy will be provided immediately upon request.\r\n",
