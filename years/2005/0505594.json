 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is about the long term evolution of systems with dissipation, \r\nespecially the final states to which these systems evolve at the end. Intuitively,\r\none would expect a state of stable equilibrium, or a\r\nstate of periodic oscillation. However, as revealed by the modern theory of\r\ndynamical systems, the real world is far more\r\ncomplicated. In fact, a dissipative system may evolve to a state of chaos.\r\nThesechaotic states\r\nare the so called ``strange attractors\".\r\nThis proposal is on a mathematical analysis of rank one attractors,\r\na subclass of strange attractors. First we try to understand the geometric and\r\ndynamic structure of rank one attractors, i.e., finding the underlining order of\r\nthese chaotic behavior. Second, we try to establish with mathematical rigor\r\nthat these ``strange attractors'' are observable and are frequently encountered\r\nin different discipline of science and mathematics.\r\n                                                           \r\nIn the modern theory of dynamical systems, it is well acknowledged\r\nthat the most important and intriguing objects are homoclinic\r\ntangles. We know that horseshoes occur inside a homoclinic tangle.\r\nThey are, however, only a relatively small part that is measure\r\ntheoretically ignorable. We also know that, in general, homoclinic\r\ntangles are extremely complicated, perhaps so complicated that\r\ncomprehensive understandings are hopeless to acquire. This proposal is mainly\r\non the study of a specific nonuniformly\r\nhyperbolic homoclinic tangle (rank one attractors).\r\nFirst we hope to\r\noffer a comprehensive understanding of the dynamical structure of\r\nhomoclinic tangles of this kind by using many of the important\r\nmathematical tools (Symbolic dynamics, SRB measures and related\r\nstatistical properties for a few) developed in the past one\r\nhundred years after the initial findings of the tangles by\r\nPoincar\\'e. Second we intend to show that, like the horseshoes,\r\nhomoclinic tangles of this kind commonly occur in the real world,\r\nwhich lead us to applications.\r\n",
