 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical.\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project addresses in situ, real time studies of the dynamics of formation of silicide nanostructures on Si surfaces, paralleled with measurements of their electronic properties. The project includes: establishing the important factors that contribute to self organization of nanostructures, including attractive and repulsive interactions and effects (both energetic and kinetic) that tend to form an ordered array of nanostructures; establishing the important factors that contribute to shape transitions, particularly for the formation of silicide nanowires; establishing the electrical properties of the interface between metallic silicide nanostructures and the Si substrate, particularly in comparison to the Schottky barrier of a planar interface; establishing the single electron tunneling properties of silicide nanostructures on Si, with particular attention to shape dependent effects; measurement of the temperature dependence of electrical transport in nanowires of different lateral dimensions. The research approach involves in situ, real time measurements using UV PEEM (photo electron emission microscopy) to gain insight into the dynamics of nanostructure formation and evolution, and measurements of the electrical properties of nanostructures using a variable temperature UHV STM-AFM. The UV excitation for the PEEM will be provided through the Free Electron Laser Laboratory at Duke University. A critical collaboration has been established with Prof. Hull of the U. of Virginia to study defect and interface structure of the nanostructures produced in this project. \r\nNontechnical. Broader Impact: An integrated education and outreach program has been developed which emphasizes interdisciplinary research approaches and has a commitment to diverse student involvement. The educational and outreach initiatives focus on diverse undergraduate student involvement. Through collaboration with North Carolina Central University, an HBCU, and involvement with the NC State REU, this program will support the development and provide opportunities for a diverse group of highly qualified undergraduate students. A specific project has been identified based on the research interests of Prof. J. Dutta of NCCU. An international student exchange has been established, which serves to broaden the perspectives of all students. The research results will provide examples for an interdisciplinary graduate course on Properties of Surfaces. The research has the potential to affect the development of microelectronics through both scientific research and education.\r\n",
