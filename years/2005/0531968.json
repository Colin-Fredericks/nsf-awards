 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phenology is the study of plant and animal life cycle events, such as first flower openings, insect hatchings, and bird return dates.  Changes in the timing of these events represent integrated responses of Earth's biosphere to environmental variations.  Past phenology studies have been highly effective in detecting climate variation impacts at individual sites, and at widely spaced locations spanning selected regions.  Observation networks exist in Europe and Canada, but the USA does not have effective regional or any nationwide phenology networks.  Only a national network can assess the large-scale ecological responses projected to occur due to future climate change.  In collaboration with other federal agencies, this project will sponsor an expert meeting to produce an implementation plan for a National Phenology Network (NPN) that addresses scientific, technical, cyberinfrastructure, and organizational issues.  NPN will facilitate understanding of plant phenological cycles and their relationship to climate; comprehensive evaluation of satellite-derived measurements; and detection of long-term phenological trends in response to climate variability/global warming. NPN data could help evaluate impacts of longer growing seasons on pollinators, cattle, crop and forest pests, wildfires, carbon storage, and water use.  \r\n \r\nThe National Phenology Network will be designed in such a way that it can engage the public as observers, and thus increase awareness of ecological responses to climate change.  NPN planning coincides with several compatible initiatives, including NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network), Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), and current plans to modernize the National Weather Service COOP (volunteer) weather station network into a National Mesonet. An NPN/National Mesonet linkage would enhance environmental measurement at up to 10,000 existing weather stations. \r\n",
