 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nThis project is adapting and extending work at the University of Massachusetts Lowell to develop the next generation robot laboratory (NSF CCLI Grant DUE 0231363), with three primary directions. First, it is focusing on using robotics, in particular the Sony AIBOs, in the classroom as a way of attracting a more diverse population of undergraduates to Computer Science programs. Multiple courses are being developed, starting from the very beginning of the computer science curriculum. Second, it is extending Pyro, an easy to use programming system for robots written in Python, to support the Scout miniature robot. The Scout has unparalleled features in terms of its combination of small size and ability to move fast over large distances. And third, it is performing a thorough evaluation of the resulting course material with the help of independent evaluators. The goal of this project is to increase the interest of underrepresented groups for studying Computer Science and to provide them with tools that will help throughout their undergraduate years. Course materials that are especially interesting for women and underrepresented groups are being developed, based on the use of the AIBO and Scout robots, in order to both attract them to consider studying computer science and to give them the initial background they need to succeed in the CS courses.",
