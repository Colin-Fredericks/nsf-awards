 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIn this 3-year project, the Colleges of Engineering and Education at the University of Missouri-\r\nColumbia will collaborate with three central Missouri school districts (one small city and two \r\nrural), engineering businesses, and the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary \r\nEducation to improve the pedagogy and team-building skills of engineering graduate students, \r\nincrease the engineering content for G6-9 science and mathematics teachers, and provide \r\nopportunities to increase interest in science and mathematics among G6-9 students using hands-\r\non engineering design projects.   \r\n  \r\nIntellectual Merit. Engineering and education faculty working together with Fellows and G6-\r\n9 science teachers blends content and pedagogy skills for better overall impact on the Fellows' \r\ndevelopment. This is further emphasized by requiring the Fellows to include a chapter about this \r\noutreach activity in their dissertation. Empowerment of the Fellows and development of \r\nleadership skills is included by explicitly involving them in decision making;  infusion of \r\nengineering design into K-12 education, a nationally recognized need, is furthered by the project, \r\nusing a unique team approach;  development of  Future Scientists and  Engineers Clubs in schools links the proposed activities with curricular ones, enhancing effectiveness and improving sustainability, and; the proposed global connections via distance links adds an important educational dimension to all the activities, for all the participants. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact.  The proposed project will help develop infrastructure for deeper and sustained \r\npartnerships, centered on engineering design, among G6-9 science and mathematics educators, \r\nhigher education, industry, and the department of elementary and secondary education of the \r\nstate. The prototype resources (for graduate students, teachers, and G6-9 students) developed will \r\nbe made available to graduate students, middle and secondary science and mathematics teachers, \r\nand higher education throughout the region, the state, and the nation, with the expectation that \r\nthey will utilize them whenever appropriate. Infusion of engineering design projects should also \r\nfacilitate the development of content-rich and inquiry-based approaches. The graduate students \r\nwill also benefit from enhanced skills transferable to a variety of occupations. The importance of \r\nactively engaging students in design has the potential not only to enrich teaching of science and \r\nmathematics, but also to forge connections to daily life by providing approaches to meet other \r\nchallenges in diverse areas ranging from ecological issues to personal life.  The inclusion of women and minorities in all aspects of this program will be stressed.\r\n\r\nPartial funding for this project is provided by the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n  \r\n\r\n",
