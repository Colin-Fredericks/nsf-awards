 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to The University of Alabama under the direction of Dr. Phillip Harris for partial support of improvements to the frozen-tissue and formalin-fixed, alcohol collections maintained by the Ichthyology, Herpetology, Malacology and Decapod Collections. Ichthyology and Malacology currently have a combined collection of ca. 35,000 frozen specimens or tissues; both collections have a substantial number of threatened and endangered species.  While both collections are in electronic databases, information coverage for individual lots is unequal.  The lack of a centralized database and repository for all frozen collections has resulted in the uncoordinated accessioning of frozen specimens and tissues.  This deficiency puts these collections in jeopardy of being permanently lost, damaged, or disassociated from their data.  Consolidation of these independent frozen-tissue collections and proper curation will ensure the long-term preservation and accessibility of these valuable and irreplaceable materials.  In addition, current electronic databases require improvements, including updating the taxonomy and initiation or completion of georeferencing for all specimens.  Upon completion of these tasks, the electronic databases will be transferred into SPECIFY 4.05 and a common internet-access platform will be created to search these collections.  \r\n\r\nThe collections maintained by The University of Alabama contain valuable specimens documenting the aquatic fauna of the eastern and southeastern United States.  These collections date from the late 1940's and contain an important record of changes in species diversity and numbers over time due to anthropogenic influences on aquatic ecosystems.  All of these collections are active research collections and are valuable resources to ichthyologists, herpetologists, malacologists, decapodologists, and state and federal natural resource agencies.  Proposed improvements to these collections, especially the frozen-tissue collections, will safeguard them from deterioration, loss of specimens, disassociation of specimen with collection data, and enhance access of researchers to data and collection records.  All of the proposed curatorial activities described in the proposal contain a training component for undergraduate and graduate students interested in natural history collection curation and management.  In addition, a new seminar course, Museum and Field Techniques in Natural History Studies, is being developed for students from across biological disciplines to gain an appreciation for the role of collections and phylogenetic systematics in their respective fields.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the university environment, specimens from all four collections are used in numerous public outreach activities, such as museum displays, loans to public and private school teachers and the Ichthyology Collection's Traveling (or In-house) Fish Show.   These collections are an important record of the biodiversity of the southeastern United States and some of these materials are irreplaceable.  Funds from this grant will assist in safeguarding these valuable resources for future generations.\r\n",
