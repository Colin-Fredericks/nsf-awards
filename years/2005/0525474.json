 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CU-STEP program is engaged in strengthening STEM pathways to community colleges and 4-year colleges and universities by linking and enhancing existing successful programs for (1) pre-college recruiting, preparation, and matriculation to Clemson University, and (2) undergraduate retention and graduation. This effort is supported by strong collaboration, cooperation and development activities among and within two participating Clemson colleges and three participating Clemson Centers and Institutes. The participants are Clemson University's College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences (CAFLS) and the College of Engineering and Science (CE&S), the South Carolina DNA Learning Center (SCDNALC), the Center of Excellence in Mathematics and Science Education (CEMSE), the Institute of Modeling and Simulation Applications (IMSA), and the Office of Undergraduate Studies.  Collectively they are developing, directing, implementing, and evaluating a comprehensive strategy for increasing the number and diversity of undergraduate students seeking and completing baccalaureate degrees in STEM disciplines. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The CU-STEP program is a comprehensive approach involving multiple STEM disciplines. This approach serves to demonstrate to current and prospective STEM students the diverse array of STEM career opportunities. It also reflects the growing interdisciplinary nature of modern STEM research.  Multiple strategies are being developed to generate student enthusiasm for science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  Components of the CU-STEP program are being designed to facilitate student development of skills necessary to advance along their chosen STEM pathway. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. Vital to increasing the number and diversity of students matriculating to Clemson is development of engaging and innovative outreach programs that are enhancing the preparation of secondary students and increasing their interest in attending the University.  CU-STEP is engaged in a number of activities to better prepare entering students and increase the number of students completing baccalaureate degrees in STEM disciplines. These activities include enrichment programs for high school students, proactive mentoring for STEM freshmen, undergraduate research and service learning, and curriculum modifications. These experiences are serving to increase student interest in STEM and to build a pipeline from high school through college. In South Carolina, biotechnology and other STEM-intensive industries are among the most rapidly growing sectors. The CU-STEP activities are introducing these career opportunities to SC students during their high school years and supporting Clemson students throughout their college studies, thus facilitating successful completion of STEM baccalaureates.  In these ways our project is engaged in the development of a technically competent workforce for rapidly growing science and technology-based industries.  \r\n",
