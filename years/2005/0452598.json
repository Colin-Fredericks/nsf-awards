 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is based on a comprehensive multi-scaled, \r\nmulti-disciplinary approach to study complex information age issues that \r\ninvolve the combination of people and the information and communication \r\ntechnologies they use. This study extends work on social actors, \r\ndeveloped through prior NSF-funded research. The social actor is an \r\nempirically derived model of people+ information and communication \r\ntechnologies (ICTs). To make this model useable for a wider community of \r\nresearchers and policy- makers, who need robust models with solid \r\nmeasures of attributes and behaviors that conflate people and their \r\ntechnologies, some formalization of the social actor is required. Using \r\nmetrics derived from institutional theory, appropriate measures based on \r\nsocial actor concepts will be developed and related to formal models and \r\ntheories of cognitive understanding and collaborative decision making to \r\nestablish a better basis for reasoning about ICT-infused environments. A \r\ntheoretically supported, empirically grounded, social actor model will \r\nthen be used to simulate dynamic agents, with scenarios developed in \r\ncollaboration with RAND organization researchers. The empirical work \r\nwill involve modeling social actors as people + IC in organizational and \r\ninstitutional settings using agent-based systems (ABS). Agent-based \r\nmodeling allows a researcher to examine complex adaptive systems with \r\nsophisticated computational models that integrate empirical research and \r\nformal modeling. These systems help researchers and policy-makers \r\nexplore the dynamic issues that attend the complex interactions of \r\ncollaborative and competitive social units.\r\n\r\n",
