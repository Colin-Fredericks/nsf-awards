 "awd_abstract_narration": "San Diego County is an internationally-recognized \"hotspot\" of biodiversity.\r\nIt's climatic, geographic, and geologic features support the greatest\r\nfloristic diversity of any county in the contiguous U.S., making it more\r\ndiverse than some entire states. This diversity is threatened by rapid\r\nurbanization and associated habitat loss. Recent wildfires burned almost 25%\r\nof the county, underscoring the urgency and significance of collecting and\r\npreserving plant specimens to document this remarkable floristic diversity\r\nbefore it is lost. The pace of regional development has left land managers\r\nwith limited scientific data on local flora, along with mounting\r\nresponsibilities for stewardship and informed decision-making. Crucial\r\ndecisions made here affect the future of national biodiversity and they must\r\nbe made with the most comprehensive, scientifically sound, information\r\npossible. The San Diego County Plant Atlas (Plant Atlas) will address these\r\nneeds by scientifically documenting the county's floristic diversity through\r\nthe collection of voucher plant specimens for the San Diego Natural History\r\nMuseum (SDNHM); the independent non-profit organization overseeing the\r\nproject. Voucher specimens (dried and pressed plants, mounted on archival\r\npaper with a data label, and filed in the herbarium) are the raw materials\r\nfor various scientific disciplines. The associated data (including\r\ngeographic coordinates plus detailed taxonomic and ecological information)\r\nare stored in a web-accessible, searchable electronic database. This creates\r\na comprehensive, centralized source of botanical information for the county\r\nand includes both historic and new data that are based upon actual specimens\r\nrather than observations that can no longer be verified. Specimen and data\r\ncollections are made and submitted by \"parabotanists\"; volunteers from the\r\ncommunity trained by a novel program developed and taught by the SDNHM staff\r\n(but identification of all specimens is verified by a professional\r\nbotanist). This creates sufficient workforce to collect specimens over a\r\n5-year period within an organized, county-wide grid system that complements\r\nthe county-wide bird and mammal atlas projects. \r\n\r\nThe collections will be maintained by the SDNHM for education, informed land\r\nmanagement and decision-making, and to support scientific research on\r\nbiodiversity, phytogeographic history, biogeography, taxonomy, anatomy,\r\nmorphology, reproductive biology, and genetics. Besides acting as a model\r\nprogram for other regions, the training and publicity from the novel\r\nparabotanist program increases the community's awareness and respect for\r\nlocal natural history (and the national, if not global significance of the\r\nlocal flora), and strengthens their role as stakeholders, stewards, and\r\nparticipants in regional botanical science. This collaborative project has\r\nthe support and participation of state and local government, NGO's, the\r\nprivate sector, academia, and both professional and lay individuals.\r\nEducational links with garden clubs, conservation groups, and other\r\ninstitutions like schools and universities are being developed. San Diego\r\nCounty contains a rich heritage of botanical diversity and we have an\r\nobligation to better understand and preserve it for ourselves and for future\r\ngenerations.  The Plant Atlas project will increase our knowledge of the\r\ndiversity and distribution of plants in the county, share that knowledge\r\nwith specialized and public audiences, and contribute to conservation,\r\neducation, science and sound land management.  \r\n",
