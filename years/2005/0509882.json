 "awd_abstract_narration": "The style of convection beneath the Earth's tectonic plates is one of the outstanding\r\nquestions in solid earth geophysics. The lack of direct constraints on mantle flow makes\r\nit difficult to determine how and on what scale global convective flow interacts with plate\r\nmotions beneath major plate boundaries. Recent advances in seismic imaging of the\r\nmantle's anisotropic structure have the potential to provide important new constraints on\r\nthese flow patterns. Seismic anisotropy results from the preferred alignment of olivine\r\ncrystals in the sub-lithospheric flow field, and thus provides a direct estimate of the\r\ndirection of mantle flow. To date, most studies comparing observations of seismic\r\nanisotropy to predictions of mantle flow have focused on either broad patterns of\r\nanisotropy associated with global mantle convection or on regional studies at plate\r\nboundaries that neglect the global flow field. However, abundant seismic evidence\r\nindicates that regional flow associated with local plate motions and lithospheric structure\r\ninteracts with global convective flow in a more complicated way than can be explained\r\nby current models. In this study the PIs will construct a series of 3-D numerical\r\nsimulations to investigate the interaction between global convective flow and regional\r\nflow associated with strike-slip faults, such as the San Andreas. First, global flow models\r\nwill be constructed that incorporate flow driven by plate motions and mantle density\r\nheterogeneity on a coarse resolution grid. The flow field derived from these models will\r\nbe used as boundary conditions on high-resolution regional scale models centered on the\r\nfault zone. The predicted anisotropy derived from these detailed regional models will be\r\ncalculated using a series of proxies for the development of lattice preferred orientation\r\n(LPO) in mantle rocks and compared to surface wave and shear-wave splitting data in\r\nstrike-slip environments. This study will improve our understanding of the relationship\r\nbetween mantle flow, LPO, and seismic anisotropy. Understanding the pattern of mantle\r\nflow beneath major strike-slip faults is important in order to quantify the tectonic forces\r\nalong strike-slip plate boundaries, as well as to determine seismic hazards associated with\r\nthese faults. The results of this project are directly relevant to many NSF sponsored\r\nprograms such as Margins, Ridge2000, CSEDI, and Earthscope.",
