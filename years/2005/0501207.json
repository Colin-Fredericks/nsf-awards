 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of purity that arises in abelian group theory and, more generally,\r\nmodule theory may be developed (Crawley-Boevey) in the setting of a locally finitely\r\npresented category. The prototypical example of such a category is the category of\r\nflat (left) modules over a ring R. The pure-injective objects of the category of\r\nflat R-modules are the flat cotorsion modules. The existence of cotorsion envelopes\r\nin the category of left R-modules is a consequence of the Flat Cover Conjecture\r\n(proved by Bican, El Bashir and Enochs). The project proposes to develop a theory of\r\nflat cotorsion modules that generalizes the classical theory of pure-injective modules\r\nover R.\r\n\r\nRing Theory is the area of Algebra that concentrates on the interaction between possible\r\nnotions of multiplication and addition. The representation theory of rings, better known\r\nas Representation Theory, is devoted to the study of modules. These mathematical structures\r\ngeneralize the concept of a vector space and provide a medium where such instances of\r\nmultiplication and addition may manifest themselves. The Model Theory of Modules proposes\r\nto understand modules from the point of view of Mathematical Logic. Thus one is not only\r\ninterested in solving linear equations, but also in deciding when a sentence in the \r\nappropriate formal language becomes true when it is assigned a given interpretation.\r\nThe modules that arise most naturally from this point of view (and are the subject of\r\nthis project) are the pure-injective, or algebraically compact, modules. They also occur\r\nprominently in the classical (non-logical) approach to Representation Theory and so provide\r\nfruitful ground for further interaction between Algebra and Mathematical Logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
