 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on NP-hard optimization problems arising from the rapid development of Computer\r\nNetworks. This research proposes to investigate the development of efficient combinatorial algorithms\r\nfor wired and wireless networks. The project also involves improving the existing algorithms for\r\nfundamental graph optimization problems that have direct applications in networking. The PI proposes\r\nto concentrate on fast generation of approximate solutions. In addition, the algorithms for wireless\r\nnetworks must use only local information.\r\nSpecifically, the PI intends to accomplish the following research items in this project:\r\n.. devise efficient approximation algorithms to increase bandwidth utilization in quality-of-service\r\nmulticasting.\r\n.. devise efficient distributed algorithms for maintaining connectivity in ad hoc wireless networks\r\nand sensor networks, while minimizing the energy consumption and extending the network's\r\nlifetime. The PI will analyze the communication complexity of the algorithms and their behavior\r\nwith imprecise input data and node failure. The research will start by concentrating on static\r\nnetworks, while always considering extensions to mobile networks. Once the problems arising\r\nfrom static ad-hoc wireless networks are better understood, the PI will concentrate on mobility.\r\n.. devise efficient approximation algorithms for several graph connectivity problems.\r\n.. identify and solve new optimization problems arising in the next generation of computer networks.\r\nThe new methods will be grounded on provably good algorithms with guaranteed worst-case performance,\r\nand extensive empirical studies that thoroughly test the algorithms' efficiency in simulations\r\non available industrial data. The developed algorithms and their implementations will be widely distributed\r\nto practitioners in order to enable a more complete understanding of the optimization problems\r\nin these application areas. The intelectual merit of this proposal consists of advances in the techniques\r\nof design and analysis of algorithms and the understanding of the underlying combinatorial structure\r\nof several graph optimization problems.\r\nThe main educational goal of this project is to improve the preparation of graduate and undergraduate\r\nCS majors at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in theoretical computer science. The grant would\r\nbe used to support a research group of graduate and undergraduate students.\r\nThe project's impact will be increased by supporting seminars and workshops which benefit a diversity\r\nof students and researchers. The PI's service agenda is centered on recruitment of talented students\r\nfor theoretical research, as part of the broader impacts of the proposed research.",
