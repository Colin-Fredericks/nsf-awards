 "awd_abstract_narration": "Living cells must communicate with each other and with their environment and respond appropriately.  This communication is generally mediated by cell surface receptors (CSRs) which receive information in the form of signalling molecules that bind to the receptors (ligands)and respond to that infomation via a signal transduction cascade that leads to a cellular response.  Thus, CSRs provide the physical/functional interface between the cell and its environment.  It is known that cell phenotype and function are correlative with changes in the cell surface, including the dynamic expression and/or distribution of  CSRs.    However,  the  present  capacity  to  track  these  potential  targets  and  signals  of  cell function is limited by both biological complexity and a lack of experimental tools.  In fact, there exists no current method to quantify this critical signature of cell state at the level of single cells within  heterogeneous  populations,  as  a  function  of  real-time  response  to  stimuli,  and  with molecular  resolution.  This  constraint  is  illustrated  by  the  increasingly  frequent  use  of combinatorial  approaches, high-throughput  screening.to  find  cell  types,  biochemical  factors, and  synthetic  substrata  that  result  in  the  desired  cell  response.  From a bioengineering perspective, there is much that could be done to benefit society (e.g., tissue  and targeted  drug  delivery  engineering) if  we  had  the  capacity  to  observe dynamic  cell-cell  and  cell-substrate  interactions  in  the  context  of  CSR  presence,  distribution, and function. From a basic fundamental perspective, there are many important but as-yet-unanswerable questions about cell surface receptor organization and function and how these effect signal transduction mechanisms that could be addressed if we had the capacity to observe these things simultaneously, in real time, with molecular resolution.  Dr. VanVliet suggests that such knowledge and the concurrent goal of engineered cell function will be enabled via biofunctionalized nanomechanical imaging of the CSR landscape on living cells.  This approach, if successful, will enable unparalleled access to real-time changes in the molecular profile of living cell surfaces, as a function of systematic variation of genetic, biochemical and mechanical stimuli. Dr. VanVliet has previously demonstrated, via collaborative investigations of nanomechanical instabilities  in  inorganic  crystals,  that dynamic  structural  adaptations  within  materials  can  be measured,  induced,  and  predicted  via  contact  deformation  of  surfaces  at  atomistic/molecular length scales.  In this Nanoscale Exploratory Research project, these powerful capabilities will be developed for dynamic living cell surfaces, in order to  extend  fundamental  understanding  of  the  CSR  interface  through  quantitative,  simultaneous structural and biochemical imaging via nanomechanical contact.   \r\n\r\nThe objective is to capitalize on the potential of scanning probe microscopy and molecular force spectroscopy to develop a powerful new in vitro cell surface imaging approach through direct, reversible binding between a chemically functionalized mechanical probe and the living  cell  surface.  This approach,  termed  functionalized  force  imaging  (FFI),  will  quantify  the real-time spatial and temporal distribution of CSRs and internal but near-surface cytoskeletal structure. FFI presents several distinct advantages over existing approaches for CSR analysis: This contact-based imaging does not require cleavage of the cell from its substratum, is not restricted to the analysis of proteins for which purified antibodies are available, and reveals the distribution and relative  binding  affinity  of  CSRs  that  can  be  tracked  over  time  within  individual  cells.    This project  focuses  on  the  development  of  two  specific  aspects  critical  to  the  feasibility  of nanomechanical  CSR  mapping  in  living  cells:  (1)  rapid,  spatially  biased  acquisition  of  both intermolecular  forces  and  structural/mechanical  surface  profiles;  (2)  validation  of  receptor binding  specificity  in  a  model  cell  system  for  which  the  number  of  CSRs  per  cell  can  be controlled and quantified through complementary experimental techniques. These objectives will enable the PI.s longer-term goals which include identifying mesenchymal stem and progenitor cell-specific CSR profiles, and then tracking and guiding the differentiation of these cells through external  mechanical  stimuli  for  applications  ranging  from  tissue  engineered  vasculature  to chemomechanical sensors.   \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the research will include a new, quantitatively rigorous experimental  tool  that  will  catalyze  innovative,  cross-disciplinary  investigations  of chemomechanical coupling in biological systems.  This broader impact of this project includes a  new  laboratory-based  course  on  nanomechanical  biological  experimentation  that  will  be offered to undergraduates of MIT, Wellesley College, and Brandeis University, and that will be co-instructed by the graduate research assistant participating in the above research objectives. This proposal addresses the Biosystems at the Nanoscale research and education theme of the NSF NES solicitation.  \r\n\r\n",
