Unfortunately carbon nanotubes have little specificity, showing similar responses for all either electron donating or electron accepting molecules. Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanotubes are expected to have several advantages over carbon nanotubes for sensor applications.  The ability to change the metal within the layered structural motif will make the nanotubes more or less selective for different classes of molecules.  These materials are being prepared by a variety methods and  their physical properties and their interaction with donor and acceptor molecules will be investigated to determine their sensitivity and specificity in sensor applications.  Theoretical calculations are also being done in order to gain further insight into the TMD nanotube/molecule(analyte) interactions.  Various theoretical methodologies ranging from large-scale correlated wavefunction electronic structure approaches will be used, through density functional methodologies, all the way to approximate model potential approaches. The synergy between experiment and theory is a unique aspect of this work.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this work includes: 1) Synthesis and characterization of an exciting new class of materials that will be applicable to sensors and potentially to other nanoscale electronic devices, 2) Validation of a theoretical methodology that will form the core of a tool chest for modeling of nanoscale systems.  The broader impacts of this study are: 1) Development of sensitive and specific sensors for the detection of explosives and molecules of biological interest resulting in a safer society, 2) Recruiting and educating a diverse population of undergraduate students, graduate students and post docs into an interdisciplinary research environment, with exposure to both experimental and theoretical methodologies of sensor development.  This will train the next generation of effective workers for high technology industries\r\n\r\n\r\n",
