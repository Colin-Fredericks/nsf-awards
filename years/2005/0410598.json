 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for: \r\nUS-Portugal International Workshop on Earthquake Engineering Research Using NEES Facilities, CMS proposal 0410598\r\nPI: Pedro Silva, U. Missouri-Rolla\r\n\r\nThe main plan for this proposal is to assemble a team of U.S. and Portuguese researchers \r\nthat will actively participate in an international workshop to be held in Portugal. This international workshop will  focus  on  establishing  research  partnerships  between  U.S.  and Portuguese scientists in the field of earthquake engineering research. These research partnerships will be established within the George E.  Brown, Jr. Network  for Earthquake  Engineering Simulation  (NEES)  collaborative  goals,  which  emphasize  shared  use  and  timely  access  to research  data.  In  particular  it  is  expected  that  these  research  partnerships  will  lead  to  the formulation of Grand Challenge (GC) NEESR projects among international collaborators. \r\n\r\nA new era in earthquake engineering research is upon us. Today the George E. Brown, Jr. Network  for  Earthquake  Engineering  Research  (NEES)  is  attempting  to  revolutionize earthquake-engineering research to a more predominant multidisciplinary, multi-institutional and \r\nworldwide collaboration. Under NEES, 16-research equipment sites are  currently in the final stages of construction and are geographically distributed around the U.S. An important feature of \r\nthese NEES research facilities is the teleobservation and teleoperation capabilities, which allows \r\nresearchers at different locations to observe and operate the same physical test at one site. This \r\nfeature of teleconferencing can benefit the exchange of information between institutions, while \r\nsimultaneously  expanding  the  experimental  capability  of  many  research  institutions.  NEES \r\nequipment portfolio for improving the seismic design and performance  of the U.S. civil and \r\nmechanical  systems  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  education  and  training  of  the \r\nnext-generation engineers. Under NEES these research facilities will be open to a large number \r\nof researchers for conducting research in the field of earthquake  engineering. This without a \r\ndoubt will propel the field of earthquake engineering research to new horizons. \r\n\r\nThe goal for establishing NEES was to provide a national and international resource that \r\nwill shift the emphasis of earthquake  engineering research  from current reliance on physical \r\ntesting to integrated  experimentation, computation, theory, databases, and model-based \r\nsimulation. Over the next 10  years, and starting in 2004, another main goal of the NEES \r\nconsortium is to add other research facilities in the US and around the world.  In line with this \r\ngoal; the main objective of the proposed international workshop is to develop research ties \r\nbetween researchers from the U.S. and Portugal. Participants in this international workshop will \r\ncomprise of U.S. and Portuguese researchers in the field of seismic design of civil infrastructures. \r\nThe PI expects to assemble a team of 10 researchers from the U.S. and an equal number from \r\nPortugal. \r\n\r\n",
