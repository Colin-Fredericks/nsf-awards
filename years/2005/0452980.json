 "awd_abstract_narration": "Corporate executives comprise a small but important part of the labor market. As the\r\nmain decision makers in public corporations, top officers have been responsible for a large\r\nfraction of assets in the economy ever since the separation of ownership from control at the turn\r\nof the century. Although finance and labor economists have analyzed the market for managerial\r\npersonnel extensively during the past 20 years, far less is known about the evolution of the\r\nmarket during earlier times. This project fills in the gap by constructing the first consistent panel\r\ndataset on executive compensation to extend from the 1930s to the present. These data are\r\nessential for understanding the evolution of managerial pay and the rise of professional managers\r\nover the course of the twentieth century.\r\nIntellectual Merits\r\nAlthough recent changes in executive compensation are well documented, an\r\nunderstanding of longer run trends has been hampered by a lack of consistent data. Previous\r\nresearchers have studied managerial pay for short periods of time, but variation in methodologies\r\nacross studies prohibits using these data to construct consistent trends over a long horizon. This\r\nproject solves this problem by collecting data on executive compensation from historical\r\ncorporate reports. Due to requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission,\r\nthese documents have provided annual information on the compensation of top officers in\r\npublicly traded firms ever since the late 1930s. Because the reporting requirements have not\r\nchanged significantly over time, these data will allow for different components of executive pay\r\nto be measured consistently for most of the twentieth century.\r\n Obtaining consistent estimates of both the level and components of managerial pay will\r\ncontribute a significant new insight into how the market for corporate executives has changed\r\nover time. Furthermore, this project will be the first to provide consistent estimates of how the\r\nrelationship between pay and firm performance has changed over time, thereby improving our\r\nunderstanding of the optimality of contracts and their effects on the long-run performance of the\r\neconomy. Finally, this project will shed light on the interaction between tax policy and trends in\r\nincome inequality during the past 70 years. By studying how top officers have been able to shift\r\nincome out of taxable forms during different tax regimes, this project will advance the current\r\nknowledge on the behavioral responses to taxation from top income earners.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nHistorical data on executive compensation are necessary to address numerous questions\r\nthat span a wide range of subjects including the market for managers, organizations, contract\r\ntheory, corporate finance, and tax policy. Because these topics exceed the scope of the proposed\r\nresearch agenda, the data will be of interest to many other social scientists. Once this project is\r\ncomplete the dataset will be made available to the public, providing other researchers with an\r\nopportunity to expand their own work.\r\nThis project also has several important implications for public policy. An improved\r\nunderstanding of how high-income earners respond to tax rates can inform the discussion on\r\noptimal tax policy, tax revenues, and income redistribution. Corporate executives have always\r\nbeen among the top 1% of the income distribution. Thus, understanding the response of these\r\nhigh income individuals to changes in tax rates is critical for determining whether changes in tax\r\npolicy will have the intended consequences. Moreover, a study on the long-run trends in\r\nexecutive pay adds an important historical perspective to the unprecedented levels of income\r\ninequality between executives and workers that have been experienced during the past decade.\r\nThe effects of past policies on the absolute and relative levels of pay should be an important\r\nconsideration in the current debate concerning the recent excesses in executive compensation.",
