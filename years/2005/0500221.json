 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nevins will carry out two clusters of projects combining ideas, methods,\r\nand problems of algebraic geometry with those of representation theory and\r\nmathematical physics.  The first collection of problems introduces two new\r\nalgebro-geometric methods into the study of integrable systems and\r\nproposes to solve a collection of established problems in that area; these\r\nmethods are also expected to illuminate the geometry of certain algebraic\r\nvarieties and provide a new tool in representation theory.  The second\r\ncollection of problems focuses on deepening and generalizing the technique\r\nof \"motivic integration\" from algebraic geometry to unify, extend, and\r\nexplain several facets of the geometry of singular algebraic varieties.\r\n\r\nPolynomial equations are among the simplest kinds of mathematical\r\nequations, yet an understanding of the sets of solutions of such equations\r\nhas remarkable utility in a wide variety of practical problems.  Nevins\r\nwill apply techniques from the geometric study of polynomial equations, a\r\nfield known as ``algebraic geometry,'' to explore and explain the behavior\r\nof both particle systems and wave motion in mathematical physics.  In the\r\nopposite direction, he will expand on methods inspired by very recent\r\ndevelopments in string theory and will apply these methods to elucidate\r\nthe fundamental structure of the solution sets of polynomial equations.\r\n\r\n",
