 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Proof of Concept project aims to create an innovative, next-generation undergraduate virology textbook (entitled \"Understanding Viruses\") and ancillary materials.  The rapid pedagogical changes occurring in lower and upper division science instruction require textbooks that also reflect emphasis on active learning and critical thinking.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The \"Understanding Viruses\" textbook concept integrates previously disconnected virology principles into a single resource, providing the student with a more global, conceptual approach to understanding viruses, host-virus interactions, and molecular biology concepts.  Additional linkages are made with history and epidemiology as well as molecular virology and pathogenesis.  Hence, these new instructional materials are significantly improved in content and lead to improved pedagogical preparation of faculty.  In addition, ancillary materials such as an Instructor's Toolkit are being created, emphasizing pedagogical flexibility, and allowing instructors to customize particular areas of their course. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The impact of the \"Understanding Viruses\" textbook and ancillary materials on student learning and faculty instruction is addressed by an external evaluator who has a strong disciplinary background in cell biology and microbiology, as well as pedagogical expertise in biology education and experience as an author of a microbiology textbook.  To facilitate the assessment of book chapters by faculty reviewers, the consultant's evaluation tool is implemented as an on-line assessment portal.  Capable faculty with recent and relevant experience in virology education and research at eight different, diverse institutions (including some anonymous peer review) are evaluating the new materials.   The textbook's impact on students is measured as their mastery of information as well as their pathways to learning.  The textbook is to be distributed nationally through a major textbook publisher.",
