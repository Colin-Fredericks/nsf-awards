 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching objective of the work proposed here is to support a productive interdisciplinary collaboration that will simultaneously generate meaningful quantitative research results in the neurosciences and foster the acquisition of the physiological background that will permit me to develop an independent research program in quantitative modeling of neuronal morphogenesis.  The proposed work will be performed at the Center for Collaborative Neuroscience at Rutgers University, and will focus on developmental and regenerative mechanisms associated with Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons and their associated glia.  This work will involve two research projects to be performed under the guidance of Prof. Wise Young, MD PhD and Chair of Cell Biology & Neuroscience, and Prof. Martin Grumet, PhD and Director of the Center, in close collaboration with appropriate faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and visiting scientists affiliated with the Center.  The aims of this work are to quantitative test the hypotheses that morphogenesis of Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurites in vitro can be well described by a stochastic model, and that the function of such stochastic morphogenesis is to efficiently explore space in search of targets.  The approach that will be used to achieve these aims will involve direct numerical simulations of axonal and glial structures that are validated and modified to accord with 3D imaging of neuronal cultures.  Throughout this work, the guiding objective will be to use modeling to derive concrete, testable predictions.\r\n\r\nThis IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).\r\n",
