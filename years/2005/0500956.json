 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n \r\nA group from Cornell University will perform theoretical and experimental\r\nstudies of a qualitatively new approach to ultrashort pulse-generation:\r\nself-similar pulse shaping. This regime is remarkable because\r\nmonotonically-evolving, asymptotic solutions of the governing wave equation\r\nexist inside a laser, despite the requirement that the field reproduce\r\nitself after each traversal of the cavity.  Self-similar pulses exist with\r\nmuch greater energies than can be produced stably by other means.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives of this work include\r\n* the development of complete understanding of a mode-locked laser in which\r\nthe pulse undergoes large changes as it traverses the laser cavity\r\n* optimization of the performance of  self-similar  fiber lasers\r\n* the demonstration of femtosecond fiber lasers that offer performance\r\ncomparable to, and even exceding, that of solid-state lasers\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed research extends well beyond fiber lasers. The\r\nconcepts developed in this project will bear on a range of topics, from the\r\nfundamental science of nonlinear dynamical systems to commercial laser\r\ninstruments. \r\n \r\nFiber lasers that generate femtosecond-duration optical pulses have great\r\npotential for expanding the range of short-pulse optical techniques into\r\nreal-world  applications such as machining, and diagnosis and treatment of\r\ndisease, for example. Self-similar fiber lasers have clear commercial\r\npotential. The performance of solid-state lasers can also be enhanced\r\nsubstantially by this concept.\r\n \r\nThe student working on this project will gain experience ranging from theory\r\nand numerical simulations to the most technical aspects of fiber optics.\r\n",
