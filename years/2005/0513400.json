 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and Department of Energy (DOE), will take place at the Universidad Autonoma \"Benito Juarez\" de Oaxaca, Mexico, in July 2006 on the topic of computational science and engineering.  The Institute, organized by Dr. Jose E. Castillo, San Diego State University, will consist of a combination of lectures, short courses, discussions and hands-on computer labs. It will involve approximately 40 participants from the United States and Latin America, including graduate students and junior and established investigators, and about 8 instructors (internationally recognized scientists, active in the field). \r\n\r\nThe content of the courses will include research in areas of computational fluid dynamics, numerical optimization, parallel computing, grid generation, scientific visualization and numerical linear algebra.  Special presentations by renowned scientists from industry and academia on the above and other appropriate topics will be given. The program will introduce students to the realm of current methods of research utilized in the US and other advanced countries. These activities will promote collaborative efforts among researchers in the field of computer and engineering sciences of the western hemisphere. Materials presented at the Institute will be posted in a designated web site for further dissemination to the scientific community and to the public at large. \r\n\r\n",
