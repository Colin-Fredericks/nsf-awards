 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Amy Rogers and her collaborators at Delaware State University will construct a laboratory consisting of linked computers with appropriate configuration and software to permit computer-aided telephone data collection. The instrumentation is also appropriate for handling, storing and analyzing large media files which contain both quantitative and qualitative data. The laboratory will be used to assess methods to increase comprehension and retention of information from media presentations. Two bi-annual surveys focusing on social issues and the role of the media will also be conducted. The first will focus on health beliefs, practices and knowledge; the second on attitudes and experiences surrounding prejudice and discrimination. Both will examine the impact of the media on perceptions, beliefs and behaviors. A core group of researchers will address a number of related questions including racial phenotype bias, the role of mass media in conflict prevention and resolution, the reintegration of criminal offenders into society and health-related behaviors and risk taking among released offenders. \r\n\r\nThis award will also provide much needed instrumentation for student education and will be accessible to a broad group of both students and faculty. It will serve to strengthen both the research and educational environments at the University.\r\n",
