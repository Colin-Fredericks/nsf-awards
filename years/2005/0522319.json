 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project is aimed at the development of a portable and fully automated chromatographic based analyzer. This analyzer will integrate several proven technologies to produce an automated instrument that is compact, robust and easily implemented for on-line, at-site, or field-ready use, especially where complex HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analyses is needed. Based on both Sequential Injection (SI) protocol and HPLC instrumentation, this device will be fully automated and provide an integrated approach with respect to sample collection, pre-treatment, chemical modification, separation and detection of target analytes. This chemical analyzer will exploit several novel technologies including sequential injection, portable high-pressure syringe pumps and sol-gel HPLC columns in its development. \r\n\r\nThe proposed SI-HPLC instrument will find applications in on-line process control, at-site environmental monitoring or as a multipurpose field-ready analyzer for medical, law-enforcement and military use. Sequential Injection technologies make this analyzer ideally suited for use by untrained personnel or for remote autonomous analysis since sample handling and preparation can be completely automated. Initial targeted use for the SI-HPLC will be for online bioprocess control (e.g. pharmaceuticals) to provide real-time feedback for Quality Control or optimal product yield. \r\n",
