Gorman, University of Virginia\r\nProject Summary\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nRecent NSF initiatives like nanotechnology and convergent technologies emphasize collaboration across not only scientific and engineering disciplines, but also social sciences and humanities (Roco & Bainbridge, 2001, 2002). Science-technology studies (STS) is evolving new theoretical frameworks based on trading zones, shared expertise and moral imagination that show promise for understanding and facilitating\r\nthese collaborations (Gorman, 2002, 2003a, 2003b).\r\n\r\nThis proposal has three goals:\r\na) Developing a framework for analyzing and facilitating interdisciplinary\r\ncollaboration in science and technology, based upon linking the concepts of\r\ntrading zones and interactional expertise;\r\nb) Adding an ethics/values component via the concept of moral imagination;\r\nc) Applying the framework to the convergence between nanoscience,\r\nbiotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science (\"NBIC\").\r\nThe method will be a workshop that brings together participants from STS, ethics and\r\nindustry. It will be held at Arizona State University's Decision Theater, a facility\r\ndesigned to encourage collaboration among different stakeholders.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThis workshop includes an interdisciplinary group of participants (see below) who\r\nwould never appear at a society meeting together. Their work will have an impact on how\r\nconverging technologies can be introduced in ways that promise social as well as\r\ntechnological progress. Results will also be relevant to the emerging fields of Earth\r\nSystems Engineering Management and Service Science.\r\nResults will be disseminated via:\r\no A volume of edited papers from the workshop;\r\no Articles in journals like Science, Technology & Human Values and IEEE\r\nTechnology & Society.\r\no On a web-site maintained at Arizona State University\r\n",
