Point-referenced spatial\r\ndata arises in several fields, including atmospheric science, ecology, \r\nenvironmental science, and epidemiology. In fact, often such data is \r\nreplicated across time say through sampling at monitoring sites. In \r\ncertain cases, with appropriate preliminary manipulation, the\r\nreplicates may be viewed as independent. More often, the temporal \r\ndependence is retained and, discretizing time, a time series of\r\nspatial processes emerges. In either case, virtually all of the\r\nmodeling for the spatial processes is specified parametrically; in fact, \r\nit is almost always a Gaussian process which is most frequently\r\nassumed to be stationary. The investigators study new classes of \r\nnonparametric spatial models to remove these assumptions. These models \r\nare applicable to either of the above replicated settings. In its \r\nsimplest form, the investigators use Dirichlet processes to create \r\nrandom spatial processes, which are non-Gaussian, nonstationary, and \r\nhave non-homogeneous variance. These processes are defined through\r\ntheir finite dimensional distributions, and are referred to as spatial \r\nDirichlet processes. A spatial Dirichlet process is then convolved\r\nwith a pure error process to create an illustrative spatial process\r\nwith a nugget component. Such models are hierarchical and can be\r\nfitted through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In application, the \r\ninvestigators use spatial Dirichlet processes to introduce spatial\r\nrandom effects into the modeling, either directly with independent \r\nreplicates or embedded within a dynamic model to handle temporal \r\ndependence. The investigators study an assortment of problems\r\nassociated with the use of spatial Dirichlet processes, including\r\ntheir theoretical global and local properties; their use as mixing\r\nmodels; their use with semiparametric mixing; their implementation in \r\ndynamic models; their utilization for interpolation at given time\r\npoints and for forecasting at future time points; their use with \r\nnon-Gaussian first stage specifications for the data; their use in \r\ndescribing multivariate distributions and, as a special case, for \r\nextended regression modeling; their use in modeling spatial point \r\nprocess data; and their extension to richer classes of so-called \r\ngeneralized spatial Dirichlet processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPoint-referenced spatial data arises in application areas as diverse \r\nas environmental science, climatology, ecology, epidemiology, and\r\nreal estate markets. As researchers collect more and more space and \r\nspace-time data, the need for analyses to enhance their understanding \r\nof the complex processes they are sampling grows. This inspires the \r\nneed for sufficiently rich models to accommodate a variety of global\r\nand local behaviors. The primary motivation for this research is to \r\nexpand the catalog of space-time modeling tools available to such \r\nscientists. This research work suggests the first approach to \r\nnonparametric Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal data analysis. \r\nNonparametric Bayesian approaches have witnessed increased utilization \r\nin recent years as a result of their successful application to certain \r\nproblems in, for example, engineering and biomedical fields.\r\nSimilar success is anticipated by bringing this methodology to \r\nspace-time settings. In particular, it is anticipated that, for fields \r\nsuch as epidemiology, environmental contamination and weather\r\nmodeling, researchers will value the flexible modeling framework the \r\nwork offers. And, an increase in usage of the methodology is expected \r\nas the computational techniques to fit the models are advanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
