 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the acquisition of Auto-Montage digital imaging instrumentation, DNA extraction and amplification equipment, and equipment associated with multiple vouchering of specimens for biological analyses at a multi-user resource lab at the University of Nebraska State Museum.  The instrumentation will be used by a number of investigators for diverse research projects including: (1) phylogenetics, (2) population genetics, (3) phylogeographic analyses, (4) three-dimensional morphometric analyses, and (5) bioinformatics and digital imaging. The equipment will provide leading edge technology and methodology that will allow for complete vouchering of specimens, including digital images, frozen tissues, dried tissues, and DNA sequences. Rigorous vouchering standards for specimens that are associated with molecular analyses are essential so that vouchers can be easily tracked, retrieved, and their identification verified. Voucher specimens form the basis for repeatability, a cornerstone of the scientific method.  Whole specimen vouchering will create a virtual collaboration where data are synthesized, assimilated, disseminated, and retrieved electronically, thus expediting the manner in which biological research is conducted.\r\n\r\nSpecimen images and on-line resources that are produced with this equipment will  enhance research and education. Remote on-line access to virtual collections, databases, and knowledge will: (1) facilitate multi-investigator and national/international collaborations, (2) empower scientists and the general public in developing nations, (3) accelerate species discovery and biodiversity research, (4) positively impact students and the general public by providing identifications and information necessary for biodiversity management, and (5) allow more efficient utilization of natural resources. Broad and conceptually sound training within the laboratory will allow students to be proficient in biology, bioinformatics, and technology. \r\n\r\nSystematics (the study of biodiversity) is a source of discoveries and new ideas in biology. This Biodiversity Synthesis Laboratory will advance biodiversity research, contribute to the infrastructure of the natural history museum by enhancing its role in DNA banking and genomics, and create predictive frameworks for managing biological resources. Resulting analyses will create the foundation for predicting potential invasive species and biocontrol species and for addressing evolution and adaptive radiation.\r\n",
