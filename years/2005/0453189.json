 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Jackson Laboratory, a non-profit research institute in Bar Harbor, Maine, will conduct an internship program in functional genomics research for 10 undergraduate students within the framework of its existing Summer Student Program. The 11-week summer program - titled \"REU Site: Functional Genomics Research Projects for Undergraduates\" - will offer students hands-on training in interdisciplinary approaches linking the biological, physical, and computational sciences to investigations of genome function. Each student will perform an independent, hypothesis-driven research project as a member of a team under the mentorship of a Ph.D.-level, grant-funded principal investigator. Students will be selected through a competitive nationwide application process that will represent a diverse group with respect to gender, ethnicity, and economic background. Under-represented groups are encouraged to apply and will be actively recruited. Jackson's institutional commitment to the REU program includes providing students with access to intellectual and research resources such as courses and conferences, state-of-the-art instrumentation, and bioinformatics databases; dedicated program direction by the Education Office; and housing in an oceanfront dormitory overseen by professional staff. Jackson offers a stimulating environment in which undergraduates with a passion for hands-on experimental science can contribute to real research progress and make great strides in intellectual and personal growth. Point-of-contact is Dr. Jon R. Geiger, at (207) 288-6749 or summerstudents@jax.org. Additional information and an application are available on-line at http://www.jax.org/education/ssp.html.",
