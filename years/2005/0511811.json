Additionally, the project includes study of the self-assembly of metallic nanostructures that form during epitaxial growth of metallic atoms on various semiconductor surfaces to understand fundamental formation mechanisms. The collaborative project utilizes a wide array of deposition, surface spectroscopic and nanoscale imaging instrumentation to address these issues. The project aims for increased understanding of atomic scale processes governing the formation of ultra thin films and nanostructures on semiconductor surfaces. The increased understanding gained is expected to lead to the ability of the broader scientific and engineering communities to develop optimal ultra thin film and nanostructure fabrication techniques necessary for building faster and smaller electronic devices.\r\nNON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION\r\nThe project addresses fundamental materials research with strong technological relevance to electronics and photonics, and effectively integrates research and education at an undergraduate institution. Undergraduate education will be impacted in a significant and highly effective way through the integration of nanomaterials research into the undergraduate science and engineering education curriculum. The established undergraduate program in materials research and education at Bradley University will be enhanced through the associated research activities. The development of a research-rich environment has made a significant impact on the educational experience of many students. Also, the undergraduates' research experience will be positively influenced through exposure to off-campus researchers through collaborations with the USDA National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, and with two research groups at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Essen, Germany. An additional significant impact will be the establishment of unique collaborations between scientists in the Bradley Physics Department, who take a fundamental approach to nano-materials research, and engineers at Bradley and in industry, who take a practical, applied science approach.\r\n",
