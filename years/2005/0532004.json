Ilinois\r\nA unique professional consortium called the Asia-Pacific Network of Centers on Research of Smart Structures Technologies (ANCRiSST) was established in 2002. The vision of the ANCRiSST is to establish a center-based consortium in the Asian-Pacific region that can better leverage and coordinate limited resources available to each individual entity to develop and implement innovative engineering methods and new enabling technologies that are needed to design, construct, maintain, manage and renew engineering structures for improved performance and safety An international workshop in East Asia on the assessment of the state-of-the-art of the subjects on smart structures and sensor technology will be organized by ANCRiSST from July 21-24, 2005 in Daegue, Korea. The Workshop is intended to summarize research and collaboration achievements during the past three years and forward-look intellectual exercise involving multiple agencies and major universities from the Asia-Pacific region. It will bring together leading researchers in the field to deliver topical presentations and to develop a clear picture of the current status in the field. \r\nTravel support provided by this project will enable a delegation of 12 US researchers to attend this important workshop. Successful completion of this workshop will facilitate broader international research and student exchange and technology transfer through test bed experiments and transfusion of research data, education/training of engineers in the region for smart material research and smart structure design, and implement technology-based hazard mitigation measures.\r\n",
