 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for  collaborative\r\nproject led by archaeologist Dr. Anabel Ford and volcanologist Dr. Frank Spera.\r\n By uniting disciplines to address an archaeological problem, they will identify\r\nthe source(s) of volcanic ash (glass) used as ceramic temper in everyday pottery\r\nof the ancient Maya in the Late Classic Period. The presence of fresh volcanic\r\nash more than 350 km from any volcano that is consistently discovered  in\r\npottery fragments (sherds) from the limestone Maya lowlands is unexpected.  Yet,\r\nsince the 1930s, when Anna O. Sheppard identified volcanic ash in Maya pottery,\r\narchaeologists have been aware of the anomaly. The correct identification of the\r\nvolcanic ash source(s) will enable these scholars to recover critical evidence\r\nof the cultural, ecological, and environmental influences that contributed to\r\nthe rise and fall of the Maya civilization. How did relatively large volumes of\r\nvolcanic ash become available for manufacturing ceramic production when all\r\ntransport was with human effort?  This question has never been answered and the\r\nimplications are significant.\r\n\r\nThis project will use geochemical and volcanological tools to study\r\nthe transport, dispersal, and identification of the volcanic glass shards in the\r\nancient Maya pottery sherds.  Examination will include \r\n1) monitoring the effects of firing on the composition of the glass shards in\r\nthe pottery sherds; \r\n2) assessment of the elements (major, minor, and trace) and isotopic ratios\r\n(strontium and lead) of glass shards in pottery fragments for fingerprinting\r\nvolcanoes; \r\n3) matching the elemental composition of glass shards and associated minerals in\r\npottery sherds to candidate volcanoes in the Central American Highlands and\r\nMexican Volcanic Belt;\r\n 4) simulating patterns of ashfall dispersal to the limestone lowlands for\r\ncandidate volcanoes; and \r\n5) exploring the consequences of volcanic ashfall into the Maya lowland soil,\r\nplant, and animal life.  \r\nThese data will permit the team to address the implications of volcanic ash on\r\nthe cultural development of the Maya and on refining lowland Maya chronology.\r\n\r\nWhile it has been generally accepted that volcanic ash was of non-local origin,\r\nthe anomaly of the presence of pristine, fresh volcanic ash has never been\r\nexplained. Since the best answer is volcanic ashfall from distant volcanoes, the\r\nsolution to the problem requires knowledge of both archaeology and volcanology.\r\n The intellectual merit of this collaboration is that it brings knowledge\r\ngenerated from NSF funding in distinct fields to a joint solution. The\r\narchaeological implications of the volcanological solution has consequences for\r\nunderstanding the economy of ceramic production as well as the ecology of the\r\nMaya forest where volcanoes are at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe broad impacts of the research results promote an innovative approach to\r\nproblem-oriented science requiring the full involvement of distinct fields.\r\nVolcanoes are universally recognized as hazards, but at a distance they can\r\nprovide benefits such as temper for pottery and amendments for soil. Thus, the\r\nresolution of this archaeological issue will expand our understanding of\r\nsociety's interaction with their changing environment.\r\n",
