 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geodesic flows are standard models of conservative (as opposed to\r\ndissipative) dynamics. Large classes of mechanical systems\r\ncan be considered as geodesic flows. This point of view is most\r\nfruitful when the underlying riemannian metric has enough local \r\nsymmetries or when it has negative sectional curvature. The latter case\r\nbelongs to the realm of chaotic dynamics.   \r\n\r\nWe study geodesic flows of Weyl connections (generalizations \r\nof Levi-Civita connections of the riemannian case). \r\nA linear symmetric connection on the tangent bundle is called \r\nWeyl if the parallel transport preserves angles between vectors. \r\nThese flows are models of systems out of equilibrium. \r\nThey were originally considered in physics \r\nliterature under the name of gaussian thermostats.\r\nThe systems have a forcing term accompanied by \r\nthe thermostatting term based on the Gauss' Least \r\nConstraint Principle for nonholonomic constraints. \r\nWe revealed the geometric nature of the systems\r\nwith gausssian thermostats. We showed that also in this generality\r\nif the sectional curvatures are negative the system has \r\nsome hyperbolic properties. However we do not know if it\r\nis enough to force the uniform hyperbolicity (Anosov property).\r\nTo settle such questions we propose to study Weyl connections\r\nwith (local) symmetries. This project has the potential of \r\ndelivering new classes of systems with hyperbolic dynamics,\r\nand/or classifying homogeneous Weyl connections with nonpositive\r\nsectional curvatures.",
