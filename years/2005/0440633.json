 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research explores the dynamics of few- and many-body processes in laser-excited atomic and molecular systems. Norah Berrah of Western Michigan University and a student will travel to France annually to work with the French team led by Denis Cubaynes, a scientist in Laboratoire d'Interaction du Rayonnement X Avec La Matiere at the University of Paris South.  Using high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy and an ion-managing detector, the investigators propose to carry out photo-excitation and photo-ionization experiments on atomic metal vapors and molecules.  They will use different photon sources, including a high spectral-resolution monochromatic photon beam from a third generation radiation source, the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will increase understanding of fundamental VUV photon matter interactions.  It will offer a gas-phase perspective on the basic understanding of correlated systems and will set the stage for future time-resolved studies with Fourth Generation Light Source (Free Electron Laser) which are underway in Europe and the U.S.  For example, time-resolved studies of Auger processes could be investigated with some of the proposed ultra fast light sources.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will provide research training to graduate students and advance their careers through new connections to leading European researchers.  By working with the French team, students will enhance their experimental skills and gain invaluable experience in international collaboration.  The resulting research will also impact other fields and could be considered as an enabling science for nanostructures and highly correlated materials.",
