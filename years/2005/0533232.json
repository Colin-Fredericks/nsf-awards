This is an added activity to the 2005 annual Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications, which is scheduled for July 10 - 13 at this same site.  The integration with a major topology conference  should provide perspective and rigor to this nascent sub-discipline.  The format is \r\nnovel, leaving ample discussion time to engage the attendees in expanding and  refining this emerging interdisciplinary research area.  A main theme for computational topology is the development of efficient algorithms for maintaining the integrity of objects with respect to a variety of topological characteristics.\r\n\r\nAlready, this workshop has garnered led to its organizer, T. J. Peters, being invited to serve as an editor on computational topology for the forthcoming monograph, \"Open Problems in Topology, II\", a volume which is expected to steer research activities for several years.  Attendees will be invited to contribute problems.\r\nGraduate students and post-doctoral associates, from both the traditional topology and computational topology communities, have aggressively been recruited, with an attractive response rate.  Papers from this workshop will also be considered for a special issue of the journal, Applied General Topology.\r\n\r\n",
