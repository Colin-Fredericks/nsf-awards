RESESS consists of a ten-week summer session each year; students may participate in the program during multiple years.  RESESS recruits participants from two-year colleges and other institutions that serve high percentages of underrepresented students. To enhance the retention rate, participants are carefully mentored by a cadre of faculty and other researchers who are educated about the value of undergraduate research and are knowledgeable about activities required to retain individuals from underrepresented populations.    \r\nRESESS is modeled on the successful SOARS program and is integrated with SOARS. UNAVCO leads RESESS. IRIS, UCAR, the University of Colorado, the USGS, Highline Community College, and Central Washington University collaborate in the program and contribute research projects and mentors. Lessons learned from SOARS is being transferred through this project to the geodesy and seismology segments of the geoscience community. This program takes advantage of a distributed research community that can be used as a model for SOARS-like programs which can be developed in places without a centralized research center.  \r\nTrack 2 Research and Education in Solid Earth Science for Students (RESESS): Adapting SOARS to Solid Earth\r\n\r\nRESESS (Research and Education in Solid Earth Science for Students) brings underrepresented students into geodesy and seismology by involving them in cutting-edge research related to earthquakes and transient plate deformation phenomena.
