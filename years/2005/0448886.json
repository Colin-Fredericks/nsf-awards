 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the development of a novel multi-electrode array (MEA), accompanied by a multi-channel recording and simulation system, which will allow stimulating and recording from patterned neuronal networks. This system can be used as a sensory platform for detection of compounds with detectable and/or harmful impact on a nervous system, and it will be a useful tool for neurobiologists to investigate processes of learning and memory on cultured cells. This goal will be met via accomplishing the following milestones: 1) developing a technique for confining a nerve cell solely on the electrode area; 2) establishing methods to enable growth of neurites in pre-defined directions; 3) fabricating a multielectrode array with these unique features; 4) devising an experimental setup, and; 5) investigating effective parameters for the stimulation of cultured neurons. Two implementations of this important tool will be studied: a) determining in vitro toxic levels and signatures of selected neuroactive compounds, and; b) exploring the learning process in simple neuronal circuits.\r\n\r\nThe proposed system can be used as a cell-based sensor system for the detection of neuroactive compounds, as well as for the fabrication of neuronal circuits, which are valuable tools in experimental neuroscience. Additionally, the experimental setup devised will be integrated into the new, inter-disciplinary bioengineering program at Lehigh University. Two new courses will be developed, and an outreach program is proposed in the form of a Micromachine Drawing Contest for elementary and junior-high school students.\r\n",
