This research focuses on how to create intrusion tolerant software at reasonable performance cost. Methods will be devised to detect software intrusions in near real time, so their effects will be easier to tolerate. Using a combination of compiler techniques and architectural support, mechanisms to pin-point tampered values and offer guarantees of recovering original (untampered) values will be investigated. Finally, studies of several optimizations that can support these guarantees without extensive performance degradation will be undertaken. Successful demonstration of these methods could improve protection of critical data and could lead to their use in critical infrastructure systems. The research will also lead to deeper understanding of how to achieve data confidentiality, integrity, and availability simultaneously for systems that must provide continuous service. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
