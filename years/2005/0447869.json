 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inherent non-determinism and dynamism and the communicational limitations of wireless ad hoc and sensor networks force a reexamination of the assumptions and models used for classical networks. There is a need for sound mathematical models to explore the complexities induced by the probabilistic and dynamic interaction of the physical and information processes. Hence, this project focuses on modeling and managing uncertainty in such systems, with the goals of achieving an improved understanding, deriving performance bounds, and developing innovative strategies and guidelines for protocol design, as well as providing cutting-edge research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. The two-pronged research approach includes a theoretical and an experimental component. The multidisciplinary theoretical part combines methodologies from information and communication theory, and random graph theory and stochastic geometry, whereas the experiments are based on a sensor network testbed with mobile elements.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute significantly to the ability to analyze and design robust and resource-efficient static and mobile ad hoc and sensor networks, and it is expected that the broader networking community will benefit from the models and design guidelines. Some models will hopefully be incorporated into standard simulation tools. The research findings are disseminated not only through the traditional channels but also via an educational outreach component, and their broader impact will be felt through the application to other important classes of networks, including multi-hop cellular networks that may soon become significant for a major part of our society.\r\n",
