The workshop is part of an ambitious plan to establish a long-term mutually beneficial collaboration between vision scientists in both the U.S. and China, and to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in addressing some fundamental bottlenecks in computational vision. A widely acknowledged bottleneck is collecting a common data set (on the order of 100,000 images) parsed by human users in a common format. Collecting and parsing such a large data set requires the collective efforts from experts in all vision areas. Participants will learn from each other's experience and discuss a common format in the workshop. Establishing the data set will benefit vision researchers in both U.S. and China in the future and enhance collaboration among participating institutions.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. team includes researchers, junior scientists, and students to attend a joint U.S.-China workshop from universities across the country. The Chinese counterpart group, funded by the National Science Foundation of China, Microsoft Research Institute of Asia, and others, includes scholars from the Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Science; Institute of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, HuaZhong University of Science and Technology; and Microsoft Research Institute Asia.\r\n",
