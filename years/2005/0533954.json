 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at applying grain-boundary engineering to develop high-temperature structural alloys such as Ni-based superalloy and Ti2AlNb intermetallics. Major objective of the proposed project is to develop better understanding of the inter-relationship of processing steps, grain boundary character distribution (GBCD), and creep behavior of high-temperature  structural alloys. The main goals of this study are ; (1) to process microstructures with a distribution of  random and special grain boundaries; (2) to measure grain boundary character distribution (GBCD); (3) to perform creep testing of varied microstructures; (4) to model the effects of grain size, grain boundary sliding, and grain boundary character on mechanical behavior. The project leads to the development of a processing methodology useful to enhance the  mechanical behavior of high-temperature structural materials. The educational outreach component incorporates the research tools used in the research portion of the project and contributes to an increase in the number of undergraduate students majoring in materials science and engineering (MS&E).\r\n%%%\r\nThe research develops new understanding of the deformation mechanisms of structural materials beyond the present state of the art through grain-boundary engineering. The results are applicable for development of better materials for high-temperature applications. \r\n***\r\n",
