The goal of this NSF CAREER Development project is to \r\ndevelop the theoretical foundations, design tools and education programs to enable the \r\nmodern system engineers to effectively and efficiently design embedded software based \r\non hybrid systems theory for performance-critical and safety-critical applications.\r\nThe research has four focus areas of research. (a) Multi-resolution Computation \r\nof Interface Evolution. The focus here is to develop computational methods,\r\nby combining the Level Set Methods with the Multi-resolution Analysis, for computing\r\nthe evolution of interfaces of high-dimensional continuous systems with level-of-control\r\nin solution resolution. (b) Model-Based Computation Platform. The goal is to\r\ndevelop a computation platform that allows systematic construction of algorithms for the\r\ndesign of hybrid systems and enables automatic synthesis of associated embedded\r\nsoftware. (c) Experimental Research. Two experimental testbeds, which are a FPGAbased reconfigurable power electronic circuit and a multi-vehicle \r\nmulti-model system, provide case studies for the computational methods \r\nand software tools developed in this research. (d) Improving Undergraduate and \r\nGraduate Education. The research advancements made in this research \r\nwould be integrated into an Interdisciplinary Curriculum that combines lecture and laboratory instruction in the design of hybrid systems for both undergraduate \r\nand graduate education.  The broader impact on society made by this CAREER Development Plan is the generation of new paradigms and tools for the design \r\nof complex embedded software systems to ensure reliability and performance.\r\n",
