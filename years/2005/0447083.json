 "awd_abstract_narration": "The volume of educational resources available to students is rapidly increasing. In a\r\nwide variety of subject domains, educational resources are now available on the Web\r\nand in educational Digital Libraries. The abundance of resources has created the need\r\nto provide personalized access to educational resources, i.e., to help students find,\r\norganize, and use resources that match their individual goals, interests, and current\r\nknowledge. This project answers that need by developing and exploring a broad range\r\nof innovative techniques for personalized access to open corpus educational resources.\r\nAmong these techniques are adaptive navigation support and adaptive visualization\r\ntechniques, which offer a higher level of interactivity and expressive power and take into\r\naccount not only the users' interests, but also their current knowledge and goals. To\r\nintegrate the results of this research into education, we are developing a system that\r\nuses the most promising techniques to provide students in undergraduate programming\r\ncourses at the University of Pittsburgh with personalized access to a large volume of\r\ndiverse open corpus resources. This system serves as a major evaluation platform for\r\nthe techniques being developed.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on personalized access to educational resources, the project provides\r\nshort-term and long-term broader impacts. The system developed in the course of this\r\nproject maximizes educational opportunities for every student in several large,\r\nprogramming-related undergraduate courses at the University of Pittsburgh. Widely\r\ndisseminated through publications and the project's web site, our personalized\r\ninformation access techniques help thousands of students to harness the educational\r\npower of the Web and Digital Libraries.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sis.pitt.edu/~taler/pacer.html",
