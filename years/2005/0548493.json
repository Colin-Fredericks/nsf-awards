 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\n\r\nWe propose an exploratory project to build a fast and scalable architectural simulation\r\nplatform using clusters of commodity FPGA boards. It is inherently parallel: A FPGA board simulates a\r\nprocessor core, a group of FPGA boards simulates a multicore processor chip, and a cluster of such groups\r\nsimulates a full computing cluster. By careful analysis using the performance data of Xilinx FPGA board,\r\nwe show that the slowdown will be less than two orders of magnitude, which makes full-scale evaluation\r\nfeasible.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, the slowdown of a software simulator will be at least five orders of magnitude. The\r\nsystem is scalable in that one can increase the system size by adding more FPGA boards. The platform is\r\nalso affordable, flexible, and easy to replicate, and can be widely used by industry and academic researchers.\r\n\r\nBoarder Impact\r\n\r\nHigh Performance computing applications have deep impact in our daily life and their computing demand would never be fully satisfied. However, without a fast simulation platform, multicore and multithreaded processors are not being evaluated by large-scale parallel programs until they have been manufactured. The proposed research removes this limit. It will prompt early consideration and evaluation of system-level methods for improving processor efficiency, providing important input to computer architects.\r\n\r\nThus, it may help reduce the trials and errors that would be very expensive and would delay the\r\nimprovement of high performance computing systems. The proposed experiment support will benefit other\r\nresearchers in both computer architecture and high-performance computing communities, and help them see\r\nthe needs of each other before the real machines are available.",
