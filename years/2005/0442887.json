 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Mechanical (56) \r\nThe project is developing undergraduate bioengineering laboratory modules that use small, inexpensive, easy-to-build and programmable autonomous robots. The robots function in a real-world environment, which provides students with an opportunity to develop self-organizational skills while observing emergent behaviors, and experiencing the effects of unexpected environmental factors. Interaction with the robots is reinforcing students' understanding of the complexity of living systems, the importance of interacting with the environment to provide feedback in the face of inherent instability, and the emergence of complex patterns of behavior from simple rules. \r\n\r\nBecause the robots are bring developed as a general educational tool rather than focusing on the mechanics of the robots, the modules and methodologies are transferable and can be used in other STEM courses. The modules are being integrated into introductory mathematics courses at Broome Community College to reinforce students' conceptual understanding of linear motion in introductory mathematics courses. It is also being used as a tool to examine concepts used in describing self-organizing systems. \r\n\r\nThe robots are being used in a summer science outreach program with middle school students to attract girls to engineering and science. To meet girls' needs the methodologies are being developed from recommendations in the AAUW Report (2000), which indicates that girls prefer group-oriented strategies with an emphasis on helping others and working collaboratively, rather than engaging in activities that are based on violence and conflict.\r\n\t \r\nThe project is being disseminated through professional publications and conferences, a website maintained through the Autonomous Robot Lab, and through a local Tech Prep Consortium. \r\n",
