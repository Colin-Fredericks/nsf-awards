 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 12-month award allows the PI to support a workshop, \"US-Spain Workshop on Nanoscale Materials, Madrid, Spain, September 2005.\"  The workshop will focus on emerging scientific areas with promise for growth over the next decade and beyond.  The workshop will, in parallel, focus on developing a research agenda and a funding strategy to begin collaboration.  The US organizers represent two US universities (Georgia Tech and UCSD) as well as Argonne National Laboratory; the Spanish organizers represent the universities of Oviedo and Complutense.\r\n\r\nThe workshop participants will focus on the fundamental aspects of nanofilms and nanoparticles of traditionally bulk metals, superconductors, semiconductors and magnetic materials.  Nanoscale materials will be emphasized, including fabrication, new phenomena, and applications.  The US and Spanish participants have areas of strong overlap and complementary expertise in fields including magnetism, superconductivity and semiconductor physics and devices.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the workshop participants will be researchers in the early stages of their careers, and the workshop is designed to have a strong impact on their careers.  They will have the opportunity to establish international collaborations and experience in another research environment and will be better equipped to participate in other global projects.",
