 "awd_abstract_narration": "Central to an understanding of successful pregnancies is determining how the placenta\r\nattaches itself to the uterine wall of the mother. The outer lining of the placenta contains a layer\r\nof cells (trophoblasts), which have the property of being able to invade the uterine lining, thus\r\nestablishing the placenta. How the invasion process is initiated and regulated is uncertain. In\r\nthis project, the hypothesis that the reproductive hormone leptin stimulates invasiveness of\r\ntrophoblast cells will be investigated in trophoblast cells grown on an artificial, protein-coated\r\nmembrane. Invasive cells secrete enzymes that degrade the protein coating, and permit the cells\r\nto move through tiny pores in the membrane; the number of cells penetrating the membrane are\r\ncounted under a microscope. The ability of leptin to stimulate invasion of trophoblasts from\r\nplacentas at early and late gestation will be examined; we predict that leptin will promote\r\ninvasion only in trophoblasts from early-stage placentas. The molecular mechanisms by which\r\nleptin stimulates invasiveness will be determined by examining changes in intracellular signaling\r\nmolecules and gene expression induced by leptin. Placentas will be studied in species\r\nrepresenting the two most abundant mammalian orders. The mouse placenta does not produce\r\nleptin, but expresses receptors for leptin and is therefore sensitive to leptin actions. The little\r\nbrown bat placenta produces and secretes leptin (as does the human placenta), and like the mouse\r\nplacenta is a target for leptin. The effects of leptin on mouse and bat placental function will be\r\ncompared. Broader impacts of this project include: 1) documentation of the importance of leptin\r\nin establishing the placenta in diverse mammals; 2) understanding the role of leptin as a general\r\nsignal for cell migration and invasion (i.e., in other cell types where leptin is known to act and\r\nwhere cells are invasive); 3) understanding gestational stage-dependent actions of hormones on\r\ntrophoblast cells; and 4) education of young scientists-in-training and outreach to include\r\nparticipation of underrepresented minorities (one postdoctoral fellow, one to two graduate\r\nstudents and four undergraduates students will be mentored per year on this project). \r\n\r\n",
