 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use metal catalyzed copolymerization with highly reactive epoxides to generate polycarbonates using carbon dioxide as a feedstock.  The new, patent-pending catalyst system is extremely efficient, polymerizing epoxides and CO2 under mild reaction conditions without producing common by-products. Furthermore, the polymerization can be controlled such that polycarbonates with a variety of physical and mechanical properties are synthesized. The initial goals of this research proposal will be to determine the commercial viability of this system.\r\n\r\nThe development of sustainable technologies will provide a platform from which U.S. manufacturers can be competitive globally. This technology platform will create value added products that command a premium price and carry an enhanced profit margin.  The use of biorenewable resources, including waste products and CO2 as opposed to petroleum feedstocks, will diminish the negative impact of manufacturers on the environment and preserve resources for economically more meaningful applications. The resulting materials have potential utility in electronics assembly, food packaging, lost foam metal casting, ceramics, energy storage (rechargeable batteries and fuel cells), pyrotechnics and polyurethane foams. \r\n",
