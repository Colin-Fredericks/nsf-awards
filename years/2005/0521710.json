 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer ( STTR) Phase II project proposes the creation of an Advanced Virtual Manufacturing Lab (AVML) for training and education on high-tech CNC machines.  The key elements of the AVML are: (a) textured 3D photo-realistic virtual models of the machines and lab that include the machines' controls and moving parts; (b) semi-empirical model of the machining operation; (c) hierarchical knowledge-base for process training; (d) unstructured knowledge-base for lecture delivery; (e) natural-language human-like intelligent virtual tutors.  In this phase of the research, the AVML will be completed by adding more capabilities, including 5-axis milling and collision detection between the tool and the machine, and enhancing the accuracy and completeness of the machining operation model.  Furthermore, the AVML will be enhanced by incorporating Conversational Programming, different types of machine controllers, and two additional types of machines:  CNC lathe and production-grade 5-axes milling machine.  Pilot implementations will be conducted at a university and two community colleges.  Applications of AVML include: training students to operate manufacturing machines in a safe environment, allowing students and researchers to view and interact with a near-physically accurate simulation of manufacturing machines, and optimization of the manufacturing process plan by testing various plans on the virtual machine before machining on the physical machine.\r\n\r\nManufacturing drives innovation and is a powerful engine of economic growth.  However, US manufacturers face a shortage of workers to run tomorrow's factories.  The AVML will enhance the quality, accessibility, and productivity of manufacturing education and training and will advance scientific discovery and engineering analysis of manufacturing processes.  Also, The AVML will enhance experimentation and learning, increase student creativity and problem-solving capability, enhance collaboration among students, teachers, and industry experts, and promote participation and equal access of underrepresented groups to manufacturing technology training.  Most potential manufacturing workers do not have access to state-of-the-art manufacturing labs that can provide the required training.  The AVML will enable such access.  This success, in turn, will strengthen US manufacturers' competitiveness and further important US national interests.\r\n",
