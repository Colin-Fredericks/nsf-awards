Blank\t\r\nInstitution: CCSSO\t\r\nTitle: Improving Evaluation of Professional Development with Mathematics and Science Teachers though Developing Research-Based Measures of Quality with States and School Districts\r\n\r\nThe proposed project has four key goals: 1) Conduct a survey of the 50 states to assess capacity within the 50 states for collecting, reporting, and analyzing data on teacher professional development including quality of programs. 2) Identify research-based criteria for high quality teacher professional development and use the criteria as a framework for analyzing and selecting local programs in partner states based on the data. 3) Evaluate effectiveness of professional development in a sample of districts in 10 states using research-based criteria of program quality and a value-added model for measuring achievement gains.4) Communicate findings to assist education leaders in all states with improving models for broad-scale evaluation of professional development, identifying key data items and measures of quality, and applying value-added models for determining effects.  Estimate the effects of quality professional development programs on student. The project goals are grounded on research-based findings of effective math and science teacher professional development. These characteristics of effective professional development are intended to guide improvement efforts and resource allocation at state and district levels.  The project would test the relationship of these research-based criteria with student achievement using a value-added model across programs in 10 states and districts in each state. \r\n",
