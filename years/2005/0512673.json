 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator is studying connections between conventional finite element\r\nmethods and the cutting edge discontinuous Galerkin method. Only recently has\r\nit been discovered that the differential operators discretized via these\r\nphilosophically distinct methods have closely related eigenspectra.  The\r\ninvestigator is synthesizing analytical and numerical tools from both fields to\r\nexamine and improve the robustness of the latter method when used with highly\r\nnon-conforming discretization resolution. In addition, the investigator and a\r\ngraduate student are creating an object oriented library which allows\r\nnon-experts to use combinations of these methods through a simple and intuitive\r\ninterface.\r\n\r\nAs new techniques for computational simulation of physical phenomena are\r\ndeveloped, it is extremely important to determine under what circumstances they\r\nperform at their best and in a predictable way. There has been significant\r\ninterest in the recently developed discontinuous Galerkin simulation method,\r\nbecause it can solve large scale problems not readily attainable with existing\r\nmethods. For example, these methods can potentially increase the accuracy,\r\nefficiency, and scope of modeling radar scattering from large complex aircraft.\r\nThe investigator is studying how to predict when this new method will give\r\nphysically reasonable solutions, for example in computing the noise generated\r\nby next generation aircraft. The end product of this investigation will be a\r\nset of guidelines on how and when to best use the methods. Furthermore, the\r\ninvestigator is developing a software library which will ease transfer of these\r\nhigh resolution methods by simplifying the process of rapid prototyping and\r\ntesting of new critical core components for physics simulation tools.\r\n",
