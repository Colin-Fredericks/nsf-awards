 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project considers the construction and analysis of algorithms to\r\nsimulate fluid systems containing elastic components. Polymers, such\r\nas liquid crystals, are an important class of such fluids, and in this\r\ninstance the elastic properties of the molecules are usually\r\nincorporated into a continuum model. Another example is blood flow\r\nwhere the elasticity of the red blood cells gives rise to\r\nnon-Newtonian behavior. This problem was motivated by collaborative\r\nwork with engineers who wish to determine the distribution of and\r\ndamage to red blood cells in the small clearances within mechanical\r\nheart assist devices. Since these clearances are of comparable\r\ndimension to the cells, it is necessary to explicitly model the cells\r\nat the micrometer scale in order to determine their distribution and\r\nthe stresses they experience. The mathematical structure of the\r\nequations modeling viscoelastic polymers and blood are very similar,\r\nand insight gained in one of them sheds light on the other.\r\n\r\nThe ability to simulate the flow of complex materials on a computer is\r\na key technology required for the design and development of many \"next\r\ngeneration\" products, such as micro-mechanical devices, bio-materials,\r\nand prosthetic organs. For example, a major mode of failure in\r\nmechanical heart assist devices is the formation of clots (thrombosis)\r\nwhich are primarily initiated by damage to the red blood cells. This\r\nphenomena is difficult to control and the ability to simulate it on a\r\ncomputer it would represent a breakthrough which would eliminate much\r\nof the expensive and time consuming experimentation currently\r\nrequired. The equations used to model such phenomena are complex and\r\npoorly understood, and much of the research proposed herein is directed\r\nto revealing the theoretical (mathematical) properties of these\r\nmodels. This work complements the more practical approaches undertaken\r\nin the engineering community and at the national laboratories.\r\n",
