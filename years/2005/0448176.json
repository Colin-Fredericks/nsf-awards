 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why do university students exit courses capable of solving difficult \r\nanalytic problems (e.g., calculate current in a complex circuit), but \r\nare unable to explain the same content conceptually (e.g., which light \r\nbulb is brighter in such a circuit)? Which educational activities \r\naddress this challenge and why?\r\n\r\nBuilding on the well-established foundations of physics education \r\nresearch that have focused on student cognition, curriculum design and \r\ncourse practices, this research program establishes another perspective \r\nfrom which we may understand student learning in physics: one that \r\nemphasizes learning in context. That is, how and what students learn \r\ndepends not only on traditionally conceived content but also upon the \r\nformation of tasks, class environments, and broader institutional \r\nstructures in which the content is embedded. Such a perspective begins \r\nto explain a host of research questions, such as the one listed above, \r\nand is directed at understanding sustainable and scalable models of \r\nreform in physics education.\r\n\r\nThis project coordinates two levels of research on the role of context \r\nin student learning: the level of individual students and the level of \r\ncourse activities. Many of the associated research questions are new in \r\nphysics (e.g., examining the effects of having students teach others in \r\norder to learn) while others augment existing lines of research (e.g., \r\nthe role of computer simulations in the classroom). Collectively, these \r\ninvestigations provide a framework for understanding each of the \r\nindividual research studies, as well as the portability of the results \r\nof these studies to other environments. Furthermore, their coordinated \r\noutcomes will result in meaningful models of context in student \r\nlearning, which will serve as the foundation for long-term research in \r\nthis area. This research is designed to improve educational practices \r\nin physics and to better understand how to make them sustainable and \r\nscalable.\r\n",
