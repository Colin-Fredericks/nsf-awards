 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to build an application\r\ninfrastructure and a suite of embedded system software that will\r\nenable the rapid development of software control and monitoring\r\napplications, such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning\r\nsystems (HVAC), on low-power, lossy wireless sensor-actuator\r\nnetworks. Such user-preference driven control applications require\r\nthe ability to adapt to noise, loss, and failures in a large-scale\r\ndistributed network, and demand a high degree of automation in\r\nacquiring user preferences, making control decisions and\r\ndisseminating those decisions to the appropriate actuators.\r\n\r\nThe Sensor Control System (SCS) being developed provides a high-\r\nlevel platform that allows users to express control application\r\nrequirements at the granularity of the entire network, enabling users\r\nto focus on the requirements of their deployments by abstracting away\r\nthe low-level sensor network details.  SCS combines techniques from\r\nmachine learning and statistics with high-level abstractions inspired\r\nby work in software systems and databases, allowing for\r\nmathematically-sound decision making despite loss and uncertainty\r\nthat is inherent in such systems.  The project will demonstrate the approach on\r\na highly instrumented office environment. This research has the potential to\r\nimpact industry through the development of a new class of wireless\r\ncontrol systems, and academia through the infusion of cross-\r\ndisciplinary ideas into a variety of sub-fields of EECS. The\r\ndatasets, code and the sensor-actuator deployments developed during\r\nthe course of this research will be used in a range of educational\r\ninitiatives.\r\n\r\n",
