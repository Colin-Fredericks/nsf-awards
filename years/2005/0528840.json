 "awd_abstract_narration": "This complex project would continue work by Ron Stevens to create an experiment with Interactive Multi-Media Exercises (IMMEX) to improve student performance in Chemistry under certain conditions.  The research would compare the effects of an intelligent tutoring (ITS) feedback system with a computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) system.  Secondly, the project would use an online collaborative problem-solving approach to create an improved model of student problem solving practices.  The intent is to improve the learning rate of novices in chemistry.  The students would be chosen from an existing field sample of thousands of high school and college students.  The purpose of the study is to improve the IMMEX model.   The study will involve creating an intervention and conducting a post-test quasi-experimental design. The studies will be conducted with over 10,000 students who will be randomly assigned to control and intervention groups. Supporting data for extending models will include gender, ethnicity, motivation measures, course identity, and standardized test scores.\r\n",
