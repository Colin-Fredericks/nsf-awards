The  research objective is to develop a totally implantable vestibular prosthesis including a 6 DOF measuring unit on a single silicon chip, a control unit accurately mimicking the dynamic vestibular function, and a stimulator unit producing the pulse train transmitting the sensorial information  to vestibular nerves. The project will also include biocompatibility analysis of the prosthesis, including histological study, long-term accelerated test of degradation of glass-silicon packages, integrity studies and positional stability of implanted devices. The main objective of the Teaching Plan is the incorporation of Problem-Based Learning techniques into the undergraduate and graduate engineering curriculum. Completion of the teaching Plan will introduce a new method of teaching engineering concepts that in the long term will produce more creative and effective engineering. Through working with the UCI Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP), and UCI Center for Opportunities and Diversity in Engineering (CODE), the participation of underrepresented groups will be broadened and learning experience of the community outside campus enhanced.           \r\n",
