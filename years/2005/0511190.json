 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of error estimation is of paramount importance to the\r\ncomputational sciences. Local temporal and spatial grid adaptivity\r\nhelp to minimize the discretization error at a low computational cost.\r\nIn this project the investigator and graduate students pursue a study\r\nof model adaptivity in which the original model represented by a\r\ncoupled system of partial differential equations is replaced by\r\nanother one which is easier to solve. The main idea of model\r\nadaptivity is to use an appropriate splitting of the total error so\r\nthat the discretization and the modeling error are estimated\r\na-posteriori and controlled locally and globally. Realization of these\r\nideas depends on a particular application and its numerical\r\napproximation as well as on the relevant quantities of interest which\r\nguide both the grid and model adaptivity. This project will focus on\r\napplications in porous media, in particular on those of multiscale and\r\npreferential type, and on their various conforming and non-conforming\r\nfinite element formulations. The researchers will prove new\r\ntheoretical results as well as will develop new adaptive algorithms\r\nwhose prototype implementations will be available in public domain.\r\n\r\nThe project will lay foundations for a new class of fast and accurate\r\ncomputational methods for simulation of natural phenomena occuring\r\nunder the Earth's surface such as flow of contaminated water through\r\nand over complex geological formations. While traditional methods use\r\na fixed model of such phenomena as a basis for computational\r\nsimulations, the novel ideas proposed in this research project will\r\nallow to discard those elements of a model which are computationally\r\ncostly but which do not have significant impact on the solutions. The\r\nnew methods proposed in the project will be evaluated from both\r\ntheoretical as well as from practical point of view and can be used in\r\nplace of costly sensitivity and parameter studies. The results of the\r\nproject will be also applicable to other disciplines such as\r\nengineering design of multiscale materials, large scale simulations of\r\nneutron transport and biomedical applications. Undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students will be involved in research and will be trained in\r\nthe new and traditional adaptive computational methods and their\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n",
