 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99) The proposed project, Insights on Science and Technology for Society (INSCITES), are forming teams of undergraduate and graduate Student Teaching Scholars from departments of science, engineering, political science, economics and history. These teams are developing and teaching a series of modular, general education courses that focus on the science, economics and sociology of innovative technologies that are an intrinsic part of our everyday life. Scientific literacy is being placed within the broad context of societal usage and impact. The new courses are integrating science and engineering with humanities disciplines. The new courses include three different teaching and learning modalities: (1) historical and social context of the innovation are being taught with lectures and discussion based on assigned readings; (2) scientific principles and technological implementations of the innovation are being explored in a hands-on laboratory component, enabling the students to work in small groups to conduct practical activities; and (3) diffusion of the innovation and its social impacts are being explored by student pairs who will define topics related to the social practices resulting from the new technology; health and safety issues, and economic and legal consequences.",
