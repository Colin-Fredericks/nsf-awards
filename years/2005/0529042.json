Stroock, James Engstrom and Kelvin Lee\r\nInstitution:  Cornell University\r\nProposal Number: 0529042\r\nTitle: SST: Optimized Microfluidic Mass Transfer and Magnetic Sensing for Detection of Pseudomonas syringae\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The overarching objective of this project is to develop technology for the detection of Pseudomonas syringae, a bacterial plant pathogen. The technology that is to be developed will rely on the ability to detect an effector-helper protein expressed during pathogenesis of this organism. The detection of the effector-helper protein will rely on the use of giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors embedded in microfluidic devices. It is expected that the technical advances and sensors developed through this project will have broad applicability to the sensing of many biological systems. The project has the following specific aims:\r\n1) Development of fundamental principles and microfluidic tools for the optimization of mass transfer to sensing elements on solid surfaces.\r\n2) Development of protein and surface chemistry for a Magnetic Tag Protein Sensor that is compatible with giant magnetoresistant sensing.\r\n3) Implementation of optimal microfluidic mass transfer strategies for protein detection with Magnetic Tag GMR sensors.\r\n4) Construction of an interdisciplinary research community and curriculum at Cornell University based around the physical, chemical, and experimental principles of microchemical technology. Increased participation in research by members of underrepresented groups through REU activities.\r\n\r\n The development of chemical and biochemical sensors is a vast technological challenge, as the sensing elements must inevitably reflect some of the endless diversity that exists in the molecular species that must be sensed. Nonetheless, there are generic physical and chemical aspects of the sensing process that must be optimized for all sensing strategies: 1) Mass transfer for the species of interest (analyte) to the point of detection, 2) sensitive detection of the presence of the analyte, and 3) chemically specific recognition of the analyte. The PIs propose to address fundamental challenges associated with the optimization of these three aspects of sensing in the important context of surface based bio-sensors. In particular, they plan to develop transport analysis and microfluidic tools to increase the rates of mass transfer to solid detector surface, to develop protein and surface chemistries that allow for attachment of magnetic bead-labeled proteins and antibodies that allow for detection with high sensitivity, and to develop new inert surfaces and shear-based mechanisms to limit non-specific signal and thus improve selectivity.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact. ThePIs have been actively engaged in the incorporation of scale-down into the Chemical Engineering curriculum. These activities have included the development of several new core and elective courses in the chemical engineering curriculum to emphasize the important role of engineering analysis in small-scale design. Further, the team has been engaged in outreach activities that bring together the Cornell community to discuss issues and challenges related to microscale systems. Beyond this local impact, the team has participated in activities that include the \"It's a NanoWorld\" exhibit that has been seen by more than 700,000 nonscientists and they have been key players in an ethics workshop to consider the Societal Implications of Nanotechnology.\r\n\r\n",
