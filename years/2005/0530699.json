 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Dr. Richard H. Meadow, Benjamin Arbuckle will \r\ncollect and analyze archaeological data related to the \r\nevolution of sheep and goat pastoralism in Central Anatolia. Continuing \r\npreliminary work that he began in 2004, Arbuckle will join international \r\narchaeological projects based at Ankara and Istanbul Universities in \r\norder to collect and analyze animal bone remains from four sites in \r\nCentral Anatolia (South Central Turkey). The goal of this research is to \r\ndevelop a detailed understanding of the organization and evolution of \r\nsheep and goat pastoralism leading up to and during the appearance of \r\nthe first complex polities and early urban states in the region from \r\n6000-2000 BC.\r\n\r\nThis research is significant because, although sheep and goat \r\npastoralism is one of the most important socio-economic formations in \r\nthe ancient and modern Middle East, little is known about how pastoral \r\nsystems were organized in Central Anatolia, how they evolved over time, \r\nand how these systems were affected by and affected the development of \r\nearly urban states. As a result a major portion of the cultural system \r\nin Central Anatolia and its role in socio-political evolution remains \r\npoorly known. This project analyzes faunal remains from four sites in \r\nthe region, including Erbaba, Kosk Hoyuk, Guvercinkayasi, and Acemhoyuk, \r\neach representing a different point in the sequence of cultural \r\nevolution in the region from simple villages to urban centers. \r\nParticular attention is focused on addressing questions concerning the \r\noverall organization of the animal economy, when and to what extent \r\nsheep and goat herds were utilized for products such as milk and wool, \r\nand when and to what degree sheep and goat herding became a specialized \r\noccupation. The extent to which products such as milk and wool were \r\nutilized is important for understanding the productive potential of \r\nancient herds and therefore their economic, social, and political \r\nimportance. Evidence for specialization in pastoral production and in \r\nthe distribution of pastoral products will provide a means to identify \r\naspects of the internal organization of early societies in Central \r\nAnatolia that may not be available from other lines of evidence, as well \r\nas the opportunity to test assumptions concerning the centralized and \r\nredistributive nature of the urban Bronze Age economy.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this research will contribute to a new understanding of the \r\norigins and development of pastoral practices that continue to be \r\nimportant in the region today. By characterizing the nature of the sheep \r\nand goat pastoral system and by addressing questions concerning the \r\nrelationship between specialization in the pastoral economy and emerging \r\nsocial complexity, this research also makes an important contribution to \r\nunderstanding the organization and evolution of early complex polities \r\nin Central Anatolia. Furthermore, this project has been conducted in \r\nclose cooperation with Turkish and other foreign researchers, and the \r\nresults of this research will be disseminated to the scientific \r\ncommunity through collaborative publications in scientific journals in \r\nboth English and Turkish. Finally, this research has given the author \r\nthe opportunity to gain valuable experience in the methods of \r\nzooarchaeological and archaeological research and has introduced faunal \r\nresearch to several important Turkish excavation projects.\r\n",
