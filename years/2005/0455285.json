 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general aim of this project is the development of the theory of \r\ndefinable actions of Polish groups, the structure and classification of \r\ntheir orbit spaces, and the closely related study of definable equivalence \r\nrelations.  This work is motivated by basic foundational questions, like \r\nunderstanding the nature of complete classification of mathematical objects, \r\nup to some notion of equivalence, by invariants, and creating a mathematical \r\nframework for measuring the complexity of such classification problems. This \r\ntheory is developed within the context of descriptive set theory, which \r\nprovides the basic underlying concepts and methods. On the other hand, in \r\nview of its broad scope, it has natural interactions with many other areas \r\nof mathematics, such as model theory, recursion theory, the theory of \r\ntopological groups and their representations, topological dynamics, ergodic \r\ntheory, operator algebras, and combinatorics. Within this general program it \r\nis  proposed to study: (i) problems arising in the theory of countable Borel \r\nequivalence relations, particularly concerning hyperfiniteness and \r\ntreeability, including descriptive aspects of free actions of free groups; \r\n(ii) newly developed connections between the topological dynamics of \r\nautomorphism groups of countable structures and finite Ramsey theory as well \r\nas a related semigroup framework for such connections with infinite Ramsey \r\ntheory; (iii) the concepts of genericity and ample genericity in Polish \r\ngroups and their relation to other structural properties of groups such as \r\nthe small index property, uncountable cofinality, the Bergman finite \r\ngeneration property, fixed point properties for actions on trees and \r\nautomatic continuity; (iv) complexity of classification problems concerning \r\nthe isometric or topological classification of various kinds of metric, \r\ntopological or Banach spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA fundamental question that arises in many fields of mathematics is that of \r\nclassifying a given collection of objects under study. This amounts to \r\nproviding a \"catalog\" or \"listing\" of these objects, in principle not unlike \r\nthat of cataloging species in biology or stars and galaxies in astronomy. If \r\nsuch a classification is possible, one has a \"complete\" understanding of the \r\nmathematical structures involved.  Otherwise a more or less \"chaotic\" \r\nbehavior is expected. It is thus very important to understand under what \r\ncircumstances a classification is possible. This difficult foundational \r\nquestion is further complicated by the fact that what constitutes an \r\nacceptable classification is very much dependent on the particular field of \r\nmathematics studied, so the criteria for a \"good\" classification in one area \r\nmight not be appropriate in another.  At its basic level, this project aims \r\nto develop a general quantitative theory, which in many situations can \r\nprecisely measure the complexity of a classification problem and thus \r\nprovide objective means by which one can decide, in any given field, whether \r\na satisfactory classification of the objects in question is possible. This \r\nis achieved by associating with each collection of objects to be classified \r\nan appropriate concept of \"magnitude\" or \"size\", which in a precise sense \r\nmeasures the difficulty of its classification problem. This new theory of \r\n\"magnitude\" as well as problems in different directions that arise in the \r\ncourse of the development of this theory are investigated in this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
