 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent surge of results in the geometry and topology of\r\n3-manifolds has provided many new tools for understanding\r\n3-manifolds combinatorially and geometrically.  In particular, the\r\nquestion of how to gain an explicit understanding of the internal\r\ngeometry of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold can be addressed with\r\nnew techniques developed by the P.I.  together with Dick Canary and\r\nYair Minsky that apply to the infinite volume case.  Such an\r\nunderstanding would be a kind of effective version of Mostow rigidity,\r\nwherein one not only knows the uniqueness of the hyperbolic structure\r\nbut additionally an explicit decription of its geometry.  The P.I., in\r\njoint work with Juan Souto, seeks to develop this kind of picture for\r\nclosed hyperbolic 3-manifolds admitting a Heegaard splitting,\r\ngiven in terms of the Heegaard surface. Additionally, with Howard\r\nMasur and Yair Minsky the P.I. will relate the internal geometry of\r\nhyperbolic 3-manifolds homotopy equivalent to a surface to the\r\ngeometry of surfaces along a Weil-Petersson geodesic G in\r\nTeichmueller space.\r\n\r\n\r\nA recent trend in the study of geometry and topology is to develop\r\ncombinatorial models for geometric spaces.  This kind of description\r\nof a space or shape sacrifices a certain degree of precision in the\r\ninterest of capturing more of the large-scale structure, and often\r\ngeneral theorems guarantee that knowing this large-scale structure is\r\nsufficient to completely determine the space.  In a recent result of\r\nthe P.I. with R. Canary and Y. Minsky, such models were used to\r\nclassify all `constantly negatively curved,' or `hyperbolic'\r\n3-dimensional spaces of infinite volume that are nevertheless tame\r\nin a certain sense.  This result solved a long-standing conjecture of\r\nWilliam thurston, where in a certain piece of data (akin to a kind of\r\nDNA-sequence for the space) completely determines its structure.  We\r\nhave developed a similar setup in the finite-volume case, and hope to\r\nprove a similar classification theorem for such spaces.  Information\r\nof this large-scale type is more useful than existence results for\r\ngeometric structures, in that it gives one a more complete picture of\r\nhow such spaces behave.  Such large-scale data arise and describe\r\nphenomena in many contexts, whether it is the spaces themselves, or\r\ntheir parameter spaces.  The P.I., together with his collaborators,\r\nwill continue to develop a complete description of the large-scale\r\ngeometry of all hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifolds, as well as for\r\nrelated spaces that parameterize them.\r\n\r\n",
