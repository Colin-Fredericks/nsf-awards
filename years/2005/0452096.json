 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nFew issues are more controversial in the contemporary globalization debate than\r\nthe effects of trade liberalization on poverty and well-being in low-income\r\ncountries.  The question of how changes in trade policy affect child labor and\r\nschooling is particularly contentious.  Yet, the current debate over\r\nglobalization and child labor is being framed in a setting where empirical\r\nevidence is extremely scarce.  This research project empirically considers how\r\ntrade policy affects child labor and schooling in a low-income country using\r\nmicro-survey data from India.  Child labor pervades India with roughly 34\r\nmillion children 5-14 who work as a principal activity at the start of our\r\ndata, and the incidence of child labor varies widely across regions.  Starting\r\nin 1991, India launched a drastic trade liberalization that lowered the average\r\ntariff rate from 83% in 1991 to 30% in 1997 and also changed the structure of\r\nprotection.  We explore the causal link between liberalization and changes in\r\nchild labor and schooling by relating child labor to district and intertemporal\r\nvariation in tariffs surrounding this reform.  India is divided into almost 450\r\ndistricts and there is vast heterogeneity across districts in terms of\r\nindustrial composition before liberalization and thus exposure to trade reform. \r\nThis provides ample variation in schooling, child labor, and trade policy in\r\nthe data to identify the effects of India's trade liberalization. \r\nMethodologically, this study will make two broad contributions.  In general,\r\nconsidering the impact of trade policy on poverty related outcomes is plagued\r\nby the political economy of changes in trade policy, but the nature of India's\r\nreforms allows us to address these concerns.  Consequently, this study will\r\nprovide rare evidence on the effects of changes in trade policy on child labor\r\nand schooling.  Second, this study illustrates how within country heterogeneity\r\nin exposure to an economy-wide trade reform can be used to evaluate the effects\r\nof a large scale policy change on child labor and schooling.  Finally, by\r\ncontributing to our understanding of how and why trade policy changes affect\r\nchild labor and schooling decisions, this research will contribute to the\r\npolicy debate on child labor and schooling in low income countries.\r\n",
