 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Faculty Early Caree Development (CAREER) Program project is to advance fundamental understanding of deformation of coated materials and to develop their processing technologies. Deformable coated materials have diverse applications, from polymer coated sheet metal for stamping to metallic thin film coated polymer for flexible electronics. The major challenges in forming coated materials into useful products are in keeping the coating from tooling contact damage and in maintaining the adhesive bond in the elastic-plastic deformation process. The approach toward the research objective is a multidisciplinary methodology that consists of both experimental and theoretical efforts. Specifically, the research will develop novel experiments to improve the understanding of contact damage and interface decohesion. The modeling framework will be based on the development of phenomenological descriptions and constitutive models of the coatings, substrates, and polymer-metal interface. Applied mechanics and adhesion science theories will be integrated to devise novel fabrication techniques for coated materials.\r\n\r\nAdvancing the understanding of deformation of coated materials will accelerate the development of new coating materials and new coating processes. Application of coated material can lessen environmental impact and reduce manufacturing cost. Development of new deformation techniques will result in enabling technologies for new products. The CAREER project will undertake various efforts in curriculum development, student mentoring, industrial collaboration, and outreach activities such as local science museum exhibitions. The project will spark students' interest in the process of knowledge discovery and will prepare students to take on future challenges. Through the integration of research and education, new intellectual capital will be developed.",
