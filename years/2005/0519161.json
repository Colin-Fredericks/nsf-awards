 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Americas Program award will support a planning visit proposal from Dr. Ronald Harley of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Dr. Ganesh K. Venayagamoorthy of the University of Missouri-Rolla.  The researchers intend to meet with Mexican colleagues Dr. Edgar Sanchez and Dr. Arturo Messina at the Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Avanzados de IPN (CINVESTAV-IPN) in Guadalajara, and to use the facilities of the Electric Research Institute in Cuernavaca, in order to plan future complementary research aimed at increasing the scope and impact of their current work in neurocontrol of power systems. \r\n\r\nThe collaboration should allow the further analysis and validation of intelligent control algorithms developed by the U.S. side, using the Mexican side's unique laboratory and simulation systems.   The work could lead to improved stability of the electric power grid, thus reducing the possibility of unexpected large power black-outs, and its consequences to society. This, together with the early diagnosis of impending faults in large rotating generators and motors, will increase the reliability and productivity of energy production and usage, resulting in lower environmental impacts and improved productivity. Aside from the intellectual exchanges, the collaboration with their Mexican colleagues will lead to broader impacts in the area of student exchanges, coursework, and the involvement of females and minorities in the project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
