 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a suite of server based infrastructure software and applications to empower service providers with the ability to deploy, monitor, customize content, debug, and upgrade their VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) terminals remotely. The proposed Transactional Applications Delivery System (TADS) will allow service providers to define new revenue generating applications and corporate IT departments and third-party IT solution providers to develop vertically integrated, productivity enhancing data-voice applications.  The proposed system will also provide a cost-effective means for service providers to move high-end VoIP terminals into the home consumer market, through, for example, multi-year service contracts in exchange for subsidized phones (the new revenue generating opportunities will allow service providers to do this).  By addressing these needs, TADS will allow tighter integration between telephony features and IT based systems, taking better advantage of unified messaging (voice mail, e-mail, video mail, instant messaging, etc), collaboration, conferencing, presence, etc.  It will also allow end-users access to ubiquitous features across different networks and different locations.\r\n\r\nThis project will define, develop, and deploy a complex software platform that will significantly accelerate the time to market of revenue generating and productivity enhancing advanced VoIP applications and services. In addition, the development of the proposed TADS technology will lead to new knowledge in the areas of human computer interaction, data mining, IP information appliances, and networking. The results to be obtained from this project will have a significant impact on the structure of the VoIP consumer market and the way converged voice-data applications are developed and deployed in the enterprise market.\r\n\r\n",
