 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mixed Apparatus Radar Investigation of Atmospheric Cosmic-rays of High Ionization project, (MARIACHI) seeks to determine if reflected radio waves can be used to detect the presence of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR).  If this can be done, UHECR detection will be possible over much larger detection areas, facilitating the collection of many more events, and be more cost efficient. These rarely occurring, mysterious high-energy particles have been detected, but no one is able to explain their nature and origin, and have been identified as a high priority area of national research. The quest for the detection and understanding of the nature and origin of UHECR may lead to a deeper understanding of how the Universe works. MARIACHI is revolutionary not only for being on the forefront of cosmic ray detection techniques, but also for its incorporation of a diverse group of scientists, educators, and students in a large cyberinfrastructure collaboration for the support of its cutting-edge research.  MARIACHI intrinsically promotes and advances physics research and information technology education, since a major component of the project is scientifically dependent upon detectors built and operated by high schools and community colleges to confirm the observation of UHECR signals.  Widespread detection sites, tied together by modern cyberinfrastructure, i.e. grid computing, allow for MARIACHI's data collection, and expose a broad range of individuals and organizations to exciting physics research and modern scientific and computing tools, thus providing an opportunity that they would otherwise be unable to experience.  MARIACHI enables participants to build, deploy, utilize, and apply the most current information technologies through collaborative efforts with scientists active in this forefront research, and consequently it encourages and prepares a strong future workforce in cyberinfrastructure and research fields. The present grant will be used to implement a pilot program that can eventually be implemented nationwide due to the scalability of its design. Progress and results of this project will be showcased in a publicly accessible website. \r\n",
