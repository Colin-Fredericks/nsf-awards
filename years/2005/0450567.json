 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project describes software that combines speech recognition, digital video, and personal computer technologies to allow PC users to have \"face-to-face\" dialogues with video characters that are real people. This software, called Conversim (Registered Trademark), incorporates an independent speaker recognition engine so that any English-speaking user can spontaneously say the words and phrases known to the system and be understood.  All Conversim (RT) programs include a non-directive, intelligent prompting algorithm.  Each time the virtual character responds to the user, the system dynamically selects statements and questions that are specifically relevant to the character's last response and then displays three choices in a rhythmic scroll.  Between questions, the character's active image remains on the monitor as if waiting for the next question.  The Conversim (RT) dialogue model is unique since it enables the user to have a virtual conversation with a real person whose intellect, personality, and personae are intact and available.  This very personal model opens the door to numerous innovative applications in education.  Scientific research has shown that most users enjoy the virtual dialogue experience; many have significant, often accelerated, learning gains; and almost all feel as though they have met the person with whom they have been \"talking.\"  These findings strongly indicate the method merits further research in conventional educational settings.\r\n\r\nThis model represents a new paradigm in education, one that allows the student to learn through a one-on-one interview of the master teacher.  The paradigm involves non-directive, independent learning by conducting face-to-face dialogues with master teachers in cyberspace, who are always present, always available, and always willing to converse with people who wish to engage them.  Multimedia presentations can be used in concert with the dialogue to clarify concepts and complex topics.  Also, the power of the computer for tracking and innovative, dynamic evaluation strategies are inherent in this model.  The broad objective is to make this model and this new paradigm available in all educational institutions that would benefit from its use.  It has potential to provide a means for students everywhere to gain access to and learn by engaging in dialogue with some of the best minds in the country; to be used to educate a broad range of students, from high school to the post-graduate level; to help students whose education is restricted by geographic location or economics; to enhance learning for all students by making them active participants in the learning process; and to provide high-quality education while significantly reducing per student costs. \r\n",
