 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individuals typically choose to mate with others of the same species by using several genetically based behavioral or chemical cues.  The investigators seek to identify the parts of the genome that are associated with these behaviors and chemicals to test various evolutionary hypotheses of species formation.  They propose to execute this research in populations of the fruit fly species Drosophila mojavensis, a member of the cactus-yeast-Drosophila model system, because of its association with and infestation of cactus rots.  Previous studies in this and other Drosophila species have shown that olfactory cues (pheromones) and auditory cues (courtship wing vibrations) are the cues that individuals use to select mates.  The investigators will use DNA-based markers to identify the locations of genes influencing these traits.  This approach will ensure that these genetic analyses will be performed on individuals reared on their natural host plants, as recent studies have shown a dramatic effect of rearing substrates on these traits.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will begin to reveal the number and locations of genes that are responsible for the beginnings of species formation.  Thus, this work will provide insights into the fundamental evolutionary processes that regulate biodiversity on Earth.\r\n",
