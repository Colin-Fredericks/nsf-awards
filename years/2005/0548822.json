 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal to Fund an International Workshop on\r\nNetworked Sensing, Information and Control\r\nSupport is requested for organizing an international workshop on networked sensing,\r\ninformation and control. The workshop will be held in Boston area over two days, Friday\r\nand Saturday, in Jan-Feb 2006 time frame. The meeting will be organized around the\r\ntechnical domains dealing with informational and mathematical aspects of networked sensing.\r\nOn account of breadth and diversity of work in this topic, we expect very broad interest\r\nand participation from the systems community (systems and control, signal processing and\r\ninformation theory). We are requesting $49,500 in funds to support travel and subsistence\r\nfor workshop participants.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The aim of the proposed workshop is to bring together researchers\r\nstudying informational & mathematical aspects of networked sensing systems. The impor-\r\ntance and timeliness of this workshop is evidenced by the explosion of several independent\r\nspecial sessions devoted to specific aspects of sensor networks in reputed international confer-\r\nences. Despite these efforts the focus has been on specific and isolated aspects of networked\r\nsensing and there is a need for cross-disciplinary efforts to integrate ideas from the various\r\nresearch communities. The workshop will bring together internationally reputed researchers\r\nfrom control, information theory and signal processing focused on the common theme of\r\ndistributed sensing, inferencing, and control over networks.\r\nBroad Impact: On account of the contemporaneous nature of the topic, we have no doubt\r\nthat there will significant interest evinced by the both the research and industrial community\r\nat large. The workshop will organize panel discussions to address gaps between educational\r\ncurricula and research, as well as between industry and academia. We will also attempt to\r\norganize panel sessions focused on identifying critical divides between the different research\r\ncommunities and constructive ways of bridging these gaps. The workshop will disseminate\r\nthe outcome of the workshop through publication of a volume of papers and essays edited\r\nby the organizers as well as some members from the program committee.\r\n",
