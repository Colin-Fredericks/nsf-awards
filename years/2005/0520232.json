 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proliferation of wireless applications creates an increased density of wireless devices.  Information-bearing signals from these devices generate significant aggregate interference that adversely affects Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) performance.  Non-data bearing radiated signals also contaminate the space of WLANs in unlicensed bands.  To date, this interference problem has largely been treated in an incremental, application specific manner.  Thus, there is strong motivation to thoroughly understand this interference phenomenon to improve WLAN design, and ultimately adapt WLANs to dynamically mitigate interference degradation.\r\nThis effort focuses on:  the development of quantifiable interference characteristics of wireless receivers and, intentional and unintentional transmitters; the establishment of a means of understanding and characterizing interference temperature; and the use of this critical information to enhance interference and general error-modeling capabilities of  network simulation tools.  These objectives are achieved via a three-prong methodology:  (1) theoretical modeling of interfering signals in temporal and spectral domains; (2) simulation modeling for studying the impact of interference on network performance including specific protocols, applications, and validation of interference models; (3) physical experimentation to verify and enhance theoretical and simulation results, augmenting empirical observations.\r\nThe broad impact of this research allows the technical community to better understand wireless network resource management, leading to significant economic savings and performance improvements.  Another important impact is on U.S. government communications policy.  Education and training of students in this field is enhanced.  Public demonstrations, symposia, and print/broadcast media are employed to disseminate results.\r\n",
