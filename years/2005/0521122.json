 "awd_abstract_narration": "0521122\r\nVanVliet\r\nThe objective is to acquire a dual probe-near field scanning optical microscope to enable fundamental investigations of cytoskeletal protein-based force generation through close collaboration among PIs in three academic departments who address this scientific issue with distinct expertise. Two specific research projects, which will benefit significantly from the capabilities of the DP-NSOM, are presented. Acquisition of the DP-NSOM will directly enable substantive collaborations among three academic departments at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Whitehead Institute. This acquisition will also provide significantly enhanced experimental capabilities to two junior faculty whose research groups each apply engineering principles to the study of cellular and molecular mechanics. Further, this DP-NSOM will be a vital experimental component of proposed cross-departmental collaborations among these and additional investigators, focusing on analytical and computational modeling of cytoskeletal mechanics. This acquisition will also significantly contribute to MIT's initiatives in cross-disciplinary education. In addition to research training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, educational efforts within MIT will include new graduate- and undergraduate-level laboratory modules.\r\n",
