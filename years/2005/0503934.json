 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last two decades of development in symplectic topology\r\nsince the advent of Gromov's pseudoholomorphic curves, the method\r\nof pseudoholomorphic curves manifested many genuinely symplectic\r\nphenomena combining tools from geometric analysis and Hamiltonian\r\ndynamics. Floer theory and its cousin, symplectic field theory,\r\nhave emerged as a unifying force of analysis, dynamics and\r\ngeometry via the language of homological algebra. With Floer\r\ntheory and the relevant analysis of holomorphic curves as the\r\ncommon tools of investigation, this project centers around the\r\ninvestigation of deeper aspects of symplectic topology and\r\nHamiltonian dynamics up to the level of the topological category.\r\nThe project also aims at the study of the moduli space of\r\npseudoholomorphic curves, both open and closed, beyond the\r\nwell-known stable map type compactifications and its applications\r\nto symplectic topology and to mirror symmetry through adiabatic\r\ndegeneration and the blow-up analysis. The proposed research will\r\nput the method of pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic topology\r\nin better perspective and further promote the existing\r\ninteractions between geometric analysis, symplectic topology and\r\ndynamical systems. The Hamiltonian formalism played a fundamental\r\nrole not only for solving problems in classical mechanics but also\r\nfor transforming the classical mechanics into quantum mechanics.\r\nWhen one considers mechanics in a constrained system, i.e.,\r\nmechanics on a curved space like `spherical pendulum' or\r\n`billiards', description of the corresponding phase space and the\r\ndifferential equation requires the Hamiltonian formalism in the\r\ncontext of the symplectic structure and symplectic manifolds.\r\n\r\nIn symplectic geometry, there are two aspects of study, one the\r\ndynamical aspect and the other the geometric aspect. Understanding\r\nthe interplay between the two aspects is the core of symplectic\r\ntopology. Oh's proposed research aims at deeper understanding of\r\nsymplectic topology, and of its relation to the string theory in\r\nphysics. It also aims at easing an access of new coming graduate\r\nstudents and mathematicians from related fields to the results\r\nderived from Oh's research by proposing to write a graduate level\r\ntextbook on Floer theory and its applications.\r\n",
