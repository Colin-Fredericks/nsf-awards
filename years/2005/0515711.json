 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Hugh Fan of the University of Florida is supported with a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to study hydrogen gas sensing by enzyme-catalyzed electrochemical detection in a microfluidic device.  The hydrogenase enzyme to be used in the sensor is obtained from microorganisms that consume hydrogen as their energy source.  The electrons released during the enzymatic oxidation of hydrogen will be accepted by benzyl viologen, and the product of the redox reaction will be detected by chronoamperometry.  Enzyme stability, selectivity, and sensitivity will be investigated.\r\nThe idea is to develop a simple microfluidic hydrogen sensor that is portable and can quickly respond to hydrogen gas leaks.  If successful, it will greatly aid the safe deployment of hydrogen-based energy sources as an alternate for fossil fuel. \r\n",
