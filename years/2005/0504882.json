 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI studies several problems related to coalescent\r\nprocesses and population models.  Coalescent processes\r\nare stochastic processes that model a system of particles\r\nwhich start out separated and merge into clusters as time\r\ngoes forward.  These processes can be used to describe\r\nthe genealogy of a population because if one takes a\r\nsample from a population and follows the ancestral lines\r\nbackwards in time, the ancestral lines will coalesce.\r\nWhen a beneficial mutation occurs in a population and\r\nspreads rapidly, many ancestral lines will merge at\r\nalmost the same time, as they will all be traced back to\r\nthe individual that had the beneficial mutation.  One\r\ngoal is to use results from the theory of coalescent\r\nprocesses with multiple mergers to get further insight\r\ninto tests that are used to detect beneficial mutations.\r\nA second project is to determine the distribution of the\r\ntime that it takes for one individual in a population to\r\nexperience k mutations.  The PI will also study a model\r\nof coalescence in which the total mass of the system\r\nincreases over time.  A coalescent model in which new\r\nparticles appear at rate one and clusters merge at a rate\r\nproportional to the product of the masses has previously\r\nbeen studied, but a qualitatively different phase\r\ntransition is conjectured to arise in an alternative\r\nmodel in which clusters merge at a rate proportional to\r\nthe sum of the masses.\r\n\r\nStochastic models of coalescence have a wide range of\r\napplications in other fields of science such as biology,\r\nphysical chemistry, and astronomy.  Biologists interested\r\nin understanding evolution are concerned with the merging\r\nof the ancestral lines of a sample from a population.  It\r\nshould be possible to use the mathematical theory of\r\ncoalescence to gain further insight into how beneficial\r\nmutations impact this process.  The project of determining\r\nthe amount of time for one individual in a population to\r\nexperience several mutations is motivated by simple models\r\nof cancer, in which it is assumed that a cell becomes\r\ncancerous only after several harmful mutations take place.\r\nThe study of coalescent processes in which the mass of the\r\nsystem increases over time is motivated by recent interest\r\nin randomly growing networks.\r\n",
