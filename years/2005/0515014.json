 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predators have long been valued for their role in controlling outbreaks of \r\ninsect species that can inflict considerable damage to their specific host \r\nplant species.   Ecological science is now theorizing that by protecting \r\nplants from damage, predators may play an even more critical role in \r\necosystems than previously thought.   Different predator species prefer \r\ndifferent kinds of insect prey.  Such preference may steer which \r\ncombinations of plant species (biodiversity) survive in an ecosystem.  The \r\nlevel of plant biodiversity, in turn, can impact the level of important \r\necosystem services like the breakdown of organic matter and cycling of \r\nimportant nutrients such as nitrogen, which then feeds back to influence \r\nthe production rate of living plant tissue.   This study will experiment \r\nwith different spider predator species and grasshoppers in a grassland \r\necosystem.  It will test the hypothesis that each predator species will \r\nuniquely affect grasshoppers which, in turn, uniquely affects the \r\ncomposition of plant species and the level of ecosystem services.  In \r\naddition, it will measure how individual predator species effects on the \r\necosystem add up.  The study will hold different predator species, \r\nindividually and in combination, in experimental field plots and measure \r\nthe abundance of grasshoppers, the abundance of naturally occurring plant \r\nspecies, and the rates of organic matter (plant leaf litter) \r\ndecomposition, nitrogen cycling and plant production.  The study will help \r\nto increase the precision of biological control measures by identifying \r\nwhich combinations of predator species best achieve desired levels of \r\nplant species diversity and plant production in grassland ecosystems.",
