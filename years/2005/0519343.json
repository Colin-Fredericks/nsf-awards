 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, in February 2006 on the topic of climate change in the Americas. Organized by Dr. Walter C. Oechel, of San Diego State University, the Institute will provide an opportunity for emerging scientists to participate in lectures and activities related to current global/climate change research, while developing international and interdisciplinary relationships that will help foster future collaborative projects. The focus of this Institute will be on the impacts of climate change on natural and managed ecosystems, and the associated feedbacks of changes in ecosystem structure and function based on environmental change and management strategies. Topics to be discussed include: terrestrial processes and carbon flux in the Americas; climate and climate feedbacks; and data integration efforts regarding terrestrial processes.\r\n\r\nThe PASI will be composed of open discussions, a forum, tutorials, and field demonstrations. Products from the Institute will include a detailed and comprehensive web site, complete Institute proceedings, a list of potential collaborators and their research interests, and a series of reports from participants on the potential for future collaborative and international projects in their regions of study. This Institute will enable future collaborative relationships between biological and physical scientists, social scientists, economists, and policymakers, to address complex issues surrounding climate and global change research in the Americas.\r\n\r\n",
