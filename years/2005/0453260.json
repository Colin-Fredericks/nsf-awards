 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (NHMLAC) will offer a comprehensive program of scientific research and training for eight undergraduate students.  The 10-week program will build on the core strengths of the museum:  a dynamic program in systematic biology combined with strong human studies programs, extensive reference collections, and broad experience in the education of scientific discovery.  The NHMLAC is the largest natural history institution in the western United States.  Research collections encompass 33 million specimens and objects that represent the nearly 4.5 billion years of the earth's past.  Ph.D. level curators conduct research on these collections and ongoing fieldwork. The Museum has state-of-the-art molecular and scanning election microscopy labs, shared by all research departments. REU students will work alongside a curator from any of the major fields in the Research and Collections Division.  Research themes will include the understanding of evolutionary relationships of living organisms, exploration of natural and cultural diversity, the study of environmental change, and the refinement of scientific method and theory.  Recruitment will emphasize placement of candidates from groups who are under-represented in the sciences and those with limited opportunities for research, and students from colleges and universities in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area.  In addition to seminars, workshops, and fieldtrips, student will experience the rich cultural and natural landscapes of Los Angeles and southern California through extracurricular activities. More information is available by contacting Scott Van Keuren (213-763-\r\n3475; svankeur@nhm.org) or Angel Valdes  (213-763-3380; avaldes@nhm.org), or by visiting http://www.nhm.org/research/reu.\r\n",
