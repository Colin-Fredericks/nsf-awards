 "awd_abstract_narration": "The past few decades have heralded huge advances in the deployment of wireless technology, as evidenced by the widespread use of cell phones and the plethora of ad hoc sensor networks. The focus in these technologies has largely been directed to high density domains, where large numbers of people or devices can effectively interconnect, sharing a common infrastructure, as in the case of cellular networks, or creating their own infrastructure as in the case of ad hoc networks. \r\n\r\nThis research explores the rural and sparse domain, where distance, rugged terrain, and low density are the key parameters driving system design and performance. It examines approaches that can overcome these obstacles through physical, link, network, and application layer strategies. The research builds on advances in radio technologies such as smart antennas and programmable radios, as well as new approaches to routing including location awareness, to optimize system performance for rural and remote realms. The approach includes a combination of analysis, modeling and simulation, and empirical prototyping and validation. \r\n\r\nThis research program is driven by the realization that a broad range of public needs increasingly rely on high-speed, ubiquitous access to information, and that these needs are not being adequately met in sparsely populated and remote regions. By seeking alternative solutions we will open up new opportunities for economic development and address pressing social needs in underserved areas. The project will sponsor a Wireless Montana Workshop to surface issues and explore rural communications and information technology needs among a diverse stakeholder community.  Graduate and undergraduate students, including members of American Indian communities will be engaged in this project.\r\n",
