 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students involved in research develop skills beyond those typically learned in the classroom - in particular, refinement of cognitive and interpersonal skills, enhancement of personal growth, and inculcation of intellectual and management habits. These benefits are well known. The research experience, however, has traditionally been restricted to the best and the brightest students. The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) has successfully implemented the Affinity Research Group (ARG) model that expands the range to include those who historically have not been involved in undergraduate research, including those who are competent, but may lack the confidence to seek a research position. The ARG model provides both undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to learn, use, and integrate the knowledge and skills that are required for research with those required for cooperative work. This model integrates best practices from a variety of sources in industry, research, and education. \r\n\r\nThis project refines the educational materials used in the ARG model, fully develops the ARG model products and processes, distributes the ARG educational materials across a range of institutions, and evaluates the transfer of the ARG model to geographically and culturally diverse institutions. \r\n",
