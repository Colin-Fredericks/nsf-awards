 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will inaugurate a National Forum for Geosciences Information Technology (FGIT). FGIT will be a focal point for a national dialog on technology across all of the geosciences to address cyber-infrastructure issues and challenges through an exchange of ideas, experiences, and requirements. It will foster the leveraging of lessons learned in development efforts in different areas of the geosciences and foster the development of best practices for cyber-infrastructure deployment and use. Participants will include people involved in the development and operation of geosciences cyber-infrastructure, current and potential users of such cyber-infrastructure, and other interested parties. The theme of the workshop will be, \"Advancing the Development, Coordination, Deployment and Use of Information Technologies for Enabling Research, Education, and Operations in the Geosciences\". It will include presentations and discussions that include academic, federal agency, and corporate perspectives, on key advances in cyber-infrastructure that can benefit the geosciences, and on topics that cut across the geoscience and environmental research communities. Attendees will be active participants in the meeting, bringing forward their interests and expertise in discussion groups through the use of a modern interactive meeting technique. FGIT will complement other national and international meetings that have more disciplinary or developmentally focused cyber-infrastructure agendas. \r\n\r\nFGIT is expected to contribute to an increase in awareness of the potential of information technology among the geoscience workforce and to more effective planning of cyber-infrastructure development in the geosciences. These in turn will contribute to enhancing research in the geosciences, improving education, and informing public decision-making. As part of this project, FGIT will maintain a public web site that will be devoted to framing important issues for discussion, hosting presentation and other information from FGIT meetings, such as white papers, hosting working group reports, and bulletin and message boards for the exchange of information on hot topics in cyber-infrastructure. Bringing together a broad spectrum of participants and providing a framework for development of reports and white papers will facilitate the development, integration, and deployment of cyber-infrastructure in support of geoscience research and education.",
