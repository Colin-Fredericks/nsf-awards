 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past two decades, low dimensional topology has seen a great\r\ndeal of studies in two types of invariants: gauge theory type invariants \r\nin dimension four and combinatorial type invariants in dimension three.  \r\nWhile both sides have deep connections with physics, they share little \r\ncommon techniques and have rather different flavors. This picture could \r\nchange though, with recent work due to Khovanov and Ozsvath-Szabo.\r\nIn 1999, Khovanov introduced a graded homology theory for knots,\r\nand proved that its graded Euler characteristic is the Jones polynomial.\r\nThis has turned out to be a far reaching generalization of the Jones \r\npolynomial.  Furthermore, there is strong evidence that Khovanov theory, \r\nalong with the Ozsvath-Szabo theory, could bridge the connection between \r\ngauge theory type and combinatorial type invariants.\r\nMotivated by Khovanov's work, the PI, with his student Laure \r\nHelme-Guizon, has established a graded homology theory for graphs which \r\nyields the chromatic polynomial when taking Euler characteristic. \r\nThe PI intends to further his investigation on these homology theories, \r\nboth for knots and for graphs. Some of the specific problems are: \r\nunderstanding their geometric meanings, studying their behavior under \r\nvarious cut and paste operations, constructing homology theories for \r\nvarious other polynomials of knots and graphs, and investigating \r\nrelations with other invariants in low dimensional topology.\r\n\r\nLow dimensional topology studies the shapes of three and four dimensional \r\nspaces. These dimensions are of particular interests to mankind because \r\nof the dimensions of our space and our space-time.  A specific subfield \r\nin low dimensional topology is knot theory, which studies the knottedness \r\nin our three dimensional space. Knots are worthwhile to study not only \r\nbecause they are fundamental in 3-dimensional spatial structure, but \r\nalso because of its connection to areas outside mathematics. For example, \r\nbiochemists have discovered knotted DNA molecule (1980s) and knotted \r\nproteins (2004). It is also intimately related to the study of graph \r\ntheory, an area interesting to mathematicians, computer scientists, and \r\nothers. Over the past two decades, there have been a flourish of new \r\ninvariants in low dimensional topology, boosted by ideas from gauge theory, \r\nquantum algebras, and mathematical physics.  In particular, a new \r\ninvariant for knots, developed by Khovanov using ideas in homological \r\nalgebra, has sparked a great deal of interest recently. An analogous \r\ntheory for graphs has since been developed by the PI and his student. \r\nThis project aims to investigate these new invariants, with a particular \r\nemphasis on the homological algebra methods for knots and graphs.",
