 "awd_abstract_narration": "The enumerative aspects of algebraic combinatorics with its strong connections to representation theory and algebraic geometry has been a very active area of research for decades. Other enumerative questions related to the number of faces of polytopes, simplical complexes, triangulated and homology spheres, and hyperplane and subspace arrangements had an explosive growth since the mid-70's. We propose to organize a CBMS lecture series that will showcase the topological and algebraic aspects of this development by ten lectures given by Anders Bjorner who has been at the vanguard of this revolution from its early days.\r\n  \r\nThe proposed conference will focus on topics where posets have played an important role. Anders Bjorner is the leading expert on algebraic and topological combinatorics that is relevant to partially ordered sets. His lectures will be a comprehensive summary of the contemporary topological combinatorics related to   partially ordered sets. This will have a strong influence on the future research of the participants and local  combinatorics community.\r\n\r\n",
