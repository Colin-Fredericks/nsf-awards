 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Euler equations, a set of partial differential equations\r\nthat describe the motion of an inviscid fluid, are an\r\nexceptionally challenging system.  Friedlander studies issues\r\nrelated to these equations that involve important mathematical\r\nproblems and at the same time reflect basic properties of fluid\r\nbehaviour.  Friedlander and Pavlovic examine an infinite system of\r\nnonlinearly coupled ordinary differential equations that provide a\r\nsimpler model of the Euler equations.  They use a variety of tools\r\nto examine the \"closeness\" of the model, for which they prove the\r\nexistence of finite time singularities, to the Euler equations. \r\nIn a separate line of research Friedlander and her collaborators\r\ncontinue a project that examines the stability and instability of\r\nfluid configurations.  They study the unstable spectrum of the\r\nEuler equation with the goal of a complete description of the\r\nstructure of this spectrum over the energy norm for generic two-\r\nand three-dimensional flows.  This spectrum detects not only\r\ninstability in the linear sense but also is closely related to\r\nnatural physical questions about the transition from stability to\r\ninstability for the full nonlinear system.  The investigator and\r\nher collaborators use a considerable range of mathematical\r\ntechniques to carry out this research, including asymptotic\r\nmethods, spectral theory, operator semi-group theory, dynamical\r\nsystems, and harmonic analysis.\r\n\r\n     The issue of stability or instability of a fluid flow is one\r\nof the central problems in fluid dynamics: stable flows are robust\r\nunder inevitable disturbances in the environment, while unstable\r\nflows may break up, sometimes violently.  Even though the topic\r\nhas been the subject for intense study over more than a century\r\nbecause of its connection with many branches of science, such as\r\nengineering, physics, oceanography, and meteorology, many\r\nquestions remain open.  Friedlander uses mathematical techniques\r\nto answer some of these questions and her work shows that in some\r\nappropriate sense almost all fluid flows are unstable, although\r\nthere are a number of different types of such instability.  A\r\nstudent is involved in the project, and the investigator continues\r\nvarious mentoring activities to encourage women to enter careers\r\nin mathematics.\r\n",
