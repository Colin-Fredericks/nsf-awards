The common objective of TAMU and its Mexican partner, CINVESTAV(IPN), is to create a distributed management framework that will support secure and efficient information exchanges, without compromising their own policies, workflow, and system management.  The common goals in this joint project include providing (1)non-repudiation of transactions, (2)shared control of data access and system administration, (3)ubiquitous accessibility and (4)software risk modeling. The TAMU team will focus on the first two issues, and the CINVESTAV(IPN) team will focus on the later two issues.  As needed, when a user accesses shared information, both systems will follow joint control procedures, their evidence gathering process, and joint auditing to prevent single authority abuse. \r\n\r\nThe significance of this project includes (1)non-invasive yet secure sharing of critical information, (2)prevention of single point abuse of management privileges, and (3)win-win management schemes of distributed information systems. This project has broader impacts on both scientific and practical issues across the US-Mexico border. It will advance the basic knowledge on technical and social issues affecting both US and Mexico, and it will also expose students to Mexican partners, while solving challenging technical problems. \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the NSF/CISE Cyber Trust program with significant support from NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering, whose contribution is gratefully acknowledged.",
