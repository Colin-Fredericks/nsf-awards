Successful polymerization on these templates would potentially lead to membranes with highly uniform and finely tunable nanometer-size pores whose dimensions are dictated by the quasi-equilibrium thermodynamics of the glassy sugar/surfactant template. After polymerization, the sugar and surfactant can be readily rinsed off with water and recycled, thereby foregoing the use of toxic solvents prevalent in traditional membrane manufacturing processes.  A goal of this exploratory research is to establish the viability of Glassy Self Assembly Templating (GSAT) as a new technology for membrane fabrication.  Additional objectives are to establish the range of polymers to which the technology is applicable and to characterize the ultrafiltration membrane formed by GSAT. If successful, further studies, will focus on controlling pore size, connectivity, and orientation. Broader educational impacts include interdisciplinary training, and outreach and mentoring programs for underrepresented groups. The proposed research provides engineering students at the University of Cincinnati with fundamental knowledge of membranes and bioseparations.  Undergraduate participation in these research activities is promoted through NSF-REU summer site and Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) programs.  This project could lead to the production of new ultrafiltration and microfiltration membranes, which play an integral part in downstream processing operations in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. \r\n",
