 "awd_abstract_narration": "(21) The project is addressing the issues of teaching versus learning and lack of communication between mathematicians, teachers and mathematics education researchers by a systematic content analysis.The content analysis of problems in algebraic thinking drawn from current school curricula and  sample student solutions is being conducted jointly by mathematicians, teachers, and researchers. The results of the analysis, an annotated commentary on the problems and the student work, are being disseminated in a form designed to catalyze other collaborations. Furthermore, the work is contributing to the development of instructional materials for professional development of teachers, for teacher education classes, and for university courses in TA training. The central products of the project are: (a) the development and dissemination of a methodology of collaboration between mathematicians, teachers, and mathematics education researchers and (b) concrete instructional materials that demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology.  The instructional materials are being designed to work with a broad range of students. An advisory board of international experts in both mathematics and mathematics education is guiding the project.",
