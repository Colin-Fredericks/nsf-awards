 "awd_abstract_narration": "The feasibility of a novel approach for developing a new generation of cutting tool coatings will be explored.  This approach is based on an innovative composite coating of superhard cubic boron nitride (cBN) nano-sized particulates with titanium nitride (TiN) phase matrix along with a science-based new methodology for cutting tool design, specific for hard machining.  The investigators propose to explore if the new electrostatic-based coating method will work by resolving the agglomeration problem for submicron particle sizes, and to determine if such coated tools can compete commercially.  This is a collaborative research program to be performed by Purdue University and University of Arkansas.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this approach may provide an economical way to synthesize protective coatings on cutting tools, far less expensive than traditional chemical or physical vapor deposition.  Such high-performance cutting tools reduce frequency of tool replacement and improve productivity.\r\n",
