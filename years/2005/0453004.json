 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of Lie algebras, both finite and infinite-dimensional, have \r\nbeen a major area of mathematical research with numerous applications in \r\nmany other areas of mathematics and physics, for example, combinatorics, \r\ngroup theory, number theory, partial differential equations, topology, \r\nconformal field theory and string theory, statistical mechanics and \r\nintegrable systems. In particular, the representation theory of an important class of infinite dimensional Lie algebras known as affine Lie algebras has led to the\r\ndiscovery of new algebraic structures, such as vertex (operator) \r\nalgebras and quantum groups. Both of these algebraic structures have \r\nbecome important areas of current mathematical research with deep \r\nconnections with many other areas in mathematics and physics. This \r\nconference will provide an excellent setting for researchers in mathematics and physics working in the area of Lie algebras, vertex operator algebras and their applications to explore \r\npossible new directions of research in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe focus of the conference will be on the following topics:\r\n(i) Finite and infinite dimensional Lie algebras and quantum groups.\r\n(ii) Vertex operator algebras and their representations.\r\n(iii) Applications to number theory, combinatorics, conformal field\r\ntheory and statistical mechanics.\r\n\r\nLie algebras are a class of algebras describing continuous symmetries in\r\nnature. They were first introduced by mathematician S. Lie in the\r\nninteenth century and have been studied by many prominent mathematicians and\r\nphysicists since then.  During the twentieth century, the theory of Lie\r\nalgebras developed rapidly into a main research area in\r\nmathematics with numerous important applications in physics. Vertex\r\noperator algebras and quantum groups are relatively new class of \r\nalgebras and can be viewed as far-reaching analogues of Lie algebras. \r\nVertex operator algebras have been used to solve problems related to discrete symmetries and to number theory. They are also an important ingredient in a\r\nphysical theory describing phenomena such as the physical state in which\r\nwater, ice and steam coexist and in a physical theory called string\r\ntheory which some physicists are using to unify all the forces in the\r\nuniverse. This conference is on Lie algebras, vertex operator algebras\r\nand their applications and it will encourage mathematicians and\r\nphysicists to interact and, to join forces to discover\r\nnew frontiers. It will be especially beneficial to graduate\r\nstudents and junior faculty members who have\r\njust started their careers. We will encourage participation from \r\ngraduate students, junior researchers, women, minorities, and persons \r\nwith disabilities by giving them priority for financial support.\r\n",
