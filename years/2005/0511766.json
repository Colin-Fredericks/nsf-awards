 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a three-year program of research on several\r\nfundamental computational issues involved in the parallel implicit\r\nsolution of optimization problems with partial differential equation\r\n(PDE) constraints.  Such problems arise in many contexts in\r\nengineering and scientific computation, since physical reality is\r\noften expressed through models involving PDEs.  Accurate\r\ndiscretizations of PDEs lead to very large sparse constrained\r\noptimization problems, where at least part of the structure reflects\r\nthe discretization.  The goals of the research on methods include, but\r\nare not limited to, advancing the state-of-the-art in four fundamental\r\ntopics: (1) the formulation and analysis of algorithms for large-scale\r\nnonlinear optimization; (2) adaptive mesh generation for PDEs; (3)\r\nmultilevel PDE solvers; and (4) parallel computation.  Although each\r\nof these topics can be investigated in isolation, the investigators\r\nbelieve that the exploitation of their interactions is crucial for the\r\ncreation of effective global algorithms.  The research is motivated\r\nand guided by three particularly challenging applications: (i)\r\ngeophysical inverse problems; (ii) projection methods for evolution\r\nPDEs with constraints; and (iii) constrained level-set methods.  These\r\ntopics cover a number of important applications of computational\r\nscience, including off-shore petroleum exploration, the numerical\r\nmodeling of black holes, the modeling of crystal growth and\r\nbiomembranes, capturing diffraction effects of waves and path\r\nplanning.  Two features common to all these applications are that the\r\nPDE constraints must be handled using modern adaptive multi-level\r\ntechniques and that the underlying optimization problem is highly\r\nnonlinear and hence nonconvex.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Investigators are members of the Computational and Applied\r\nMathematics (CAM) Group within the Department of Mathematics at UC San\r\nDiego. They have a combined expertise in applied mathematics,\r\nnumerical optimization, numerical partial differential equations and\r\nparallel computation.  An important goal is the development of\r\nsoftware embodying the above algorithms.  Software developed as part\r\nof the project will provide an effective method of technology transfer\r\nand will extend the scope and effectiveness of existing codes that\r\nhave been developed by the investigators at UC San Diego.  The\r\nsoftware component of the project will have a substantial impact on\r\nresearch involving the modeling of complex systems as it will provide\r\nscientists and engineers with instant access to state-of-the-art\r\nmethods.  Within the Computational and Applied Mathematics Group, the\r\nInvestigators offer a program of instruction and research that\r\nemphasizes the role of computational science in the formulation,\r\nmodeling, and solution of problems from diverse and changing areas.\r\nThe activities associated with this project will help attract advanced\r\ngraduate students into the area of computational science, which plays\r\na vital role in the study of systems arising in manufacturing,\r\nengineering and the natural sciences.\r\n",
