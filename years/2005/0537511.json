 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 0406007, Nicholls, University of Notre Dame\r\n\r\nFree Surface Fluid Mechanics and Electromagnetic Scattering: Stable, High-Order Perturbation Techniques  \r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) proposes the investigation of\r\nfundamental phenomena in free-surface ideal fluid flows, and\r\nelectromagnetic and acoustic scattering.  Among the applications are\r\nthe efficient, stable, high-order computation of traveling\r\nthree-dimensional, capillary-gravity water waves, and a numerical\r\ninvestigation of their dynamic stability.  Another problem the PI will\r\naddress is the imposition of \"non-reflecting\" boundary conditions for\r\ndifferential equations posed on unbounded domains, particularly in the\r\nsetting of electromagnetic and acoustic scattering.  The PI also\r\nproposes a synthesis of two major areas of his research through the\r\nstudy of backscattering returns of electromagnetic radiation from\r\ntraveling ocean waves.  A unifying element in this project, and the\r\nprincipal numerical tool the PI will employ, is a class of boundary\r\nperturbation methods first introduced by O. Bruno & F. Reitich in the\r\ncontext of numerical simulation of acoustic and electromagnetic\r\nscattering problems.  These methods have subsequently been\r\nsignificantly refined and stabilized by Reitich and the PI for the BVP\r\nof computing Dirichlet-Neumann operators, and approximating scattering\r\nconfigurations.  Among these refinements, the PI & Reitich developed\r\nthe method of \"Transformed Field Expansions\" (TFE) which enables the\r\nreliable, high-order, stable perturbative computation of BVP and FBP.\r\nWhile this method is extremely successful in resolving simulations\r\nwell outside the reach of competing methods, it is somewhat\r\ndisadvantaged in terms of computational complexity in comparison to\r\nother techniques (e.g. boundary integrals/elements).  A final project\r\nthat the PI proposes is the investigation of two refinements of this\r\nTFE approach to increase its efficiency.\r\n\r\nFixed and free boundary problems arise in all areas of engineering and\r\nthe sciences.  Two particular instances of relevance in this proposal\r\nare the classic free boundary problem of the motion of surface waves\r\non a large body of water (e.g. a lake, sea, or ocean), and the fixed\r\nboundary problem of scattering of electromagnetic or acoustic waves\r\nfrom an irregular surface.  The accurate and reliable simulation of\r\nsurface waves is used not only to model the capabilities of open-ocean\r\nstructures (e.g. oil platforms), but also in the study of transport of\r\npollutants and other substances of environmental interest across\r\nlakes, seas, and oceans.  Applications of electromagnetic and acoustic\r\nscattering come in problems of radar, imaging, and sensing to name\r\njust a few.  Many numerical techniques are available for the\r\nsimulation of these problems and one of the goals of this proposal is\r\nthe utilization and improvement of a class of techniques discovered\r\nand refined by the Principal Investigator (PI) and collaborators.  In\r\nparticular, when the problems mentioned above are simulated in full\r\nthree dimensions, the computations become quite intensive and the\r\nissues truly become those of high-performance computing.\r\n\r\n",
