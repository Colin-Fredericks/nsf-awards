 "awd_abstract_narration": "Documenting regional species diversity is an urgent task because the\r\nextinction crisis has become more acute and more apparent to the collective\r\nconscience of society.  The insect order Coleoptera (beetles) is an obvious\r\nstarting point for this endeavor because it is the largest order of insects\r\nand constitutes over 25% of total animal diversity worldwide. Likewise,\r\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) is an obvious place to begin\r\nbecause it is a national treasure constituting one of the most biologically\r\ndiverse and unique landscapes in North America and is located in one of the\r\nmost densely populated parts of the U.S. This project will be conducted by a\r\nteam of 44 cooperating scientists engaging in an ambitious effort to\r\ncompletely document beetle diversity in GSMNP. Methods will include\r\nfieldwork by scientists, students and volunteers, morphological and\r\nmolecular analyses, and computer databasing. The project is fully integrated\r\nwith other teams of researchers conducting biotic surveys as part of the All\r\nTaxa Biodiversity Inventory (ATBI) in GSMNP, including data and specimen\r\nexchange, joint collecting events (\"bioblitzes\"), and networking at the\r\nannual ATBI Conference.  Products from the Coleoptera project of the ATBI\r\nwill include computer generated identification guides, internet species\r\nprofiles, and research publications.  Project scientists have estimated that\r\n3000 species will be recorded, representing 105 different beetle families.\r\nPrevious work has already documented 25 species new to science and this\r\nnumber is expected to double during the four-year project. Ultimately, the\r\nbeetle fauna of GSMNP will be the best documented in the entire world. The\r\nproject is coordinated with Discover Life in America, Inc (DLIA), an\r\norganization devoted to documenting life in U.S. national parks that serves\r\nas a liaison between our team and participating units in the National Parks\r\nService, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and National Biological Information\r\nInfrastructure (NBII).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coleoptera project is a significant part of a larger endeavor to assist\r\nnational parks and other conservation areas in the development of inventory\r\nmethods to compile data about biological diversity. This work is being\r\nconducted under the broad umbrella of the GSMNP ATBI to document all species\r\nwithin the park.  Already, other national parks are implementing the\r\nsynergistic model established at GSMNP.  Completion of the beetle survey\r\nwill serve these broader goals by demonstrating that the single most diverse\r\ngroup of animals can be successfully documented.  Beyond this, parks and\r\nreserves in China and Nepal are closely monitoring this survey in developing\r\ninitiatives to save habitats and preserve biodiversity there.  The education\r\ncomponents of this project will transfer basic knowledge of the importance\r\nof all living things using beetles as examples to the youth of America\r\nthrough the classroom and positive interactions with scientists in the\r\nfield.  Products that will be available through the web have the potential\r\nto teach millions of people about biodiversity and the importance of knowing\r\nand understanding the organisms that share this world with us.\r\n",
