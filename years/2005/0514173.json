 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide support for a workshop \"Exchanging Cyber-Infrastructure Themes in Engineering Design\" that will bring researchers in engineering design from different disciplines (mechanical, civil, materials, industrial) together with information technology researchers to explore how predictive product realization can be supported by and provide support to the cyberinfrastructure enterprise. The objectives of the workshop are threefold: 1) identify CI-related research themes within the engineering design (ED) community; 2) build relationships within ED and between ED researchers and other disciplines; and 3) foster interactions with potential industry developers and users of the cyberinfrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be a 1-1/2 day workshop held in Arlington, VA February 28 - March 1, 2005. Participation will be limited to 30 attendees along with the organizing committee. Applicants will submit a statement identifying what they believe to be key issues that cannot currently be solved with today's computing capabilities and participants will be selected by the organizing committee based upon these statements.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is expected to have broad impacts for engineering design across the engineering disciplines, through the identification of research needs to provide the foundational tools for future predictive product and system realization. Findings and recommendations of the workshop will be disseminated both on the web and through white papers presented to NSF and to the broader community at professional meetings. \r\n",
