 "awd_abstract_narration": "UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF MARYLAND LOUIS STOKES ALLIANCE FOR MINORITY PARTICIPATION, PHASE III \r\n\r\nThe  proposed  funding  will  support  the  continuation  of  a  comprehensive  program  connecting  students  with  the research  base  at  three  USM  institutions  that  began  an  Alliance  in  1995  to  extend  and  increase  the  impact  of initiatives to increase substantially the quantity and quality of underrepresented minority (URM) students receiving baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields.  With Dr. Freeman A. Hrabowski, III, President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore  County  (UMBC)  continuing  as  Principal  Investigator,  UMBC,  the  University  of  Maryland,  College  Park (UMCP), and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) will implement the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase III which is designed to serve undergraduate students, particularly those who are members of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups. \r\n \r\nBuilding on lessons learned from the successes in Phase I and II and best practices from other LSAMP Programs and other initiatives with similar goals, the following measurable objectives have been established for the proposed LSAMP, Phase III. \r\n \r\nTo increase the enrollment of URM students in STEM fields annualy; \r\nTo increase the retention to second year rate of URM students in STEM fields annualy; \r\nTo improve the academic performance of URM students in STEM courses and majors annually; \r\nTo increase the percentage of URM STEM students earning cumulative GPAs at or above 3.0 annually; \r\nTo increase the six-year graduation rates of URM students in STEM majors; \r\nTo increase the number of URM students who go on to graduate programs in STEM fields. \r\n \r\nNSF and other funds will provide support for the five major Alliance components: \r\n \r\nThe Summer Component:  Includes a Summer Bridge Program to facilitate new students' transition to the \r\nuniversity through academic support and summer research opportunities for continuing students \r\n \r\nThe Academic Year Component:    Includes  undergraduate  research  fellowships,  graduate  school \r\npreparation, intrusive academic advising, mentoring tutoring, monitoring, and other academic support; \r\n \r\nThe Collaboration Component:  Is designed to enhance and provide a formal structure for colaborations \r\namong and between programs and initiatives on and off the USM LSAMP campuses with goals similar to \r\nthose of LSAMP. \r\n \r\nThe Curriculum Review and Revision Component:  The ongoing review and, as needed, revisions of the \r\ncurricula for .filter\" STEM courses will facilitate the success and retention in STEM majors of URM and other students. \r\n \r\nThe Tracking and Follow-up Component:  The academic and career accomplishments of Program alumni \r\nwill  be  tracked,  and  folow-up  contacts  will  be  made  with  them  to  encourage  their  persistence  in  STEM graduate programs and consideration of STEM careers, particularly in the professoriate. \r\n \r\nThroughout their undergraduate years, students will be actively involved in research projects with faculty and other mentors,  at  the  partnering institutions  and  off campus  (including  national  laboratories), and  will be  encouraged  to present  their  research  findings  in  appropriate  settings.    Also,  in  Phase  III,  the  USM  Alliance  will  collaborate  with \r\nestablished programs operating on the campuses, including the NSF-funded Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate  (AGEP),  and  the McNair  Scholars  and  Upward  Bound  programs  funded  by  the  U.S.  Department of Education, among others that provide a pipeline with targeted services to support URM students from grade nine through the Ph.D.",

Moreover, we have succeeded in identifying and implementing best practices that help to broaden participation in STEM significantly not only at the undergraduate level but also through the Ph.D.  Notable outcomes are provided below.\n\nUndergraduate Degrees\n\nGrowth in STEM bachelor\u2019s degrees has been evident among all URM groups, but successful outreach and retention activities have resulted in the greatest growth occurring among Native American and Hispanic students.\n\nSTEM bachelor\u2019s degrees awarded to URM students rose from 2,011 during Phase I (1995-2000) to 3,011 during Phase III (2006-2010).  This represents a 49% increase.\nSTEM bachelor\u2019s degrees awarded to Black or African American students rose from 1,543 during Phase I to 2,214 during Phase III.  This represents a 43% increase.\nSTEM bachelor\u2019s degrees awarded to Hispanic students rose from 325 during Phase I to 734 during Phase III.  This represents a 126% increase.\nSTEM bachelor\u2019s degrees awarded to Native American students rose from 27 during Phase I to 63 during Phase III.  This represents a 137% increase.\n\n\nUndergraduate Enrollment and Progress\n\nWe have developed an increasingly healthy pipeline of students who are well prepared to complete STEM degrees and advance into the STEM workforce.\n\nURM students enrolled in STEM bachelor\u2019s degree programs rose from 3,197 in year 5 of Phase I (1999-2000) to 4,259 in year 5 of Phase III (2009-2010).  This represents a 33% increase.\nOver time, there has been an increase in the number of URM students who achieve junior and senior classification and are well positioned to complete STEM bachelor\u2019s degrees.  URM STEM juniors and seniors rose from 1,572 in year 5 of Phase I to 2,032 in year 5 of Phase III.

For example, the percentage of B.S. degrees awarded to URM students in Geosciences, Physics/Astronomy, and Chemistry increased by 300%, 260%, and 208%, respectively, from year 5 of Phase I to year 5 of Phase III.\nDirect student participants, in particular, perform well academically each year, and both the number and percentage of these students who earn grades that ultimately will be competitive for graduate school continues to increase.

These awards helped us to strengthen both our undergraduate and graduate education pipelines and create an expanded community of STEM scholars.  As LSAMP alumni, the BD Fellows have had a strong and positive influence on the LSAMP undergraduates.  Significantly, the USM BD program produced five Ph.D.s in academic year 2010-2011.\n\n\nAlumni Accomplishments\n\nUSM LSAMP alumni are making important contributions across the STEM disciplines.  Many have gone on to graduate programs; others have gone directly into the workforce in a broad range of STEM careers from the professoriate to rocket science.\n\nSuccessful strategies to prepare students for graduate education and to track LSAMP alumni are evident by the 93 alumni who have been identified as having earned either Ph.D. or M.D. / Ph.D. degrees.\n\n\nCatalyst for Additional External Funding\n\nThe LSAMP has been a catalyst for significant increases in external funding to support STEM initiatives.\n\nSupplemental funding was provided through LSAMP annually by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and BioEngineering that allowed us increase the number of students in our Summer Bridge Program.  It also supported partial scholarships for tuition, fees, room, and board to undergraduates.  We have found that scholarship support is critical to the success of STEM students because it relieves the stress and time commitment required to hold jobs while navigating the rigorous curricula.\nNumerous other federal and state agencies, foundations, and private sources also provided external funding.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/21/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Freeman Hrabowski"
