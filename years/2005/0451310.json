The \r\nresearch questions include: what are the forms or structural properties \r\nof these new institutions and how do they differ from traditional \r\nresearch universities? What is the startup process of these new \r\ninstitutions? How can the concept of the \"learning contract\" help us \r\nunderstand the evolution of these new forms of higher education as well \r\nas other learning organizations?\r\n\r\nThis multi-disciplinary research draws on the organizational change \r\nliterature, role theory literature, recent work on psychological \r\ncontracts, and the literature about innovative forms of higher education \r\ninstitutions.  The project includes four related studies of research \r\nuniversity startups. The first two studies will rely on rich \r\nethnographic methods including interviews and observation, as well as \r\narchival records to capture the form of these institutions and their \r\nprocesses during the startup phase. The third study will develop and \r\nvalidate scales in a survey instrument, tapping the learning contract \r\nconstruct. The fourth study will use data from the first three studies \r\nto examine initial effectiveness indicators. These last two studies rely \r\non construct development, hypothesis testing, and quantitative methods.\r\n\r\nThe potential broader impact of this research includes: 1) helping U.S. \r\nuniversities maintain their historically competitive edge while under \r\nsevere pressure to change due to environmental forces such as \r\nconstrained governmental support, escalating faculty recruitment and \r\nretention costs, downward tuition pressure from skeptical constituents, \r\nlower cost content delivery systems (e.g., e-learning), and \r\nglobalization of U.S. style education; 2) educational policy formation \r\nfor new and existing research and teaching universities; and 3) the \r\ndevelopment of the learning contract within university settings will \r\nprovide institutions and policy makers with new frameworks and \r\nmeasurement instruments to assess aspects of organizational effectiveness.\r\n\r\n",
