 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the response of ecological systems to disturbance is a central\r\nproblem in ecology, and is of fundamental importance to management of\r\necosystems from local to global scales.  Two major theories of disturbance\r\nare stability theory, which describes the rate of return of ecosystems to\r\npre-disturbance conditions, and multiple state theory, which describes the\r\ntransition of ecosystems between alternative equilibrium conditions (e.g.,\r\ngrassland vs. shrubland, etc.).  Because desert streams are subject to\r\nfrequent and severe disturbance in the form of both flood and drying, these\r\necosystems provide excellent models for understanding the response of\r\necosystems to disturbance more generally.  Prior to the end of the 19th\r\ncentury, wetlands (cienegas) were a common feature of the Southwestern U.S.\r\nErosion of these wetlands left most arid streams as bare, gravelbed channels\r\n(arroyos) that represent an alternative equilibrium.  Recent observations of\r\nwetland re-establishment at a long-term ecological study site (Sycamore\r\nCreek, AZ) provides an opportunity to evaluate how the alternative\r\nconfigurations of desert streams respond to disturbances using the context\r\nof stability theory.  Following flash flood disturbance, we will measure\r\nprimary production and ecosystem respiration in both wetland and gravelbed\r\nsites to determine whether these alternative stable states differ in their\r\nresponse to disturbance.  The Intellectual Merit of this proposal lies in\r\nthis integration of single- and multiple-equilibrium theories of ecosystem\r\nresponse to disturbance.  The Broader Impact of this research will be to\r\nimprove conservation and restoration efforts of this formerly-widespread and\r\nnow-rare wetland ecosystem, and to provide opportunities for training of\r\ngraduate students in the design, execution, and analysis of ecological\r\nstudies.",
