The focus will be the linear and nonlinear parabolic\r\nequations on complete manifolds with various curvature\r\nassumptions. These equations includes the linear heat equation\r\nand Laplacian operator, harmonic mapping heat equation, mean\r\ncurvature flow, Hermitian-Einstein flow, Ricci/Kaehler-Ricci\r\nflow, etc. These equations have various physical and geometric\r\norigins.  But they share many common features such as geometric\r\nsymmetries and identities, monotonicity formulae, entropy like\r\nconsiderations, differential Harnack (also called\r\nLi-Yau-Hamilton) inequalities.  They also connect to each other\r\nin various ways.  By studying them together, more light is shed\r\non all of them.\r\n\r\nDifferential Geometry is the study of the relationship between\r\nthe geometry of a space, a manifold in the mathematical notion,\r\nand the analytic properties of the functions and the differential\r\nequations, on the underlying space. Geometric analysis is the\r\nstudy of the overall geometric and topological properties of a\r\nspace by piecing together the local information. Since the spaces\r\nare usually curved ones, the ``curvature\" was introduced to\r\nmeasure the deviation from the Euclidean space and the techniques\r\nare often `nonlinear' even dealing with a linear problem. The\r\nstudy of this area of mathematics has close connection with the\r\ngeneral relativity and string theory in physics. The applications\r\ncan be found in the study of thestructure of complicated\r\nmolecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and even the large scale\r\nnetworks. This project on studying the Kaehler manifolds via\r\nlinear and nonlinear parabolic equations will enhance the\r\nunderstanding of geometric analysis, linear and nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equations, algebraic geometry and mathematical\r\nphysics.\r\n",
