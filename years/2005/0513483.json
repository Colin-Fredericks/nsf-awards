 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to use functionalized, fluorinated allenes to develop new fluorinated ring construction methodologies. They will first prepare a number of mono and difluoroallenes. The metallation, alkylation and substitution reactions of these compounds will be investigated followed by a study of their use in cyclization reactions to prepare both fluorinated heterocycles and carbocycles.  \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Gerald B. Hammond of the University of Louisville. Dr. Hammond and his student co-workers will study the preparation and reaction chemistry of a number of organofluorine molecules known as fluorinated allenes. Many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals are organofluorine containing molecules and this group will be developing new synthetic routes to these types of molecules. Students trained during the course of this work will gain experience in synthetic organofluorine chemistry and acquire skills needed by the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries.",
