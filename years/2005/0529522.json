 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Astronomy Learning in Immersive Virtual Environments \r\n(ALIVE) Project is to evaluate the effectiveness  of the use of  \r\ncomputer-generated immersive virtual environments (VEs) for teaching \r\nastronomical concepts in college introductory astronomy classes. The \r\nstudy will find optimal learning modes for astronomy, and quantify the \r\nbenefits that immersive VEs may have for enabling spatial learning. The \r\nexperiment will compare the advantages of immersive VEs over their \r\nnon-immersive counterparts.\r\n\r\nALIVE establishes a collaboration between a four-year urban university \r\nand a regional science museum. The study will take place in the \r\nintroductory astronomy classes  at the Metropolitan State College of \r\nDenver (MSCD), using the digital full-dome theater at the Denver Museum \r\nof Nature & Science (DMNS). The three-year study will use MSCD's \r\ndiverse urban student population as test subjects, and will be broken \r\nup into two stages. Phase I will develop the materials for the \r\nexperiment, while the experiment and follow-up analyses will take place \r\nin Phase II.  The study will use interactive, real-time software \r\ndeveloped at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science (DMNS). Astronomy \r\nclass students at the Metropolitan State College of Denver (MSCD) will \r\nbe surveyed to determine what astronomical misconceptions they already \r\npossess. From these frontend evaluations, learning modules using VE \r\nsimulations will be developed to supplement the introductory astronomy \r\ncurriculum. In the experiment, pre-course, post-course, and curriculum \r\ntests will be used to determine the efficacy of immersive \r\nvisualizations presented in DMNS' Gates Planetarium versus the same \r\nvisual simulations in non-immersive settings (i.e., shown on a flat \r\nscreen in a normal classroom), as well as a control case using \r\ntraditional classroom multimedia.  The project will stimulate and \r\nsupport the development of astronomy education modules used in \r\nmulti-user facilities such as smart classrooms and digital planetaria. \r\nSuch modules can also be used for informal science education in \r\nimmersive digital theaters. An important sub-study will look explicitly \r\nat gender-related trends, since there is evidence that women exhibit \r\ngreater gains than men in certain virtual navigation tasks when using \r\nan immersive VE.  These results may have the \r\npotential to increase female participation and retention in the \r\nsciences. These activities are strongly aligned with the goals of NSF \r\nGPRA Strategic Plan 2001-2006.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
