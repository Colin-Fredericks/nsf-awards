 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to design, develop and test a novel wafer-level encapsulation and chip-scale interconnection scheme for packaging of micro electromechanical systems. Arrays of radio frequency micro electromechanical system switch devices on a wafer are chosen as a demonstration test bed. The goal is to implement and test capping high resistivity silicon, polymer and low temperature co-fired ceramic wafers, with through wafer metallized vias for encapsulation and interconnection of radio frequency micro electromechanical system switches on the device wafer.  This project will be executed in an ongoing collaboration among the University of Arkansas, wiSpry, and Sandia National Laboratories. The success of the proposed technical approach will allow the industry to work on a wide gamut of micro electromechanical system devices operational in hermetic environments. These developments benefit micro electromechanical system packaging in strategic application areas of telecommunication, homeland security, biomedical devices, automotive and aerospace sensors, thin display and solid state lighting applications and fuel cells. The interdisciplinary expertise of the team will be conducive for the microsystems education of the students involved on this project. In the research, the special emphasis will be to recruit and nurture teaching, training and learning within underrepresented minorities.  Investigators will continue to build their ongoing partnership with area school community and the experience will used to forge new relations with the area Community Colleges. Training is inevitable today- to the technology community particularly in the Midwest- to create and retain new high paid microsystems related jobs in America.",
