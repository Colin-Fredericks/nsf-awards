 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nComputational science-using modeling, simulation, and visualization to investigate natural phenomena-has been the third leg of science for more than 30 years, complementing experiment and theory. This allows scientists 1) to see representations that can't be seen with the naked eye or with experimental apparatus, over time periods not possible on a human scale, 2) to safely simulate phenomena that cannot be achieved without endangering life or property, and 3) to conduct what-if scenarios to instantiate these from among the range of possible applications, algorithms, and architectures. Students must understand computational science to prepare to solve the problems facing today's global, technologically oriented society.\r\n\r\nThis project is conducting interviews, commissioning white papers, and convening a national workshop of experts in computational science and science education. These activities are identifying the challenges that preclude broader adoption of computational science education in all educational institutions. The project is producing recommendations for advancing science education at all educational institutions, including federal, state, and local imperatives to create systemic change in the education system to infuse computational science at all levels.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nExperts in science education are presenting exemplars of best practices of integrating computational science methods and content into education at all levels, among under-served populations, that are presented as models for national adoption and integration. They are developing recommendations for action to achieve national-scale impact and a research agenda where there is insufficient knowledge to achieve the vision.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThis project involves diverse groups to broaden the computational science community of practice. Attention is being given to diverse cultural and socio-economic perspectives for effecting broad sustained impact, since often the visual and hands-on characteristics of computational science empower students who lack adequate preparation to undertake more complex STEM coursework. This has the potential to achieve systemic change in science teaching and learning throughout the K-20 educational system.",
