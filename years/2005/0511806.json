 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators intend to study the superconvergence properties of Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) for partial differential equations. These methods are becoming important techniques for the computational solution of large scale problems modeled by  partial differential equations.  With discontinuous finite element bases, they capture discontinuities in, e.g., hyperbolic systems with high accuracy and efficiency; simplify adaptive h-, p-, r-, refinement and produce efficient  parallel solution procedures.   The investigators will study the superconvergence properties of  DG solutions of hyperbolic problems and local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG)  solutions of convection-diffusion problems in one and multiple space  dimensions. Several aspects of the superconvergence phenomena, including  the effects of numerical fluxes, stabilization schemes, mesh structure,  and order variation on superconvergence properties will be investigated.  They will also develop a framework for flexible continuous/discontinuous  finite element methods.  A knowledge of superconvergence properties will be used to construct simple and asymptotically exact a posteriori estimates of discretization errors and very accurate functions of interest.   Both of these provide valuable accuracy appraisals and guidance for an  adaptive solution strategy.  Indeed, superconvergence properties of DG and LDG solutions in two and three spatial dimensions will be used to develop new a posteriori estimates of discretization errors.  The investigators  will explore various strategies to construct very simple and computationally  efficient error estimates. \r\n\r\nMany practical computer simulations such as flow around a car or a plane  or weather forcasting still require a very long time on the the fastest  computers. The investigators will develop very efficient reliable and  accurate methods. This work will lead to more accurate computer simulations,  better product and shorter design cycles.\r\n",
