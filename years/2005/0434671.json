The fellowship supports research and training\r\nat the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the\r\ninformational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences.\r\nThe goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist\r\nin preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research\r\nand education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for\r\ntraining in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is\r\nexpected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play\r\nimportant roles in training the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled\r\n\"Evolution of introns in untranslated regions of genes\".  Using\r\npredictions and insight from theoretical population genetics, this\r\nproject seeks ultimately to provide creative methods and results for\r\nstudying the evolution of traits in long-lived plants, where generation\r\ntimes make existing methods impractical if not impossible.  The current\r\nfocus is on the use of informatics tools to explore the evolution of\r\nuntranslated regions (UTRs) of genes, and specifically the evolution of\r\nintrons within UTRs.  Introns are regions of genes that are removed\r\nprior to their translation into proteins, and mistakes in the removal of\r\nintrons are implicated in about one-third of human diseases.  Genome\r\nsequence data will be used from many separate species to explore the\r\neffect of population size, and genome features, on the structure and\r\nevolution of introns.  A publicly available database of introns found in\r\nUTRs is being constructed, as are several software tools that will be of\r\nuse to evolutionary and genome biologists.\r\n\r\nThe training goals are to learn the theories of genome evolution and the\r\ntechniques of genome biology.  In combination with the Fellow's\r\nextensive experience in both evolutionary genetics and software\r\nengineering, the fellowship will provide a solid foundation for robust,\r\ncomprehensive design of large bioinformatics projects.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n",
