 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a rapid post-processing technique for carbon and graphitic nanocomposite foams via a catalytic approach. Our novel approach will greatly reduce the post-processing time. The mechanical properties of carbon and graphitic foams will be improved by the reinforcement of nanofibers. This Phase I project will research and demonstrate the proposed rapid post-processing and nanocomposite technique for microcellular carbon and graphitic foams with mesophase pitch as the starting material. Both the nanocomposite carbon and graphitic foams will be developed that possess insulating and conducting properties, respectively.\r\n\r\nMicrocellular carbon and graphitic foams are expected to have many commercial applications including high temperature sandwich structures, energy absorbers, electrodes, purification and separation of gas and water, jet-engine rotors and stators, space structures, nozzle components in rocket engines, and hot structures. The proposed technique can also be used to manufacture other carbon-based materials like fibers, carbon/carbon composites, and hybrid composites, which have many structural applications.  \r\n",
