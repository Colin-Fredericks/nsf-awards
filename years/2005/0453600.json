 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) will establish an International REU Site in Hong Kong. The focus of this activity will be numerical analysis and scientific computing with application to  problems in applied science and engineering. The program will involve internationally known Numerical Analysis/Scientific Computing faculty from four major Hong Kong universities:  Hong Kong Baptist University,  Chinese University of Hong Kong, City University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The primary location of the program will be at  Hong Kong Baptist University.  The eight-week program will be offered during each of the summers of  2005, 2006 and 2007, and will involve ten U.S. student participants, the majority of whom will be non-CSM students.\r\n \r\nThe participating students will engage in team research with faculty mentors from  the four Hong Kong universities on topics from areas such as numerical linear algebra, wavelets, multidimensional integration and approximation, problem solving  environments, and numerical partial differential equations. Each project will involve original research, blending algorithm development and analysis, both mathematical and \r\ncomputational.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program will introduce talented undergraduate students to the joy and excitement of discovery that comes from participating in a vibrant international research program. It will also enhance the students' technical expertise by providing them with the opportunity to see and experience research problems from a global perspective, and they will gain training and independence in working on research problems in a multi-cultural setting.  It is anticipated that this REU experience will encourage more students  to pursue advanced degrees in the mathematical sciences with an international perspective.\r\n",
