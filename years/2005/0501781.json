 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering Technology Education, Wireless Technology \r\n\r\nThis project is developing, testing, and disseminating a new model for success and retention of engineering technicians. It is applied to the wireless communication track specifically, but can be generalized and applied to other engineering technology tracks. The project aims to address three important factors in the preparation of a skilled workforce: student preparedness, teachers and faculty development, and course content. The intended audiences are middle/high school students, wireless engineering technicians and engineers, high school teachers, and college faculty. The project aims to adopt and adapt published skill standards from the Global Wireless Education Consortium (GWEC) and the National Center for Telecommunications Technologies (NCTT), an NSF Advanced Technological Education Resource Center of Excellence. NCTT has developed four curriculum modules along with associated labs for wireless engineering technicians/engineers. This project is also developing four modules along with their associated labs for high schools. Each module incorporates a set of learning activities that emphasize the importance of math and science and relate them to realistic technological tasks. A classroom to workplace approach is being implemented and tested through an industry and education partnership. The modules provide technical experiences to school teachers and students. Collaboration with industry partners moves the laboratory components of the wireless courses from the classroom to the workplace environment. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project provides comprehensive faculty and teacher professional development in an evolving engineering technology field of wireless communication, which used extensively in business and industry. Hands-on learning experiences for technicians are being provided in a real workplace environment. The modules developed in collaboration with the industry partners expose the students to real case scenarios and troubleshooting techniques. Engineering technology is being introduced to school students through an active interaction with technicians setting up wireless networks.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project addresses the future needs of business and industry for new wireless technicians who have had hands-on experience in installing and troubleshooting wireless networks, cellular networks, or wireless sensors networks. Technical college faculty from technical colleges are engaging in hands-on learning workshops that result in curriculum enhancements and improved student learning. The project provides cutting-edge learning opportunities to schools with minority students by installing wireless networks in these schools.\r\n",
