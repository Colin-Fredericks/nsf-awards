 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and the Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez (UACJ), Mexico will jointly organize a conference on microsystems technology (MEMS) for the first time in the El Paso - Cd. Juarez region in September 2005. In particular, the seventh in the series of TEXMEMS conferences will be hosted at the US-Mexican border to promote international and inter-regional collaborations and create several TEXMEMS firsts. TEXMEMS workshops provide a forum for technical information exchange between scientists and engineers from organizations throughout the southwestern United States. In the past, TEXMEMS meetings have taken place in central Texas universities including Texas A&M University (1999, 2004), Southern Methodist University (2000), University of Texas at Dallas (2001), Texas Technological University (2002), and the University of Texas at Arlington (2003).  This year, TEXMEMS VII will be hosted in both the US and Mexico (for the first time) and will include keynote addresses, technical presentations and industrial tours. Broad participation from throughout Mexico (for the first time) and the southwestern United States is anticipated. The conference will encompass two days (for the first time) of activities in both nations.\r\n",
