 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with statistical inference in\r\nphenomena that result in massive, multidimensional  and/or\r\nfunctional data sets. Prime examples are geophysical, biomedical,\r\nand internet related data. In addition to high dimensionality, such\r\ndata are often characterized by self-affinity and require\r\nnon-standard (functional) models for their modeling and subsequent\r\nstatistical analysis. The methodology to be developed will advance\r\nboth the theory and practice of functional data analysis, a very\r\nfast-developing and modern area of statistics. The common and novel\r\nfeatures of the statistical methods proposed here lie in the nature\r\nof analyzed data. The data sets are massive, multidimensional,\r\nfunctional, and possibly self-affine (fractal or multifractal).\r\nRecent progress in multiscale data representations provide natural\r\nand efficient environments for (i)  developing scale-sensitive\r\nanalyzing tools for estimation, testing, classification, and\r\ndeconvolution, and (ii) describing, summarizing, and modeling\r\nself-similar data. Bayesian methodology will be used whenever\r\navailable prior information can be incorporated or whenever sensible\r\nautomatic priors are possible.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of new inferential methodologies is critical for the\r\nstatistical support of recent scientific initiatives and newly\r\nemerging technologies. The proposed research is application driven,\r\nso the specificities of the application fields influence the design\r\nand focus of the methodology. Techniques suggested in the proposal\r\ndeal  with problems of testing of efficiency of new medical\r\ntreatments, target  detection and classification as well as\r\nclassification of medical images, or more accurate recovery of radar\r\nor satellite data. Hence, the methodologies which result from the\r\nproposal are applicable in such areas of strategic interest as\r\nhealth and medicine and homeland security. In addition to\r\nmethodological impact,  the proposed research has a strong\r\neducational component consisting of training graduate students,\r\ninvolving undergraduate students in research projects, conducting\r\ninter-departmental seminars, increasing awareness of mathematics\r\neducation among the work force, and attracting minority and female\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n",
