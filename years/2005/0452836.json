 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe NSF-funded REU Site at New York University offers opportunities for basic research in the field of neural science.  The objective of this field of science is to understand the biological basis of brain functions involving sensory perception, cognition, memory, learning, planning and emotion.   At the Center for Neural Science (CNS), in particular, undergraduates are mentored to in several areas: cellular biology of learning and memory, neuro-economics dealing with mechanisms that underlie decision-making, visual neuroscience, etc. The neuroscientists at the Center form a friendly, cohesive group, yet their scope of activities ranges from genetics to molecular and cellular neurobiology to mathematical modeling of neural networks. By keeping the REU group small (10 students are admitted yearly), each student will be able to benefit from the intense, personalized mentorship he or she receives, while also gaining knowledge about research activities of all other participants through activities in the form of lunches, visitation of other students' labs, and group meetings with all of the faculty members serving as REU mentors. The program will seek to recruit under-represented minorities from small liberal arts colleges and/or historically black colleges. Rather than using SAT or GPA scores, the key requirement for selection will be that students have demonstrated keen interest in neural science research and are self-driven and inquisitive. More information is available at http://www.cns.nyu.edu/undergrad/surp/ or by contacting Dr. Chiye Aoki (tel 212-998-3929; email chiye@cns.nyu.edu).\r\n",
