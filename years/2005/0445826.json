 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Genomic Research is awarded a grant to support the development of the Genome Properties system (www.tigr.org/Genome_Properties). Genome Properties is a relational database system, which includes a set of tools and web interfaces for the investigation of the metabolism, phenotypes, qualitative and quantitative measures, and other biological properties of microbial life. In particular, Genome Properties will provide: (1) Automatic determination of biological systems and metabolic pathways, which are made up of protein, RNA or DNA components. Algorithms have been developed to apply logical rules to determine, from the set of components identified, whether the processes are likely (or unlikely) to be active in each of the organisms. (2) Representation of phenotypes and processes such as optimal growth temperature or pathogenicity, which cannot be determined by analysis of the genome. These Genome Properties are set manually and are mapped to traceable literature citations or particular expert curators. (3) Structures that allow formation of higher-level Genome Properties by combining disparate data types including the states and values of other Genome Properties. (4) A user-friendly query and data display system including multiple data views and facile download of data. This system also permits comparative analysis between species, and statistical evaluation of relationships between Genome Properties. And (5), a web- and email-based system for interaction between the scientific community and Genome Properties curators to promote the accuracy of the data and the development of new Properties and structures best suited to the needs of researchers at large. All databases, data sets and software will be made available on the Comprehensive Microbial Resource and released as Open Source. The Genome Properties system is being incorporated into TIGR.s existing microbial annotation pipeline where significant improvements in annotation speed, accuracy and richness have been realized. The system integrates research and education in serving as an online encyclopedia of microbiological data for students and teachers.",
