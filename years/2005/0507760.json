 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST 0507760\r\nMarina Romanova\r\nCornell University\r\nVariability of Accreting Magnetized Stars\r\nABSTRACT\r\nNewly developed numerical methods will be applied to problems of disk interactions with\r\nmagnetized stars. Specifically, 3-dimensional models of disk-magnetosphere interactions will be\r\ngenerated using numerical codes based on an inflated cube grid. The simulations will be used to\r\nhelp link observational data with underlying physics. The goal is to help understand the nature of\r\nthe variability of different types of magnetized stars (Classical T Tauri stars, cataclysmic variables,\r\nand accreting neutron stars). With this in mind, four different activities will be undertaken: (1)\r\nsimulations will be run with parameters as close to observational constraints as possible; (2)\r\ndifferent mechanisms of variability and quasi-variability which follow from 2-dimensional and 3-\r\ndimensional numerical modeling will be investigated; (3) the light-curves from the modeled\r\nmagnetized stars will be calculated and analyzed to determine the origin of different peaks in the\r\npower spectra; and (4) a program will be developed which will search for the best match between\r\nobserved and modeled light curves.\r\nIncluded is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in complex magnetohydrodynamic\r\nphysics as well as advanced programming and modeling techniques. The results obtained here will\r\nbe disseminated to the public through an education/public outreach program at the local Science\r\nMuseum and through a Virtual Reality  outreach program to school children and educators.",
