 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe National Curve Bank (NCB) was founded under NSF DUE CCLI - EMD proof of concept grant #0127283. The NCB addresses the challenge of improving learning through making materials inexpensively and easily available to a wide audience of faculty and students via the Web site  http://curvebank.calstatela.edu.  Through this site topics on curves often are enhanced in various ways that the printed page does not allow, including animation and interactive components.  Numerous modules (deposits) are featured.\r\n\r\nThis CCLI- EMD full development project continues to refine and expand the Web site by increasing interactive capabilities, improving animation and video streaming, adding deposits on surfaces, and creating multimedia components.  Other features include applications of mathematics concepts in science, technology and engineering for STEM undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nStudents and faculty of diverse backgrounds participate in every stage of development, and the 33 members of the National Advisory Board continue to communicate regularly in evaluating new bank \"deposits.\"  An annual prize, the Renie, is awarded for Best Deposit of the Year.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in the development and refinement of materials for the NCB.  In addition to including students, faculty members, and an Advisory Board from numerous institutions in the process of developing, improving, and approving materials, the broader impacts include that the results of the project reach a diverse, national audience.",
