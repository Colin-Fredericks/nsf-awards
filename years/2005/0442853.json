 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is attempting to enhance electrical engineering education by improving the students' transition from fundamental courses to the first discipline-specific courses. The investigators are developing course material for an introductory electrical engineering course that reviews several topics in mathematics and physics in the context of electrical engineering applications. The material consists of six two-week modules that include a prerequisites review, a technical description of the engineering topic, and associated homework and laboratory assignments. Class notes, examples and demonstrations, homework assignments, and laboratory notes are being developed and organized in a web-based format.  The main challenge is identifying the specific prerequisite skills that need to be reinforced and the corresponding electrical engineering topics that will engage and motivate the students without overwhelming them.  These modules are particularly suited for transfer and back-to-school students, and they provide an ideal articulation link between junior colleges and four-year programs.  The investigators are evaluating the material using both quantitative and qualitative techniques, including written surveys and personal interviews.  Dissemination plans include conference papers, journal articles, a web posting, and a possible textbook.",
