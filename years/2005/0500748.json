 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes four projects aimed to deepen\r\nour understanding of the combinatorics, algebra and topology of\r\nsimplicial complexes through the study of their size (or face numbers).\r\nThis includes work on the Upper Bound Theorem that has its origins in\r\nthe theory of convex polytopes, and the study of the face numbers and\r\nBetti numbers of balanced simplicial complexes, flag complexes, and\r\ncomplexes with symmetry.\r\n\r\nCombinatorics is an active field of mathematics today that has close\r\nconnections with many other subjects such as\r\nalgebra, geometry and topology, optimization, statistics,\r\netc. inside mathematics, and computer science, high-energy physics, and\r\nbiology outside. Continuing exploring  and developing new  cross-\r\npollinations and interactions between combinatorics and other areas of\r\nmathematics is a central intellectual pursuit of this project.\r\nSpecifically, this proposal concerns simplicial complexes --- finite\r\nobjects that provide the easiest way to represent multi-dimensional shapes\r\nin a computer through their triangulations --- and various bounds on the\r\nsizes of such complexes. The minimal size of a triangulation has taken on\r\npractical significance, since it directly affects the complexity of\r\ncomputations involving a particular shape.\r\n",
