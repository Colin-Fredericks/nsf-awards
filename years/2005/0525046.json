 "awd_abstract_narration": "(42) The project is developing: (1) educational materials for an earth processes course; (2) a research demonstration of doing science with students and images; and (3) web tools that facilitate both learning and research using images. The project is based upon the education, research and outreach success of the Landscape Change Program developed by the PI and is creating visual educational resource materials that are being  used for K-12, undergraduate, graduate and informal education as well as research. The use of images for education and research on the scale involved is serving as a catalyst for interdisciplinary education. The project is developing, demonstrating, evaluating, and disseminating educational materials and ideas. The development is being done by students working in close concert with the PI to create both image analysis and retrieval tools as well as web- and classroom-based educational materials, all centered on doing and learning science with landscape imagery. Teams of students, working summers, are demonstrating just how much science can be done by analyzing images quantitatively. \r\n",
