 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\n\r\nThe objective of the research is to develop artificial surface nanostructures to mimic gecko skins. Geckos have an amazing ability to climb up and down vertical dry walls effortlessly. Recent investigations revealed the secret of uniquely structured \"Seta\" hairs on gecko's palms. The keratinous seta fibers are composed of hundreds of finer nano-structured spatulas. This unique structure allows a gecko to use efficient van der Waals forces to make its dry hands sticky. In this proposed program fundamental understandings and manufacturing technologies to fabricate synthetic Gecko skin structures will be researched. The approach is through systematic analysis of the artificial gecko foot hairs in terms of material properties and structural parameters of the nano-patterned polymer surface. Nanoimprinting and Synthetic chemistry are the tools to achieve the nanopatterned polymer surfaces with designed engineering properties, which enables strong but reversible adhesive surfaces. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\n\r\nThe main components of the proposed research project cover several disciplines of science and engineering including molecular design, synthesis, and nano-fabrication. The results may lead to new biomimetic nanostructures with economic significance. The research will be integrated into a strong educational effort including graduate student training, curriculum development, and undergraduate student research opportunity. This interdisciplinary project will involve students from both material science and electrical engineering departments. The results obtained will be incorporated to graduate level courses on nanotechnology and biomaterials. In addition, synthetic gecko tapes for in-class demonstration will be developed as effective educational tools for the K-12 teachers and students to experience the emerging nano-bio science. \r\n\r\n",
