 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will enable the creation of an electrophysiology laboratory with equipment necessary for whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp recording and single-channel recording in cultured cells and tissues.  Four Calvin College professors, along with undergraduate research assistants, will share the equipment to work on four research projects.  [1] Retinal contrast adaptation: Loren Haarsma (Physics). [2] Rho GTPases and neuronal differentiation: Stephen Matheson (Biology). [3] Probst bundles: Paul Moes (Psychology). [4]  Duct cells in the lacrimal gland: John Ubels (Biology).\r\n \r\nSome of the research with this instrumentation will contribute to our growing knowledge of the complex chain of biochemical events that occur when neuronal precursor cells develop into full-fledged, specialized nerve cells.  Other research is part of a larger effort to understand how the retina converts light signals into electrical signals interpreted by the brain.  In addition, contrast adaptation is just one example of nerve cells adapting to second-order signal statistics (e.g. variation around the mean).  Understanding these mechanisms in the retina could have broader implications for similar adaptation in other areas of the brain.  All of these interdisciplinary research projects will include research training of undergraduate students. In addition, as the first patch-clamp rig in the Grand Rapids area, it will serve new users and existing collaborators from area educational institutions and the Van Andel Research Institute, with the life and usefulness of the equipment extending well beyond the three-year proposal period.  \r\n",
