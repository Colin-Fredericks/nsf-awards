 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new class of carbohydrate polyethers for chiral chromatography, by starting with levoglucogan produced from starch. In nine out of the top ten selling drugs, the active ingredient is chiral. The (2-3)-polyethers are unique because they have multiple contiguous chiral centers, which can be manipulated to form desired intermediates, with  unparalleled optical integrity and the highest density of functional groups of all known molecules. Drug manufacturers seek new chiral stationary phases with high and extended chiral selectivity, high loading capacity, and ability to tolerate a wide range of mobile phases. To meet this need, epoxide monomers will be synthesized and polymerized into a 100% stereo specific chiral stationary phase for liquid chromatography of enantiomers. This polyether phase will be applied to silica supports and evaluated by leading chromatography equipment manufacturers. \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will primarily be in the manufacture of enantiomerically pure pharmaceuticals. Further impact of the proposed work will extend to drug purification, sugar separations, selective epoxidation, and controlled polymerization for a range of bio-refinery products.",
