 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than a half century ago, Sir Edward Bullard conjectured that the\r\nmotions necessary to generate the Earth's magnetic field in the\r\nEarth's electrically-conducting fluid core might be driven by the\r\nluni-solar precession. All that has been unequivocally established\r\nin the intervening 55 years is that precession can in principle\r\nsupply the geodynamo with abundant power. The question of whether\r\nit can draw on this power is still unanswered, and this provides\r\nthe challenging target that is the basis of the intellectual merit of this\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nMuch has been learned during the last decade about the structure\r\nand stability of precessionally-driven flows, but only when\r\nmagnetic fields are absent. In analogy with parallel studies of\r\nconvectively-driven system studies, it is anticipated that the character\r\nand strength of a precessionally-driven flow will be dramatically\r\ndifferent in the presence of a \"sufficiently-strong\" magnetic field\r\nmeaning, in the geophysical context, a field of strength comparable\r\nwith that inferred for the Earth's core. The proponents to investigate this\r\nmatter as part of a systematic study of such magnetoprecessional\r\ndynamos\", and also to see if they provide a new example of so-called\r\nstrong field dynamo action\".\r\n\r\nThe main theoretical tool to be used in the proposed research\r\nis a computer code that has been under development at UCLA for\r\nthe past 18 months. It employs the grid point based \"method of\r\noverlapping grids\". This is very suitable for rotationally\r\nflattened bodies of fluid such as Earth's core. The method\r\nhas been generalized here so that it solves the\r\nfull magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo equations in 3 dimensions.\r\nThe code is on the verge of completion and this proposal\r\nmainly seeks support to parallelize it and to improve\r\nits efficiency so that Bullard's proposal can be thoroughly evaluated.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the completed code will exceed its\r\napplication to precession. Without major modification, precessional\r\ndriving can be replaced by buoyant forcing, so putting the model in\r\ncompetition with other codes currently under development for\r\nspherical convective dynamos. Without further change it could be\r\nused to study dynamos operating in rotationally flattened objects\r\n(Saturn, galactic discs,. . . ). The investigators plan to make\r\nthese generalizations. It would also be possible to generalize\r\nto tidally distorted objects such as extra-solar planets.\r\nEven if Bullard's speculation has to be abandoned, it will be\r\neasy to investigate how a convectively-driven geodynamo is\r\ninfluenced by precession.",
