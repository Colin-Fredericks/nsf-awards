 "awd_abstract_narration": "Until World War I wealth inequality in most industrialized economies was\r\nhigh. Then, in the next half century, it collapsed. In Paris, for instance, the share of\r\nwealth owned by the top 1% fell by half (from 70% to 35%). Although there has been\r\nsignificant variation in wealth concentration in developed economies since the end of\r\nWorld War II, in a historical perspective we have been living in a world of diminished\r\ninequality. In collaboration with Thomas Piketty and Gilles Postel-Vinay, I propose\r\nto investigate the collapse of wealth inequality by examining estate tax records from\r\nParis in the period from 1912 to 1946. To do so the PI plans to collect detailed information\r\nof the composition of estates for individuals who died in Paris during the years 1912,\r\n1922, 1927, 1932, 1937 and 1946. These years will provide access to one cross section\r\nbefore and one after each of the great shocks this era such as WWI, the Great Depression,\r\nand WWII).\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed activity:\r\nAlthough there has been increasing recognition of the importance of the\r\nchanges in inequality that occurred between 1914 and 1950, relatively little is known\r\nabout how the process unfolded. These data will complement data sets we have\r\nalready collected from 1807 to 1902 and will permit the compilation of homogeneous series\r\non wealth concentration in Paris and France from 1807 to 1946 that complement\r\npublished series that run from 1902 to 1984. The data offer detailed information on\r\nthe identity of the decedents and on the nature of the wealth they left behind. This will permit a better understanding of why the very rich failed to maintain their relative\r\nposition, and why the middle class started to accumulate assets at a much faster rate\r\nafter rather than before WWI.\r\nBroader impacts resulting from the proposed activity:\r\nUnderstanding the decline in inequality that occurred during the first half of\r\nthe twentieth century is important in its own right. More recently however, a number\r\nof economists have become interested in the consequences of the great shocks of the\r\nfirst half of the twentieth century on institutions. For some, these set back the\r\ndevelopment of private financial markets in those countries where the shocks were\r\nworst. Yet, to understand the political economy of institutional change, it is necessary to\r\nknow exactly what kinds of people were affected by the shocks and how that may\r\nhave changed their preferences for one set or another of institutions. On another\r\nlevel, we suspect that older cohorts had a much more difficult time overcoming the\r\nadverse consequences of the shocks than did younger ones. Beyond the lost\r\ngenerations on the battlefield, WWI and WWII may also have destroyed a generation\r\nof savers. As such, studying the first half of the twentieth century may provide some\r\nimportant clues at to the persistent effects of very large shocks and thus be of\r\nrelevance to present day concerns. Indeed  the impact on developing economies in Eastern Europe,Latin America, Africa and elsewhere of very large shocks that\r\nhave had important effects on wealth accumulation can only be understood by turning to history.",
