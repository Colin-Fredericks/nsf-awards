 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Dayton is providing a web site of resources on service learning and experiential learning for K-12 STEM educators.  Service-learning and experiential learning methods, when integrated into STEM curriculum, result in positive attitudes towards these fields and increase the likelihood of students pursuing further education in these areas.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis project is providing a simple mechanism to inform a significant group of K-12 STEM educators of  strategies available to incorporate service learning and experiential learning into their curriculum in order to encourage students to pursue careers in these fields.  By developing a central repository for these educational resources, and making this resource user-friendly and easily accessible, educators are more likely to implement them in their curriculum. The project is evaluating, distilling, and classifying the most easy-to-use, inexpensive, and effective methods.\r\n\r\nBy helping students to \"make the connections\" between STEM subjects and real-world issues, the educational strategies are expected to increase student interest in STEM disciplines, enrich learning experiences for students, and enhance the skills of STEM educators on the content and application of STEM subjects. The strategies have been shown to enhance the interest of girls and other under-represented populations in these fields.\r\n\r\nThe PI has extensive experience in incorporating service learning into science and engineering curriculum.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nEducators will more easily tie basic STEM principles to real-life applications and will promote service learning as a method of teaching course content as well as social responsibility and ethics, and show students the \"human\" side of science, math and engineering.  The project is expected to 1) promote the entry of women and minorities into the STEM fields, 2) increase the potential pool of engineers and scientists in the U.S., 3) contribute to the development of STEM educators, and 4) enhance cultural sensitivity, ethics and social responsibility in future STEM workers.  \r\n",
