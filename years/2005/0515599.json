 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) will develop \"Water Planet,\" a 5,000 square foot traveling exhibit, web site, and associated programs focusing on the new and evolving field of Earth system science.  It will apply the dynamic technologies of \"Science-on-a-Sphere,\" \" Digital River Basin,\" and \"GEO-Wall II\" to engage museum visitors in the processes by which water mediates many interactions among the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryoshpere, biosphere and geosphere.  Through these techniques, it will explore the potential of using large satellite and ground-based datasets, computermodeling, simulations and visualizations to increase public understanding of Earth system research.  Scientific collaborators include the National Center for Earth System Dynamics (Universiy of Minnesota, Twin Cities); Center for Advanced Materials for Purifiction of Water with Systems (University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana); and Sustainability of Semi-Arid Hydrology and Riparian Areas (University of Arizona, Tucson).\r\n\r\nBROADER  IMPACTS:  \"Water Planet\" will reach some three million people, with a focus on local water conservation and pollution issues and the way the entire planet functions.  In addition, through collaboration with the University of Connecticut Nonpoint Education for Municipal Officers (NEMO) program, the exhibition will help educate local government officials at exhibition venues.  SMM also will partner with the Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College Headwaters Science Center for educational outreach programs.  These applications of scientific visualization technology and lessons from this project will be shared with the science museum at large through a web site created for this purpose and other forms of professional dissemination.",
