 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Ethics Education In Science and Engineering award to The Colorado School of Mines supports a team of five faculty led by Dr. Juan Lucena, Department of Liberal Arts and International Studies to conduct research on the application of humanitarian ethics(HE) to engineering, and to create a model of HE for engineering in graduate education.\r\nEngineering ethics education and research, with focus mainly on individual and social responsibilities,\r\ncan be substantially enhanced by the analysis of an important dimension of engineering practice: the role\r\nof engineers in humanitarian activities. Further, reform initiatives in science and engineering (S&E)\r\ngraduate education have not yet realized their potential for integrating ethics into graduate curricula.\r\nContributing to these conceptual, methodological, and curricular challenges, the proposed project has the\r\nfollowing objectives: 1) to review and critically assess relations between humanitarianism and\r\nengineering in order to develop an applicable concept of HE in engineering\r\neducation and practice; 2) to discover and overcome barriers to the integration of HE in graduate\r\nengineering education as currently taught and learned; 3) to create and implement a model of HE in\r\ngraduate engineering education; and 4) to assess and improve the model of HE in order to make it an\r\nexample for broad dissemination. \r\nThe benefits to society from the proposed project include opening alternative career paths to\r\ngraduate engineering students in the areas humanitarian intervention and community development and\r\nproviding an ethical framework for humanitarian practice to an increasing number of engineers involved\r\nin humanitarian activities.\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Ethics Education in Science and Engineering announcement, NSF 05-532, and was funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering, Division of Computer and Network Systems in the Computer & Information Science & Engineering Directorate, and by the  Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences Directorate.",
