 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proliferation of shrubs and trees in arid/semiarid grasslands and savannas in recent\r\ndecades has been widely documented. This worldwide phenomenon threatens the\r\nlivelihood of rural economies through adverse impacts on livestock production. It is also\r\nthought to have had a significant impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle in North and\r\nSouth America, Australia and Africa. The ability of woody plants to encroach into\r\ngrasslands varies widely among species. Why are some so successful and others not?\r\nThe study will address this question by determining how woody plants gain their\r\nfoothold in grasslands during the critical establishment phase. By comparing the\r\nsurvivorship and growth of more and less successful woody encroachers under a range\r\nof climatic conditions and disturbances (defoliation), the study will determine a) which\r\nroot and shoot growth characteristics, of the many that seem plausible, are reliably\r\nassociated with encroachment potential; and b) how soil properties (such at clay\r\ncontent) may amplify or mitigate environmental factors influencing encroachment\r\npotential. The goals are two-fold: (1) to develop guidelines that can be used to identify\r\npotential problem species and characterize the conditions under which they are likely to\r\nestablish so that appropriate management actions can be taken to minimize their\r\ninvasion into grassland; and (2) to generate information needed to parameterize\r\nsimulation models that can be used to forecast when and where woody plant invasions\r\nare likely to occur, thus giving land managers time to develop and implement\r\nappropriate preventative measures. Outreach activities will be an integral part of this\r\nwork.",
