Most of the invited  lecturers will\r\n address a variety of interrelated topics, such as: ``best-constant''\r\n type problems concerning Sobolev and isoperimetric inequalities; the\r\n study of minimal and constant-curvature submanifolds; rectifiability\r\n and geometric measure theory; quasiconformal maps and potential\r\n theory; geometric flows and applications. Analysis in\r\n Carnot-Carath\\'eodory spaces is an important component in the general\r\n theory of abstract, non-smooth analysis which has seen extensive\r\n development in recent years. The conference, as envisioned by the\r\n PI's, will foster the collaboration of different research groups and\r\n provide a ground for discussion.\r\n \r\n The study of systems whose dynamics is subject to physical constraints\r\n has been a focus of attention for a long time, both from the point of\r\n view of pure mathematics and from the point of view of engineering and\r\n physics. Motivation for these inquiries stems from the wide variety of\r\n applications to problems in control theory, robotic planning, the\r\n structure of crystalline materials, image reconstruction, nonholonomic\r\n mechanics, and others. In mathematical terms such systems are\r\n represented by Carnot-Carath\\'eodory (sub-Riemannian) spaces. These\r\n are manifolds with a preferred set of directions at every point. These\r\n preferred directions represent the constraints; motion is only allowed\r\n in these directions. The study of geometry and  analysis on CC spaces\r\n is based on techniques from several mathematical disciplines: several\r\n complex variables, contact geometry, partial differential equations,\r\n harmonic analysis and geometric function theory. In turn, new results\r\n in the sub-Riemannian context often yield important progress in these\r\n areas.\r\n\r\n",
