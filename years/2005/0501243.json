 "awd_abstract_narration": "The striking similarities of pattern textures arising from\r\ndiverse microscopic systems suggest that patterns are macroscopic\r\nobjects whose behaviors depend mainly on certain overall large scale\r\ncommon symmetries rather than on microscopic details.  The proposer has\r\nbeen associated with efforts to exploit the macroscopic character of\r\npatterns for over thirty years.  The main ideas involve averaging over\r\nmany pattern wavelengths and introducing macroscopic order parameters,\r\nsuch as the pattern wavevector which, unlike the microscopic variables\r\nsuch as velocity and temperature, vary slowly over distances of the\r\npattern wavelength.  Near onset, that is for values of a stress\r\nparameter (e.g., Rayleigh number, buckling load) close to the threshold\r\nvalue at which the uniform state is unstable, the order parameters are\r\nthe slowly varying pattern amplitude and phase gradient and certain soft(Goldstone) modes which ay be present (e.g., mean drift in low to\r\nmoderate Prandte number convecting fluids).  They satisfy universal\r\npde's (Newell-Whitehead-Segel, complex Gingburg-Landau).  Far from\r\nonset, the amplitudes are slaved to the phase gradients and then the\r\nphase gradients and the soft modes also satisfy universal pde's\r\n(Cross-Newell).  In certain cases, these pde's are gradient flows and\r\nthe phase gradient fields to which the pattern relaxes are minimizers of functionals which belong to the harmonic map family.  The first aim of the proposed research is to continue work on plant patterns and plant phyllotaxis.  The second aim is to continue work on epidermal ridge formation.  The third aim is to develop further insight into the role of soft (Goldstone) modes in elastic sheet buckling.  The fourth aim is to continue our investigations into patterns far from onset and in particular those described by the regularized Cross-Newell (RCN)\r\nequation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatterns are ubiquitous.  One sees them in nature as sand\r\nripples, as cloud structures, as fingerprints, as tiger stripes and\r\nleopard spots, in the morphology of plants, and in geological\r\nformations.  In the laboratory they arise in experiments on heat\r\ntransport by convection, or ferrimagnetic garnet films, on wide aperture (\"fat\") laser beams, and on flame fronts.  They are all over literature. Open any journal these days in physics, chemistry, biology, ecology, engineering, the mathematical sciences and you will find several articles devoted to pattern formation.  One of the reasons for this interest is a curiosity as to why complicated microscopic systems\r\norganize themselves into ordered structures.  A second reason is that\r\nmore powerful methods (experimental, numerical, theoretical) are\r\nbecoming available to help us understand patterns.  A third reason is\r\nthat, in addition to scientific understanding, there may also be\r\ntechnological payoffs such as control of powerful laser arrays or\r\ninformation storage.  But perhaps the purest reason is the simplest.\r\nLike all beautiful things, they are mysterious and intriguing and full\r\nof open challenges for the fertile imagination to enjoy and explore.",
