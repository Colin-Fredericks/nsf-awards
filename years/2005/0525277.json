 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Artic Climate Model Program (ACMP) is designed to improve student performance in the Bering Strait School District (BSSD); a school district that serves isolated idigenous communities in the northeastern peninsula of Alaska.  The PI is building on a community-inclusive infrastructure that was established over an eight-year period.  The plan of action for this program is, by necessity, adapted to the lifestyle of the community at large.  As the population primarily survives by subsistence living, the families must hunt and fish during the summer months so as to acquire sufficicent commodities for the winter.  Therefore, teachers and students will be active participants in the ACMP during the academic year.  Using multiple technologies, including GIS and STELLA numerical modeling software, AMCP will infuse mathematical and physical science phenomenal themes, focusing on climatic impacts to the communities' daily lives.  Each teacher will receive a mininum of 156 contact hours of instruction per year.  Overall, this program will directly include 375 teachers and 5,100 students during its three years of operation.",
