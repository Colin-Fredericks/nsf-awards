The difficult structure of the problem requires innovative\r\ntechniques and ideas beyond the well developed tools such as the\r\nmethod of concentration-compactness.  Recently, the PI has\r\ncollaborated with F. H. Lin on the existence of these Faddeev\r\nknots and a series of important results have been obtained.  A\r\nnotable feature in their study is that, although compactness may\r\nfail, existence may be achieved as a consequence of two key\r\ninequalities: the first inequality, called by them the\r\nSubstantial Inequality, ensures the existence of at least one\r\ntopological minimizer; the second inequality, giving an optimal\r\nsublinear upper growth estimate for the Faddeev energy in terms\r\nof the associated topological charge, implies the existence of an\r\ninfinite family of topological minimizers, hence the existence of\r\nthe Faddeev knots. This progress opens new directions for\r\nachieving a higher level of understanding of various unsettled\r\naspects of the Faddeev knots, including the existence of\r\nunit-charge unknots (ring-like solitons), existence of\r\nhigh-charge knots and their stability, and transition pictures of\r\nknots in view of their topological and energetical\r\ncharacteristics. The similarity between the Faddeev energy and\r\nthe Skyrme energy may be exploited to tackle the difficult\r\nexistence problem of the Skyrme solitons. Indeed, a by-product of\r\nthe work of F.  H. Lin and the PI will be a proof of the\r\nexistence of unit-charge Skyrme solitons which corrects the\r\nflawed (but well-known) proof of M. Esteban published in 1986.\r\nThis study may also be extended to the Skyrme model in two\r\nspatial dimensions which has applications in condensed matter\r\nphysics and cosmology. This project also suggests new directions\r\nfor the study of the existence problems of global energy\r\nminimizers with topological characteristics in other important\r\nrelated areas.\r\n\r\nThe concept of knots is of foundational importance in\r\nscience. For example, Lord Kelvin first explored the idea of\r\nusing knots to model atoms and molecules.  More recently, the\r\nconcept of knots has inspired various fundamental areas,\r\nincluding particle and condensed-matter physics, statistical\r\nmechanics, cosmology, molecular biology, and synthetic chemistry.\r\nUp until recently, mathematical work had been focused on\r\ntopological and combinatorial classifications of knots, but not\r\non existence.  In 1995, Faddeev and Niemi started a seminal study\r\non the existence of knots as the soliton solutions of a quantum\r\nfield theory model known as the Faddeev model using high-power\r\ncomputer simulations.  The proposed work develops a mathematical\r\nexistence theory of such knots.  This work will give new insight\r\ninto the mathematical structure of knots and their computer\r\nrealization.\r\n",
