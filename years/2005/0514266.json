Casanova of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale to work with Dr. Gabriel A. Gonzalez of Universidad Catolica del Norte in Antofagasta, Chile, as well as with Dr. Ulrich Radtke at the University of Cologne in Germany, on a dissertation enhancement project entitled \"Morphotectonic Evolution of the Mejillones Peninsula, Northern Chile Using Precise GPS Measurement of Uplifted Coastal Terraces.\"  This peninsula was largely inaccessible until the last few years.  It contains a sequence of uplifted coastal terraces that rank among the best in the world.  At least 13 distinct terrace levels are present, and because of the extreme aridity, is unmatched in preserved terrace morphology, terrace-capping sedimentary deposits and the abundant fossil material preserved in those deposits.  The goal of this research is to map, precisely measure and analyze this sequence.  The results would add to the worldwide databse of terrace-based sea-level information, investigating local climate evolution, and documenting the Plio-Pleistocene tectonic evolution of the sediment-starved Chilean subduction complex.  Dr. Radtke will train Ms. Casanova in the Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) dating technique.  ESR is done on fossil mollusk shells that will be collected on each identified terrace level.\r\n\r\nResults of this project will be posted on a bilingual website for geology students in the U.S. and Chile.\r\n",
