 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes the study of back and forth error compensation\r\nand correction methods (BF) and their applications, in particular, to the\r\nlevel set method (Osher and Sethian, 1988) for interface computation in\r\nfluid dynamics and image processing etc. The level set equation and the\r\nassociated redistancing equation (Sussman et al., 1994) are usually solved\r\nby high order non-oscillatory schemes (e.g., ENO, WENO). In addition,\r\nspecial techniques can be used in order to reduce the diffusion near\r\nsingular points of the interface, such as the particle level set method\r\n(Enright et al., 2002). BF was initially developed by Dupont and Liu (2003)\r\nas a simple technique for reducing the diffusion in solving the level set\r\nequation. Further improvements are being developed with more and more\r\npromising results. When applied to the Zalesak problem (rigid rotation\r\nof a slotted disk), it approaches the resolution of volume of fluid\r\nmethods, e.g., Youngs 1982 etc, and is simple with low computational cost.\r\nSome special properties are being found such as that when applied to some\r\nunstable schemes, it not only stabilizes them but also improves their\r\naccuracy. The investigator plans to collaborate with Todd F. Dupont and\r\nother researchers to further study this algorithm and its variants and\r\napplications. The particular issues examined in this proposal include:\r\n(1)further study of the properties of BF and the error and stability\r\nanalysis of BF for irregular meshes; (2)the combination of finite element\r\nmethod and level set method with BF on triangular meshes; (3)further\r\ndevelopment of BF for level set method with applications in fluid dynamics\r\nand computer graphics; (4)study of possible applications of BF for other\r\ndifferential equations such as the Schrodinger equation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed activity in this project involves new methodologies in\r\ncomputational mathematics and opens new possibilities. The research\r\napproach will be a combination of theoretical analysis and their\r\napplications. An integrated cross-disciplinary curriculum will be developed\r\nsuitable for students majoring in mathematics, physical sciences and\r\nengineering. The new methodologies developed in this project will enlarge\r\nthe numerical recipes and can be applied to fluid dynamics, interface\r\ncomputation and their applications like atmospheric dynamics, ocean flow,\r\nocean floor gas hydrate, crystal growth, biological fluid dynamics, elastic-\r\nplastic solids, astronomy, computer graphic, image processing, etc. The\r\nresearch results will be disseminated through conference presentations\r\nand publications. Progress in this project will also enhance the\r\ninteraction among several subfields including level set method, finite\r\nelement and finite difference methods etc.\r\n\r\n",
