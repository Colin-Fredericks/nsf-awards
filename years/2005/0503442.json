 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports a two-year OEDG project at Michigan Technological University for minority pre-college students and their educators to infuse readily available geoscience education units into the secondary education classroom. This project,  \"Geoscience PrEP (Precollege Enterprise Program)\" will target populations underrepresented in geoscience careers as well as their educators.\r\n\r\nThe Geoscience PrEP will establish on campus pre-college programming where 36 students and six teachers from three schools will practice and become familiar with geology and geological engineering with the end goal of participants returning to their schools for continued dissemination and replication of the subject and activities with their peers.\r\n\r\nThe project goals are to:\r\n\r\n1. Increase interest and participation of underrepresented populations in geoscience education through summer pre-college programming in an environmentally pristine location as well as in-school and informal education environments; \r\n\r\n2. Enhance the ability of secondary educators to readily provide geoscience education through the creation of hands-on academic geoscience activity modules delivered at the summer precollege program and replicated by educators with professional development, curriculum modules, in-school support, and continuing education; and\r\n\r\n3. Increase awareness of geoscience careers and increased student enrollment in geoscience undergraduate degree programs by groups traditionally underrepresented in this area. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project advances knowledge about the efficiency and effectiveness of pre-college geoscience programs, including replicating undergraduate geoscience curriculum within secondary schools.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This project broadens participation by underrepresented groups in geoscience.",
