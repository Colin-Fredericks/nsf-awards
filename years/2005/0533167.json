 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAbstract:\r\nThe objective of this research is to combine expertise in materials science, fluid dynamics, and electrical engineering to (1) implement a new method for growth of millimeter-scale organic crystals directly on a large-area substrate and (2) utilize the crystals in active nanostructured optoelectronics. The approach uses a single-step process in which amorphous organic thin films crystallize during exposure to solvent vapor at room temperature. Preliminary investigations led to the discovery of elongated in-plane crystals that are more than 100 times larger than any previously reported, spanning the length of an entire substrate (up to 1 cm long). The large size of the single crystals will for the first time enable fabrication of a variety of high-performance organic electronic and optical devices.  \r\nAchieving the targeted goals of this program would for the first time allow integration of organic crystals with existing optoelectronic devices and in such a way enable the development of entirely new technologies. The proposed theoretical modeling will facilitate rational extension of the crystal growth technique to a broad range of organic materials, enabling fundamental investigations of their electronic, optical and structural properties. North Dakota State University has targeted Materials Science and Nanotechnology as priority research areas, with plans to establish a campus-wide interdisciplinary BS/MS/PhD program. The proposed research will facilitate initiation and stimulate growth of this educational program. In addition, the establishment of a relationship between NDSU and MIT, which has top-ranking programs in Materials Science, will benefit NDSU as it establishes itself in this research and educational arena. \r\n\r\n",
