 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of the chemical composition of lake waters is determined by the inflow waters and\r\nsubsequent evaporative concentration and the precipitation of minerals. In closed-basin lakes, evaporative\r\nconcentration is mostly determined by changes in aridity, as a result of regional climate change. However,\r\nthe interactions among lake water and groundwater chemistries, lake sediment geochemistry, and\r\nenvironmental change have not been studied over short or long time scales, and seldom using\r\nmultidisciplinary approach.\r\nIntellectual merits. This pilot study is to investigate paired chemically-contrasting lakes (fresh and\r\nsaline) in the arid northeastern Tibetan Plateau. These lakes are likely to be ideal sites for the study of\r\nwater isotopic and elemental evolution, and the interactions of environmental change and lacustrine\r\ngeochemical processes. The overarching objective of the proposed study is to understand hydrochemical\r\nevolution and how it interacts with various environmental controls at different time scales. The added\r\nbonus for undertaking such a study in this climate-sensitive region near the northern limit of the East\r\nAsian monsoon is to improve our ability to read the lacustrine sediment record of this region to better\r\nunderstand the past environmental changes. We propose to use a multidisciplinary approach to investigate\r\nat regional and watershed scales, the modern processes in these two lakes, history of solute and water flux\r\nfrom mineralogy and chemical and isotopic composition of authigenic and biogenic minerals, and from\r\nspecies assemblage of ostracodes and the history of climate and environmental change from such records\r\nof landscape processes as pollen, plant macrofossils, and environmental magnetism.\r\nThe results from this project will provide insights into understanding the pathways and mechanisms of\r\nlake solute evolution and water flux and how they affect the sedimentary record of past environmental\r\nchanges. This is the first study to employ a multidisciplinary approach to address the lake-climate\r\ninteractions in Central Asia. A key feature of this project is in its use of paired limnologically- and\r\nchemically-contrasting lakes in order to unravel the interactions between lacustrine hydrologic and\r\nhydrochemical processes and environmental (and climatic) changes. The study of modern responses of\r\nthe dilute lake (Keluke Lake) with a saline Lake (Toson Lake) will enable comprehensive and robust\r\nreconstructions of paleohydrochemistry. Also, the multiple techniques used in the proposed study will\r\nprovide independent records of regional climate change, watershed stability and vegetation, as well as\r\nchanges in lake chemistry. Integration of these records will allow us to focus on the complex interactions\r\nand feedbacks between these processes at different temporal scales (from present-day to interglacialglacial\r\ncycles).\r\nBroader impacts. Our interdisciplinary research will advance the understanding of complex interactions\r\nin these systems under different climate regimes. Understanding the lake and watershed responses to\r\nclimate change of the past will contribute to our ability to predict the environmental consequences of\r\nclimate (especially monsoon) variations and variability. Our approach of using contrasting\r\nhydrochemistries of paired fresh and saline lakes is not commonly employed but we believe is a very\r\ninstructive one with a large pay-off. Understanding the hydrological dynamics will benefit the people in\r\nthis remote arid part of China in adapting to the potential future changes in climate and hydrological\r\ncycles. The results will be compared with the response of lakes in the semi-arid northern Great Plains to\r\nclimate and hydrololgic changes and shared with the state geological surveys and water commissions.\r\nOnce past the pilot-stage, graduate and undergraduate students will be more fully involved in the project\r\nand will benefit from interacting with an international multidisciplinary research team. The project will\r\nfacilitate collaborations, especially with our Chinese colleagues, who are having increased impacts in the\r\ninternational scene of science and technology.",
