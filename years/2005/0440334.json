 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teacher/Fellow teams actively engage students with inquiry-based laboratory exercises in 9th-grade biology classes at six Fort Worth Independent School District (FWISD) high schools from the Track I program that serve predominantly underrepresented minorities. Outcomes are assessed through questionnaires, surveys, and data collection by internal/external evaluators to establish student interests and attitudes regarding science, overall impact of their understanding of key scientific concepts, teachers and Fellows outlook of the program, mentors cooperation and understanding of Fellows involvement, and institutional commitment to continued support post NSF funding. In addition, SCORE.s Track II proposal initiates a unique enrichment opportunity for selected FWISD students who take part in a Summer Science Camp after their 9th grade year. A Young Scientists Program where students learn laboratory techniques and develop a research project during their junior or senior year of high school follows this activity. These programs integrate SCORE activities throughout the institution by recruiting graduate students outside of the program along with SCORE Fellows to serve as research mentors to FWISD students and teachers, embedding this outreach program into the mission and culture of UNTHSC. \r\n\r\nBroader Implications: Project SCORE aggressively reinforces science and technology as viable career choices to students. In addition, it addresses the decline in higher education participation rates and educational attainment of minorities in the state of Texas. SCORE Fellows receive training on how to initiate discussions with students about their future education goals, emphasizing science and technology. These discussions address student's lifelong learning goals, regardless of their personal interests or educational choices. At all times, Fellows serve as role models and mentors to their students, providing encouragement for success along with valuable scientific stimulation in the laboratory and classroom.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: During Track I, the project expanded the originally proposed activities with the addition of the Teachers as Scholars and the After-school/TAKS Tutorial programs. Track II builds on these existing activities with a Summer Science Camp, Young Scientists Program, Fort Worth Zoo Outreach Program, and a Research Field Trip Experience. Anticipated outcomes of these new activities will, we feel, have a profound effect on the overall acceptance and level of commitment to the program by the institutions, and will be a strong foundation for the expansion of this and future outreach programs at UNTHSC.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
