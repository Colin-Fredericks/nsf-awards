 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT: \r\n\r\nProfessor Quinto will pursue problems in tomography\r\nand the mathematical analysis of Radon transforms.  He will develop\r\nand refine tomographic singularity detection algorithms and apply them\r\nto electron microscopy.  Professor Quinto has successfully tested his\r\nlimited data tomography algorithm on electron microscope data, and he\r\nwill use these results as a basis for further refinement with the goal\r\nof incorporating scattering and other effects.  He will continue\r\nresearch on the approximate inverse in three-dimensional SONAR.\r\nProfessor Quinto plans to prove uniqueness theorems for a model of\r\nsynthetic aperture RADAR, research which is based on his pure\r\nmathematical work.  Within pure mathematics, the principal\r\ninvestigator plans to prove uniqueness and support theorems for\r\nspherical Radon transforms.  He and Professor Agranovsky will use\r\nthese results to characterize stationary sets of solutions of the wave\r\nequation.  Stationary sets, where the solution is zero for all time,\r\nare very important and difficult to characterize.  He plans to prove\r\nuniqueness theorems for Radon transforms on spheres on real-analytic\r\nmanifolds and use these results to begin to characterize stationary\r\nsets on rank-one symmetric spaces.  He is proving Morera theorems for\r\nthe distinguished boundary of polydisks, and he plans to generalize\r\nthem to complex manifolds.  He hopes to prove inverse continuity for\r\nan important class of local limited data problems or clarify when they\r\ndo not hold.\r\n\r\nThis research encompasses both applied and pure\r\nmathematics: tomography and integral geometry.  The pure research will\r\nbe used to develop, understand, and justify the applied algorithms,\r\nand the applied problems will motivate much of the pure research.  A\r\ncomputed tomography algorithm will be developed for electron\r\nmicroscopy and tested jointly with colleagues at the Karolinska\r\nInstitute in Sweden.  Our goal is to produce accurate pictures of\r\nviruses and small molecules using an electron microscope.  Jointly\r\nwith a colleague and an undergraduate student, he will develop an\r\nalgorithm for emission tomography, a type of tomography that locates\r\nmetabolic processes.  He will develop pure mathematics that will show\r\nhow well the algorithms work and where their limitations might occur.\r\nThese pure mathematical underpinnings are required to ensure that his\r\n(or any other) algorithms are as effective as they can be.  SONAR data\r\ncan be modeled as averages over spheres (the spherical wave fronts of\r\nthe sound wave), and Professor Quinto will jointly develop new\r\nalgorithms for SONAR.  This pure mathematics is intriguing in its own\r\nright.  Professor Quinto will prove theorems about spherical averages\r\nwhich will be used to understand the wave equation (the equation that\r\ndescribes how sound and light behave).  The wave equation describes\r\nthe motion of a drum head, and he will specify which points on the\r\ndrum do not move at all.  Finally, he will prove theorems he will\r\napply to complex and harmonic analysis, fields in pure mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
