First, the investigator will show\r\nthat one currently advocated approach for the analysis of data\r\nfrom multiple genes, the concatenation approach, can be\r\nstatistically inconsistent, even when a consistent method of\r\nphylogenetic tree estimation is used. Second, an algorithm for\r\nmaximum likelihood (ML) estimation of species trees from data on\r\nmultiple genes under the coalescent model will be developed and\r\nimplemented, and will be made freely available via the internet.\r\nThe availability of a method for ML species tree estimation will\r\nallow for likelihood-based hypothesis testing of phylogeographic\r\nand population genetic hypotheses.  Further, methods for assessing\r\nuncertainty in the species tree estimates will be developed by\r\nextending traditional bootstrapping methods in phylogenetics to\r\nthe case in which data have been collected for multiple genes\r\nsampled randomly throughout the genome.  Finally, tests for the\r\nadequacy of the coalescent model will be developed by examining\r\nwhether the observed gene trees are consistent with a given\r\nspecies tree using several metrics to measure levels of\r\nincongruence.\r\n\r\nThe inference of the evolutionary history of a collection of organisms \r\nbased on the information contained in their DNA sequences is a problem\r\nof fundamental importance in evolutionary biology. The abundance of DNA \r\nsequence data arising from genome sequencing projects has led to \r\nsignificant challenges in the inference of these phylogenetic \r\nrelationships. Among these challenges is the inference of the evolutionary \r\nhistory of a collection of species based on DNA sequence information\r\nfrom several distinct genes sampled throughout the genome.  This project \r\nstudies the effect of the coalescent process on the inference of species \r\nphylogenies using data from multiple genes.  This work will first \r\ndemonstrate that failure to model the coalescent process can lead to \r\nincorrect inferences of species relationships.  The investigator will then \r\ndevelop methods that can accurately estimate species phylogenies through \r\nexplicitly modeling the coalescent process, and will apply these \r\nestimation procedures to construct techniques for hypothesis testing and \r\nfor measuring uncertainty in estimated species phylogenies.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n",
