 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal presents a career development plan for integrating research and education. The research\r\ncomponent of this program focuses on the study of collaborative signal and information processing (CSIP)\r\nalgorithms as well as the supporting computing models and protocols in sensor networks. The educational\r\ncomponent is aimed at enhancing the newly created computer engineering program of the department\r\nthrough innovative curriculum development, active student mentoring, and by incorporating research findings\r\ninto classroom teaching. The project consolidates research and educational efforts, responds to the\r\nunique challenges presented by sensor networks, and contributes significantly to the PI's career development.\r\nA sensor network forms a loosely-coupled distributed environment where collaborative processing among\r\nmultiple sensor nodes is essential in order to compensate for each other's limited capability in sensing, processing,\r\npower supply, and to tolerate faults. The extremely constraint resources of sensor networks have\r\npresented unique challenges to CSIP, the biggest of which is the contradictory requirements between energy\r\nefficiency and fault tolerance. While energy-efficient approaches try to limit the redundancy such that\r\nminimum amount of energy is required for fulfilling a certain task, redundancy is needed for providing\r\nfault tolerance since sensors might be faulty, malfunctioning, or even malicious. A balance has to be struck\r\nbetween these two objectives.\r\nIntellectual Merit: An integrated research plan is proposed that tackles the unique challenges presented\r\nby sensor networks. This plan concerns not only the development of effective processing algorithms, it\r\nalso studies the design of supporting computing paradigms and protocols which play an important role in\r\nfacilitating the collaborative processing. In particular, the research plan focusses on three themes:\r\nFirst, the design, evaluation and implementation of a new paradigm, the mobile-agent-based paradigm,\r\nfor realizing collaborative processing in sensor networks. In this model, instead of each sensor node sending\r\nlocal information to a processing center for integration, as is typical in a client/server-based computing, the\r\nintegration code is moved to the sensor nodes through mobile agents. We discuss the potential of mobileagent-\r\nbased collaborative processing in providing progressive accuracy while maintaining certain degree of\r\nfault tolerance. Second, the development and evaluation of a decentralized reactive clustering protocol to\r\nhelp adapt to the changing environment. Due to the sheer amount of nodes deployed, collaboration is usually\r\ncarried out among nodes within the same cluster. We propose a decentralized reactive clustering (DRC)\r\nprotocol in which the clustering procedure is initiated only when events are detected. Performance gain in\r\nterms of energy consumption and network lifetime is analyzed. Third, the study of distributed optimization\r\nfor in-network data processing. We tackle the challenging CSIP problems including multiple target/event\r\ndetection and unknown target/event identification and develop decentralized algorithms that achieve both\r\nenergy-efficiency and bandwidth-efficiency advantages, as well as detection performance gain compared to\r\nits centralized counterpart.\r\nBroader Impact: The PI is dedicated to excellence in teaching and enthusiastic student mentoring.\r\nCSIP in sensor networks, as one of the areas that integrate multidisciplinary characteristics, will be used\r\nas an experimental concentration area to initiate innovative curriculum design, which helps bring in unique\r\nfeatures to increase the quality and visibility of the newly established computer engineering program of\r\nthe department. Although sensor networks have revealed great potential in CSIP, the extremely constraint\r\nresources have largely limited their practical deployment. The performance evaluation of computing models,\r\nprotocols, and processing algorithms for CSIP would help understand the capability of sensor networks as\r\nwell as provide theoretical guide in the design of CSIP algorithms. Both the research and educational results\r\nwill be made available through the Twiki collaboration platform on the Internet.\r\n1",
