 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Luis Echegoyen of Clemson University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program for the design and synthesis of novel fullerene compounds for applications in molecular electronics and photovoltaic energy conversion. The goal is to add to knowledge about how electron-transfer might be manipulated, using fullerenes derivitized with nitrogen-ligand groups.  The idea is to use the complete set of derivatives together with a large variety of metal ion linkers as a \"molecular tinkertoy\" for the assembly of supramolecular architectures.   The group is growing self-assembled monolayers on metal surfaces on a layer-by-layer basis, changing the linking metal ions and the corresponding fullerene derivatives, depending on the desired properties.  Other synthetic work is being carried out starting with endohedral fullerenes, which contain groups of other atoms trapped inside the carbon cage.  A new purification strategy is being sought based on a new reaction involving the removal of pyrrolidine adducts from the surface.  This work is being performed in collaboration with Prof. Nazario Martin from the Universidad Complutense in Madrid, Spain.  Further, dendrimeric films containing fullerenes are being studied for photovoltaic applications in collaboration with Dr. Luis Godinez from the Research and Technological Development Center for Electrochemistry in Queretaro, Mexico.\r\n\r\nFullerenes or \"Buckyballs\" are a relatively new class of molecules that undergo a large number of reversible electron transfers in solution.  Coupling these molecules to surfaces has the potential to lead to breakthroughs in photovoltaic applications such as solar cells, and will further the development of novel molecular electronic devices.\r\n",
