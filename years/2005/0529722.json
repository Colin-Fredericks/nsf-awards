 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Alex Weir of the State University of New York, College of Environmental Science and Forestry, to produce a revision of the classification of one large subtribe, Stigmatomycetinae, of the Class Laboulbeniomycetes. These unusual fungi produce fruiting bodies on the exoskeleton of living insects and other arthropods, and are thought to represent one of the most diverse, but least studied, groups of fungi on Earth. Despite the recent development of reliable DNA extraction and amplification protocols, and increased attention from ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and conservation biologists, the dearth of trained researchers has meant that the classification and identification of these fungi remains unresolved. This severely impedes their incorporation into broader studies such as those focused on assessment of biodiversity patterns, and parasite speciation processes. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this Partnership for Enhancing Expertise in taxonomy (PEET) project are to: (1) train several new Laboulbeniales systematists, (2) resolve some of the major systematics questions, (3) produce a comprehensive monograph of subtribe Stigmatomycetinae (in both hard copy and as an on-line treatise), and (4) develop a web site that will provide information on the biology of the Laboulbeniales to the broader biological community and the general public. The research methods involve a dual approach of (1) examination of microscopic characteristics using high-quality light and scanning electron microscopy, and (2) acquisition of molecular DNA sequence data. Results will be used in combination to develop and test hypotheses about lineages within the Stigmatomycetinae. Monographic accounts will be published in mycological journals and placed on the internet along with interactive identification keys supported by descriptions and illustrations. \r\n",
