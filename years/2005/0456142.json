 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northern Arizona University will host an 8-week summer research program for six students recruited nationwide. Minority students and students from colleges and universities without doctoral programs are especially encouraged to apply, and have been a major component of previous programs. Each student will work on an individual project in a subject area to include Applied Mathematics and Combinatorics and tailored to his or her own mathematical background. Two students will work with each faculty advisor, many of whom have experience working with undergraduate students on research projects,. Descriptions of projects available for each forthcoming summer are posted under 'Department Activities' on the department's homepage at http://www.math.nau.edu.  As well as carrying out their research, students participate in seminar series, give fifty-minute presentations and write up their work in a form suitable for publication.Students are encouraged to give talks at meetings after the program has concluded, and the most successful will submit their work to a journal for publication.",
