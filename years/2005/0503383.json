 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores gas phase clusters as an ideal means to elucidate the novel size- and shape-dependent properties of nanoparticles.  This research program focuses on a fundamental study of gas phase clusters with an emphasis on novel molecular structures and chemical bonding, as well as identifying potential cluster building blocks for new materials. The experiment involves photoelectron spectroscopy of size-selected clusters, produced by a laser vaporization supersonic cluster source.  Special emphases are on clusters of group 13 elements (Boron and Aluminum), as well as clusters of group 14 (Silicon and Germanium) and 15 (Antimony and Bismuth) elements.  Specific tasks include bare and mixed boron clusters, aluminum alloy clusters, aromatic clusters, metal carbide clusters, and exploratory synthesis of cluster-based nanomaterials.  A major focus is to connect molecular properties to bulk properties and to discover structurally and electronically stable clusters for potential syntheses of cluster-based materials.  Structurally known clusters in the solid state will also be examined in the gas phase to provide fundamental understanding about the principles underlying their stabilities, which may lead to the design of new classes of clusters. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be participating in the research project and receive research training in the emerging field of nanoscience and cutting edge research techniques in the synthesis and characterization of nanoclusters and nanomatierals.  The research program is integrated to the teaching of a nanocourse, maximizing the impact of the research results. \r\n\r\nNanoscience and nanotechnology have attracted worldwide attention.  Materials in the nanometer size scale exhibit properties different from their bulk counterparts and these properties depend on particle size and shape.  This forms the basis for nanoscience and nanotechnology.  At the core of nanoscience is to understand the size-dependent behaviors of materials at the nanometer scale.  Atomic clusters consisting of a few to few hundred atoms provide an ideal playground to elucidate the novel size- and shape-dependent properties of nanoparticles.  This research program focuses on the fundamental investigation of atomic clusters with an emphasis on novel molecular structures and chemical bonding, as well as identifying potential cluster building blocks for new materials.  Boron (B) and aluminum (Al) are light and form important alloys as structural materials in automobiles and airplanes.  Understanding the nanoclusters of B and Al may lead to the design of better and stronger materials.  Silicon is the cornerstone material for the microelectronic industry and understanding the properties of silicon nanoclusters may be relevant to the manufacture and function of future generations of computers.  The training of the next generation researchers and scientists are important for the nation's technical competitiveness.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be participating in the research project and receive research training in the emerging field of nanoscience and cutting edge research techniques in the synthesis and characterization of nanoclusters and nanomatierals.  The research program is also integrated to the teaching of a nanocourse, maximizing the impact of the research results.\r\n",
