 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, creating a Data Capacitor and a Metadata/Web Services server, addresses two clear and widespread challenges: the need \r\n-To store and manipulate large amounts of data for short periods of time (hours to several days) and\r\n-For Reliable and unambiguous publication, discovery, and utilization of data via the Web.\r\n\r\nThe Data Capacitor, a 250 Terabyte short term data store with very fast I/O and the Metadata/Web Services server, a robust server, enable the institution and collaborators to adopt and depend upon the Web services for exchange of research data. Research and development efforts at IU will create the tools required for the Data Capacitor to be used to its fullest. Progress and research possibilities in many disciplines have been fundamentally changed by the abundance of data now so rapidly produced by advanced digital instruments. Scientists face the present challenge of drawing out from these data the information and meaning contained within. IU has established a significant cyberinfrastructure composed of high performance computing systems, archival storage systems, and advanced visualization systems spanning two main campuses in Indianapolis and Bloomington, and connected to national and international networks. This institution enhances its infrastructure in ways that will result in qualitative changes in the research capabilities and discovery opportunities of a broad array of scientist that work with large data sets. The Data Capacitor is expected to become a development platform and testbed for new cyberinfrastructure, as well as a proof of concept for large capacity, short-term storage devices. On the other hand, the Metadata/Web Services server enables the institution to establish a leadership position in standards-based data dissemination in many fields.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The Data Capacitor enhances current practice in relevant scientific communities, enables technology transfer and commercialization, develops a 21st century workforce, and ensures public understanding of the value of science. Deliberate use of objective metrics in all areas of broader impact ensures that new discoveries, technology development, educational activities, and public information efforts translate into benefit for the scientific community and society as a whole. Women and underrepresented groups will be drawn into computing-intensive sciences and applications of computing.\r\n\r\n",
