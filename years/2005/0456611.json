 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI and Xiaochun Li have recently established the boundedness of a degenerate \r\nRadon transform, in which a Hilbert transform is computed on choice of directions \r\nin the plane.  The critical point is that the choice of directions is only assumed \r\nto be smooth, with no geometric condition imposed on the choice of directions.  \r\nThe method of proof involves an intricate set of phase plane methods, together with \r\nnovel Kakeya maximal function. There are several aspects of this transform that remain \r\npoorly understood, and the PI will work to resolve some of these issues.  In a second \r\ndirection, the PI, with Sarah Ferguson and Erin Terwilleger have provided the natural \r\nextension of the Nehari theorem to 'little' Hankel operators on product Hardy space. \r\nNamely, such Hankel operators are bounded iff their symbol is in product BMO.  This is \r\nfundamental criteria, which opens up a range of questions in operator theory in \r\nseveral complex variables.  This range of questions forms the second avenue of investigation that will be pursued in this project. \r\n\r\nThe range of problems to be pursued in this project will require the creation of new techniques in the broad area of analysis. The objects studies arise naturally in physical processes, such as charge distribution namely the Hilbert transform, medical imaging, namely Radon transforms, and control theory, namely Hankel operators. \r\nThe questions addressed concern how well behaved these objects are, and the resolution \r\nof these questions should  yield important insights into deeper aspects of these \r\nobjects. These insights have in the past lead to important advances in signal processing, \r\nimaging, and control theory.
