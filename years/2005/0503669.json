 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe research undertaken by Jay Jorgenson involves collaboration with \r\nnumerous co-authors on a range of questions in analysis which are \r\nmotivated by questions from number theory, such as L-functions, \r\nautomorphic forms and trace formulae.  The work with Jurg Kramer \r\nfocuses on questions which arise in certain aspects of Arakelov theory, \r\nand extends into the study of theta functions, automorphic forms, and \r\nSelberg's zeta function.  With Cormac O'Sullivan, Jorgenson is developing \r\nthe theory of higher order modular forms which to date has produced \r\nanalogues of Kronecker's limit formula and Dedekind sums.  The research \r\nwith Serge Lang involves zeta function constructions for general symmetric \r\nspaces, beginning with SL(n,C).  Certain methods of proof are common to \r\nall investigations, such as techniques from analytic number theory, algebraic \r\ngeometry and heat kernel analysis, which provides for an interesting mixture \r\nof ideas and consolidation of results.  \r\n\r\nThe mathematical gadget known as the heat kernel appears in many diverse \r\nareas of mathematics research, either explicitly or implicitly, and one aspect \r\nof Jay Jorgenson's research activities is the investigation of the many \r\nmanifestations of the heat kernel.  In the mathematics of finance, the classical \r\nheat kernel in one dimension can be used to describe the Black-Scholes-Merton \r\nformula, which is used to price certain stock options.  In number theory, the \r\nheat kernel is used to construct many basic objects of study, such as theta and \r\nzeta functions.  In geometry, analysis and probability, the heat kernel is both an \r\nobject of primary study as well as a tool to understand specific questions of \r\nresearch interest.  By studying the many realizations of heat kernels and heat \r\nkernel techniques, Jay Jorgenson is able to utilize proven techniques in one field \r\nof mathematics and develop ideas in another discipline.  In addition, this method \r\nof study has proven useful in providing students, both undergraduate and graduate, \r\nwith new ways in which they have access to certain areas of mathematical \r\nresearch.  \r\n",
