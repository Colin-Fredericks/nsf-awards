 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal investigates quantum algorithms based on quantum physical processes.The goal\r\nis to identify quantum processes that can be reformulated to serve as quantum algorithms,and to\r\nidentify the types of errors that can disrupt these processes.The main focus is on NP-intermediate\r\nproblems,which are problems in NP that are neither NP-complete nor in P.\r\nIntellectual Merit .One main focus of this research is the study of graph isomorphism,an NP-\r\nintermediate problem that is a central problem in complexity theory.A many-particle random\r\nwalk process that may be particularly well-suited to solve this problem will be investigated.Since\r\nthe quantum dynamics of many-particle systems can often be e .ciently simulated on quantum\r\ncomputers but not on classical computers,understanding the performance of the many-particle\r\nrandom walk may yield new insight into inherently quantum algorithms for this problem.Speci .c\r\ngraphs known as strongly regular graphs (already shown to be useful to test critically algorithms\r\nproposed for solving graph isomorphism)will be investigated in detail numerically to test the\r\nmany-particle quantum random walk algorithm,and fully characterize its complexity.In addition,\r\nan e .ort will be made to make progress by characterizing the algebraic graph invariants that are\r\naccessible to quantum computers.\r\nOther related problems and methods will also be investigated,including integer factorization,\r\nthe discrete logarithm,and .nding short vectors in lattices.It will also be investigated whether\r\nclassical algorithms that depend on the birthday paradox can be used to devise new quantum\r\nalgorithms.\r\nA complementary research thrust is to analyze the sensitivity of the multi-particle dynamical\r\nalgorithms to errors,focusing speci .cally on the scaling of errors as the number of particles increases,\r\nand to understand the connection of the physical processes utilized by the algorithms to the physical\r\nprocesses that actually occur at the hardware level and use this to improve the e .ciency of quantum\r\ncomputations.\r\nThe goal of this research is to extend the limits of computation to qualitatively new problems.\r\nFor example,at present one cannot reliably test for the isomorphism of graphs with more than a\r\nfew hundred vertices.A quantum computer could,however,accurately compute the dynamics of\r\nquantum particles on graphs of this size.If it is possible to use the information so obtained to test\r\nisomorphism,this would be a signi .cant step forward in conquering complex problems.\r\nBroader Impacts .The proposed work will have broad impact because of the insight it will yield\r\ninto hard computational problems.Further broad impact will be through the training of graduate\r\nand undergraduate students with substantial interdisciplinary experience with both computer sci-\r\nence and physics.In addition to web-based dissemination of research results,an interdisciplinary\r\nworkshop will be held that will help improve communication between computer scientists and\r\nphysicists working on problems of common interest.",
