 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contrary to its popular name, the well-loved North American Flowering Dogwood tree (Cornus florida) has inconspicuous flowers with tiny greenish petals.  The appellation 'flowering' refers to the tree's specialized leaves (bracts) that recall the bright, attractive petals of a large flower, even upon anatomical inspection.  In both Cornus florida and its close relative, the East Asian Cornus kousa, genes known to specify petals are expressed in the bracts, suggesting that these petal genes are turning leaves into 'petals' in these species. The next step in testing this hypothesis is to clone these genes and compare their expression in true petals, bracts, and leaves of different types of dogwoods, including species with petal-like bracts, leafy bracts, and rudimentary bracts. \r\n\r\n\tThis research on petal-like leaves will serve as a case study for the genetic basis of a novel morphological trait.  As genetic information is increasingly available, biologists seek to understand how specific genes act to produce specific traits.  Only then can genetic information be effectively applied.  The research described here will be directly applicable to bioengineering of petals, a key trait in horticultural and insect-pollinated agricultural plants.  Moreover, an understanding of the genetic basis for a macroevolutionary (above species level) difference between organisms will illuminate the public debate over the nature of evolution.   \r\n",
