 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rybnikov will study geometric and combinatorial properties of polytopes,\r\nsurfaces, graphs, and point lattices.  In particular, he will address\r\nconnections between local and global convexity and convexity verification,\r\ntopological approaches to Voronoi's conjecture on parallelohedra, rigidity\r\nand flexibility of large graphs, and perfect Delaunay polytopes in\r\nlattices and arithmetic of inhomogeneous quadratic forms. The educational\r\nactivity will include supervision of undergraduate and Masters students,\r\nwhich will help them not only improve their mathematical skills, but also\r\nget involved in active research.\r\n\r\nGraphs, polytopes, and lattices are studied and used not only in\r\nmathematics, but also in applications such as operations research,\r\ncomputational molecular biology, cryptography, CAD, etc. Rybnikov's\r\nresearch will be motivated, among other things, by problems in software\r\nreliability, computational molecular biology, and cryptology.  For\r\nexample, convexity verification is an important issue, which is addressed\r\nnot only in academic papers, but also in widely used software, such as\r\ne.g. LEDA; most of PI's research on rigidity and flexibility of graphs is\r\nmotivated by problems in protein structure analysis and prediction; point\r\nlattices and quadratic forms in higher dimensions are important to the\r\ncomputational complexity theory and cryptology.\r\n\r\n",
