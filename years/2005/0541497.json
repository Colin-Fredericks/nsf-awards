 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop on biologically diverse karst systems brings together a group of researchers and students from the United States and Slovenia with expertise in disciplines ranging from hydrogeology and geochemistry to subterranean ecosystems.   David Culver of American University and Tanja Pipan of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences' Karst Research Institute in Postojna serve as the organizers. Their goal is to foster new research collaborations and develop joint proposals for research on karst systems, a landscape that compromises as much as twenty percent of the earth's system.   \r\n\r\nThe workshop agenda covers subjects related to both above- and below-ground components of aquatic systems.  Discussions should benefit from the expertise of the U.S. group in aquatic ecosystems and karst studies, complemented by Slovenian strengths in biodiversity as well as their knowledge of karst landforms in the Dinaric Mountains.  Results will help define new, mutually beneficial research topics while extending opportunities for U.S.-European regional activities under the Foundation's national and international Long-term Ecological Research Program.  Furthermore, the meeting may provide fundamental insights into problems associated with construction in karst areas and the development of dependable water resources that limit aquifer vulnerability to groundwater contamination.  \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary karst workshop fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   Broader impacts include the early career introduction of participating U.S. graduate students to a network of leading international karst researchers.",
