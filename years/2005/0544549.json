 "awd_abstract_narration": "The authors propose a conference, together with preliminary and follow-up activities, and involving American and African researchers in mathematics education, particularly in the professional development of teachers.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to discuss common issues that face American and African teachers and students, and to map out a research agenda that can be worked on collaboratively in the future, together with some discussion about the technical aspects of such collaborations.  \r\n\r\nThe conference will take advantage of the convergence at the Pan-African Mathematical Olympiad of mathematicians, educational researchers, and education officials from across the continent of Africa.  This event will be held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in July, 2006. \r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
