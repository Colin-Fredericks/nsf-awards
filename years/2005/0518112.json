 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores the factors responsible for the unusual properties of highly fluorinated molecules.  The primary objectives of this work are to:  1. Achieve a coherent and comprehensive understanding of the origin and nature of a fluorous phase.  2. Exploit the fluorophobic effect to drive the formation of nano- to mesoscopic size fluorous-phase-based assemblies characterized by specific physico-chemical properties.  These include the ability to display switchable liquid crystalline attributes and to bind and/or encapsulate other molecules.  Complementary computational studies will be directed to provide a rational basis for the spontaneous separation of highly fluorinated molecules from classical hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases. \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Sandro Mecozzi of the University of Wisconsin at Madison.  Professor Mecozzi seeks a better understanding of how the formation of a fluorous phase can be used to direct the assembly of highly regular and non-covalently bound structures.  Advancing the understanding of the nature of the properties of organofluorine compounds will have an impact on fluorous phase synthetic chemistry and the broad field of fluorinated materials. It will also lead to deeper insights into the mode of action of fluorinated drugs, and into a more educated assessment of the effect of fluoroorganics on the global ecosystem.\r\n",
