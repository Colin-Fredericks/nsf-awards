 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support a symposium entitled \" Cellular Osmoregulation: Sensors, Transducers and Regulators\" to be held at Salve Regina College in Newport, RI on August 7-12, 2005.  The symposium is a follow-up of a successful 2003 Gordon Conference on Cellular Osmoregulation.  The conference will provide a forum for the study of mechanisms involved in the sensing, transport and regulation of organic osmolytes brought about by extracellular osmotic imbalances, as well as the study of mechanisms involving effects of these osmolytes on the structure, function, and folding of macromolecules within cells.  This conference will also expand the areas of investigation from the previous conference to include more organisms in the eukarya, giving the conference a broad, organismal context.  The program will include over 40 speakers and session chairs including many foreign scientists.  All participants will have the opportunity to present posters at sessions scheduled each day of the conference.  The organizers have planned a variety of methods for recruitment of conference attendees from under-represented groups and expect significant graduate student and postdoc attendance.   The Gordon Conference settings are particularly effective for students to interact in a small group setting with researchers from big-named laboratories and also to interact with foreign investigators.  There will be opportunities for establishing new collaborations, cementing existing collaborations, and arranging for future meetings and research ventures.  Funds in this proposal will support travel and conference fees for five United States participants which will include some students and postdocs.",
