 "awd_abstract_narration": "Late Triassic extinctions are known to have severely affected many invertebrate and\r\nvertebrate taxa from the marine and non-marine realms; however, the precise timing,\r\nmagnitude, and ultimate cause(s) of the biotic crisis remain poorly understood. Recently\r\npublished and unpublished high-resolution isotope stratigraphy coupled with preliminary\r\nbivalve collections reveals an abundance of ecologically significant bivalves near an\r\ninitial negative excursion in -13C and now permits precise correlation between nearly all\r\nknown Triassic-Jurassic boundary sections. To understand better which organisms were\r\naffected and the sequence of events in the late Triassic, I propose research involving an\r\nanalysis of taxonomic richness and paleoecology of Triassic-Jurassic bivalve faunas of\r\nthe Lombardy, La Spezia and Kossen Basins of the western Tethys By virtue of their\r\nabundance and richness in Triassic/Jurassic boundary beds within these key sections,\r\nbivalve mollusks provide an ideal group with which to test hypotheses surrounding the\r\ntempo and mode of extinction. Two related hypotheses will be investigated: (i) following\r\na period of ecologic stability, the end-Triassic bivalve extinction was both severe and\r\nabrupt; and (ii) bivalves within the extinction and early survival interval exhibit an\r\necologic pattern of selective extinction and survival. To address these questions, I\r\npropose intensive field and institutional based research to: (i) revise and develop new\r\ntaxonomic data on latest Triassic through earliest Jurassic bivalve fauna from the western\r\nTethyan realm; and (ii) to develop high-resolution paleoecologic and paleoenvironmental\r\ndata from identified stratigraphic sections spanning the Triassic/Jurassic boundary from\r\nfive critical sections identified from the Lombardy, La Spezia and Kossen Basins of Italy\r\nand Austria. A taxonomic revision of west-Tethyan bivalves, which will involve\r\nextensive institutional-based research at major European repositories, has never been\r\nattempted and is long overdue. Paleoecologic analyses will entail bed-by-bed analyses of\r\nboundary intervals in which abundance, diversity, and trophic data will be collected from\r\nstatistically large samples combined with taphonomic and sedimentologic data within a\r\nhigh-resolution biochronologic and chemostratigraphic framework. This work will\r\ninvolve substantial new collaborations with scientists from Italy, Austria and The\r\nNetherlands with expertise in micropaleontology, palynology, stable isotope\r\ngeochemistry and regional geology, The research will also actively involve\r\nundergraduate students, both as assistants and as independent researchers and provide for\r\ntheir training and preparation for future graduate studies. The work proposed here will\r\nhave broad significance for the interpretation of biotic patterns surrounding the end-\r\nTriassic mass extinction. The expected outcome of a revised taxonomy of\r\nRhaetian/Hettangian bivalves of the Kossen Basin will, after more than 100 years, finally\r\nprovide sound base-line taxonomic data from which to test hypotheses surrounding the\r\ntiming, magnitude, and mode of the end-Triassic extinction.",
