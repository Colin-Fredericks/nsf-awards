With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, structure-property relationships in the replacement lithography of these monolayers are used to develop approaches for the formation of three dimensional nanostructures that can be used in molecular electronics applications.   In particular, the work concentrates on the examination of negative differential resistance devices, and the effect of electrochemical redox transitions in the monolayer materials in the operation of these structures.  Training of students in the field of molecular electronics and nano-technology is one broader impact of the work being carried out.\r\n\r\nDeveloping the fundamental science of replacement lithography for the construction of molecular electronic devices is the focus of this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor Gorman is systematically examining the connections between structure and function of self-assembled monolayers formed using replacement lithographic approaches.  This information provides the fundamental understanding needed for the design and production of molecular electronic devices. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
