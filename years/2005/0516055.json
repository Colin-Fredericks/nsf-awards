 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMotivated by the accelerated loss of species worldwide, understanding the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has emerged as a central question in ecology. An overwhelming majority of studies have been conducted in terrestrial ecosystems and have focused primarily on plant productivity and nutrient uptake/retention, with a notable lack of information available on belowground processes.  The objective of this project is to examine how changes in plant community composition and diversity alter the methane cycle in freshwater wetlands. This will be done with an observational field study and two controlled mesocosm experiments designed to mimic the structure of natural plant communities. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will contribute to our understanding of the links between aboveground and belowground processes in wetlands, and provide evidence for how the plant community impacts methane emissions, having clear implications for future climate change.  The PIs will partner with the Ohio EPA to offer an outreach program to wetland professionals to encourage a reevaluation of current practices in wetland mitigation. This project will also support the research of two early-career scientists committed to the integration of their research and education activities and provide training and research experience for two graduate and several undergraduate students.\r\n\r\n",
