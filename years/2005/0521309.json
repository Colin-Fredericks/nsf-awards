 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to acquire a high resolution X-ray microtomography system that will fulfill the characterization needs for research projects of a large group of faculty spanning several departments including Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical, Civil and Biomedical Engineering and the College of Medicine. X-ray microtomography is a non-destructive characterization technique that provides cross-sectional images in planes through a component. Commercial computerized tomography (CT) systems with a microfocus X-ray provide a viable alternative of the high quality microtomography at Synchrotron sources. Such commercial CT systems offer an unprecedented level of flexibility due to their affordable price, small footprint and ease of operations.  This instrument will provide non-destructive, three dimensional, quantitative characterization capability for a large variety of current and new projects in the areas of: (a) processing and characterization of materials (including pharmaceutical compacts, paper, environmentally conscious composite materials, quarry fines, dredged materials, ground rubber tires), (b) bone microstructure and properties, (c) scaffold design, evaluation and rapid prototyping for biomedical applications, (d) fundamental studies in the microstructure sensitive design methodologies, (e) novel materials in civil engineering. In fact, a very wider user base in envisioned beyond the 5 PIs and 5 senior personnel in this award.   This  system is characterized by high resolution with smallest detail at low contrast resolution (10% MTF) up to 1mm and pixel size at maximum magnification < 0.9 mm. It is equipped with a 10 Megapixel 12-bit digital cooled CCD. A four-node network cluster will be used for rapid image reconstruction and analysis.  It is proposed that the instrument be housed in the Materials Characterization Laboratory in the new Bossone Engineering Research Building and administrated by the Centralized Materials Characterization Facility (CMCF). CMCF houses a comprehensive array of state-of-the art materials characterization instruments capable of meeting the needs of researchers within the university, other academic institutions and regional industries. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts from the acquisition of this instrument include the enhancement the educational activities of Drexel University at both undergraduate and graduate level, and the potential for additional outreach activities to high school students and industry via hands on demonstrations and user group meetings respectively.\r\n",
