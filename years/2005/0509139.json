Each meeting has been essentially a workshop, and the interdisciplinary discussions of major research issues are a highlight of the meeting.  The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) brings together approximately 135 scientists for a week of intense interaction and scientific discussion.   The meeting program is advertised in the publication Science, and the attendees are chosen by the meeting chair from the pool of applicants; past GRC meetings on Laser Diagnostics for Combustion attract over 200 well-qualified applicants.  This program will provide conference fee and travel support to insure participation in this important forum.\r\n\tThe 2005 Gordon Conference on Laser Diagnostics for Combustion Program features  updates on the latest advances in laser-based diagnostics and sensor activities important in combustion emissions from land-based propulsions systems relevant to the NSF mission.  New technology in synchrotron sources, fiber lasers, and broadband coherent sources will be featured, along with applications to laser-based particulate analysis and biochemistry applications that serve to broaden the interdisciplinary nature of this meeting.  This is the only scientific forum with an interdisciplinary focus on laser-based diagnostics of combustion; therefore, it is crucial to insure the travel funds to provide young and emerging US scientists access to this meeting.\r\n\r\n",
