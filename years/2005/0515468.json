 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Successful scaffolding strategies in urban museums:  Research and practice on mediated scientific conversations with families and museum educators\" project seeks to simultaneously advance existing research on learning in informal settings, and to improve museum educator practice in mediating understanding with families in an urban museum.  This collaboration between the Museum of Science & Industry (MOSI) in Tampa, Florida, and the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) will focus on three research questions:\r\n\r\n1. What are several underlying characteristics of successful and unsuccessful strategies for scaffolding understanding of collaborative groups while interacting and talking at life science based exhibits?;\r\n\r\n2. How can such identified strategies for scaffolding understanding of collaborative groups be best translated to inform teaching practices in museums, using teacher research as the focus?;\r\n\r\n3. Can these scaffolding strategies be disseminated beyond MOSI in a published and replicable model for other informal learning centers?\r\n\r\nThis project is designed to identify, practice and disseminate successful scaffolding strategies, studying, first, how they are used by families visiting MOSI without mediators, and, second, with museum educators.  They then will collaborate with museum educator researchers (MERs) to analyze digital audio/video and other data, carefully abstracting new scaffolding tools.  This is followed by practice and reflection and broader dissemination with the goal of understanding essential aspects of successful and unsuccessful scaffolding.  A \"teacher research model\" will be used for museum educator professional development. \r\n\r\nBy intertwining demonstrated and effective scaffolding research and practice with populations typically left out of informal education research, the anticipated strategic impact will be in:\r\n\r\n*  Advancing current understanding of a new area of informal learning research centering on scaffolding practices;\r\n\r\n*  Redefining scaffolded teaching practice with museum educator researchers;\r\n\r\n*  Creating a model for conducting collaborative research with families, youth and schools typically not included in museum research and evaluation;\r\n\r\n*  Contributing to overall research on collaborative sense-making conversations in museums; and\r\n\r\n*  Increasing the ability of museum educators who interact with the public, their supervisors and trainers to promote self-directed learning.\r\n\r\nOnce the researched strategies and methodologies for identifying those strategies are documented, future researchers can efficiently add to the body of understandings.  This project will have broad implications for all informal learning, no matter the location.\r\n",
