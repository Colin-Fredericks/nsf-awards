The investigator develops a wide-ranging\r\nperfect sampling algorithm that is particularly well-suited to such\r\ndistributions.  The basic idea is to exploit a mixture representation\r\nof the a stationary distribution.  The investigator also studies\r\ntechniques for Bayesian analysis of the market model, which is a\r\nmultivariate regression model used by financial economists to analyze\r\ndata on asset returns.  Empirical evidence and theoretical arguments\r\nsuggest that the errors in this model should be from a heavy-tailed,\r\nelliptically symmetric distribution.  However, the Bayesian\r\nmethodology that has been developed for making inferences via the\r\nmarket model is based on the assumption of multivariate normal errors.\r\nThis disconnect is presumably due to the fact that the posterior\r\ndistributions corresponding to the heavy-tailed alternatives are\r\nhighly intractable.  The PI develops and analyzes Monte Carlo and MCMC\r\nmethods for exploring such posterior distributions.\r\n\r\nBayesian statistical methods of analyzing data often require the user\r\nto deal with intractable probability distributions.  The investigator\r\ndevelops sampling algorithms that facilitate the use of such Bayesian\r\nmethods.  These algorithms enhance infrastructure for research and\r\neducation by providing scientists from many different disciplines with\r\nbetter techniques for making inferences from their data.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n",
