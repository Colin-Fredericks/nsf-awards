 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator takes up three projects.  In the first\r\nproject, the emphasis is the analysis and the design of efficient\r\nnumerical methods for the simulation of recent models proposed for\r\nthe dynamics of the magnetization coupled to the spin accumulation\r\nin multilayers when a current perpendicular to the plane of the\r\nlayers is applied.  The dynamical equation for the spin is a\r\ndiffusion equation with discontinuous coefficients, and the\r\nmagnetization dynamics is described by the Landau-Lifshitz\r\nequation from ferromagnetism.  In the second project, the\r\ninvestigator studies a new model for liquid crystals based on\r\nInhomogeneous Density Functional Theory.  The model can describe\r\nthe isotropic, nematic, smectic A, and crystalline phases. \r\nFinally, in the third project, the investigator studies the\r\nformation of aggregates in polymer  mixtures. \r\n\r\n     Ferromagnetic materials are widely used in the magnetic\r\nrecording industry, which continues to be the dominant technology\r\nfor the storage of digital data.  The project addresses some of\r\nthe technological difficulties found in the design of magnetic\r\ndevices such as magnetic memories (MRAMs).  Liquid crystals have a\r\nwide range of applications.  Their optical properties are highly\r\nsensitive to electric and magnetic fields, which has made liquid\r\ncrystals ideal candidates for optical-switching devices, such as\r\nvideo displays and optical memories.  They are very sensitive  to\r\ntemperature changes as well, which makes them useful in\r\napplications involving sensors.  More generally, polymers appear\r\nin most aspects of our life, from the amniotic fluid inside\r\nbiological cells, to plastics and shampoos used on a daily basis. \r\nUnderstanding the dynamics of biological membranes and transport\r\nthrough them is of fundamental importance in the development of\r\nefficient methods for the delivery of medicines.  Understanding\r\nthe process of aggregation in polymer mixtures can have a\r\nsignificant impact in the design of new products.  This study of\r\npolymers and liquid crystals addresses some of these technological\r\nand biological issues.",
