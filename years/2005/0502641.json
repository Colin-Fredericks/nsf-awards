 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Stanford gravitational wave research program is engaged in research and development on gravitational wave detection for the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) program through its membership in the LIGO Science Collaboration. Stanford's main objective is the development of technologies for Advanced LIGO that will increase its sensitivity and thus improve the probability of detection. Research on high power lasers, photo-detectors, and optical configurations that reliably handle high power will be continued toward enhancing LIGO sensitivity at high frequencies.  Studies on understanding and minimizing thermal noise in the detector's core optics will be pursued to enhance sensitivity at intermediate frequencies.  Improved core optic suspensions and isolation platforms will be developed to enable higher sensitivity at low frequencies where ground vibrations currently limit performance. The Stanford program will also include data analysis and modeling of periodic gravitational wave sources.\r\n\r\nGravitational waves were predicted almost 90 years ago in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, but they have not yet been detected due to the extreme sensitivity required. Interacting black holes, coalescing compact binary stellar systems, stellar collapses, pulsars and low mass X-ray binaries are all possible sources of gravitational waves, as is the random background of radiation from the early universe. Laser interferometer detectors, which operate by measuring strains in the fabric of space-time that are expected to be produced by gravitational waves, are now becoming operational and may soon give us a first detection. Detectors of higher performance, such as Advanced LIGO, should allow us to develop gravitational wave astronomy as a new window on the Universe. Stanford has a strong, multidisciplinary program in developing the technology for such detectors.  Participants include mechanical, electrical and control engineers, physicists and materials researchers. The program provides training for future scientists and engineers at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, it integrates basic scientific research with scientific education, and it develops and funds outreach programs that inform and educate the broader community.",
