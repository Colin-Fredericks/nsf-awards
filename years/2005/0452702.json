 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a research experiences for undergraduates (REU) site in Economics at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University that offers 10 undergraduate students a summer research experience.  Intellectual Merits- Students intern with an economics faculty member working in one of the five policy research centers or programs in the AYSPS including public economics, resource/environmental economics, urban/regional economics, labor economics, and international economics.  Interns work closely with a faculty mentor on a research project that the faculty member originally chooses, but that evolves during the project so that students become active partners.  Interns receive formal and systematic training in a weekly seminar that provides basic research skills and that culminates in a presentation and a paper related to the research experience.  Broader Impacts- The program's main short-term objective is to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to participate actively in policy research; the program is also intended to achieve the longer-term objective of attracting qualified, interested students to quality Ph.D. programs in economics, public policy, and other social sciences.",
