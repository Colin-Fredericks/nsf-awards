Knopf\r\n\r\nThe project will advance the search for canonical geometries by\r\nmeans of geometric heat flows. In light of the landmark progress\r\nmade recently by Perelman in Hamilton's program to resolve the\r\nGeometrization and Poincare' Conjectures, this research area is\r\nundergoing a rapid and productive expansion. The powerful\r\ninnovations and profound insights in Perelman's work contribute\r\nto the extraordinary power of Ricci flow as a tool for\r\ninvestigating the geometry and topology of Riemannian and complex\r\nmanifolds. In virtually all known applications of Ricci flow, it\r\nis critical to have a deep understanding of the mechanisms of\r\nsingularity formation. Therefore, the project will investigate\r\nfour aspects of singularity formation. These four objectives are\r\nchosen to build upon the prior results and current research\r\nprogram of the PI and to be highly relevant to promising new\r\napplications of Ricci flow. The objectives are to study (1)\r\nasymptotics of Ricci flow singularity formation, (2) analysis of\r\nRicci flow singularities in dimension four, (3) analysis of\r\nsingularity models for Kaehler-Ricci flow, and (4) the structure\r\nof reduced geometry.\r\n\r\nA manifold is an object that - like our universe - looks like\r\nEuclidean space locally, but whose global topology and geometry\r\nmay be much different. The broad goals of this project are to\r\nfind optimal geometric structures with which to categorize\r\nmanifolds. The methods used are certain partial differential\r\nequations called geometric heat flows. The idea is to let a\r\ngeometric object evolve in time in such a way that its geometry\r\nimproves and simplifies, possibly after a change in topology. A\r\ngeometric heat flow called the Ricci flow has just yielded major\r\nbreakthroughs in two of the most difficult open problems in\r\nmathematics. These successes provide great incentives to apply it\r\nto other challenging open problems and make it a very active and\r\ncompetitive field of research. The types of partial differential\r\nequations studied in Ricci flow have much in common with those\r\nused to model the movement of oil in shale and in thin films,\r\ncombustion in porous media, heat propagation, avalanches,\r\npopulation dispersal, the spreading of microscopic droplets, and\r\ncertain effects in plasma physics. For this reason, methods\r\ndeveloped in this project may have important applications to\r\nthose areas of applied mathematics. The project will focus on the\r\ndelicate analysis needed to understand such equations as they\r\nbecome singular. This analysis should have important broad\r\napplications, among which are the following. (i) The methods\r\ndeveloped, especially asymptotic analysis, should extend to the\r\npractical applications mentioned above. (ii) The project will\r\npromote interdisciplinary interactions with physics, where there\r\nare many applications for geometric classification and flow\r\ntechniques. For example, theorists in general relativity want to\r\nclassify possible topologies of four-dimensional\r\nspace-times. Researchers in string theory and mirror symmetry are\r\ninterested in understanding certain six-dimensional\r\nmanifolds. The Ricci flow itself is an approximation to the\r\nrenormalization flow for an important model in quantum field\r\ntheory.  (iii) The project will benefit graduate education,\r\nbecause the PI will invest time helping students develop\r\nexpertise in relevant areas of geometry, analysis, and topology.\r\n",
