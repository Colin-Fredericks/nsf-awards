Convolutions are used both for\r\ntheir theoretical elegance and their computational efficiency.  The\r\nfirst focus is on the spatio-temporal setting, with exploration of\r\ndifferent approaches to applying convolutions to the problem.  Both\r\ntheoretical and implementational aspects will be addressed.  The\r\nsecond focus is on partitioned processes, starting in the spatial\r\nsetting and moving on to spatio-temporal problems.  Partitioning is a\r\ncomputationally effective method for dealing with non-stationarity,\r\nand combined with the convolution approach allows for practical\r\nmodeling of much larger datasets than can traditionally be analyzed\r\nwith a non-stationary model.\r\n\r\nThis work is on new statistical models for processes that vary over\r\ndistance and time, possibly varying in an irregular fashion.\r\nMotivating examples come from environmental science (such as\r\nunderstanding rainfall and other environmental variables, and\r\nvalidating computer models for climate simulations) and aeronautical\r\nengineering (modeling of computational fluid dynamics simulators, such\r\nas flight simulators).  Such complex processes can be difficult to\r\nmodel well, as complicated models can be too difficult to use while\r\nsimpler models fail to fit well.  This work involves models which are\r\nsufficiently powerful, yet also practical to use for larger datasets.\r\nSuccess will impact not just the realm of statistical modeling, but\r\nmore importantly will help advance research in the fields of the\r\napplications, in particular environmetrics and aeronautical\r\nengineering.  \r\n\r\n",
