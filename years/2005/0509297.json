Nodes either operate correctly, or\r\ncease to work altogether (i.e., fail-stop). This model is quite successful when nodes\r\ncan trust one another, but this limits overlay systems from operating in the more general\r\ncase when they might be operating on untrusted, end-user computers. Such users will be\r\neconomically rational, meaning they will seek to get as much benefit from the network as\r\npossible while contributing as little of their own resources. Our research will examine\r\nextensions to these systems where nodes perform accounting, allowing them to track\r\nwhich nodes are and are not performing correctly, making it possible to offer preferential\r\nservice to nodes that offer preferential service in return. These and other related\r\ntechniques will ultimately result in incentives-compatible designs that enable a new\r\ngeneration of peer-to-peer applications, including distributed backup systems, distributed\r\nfile systems, and distributed email systems. Our work will be disseminated as part of the\r\nFreePastry project, which provides a high-quality and scalable implementation of a\r\nvariety of overlay network services and is available under a BSD-style license. Likewise,\r\nour work will become part of the next-generation Tor anonymous communication system.",
