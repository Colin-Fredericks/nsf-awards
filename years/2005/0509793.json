 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Jones polynomial invariant of links presents two puzzles. The first \r\none is its interpretation within the framework of classical topology and \r\nits relation to the fundamental group of the link complement. This \r\nrelation is well-known for the Alexander polynomial, but its Jones \r\nanalog is missing. I search for it by using the quantum field theory \r\napproach. I decompose the colored Jones polynomial in the semi-classical \r\nlimit into a sum of many simpler invariants, which turn out to be \r\nmulti-variable polynomial invariants of links. These invariants are \r\narranged naturally into a `tower' and the Alexander polynomial lies at \r\nits foundation.  My goal is to study the properties of the other `higher \r\nlevel' polynomials and establish their relation to the topology of the \r\nknot complement. The second puzzle of the Jones polynomial is its \r\npolynomial structure, which does not follow easily from its \r\nChern-Simons-Witten path integral presentation. An amazing explanation \r\nfor the polynomial nature of the Jones polynomial comes from Khovanov's \r\ncategorification program, which interprets the Jones polynomial as a \r\ngraded Euler characteristic of a chain complex of graded modules, \r\nassociated to a link up to a homotopy. I will study the possible quantum \r\nfield theory interpretations of the Khovanov homology. Namely, the \r\nhomology of the categorification complex should be a space of states for \r\na 4-dimensional topological quantum field theory, which has to be \r\nconstructed. This construction should help us to extend Khovanov's \r\nresults to quantum polynomial invariants of 3-manifolds and to interpret \r\ntheir relation to 4-dimensional topology.\r\n\r\nThe problem of knot classification is very old and although its \r\nformulation is simple and transparent, it has not been solved yet \r\ndespite concerted efforts of many mathematicians. One of the most \r\nsuccessful approaches to knot classification is the construction of knot \r\ninvariants, that is, the numbers, which can be easily computed by \r\nlooking at a picture of a knot and which would be the same for all \r\npictures representing the same knot. This area has undergone significant \r\ndevelopments in the last 30 years starting with the invention of the \r\nJones polynomial. This polynomial and the other invariants which \r\nfollowed it, are intimately related to quantum field theory and can be \r\nexpressed as so-called path integrals. Thus many of the new ideas in the \r\ntheory of knot invariants are inspired by methods and approaches of \r\nquantum physics. The goal of my research is to use the methods of \r\nquantum field theory in order to interpret the new `quantum' topological \r\ninvariants within the framework of classical topology and to apply them \r\nto the solution of the knot classification problem.\r\n",
