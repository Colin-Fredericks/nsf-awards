 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThe United States and Japan have recognized Nanoscience and Nanotechnology as frontier areas\r\nof research with potentially widespread societal impact, promising to transform health,\r\nelectronics, transportation, the environment, and national security. In both countries, significant\r\ninvestments in these areas have been made and their rapid growth is expected to continue in the\r\nfuture.\r\nTo be successful, research and training efforts in this emerging arena have to be highly\r\ninterdisciplinary and interactions will have to span not only across fields and professional hubs,\r\nbut also across international boundaries, so that the strengths and resources available in each\r\ncountry can also benefit other countries. With this in mind, the Japanese Ministry of Education,\r\nScience, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) and the United States National\r\nScience Foundation (NSF) initiated the support of scientific exchange visits between the two\r\ncountries. We propose to organize the next exchange visit to several Japanese universities for\r\ntwelve US scientists early in their academic careers, with research interests broadly defined as\r\nNanoscience and Bionanotechnology. The Japanese government will sponsor a similar trip of\r\ntwelve young scientists from Japan to several US universities as the counterpart component in\r\nthis exchange program. The focus on young scientists is driven by the premise that the\r\npossibilities for building long-term and meaningful partnerships are far higher if contacts are\r\nmade early in one's career.\r\n\r\nImpact of Proposed Research\r\nLinks established between scientists in the US and Japan at the very early stages of their\r\nacademic careers will lay the foundation for a long-term fruitful collaboration over an extended\r\nperiod, maximizing the likelihood for a successful global interdisciplinary effort and productive\r\nrelationship between these two and other countries.",
