 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL: This action supports a collaborative research program to address important issues on the mechanical behavior of multilayered nanoscaled composites. In recent years, layered materials engineered at the nanoscale have exhibited exciting possibilities for producing extremely high strength, fatigue resistance, thermal resistance, wear resistance, and biocompatibility. The research plan consists of following major thrusts: (i) processing by physical vapor deposition (PVD) and microstructure characterization (SEM, TEM, and HRTEM) of multilayered Al/SiC composites (Arizona State); (ii) residual stress characterization by x-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction (Oak Ridge National Laboratory); (iii) deformation behavior by nanoindentation and microforce tensile and fatigue testing (Arizona State); and (iv) simulation of deformation behavior by continuum, dislocation dynamics, and atomistic methodologies. The relationship between processing, nanoscale structure and mechanical properties of metal/ceramic nanolayers is examined by way of experiments employing deposition, characterization and small-scale mechanical testing techniques. Computational simulations across multiple length scales provide fundamental insights into the deformation and fracture mechanisms of nanolayered composites. NONTECHNICAL: Enhancing materials education and public awareness of the importance of nanolayered materials research and its role in addressing societal needs forms a crucial component of the program. A diverse educational and outreach program is integrated with the research program and serves to disseminate, educate, and involve students at all levels as well as the public. The program enhances the university partnership between ASU and UNM. The outreach program has the following components: (i) Creation of a new course on mechanics of nanomaterials offered jointly at ASU and UNM; (ii) Project-based activities and research opportunities for undergraduate students at ASU, UNM, and ORNL; (iii) Recruitment and involvement of underrepresented females and minorities through outreach programs at both ASU and UNM; (iv) virtual thesis defenses for graduate students and the creation of a virtual seminar series; and (v) public awareness by the creation of a website on nanomaterials. UNM is a Minority Institution and a Hispanic Serving Institution with an enrollment of nearly 50% minority students. Existing mechanisms are already in place at ASU and UNM to recruit and involve underrepresented female and minority students. The partnering programs include: Student Outreach and Retention Program (SORP) at ASU, NASA PURSUE (Preparation for University Research of Students in Undergraduate Education) at UNM, the \"Graduate Bridge Program\" in the Multicultural Engineering Program at UNM, and the NASA SHARP (Summer High-School Apprenticeship Research Program) at UNM.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
