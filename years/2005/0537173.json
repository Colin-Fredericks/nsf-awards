 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs propose to use the NOPP funding to promote commercialization of the TETHYS (TETHered Yearlong Spectrometer), a mass spectrometer for long-term unattended deployment on moorings and cabled observatories through a collaboration with Monitor Instruments Company LLC (Monitor). The proposed mass spectrometer will be based on MonitorInstruments miniature mass analyzer (MMA) and oceanographic components developed by WHOI. Testing and trial deployments will be carried out by WHOI at its Deep Submergence Laboratory and Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory. The TETHYS instrument will be optimized for long-term measurement of low molecular weight dissolved biogenic, atmospheric, and noble gases as well as light hydrocarbon compounds up to 50 AMU. This instrument will have minimum limits of detection on the order of parts-per-billion and be capable of shallow water to full ocean depth deployment. It will utilize techniques currently under development at WHOI to enable automated re-calibration in-situ and will also include measures for anti-fouling, an essential consideration for long-term deployment.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe partnership between WHOI and Monitor offers the potential of developing a new class of in situ mass spectrometer that potentially has a wide range of basic science/research applications highly relevant to development and use of both shallow- and deep-water ocean observatories. The work proposed could result in a new, commercially viable sensor that has applications ranging from basic science to resource management.\r\n",
