 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is establishing a comprehensive program in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Science Technology.  GIS is a discipline that endeavors to spatially analyze, study, and critically research aspects of our world with the use of innovative tools and techniques that organize and display large amounts of site-specific data.  Because San Diego County is home to a large number of companies that utilize GIS Technology, a significant need exists within the workforce of the County for personnel trained in the theory and use of GIS software and hardware, particularly for spatial analysis applications. \r\n\r\nThe GIS Technology program is promoting the intellectual development of a community of learners in desperate need. Incorporation of real-world, discipline related critical topics and GIS industrial standards into existing courses, and the implementation of four new courses is at the core of the program. Using state-of-the-art hardware and software, the project is also conducting the following activities: 1) Professional development workshops for college and high school faculty; 2) Placement of students in undergraduate research projects and baccalaureate programs; 3) Placement of students in professional, paid internships; and 4) GIS training for professionals in need. The GIS Technology program is a collaborative effort among faculty from disciplinary divisions across the campus. \r\n\r\nWith a student enrollment of greater than 80% ethnic minorities, this project is also making a significant contribution to bringing marketable GIS skills to underrepresented students.\t\r\n",
