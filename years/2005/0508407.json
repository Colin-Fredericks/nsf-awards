 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 04-043, category NER. The objective of this research is to achieve periodically functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and use these as precursors to fabricate multifunctional hybrid nanostructures. The approach is using polymer single crystals to periodically wrap CNTs. By controlling the crystallization conditions, a variety of CNT/polymer hybrid nanostructures can be achieved. The proposed approach is an untested method and is thus high risk. It is also high rewarding, since it provides an economic, efficient and controllable means to periodically functionalized CNTs, a challenging research area yet to be explored. Being able to periodically functionalize CNTs immediately opens the gateway to patterning functional groups on an individual CNT. \r\nThe educational component of the NER proposal includes (1) addressing the needs for the education of modern developments in polymer nanoscience and nanotechnology by developing a \"Hybrid Nano Materials\" module which will be used in the \"Nanostructured Polymeric Materials\" course. (2) involving high school students and teachers, particularly under-represented populations, in the proposed nanotechnology exploratory research activities. Due to the high population of under-represented groups in the Philadelphia region, the proposed out-reach program will be specifically geared towards encouraging the participation of under-represented populations. \r\n",
