 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the recent advances in theory, technology and applications of\r\nwireless communications a vision of the next generation wireless\r\nsystems arises to be that of communicating arbitrarily correlated\r\ndata, in arbitrarily structured networks, in challenging physical\r\nlayer conditions, using wireless devices that are more flexible in\r\nterms of their transmitting/receiving capabilities and in terms of the\r\nboundaries between the layers of their protocol stack. The goal of\r\nthis research is to develop a comprehensive information theoretic\r\nframework for determining the ultimate capacity limits of such\r\nnetworks and for developing efficient coding, transmission, reception\r\nand decoding schemes to be used in such networks.\r\n\r\nThe research is structured into four heavily interrelated parts:\r\nnetwork, data, tools, and channel. This research investigates the\r\ncapacity regions and capacity achieving transmit/receive\r\ncoding/decoding schemes of basic network structures that are building\r\nblocks of general ad-hoc multi-hop wireless networks, with an emphasis\r\non the interference channel. This research develops principles of\r\ncommunicating correlated and common data. Specifically, the\r\ninvestigator determines the optimum coding and transmission schemes\r\nfor correlated/common data and also studies the trade-offs between\r\nperformance and complexity; in particular, the loss in performance\r\nwhen the source-channel separation principle is enforced. This\r\nresearch develops new tools and integrates and jointly optimizes some\r\nof the existing tools; the emphasis is on the joint optimization of\r\nuser cooperation and power control. This research integrates the\r\nfading nature of the wireless communication channel into all of the\r\nproblem formulations. The existence of fading in the channel can be\r\nboth challenging and fortuitous, more the latter, if it is carefully\r\nexploited to the advantage of the network capacity. The investigator\r\nincorporates the existence of the channel fading into the capacity\r\nevaluations (hence, ergodic and outage capacities), into coding and\r\ntransmission schemes for common/correlated data, and also into the\r\ndevelopment of the tools.\r\n------------------\r\n",
