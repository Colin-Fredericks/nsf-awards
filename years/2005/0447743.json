 "awd_abstract_narration": "The key to reliable communications over wireless channels is diversity. \r\nOf the various methods used to achieve diversity, spatial diversity \r\nthrough the use of multiple transmit and/or receive antennas is \r\nparticularly attractive in that it does not require additional \r\nbandwidth or loss of transmission rate. Spatial diversity does, \r\nhowever, require the use of multiple antennas which must be separated \r\nby at least a few wavelengths in order to be effective. This physical \r\nconstraint precludes the use of spatial diversity in many scenarios, \r\nbut recently, researchers considered this problem in the context of \r\nmultiuser communication systems in which there may be multiple sources \r\nand/or destinations each with only a single antenna. In these types of \r\nsystems, communicating nodes can form \"partnerships\" to achieve a new \r\nkind of spatial diversity: \"user cooperation diversity\". Nodes in a \r\npartnership pool their antenna resources to form a virtual antenna \r\narray and many of the benefits of spatial diversity are achieved \r\nwithout the need for a \"real\" antenna array.\r\n\r\nWhile user cooperation diversity can provide many of the advantages of \r\nantenna arrays to devices that would otherwise only have access to a \r\nsingle antenna, the implementation issues are significantly different \r\nthan those of antenna arrays. Unlike a traditional antenna array, the \r\nnodes in a cooperative partnership are at least semi-autonomous in the \r\nsense that they each typically have their own local resources, \r\nquality-of-service requirements, and timing references. This project is \r\ncentered around the questions created by the inherent autonomy of nodes \r\nin cooperative multiuser communication systems: how to initiate and \r\nmaintain cooperative partnerships, how to optimally allocate resources \r\nin cooperative partnerships, and how to synchronize cooperating nodes.\r\n\r\n",
