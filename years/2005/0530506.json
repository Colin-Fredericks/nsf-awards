 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe planning grant is to revise the civil engineering curriculum by infusing an infrastructure theme throughout. The new curriculum will include a new class, \"Introduction to Infrastructure,\" at the beginning of the second year that will specifically address infrastructure needs and the non-technical issues (such as financing, political process, etc.) that are often crucial to successful engineering projects. It should be emphasized, however, that the objectives of this proposal go far beyond adding a single class. The infrastructure concepts from this new class will be interwoven throughout the remainder of the curriculum to provide students with a better understanding of the challenges to be faced in improving, securing, and maintaining the national infrastructure. In addition to learning about infrastructure in classes, student will evaluate infrastructure components in local communities from direct observation. The service learning activity will provide students with a direct connection to a local community and its needs. Upon completion of their technical elective courses, graduates of the department will have written a thorough infrastructure assessment of a local community. Engineering graduates from UWP will have a broader understanding of infrastructure that will benefit communities throughout the United States where they will work and live. \r\n",
