The conference \r\nparticipants will be comprised of experts in both theory and \r\napplications. There will be a substantial emphasis on problems of \r\noptical communications, Bose-Einstein condensates, and ultra-short \r\npulse lasers. Mathematical topics include inverse scattering and \r\nother theoretical aspects of integrable nonlinear evolution equations. \r\nThe topics slated for discussion are in the forefront of research \r\nin nonlinear science, and have witnessed enormous progress at a \r\nphenomenal pace in recent times. In particular, the past few years \r\nhas seen new applications of soliton theory to lightwave communication \r\nand rare event simulation of lightwave systems, and rapid experimental \r\nprogress in the fields of Bose-Einstein condensation and ultra-short \r\npulse lasers; all of these application fields are strongly corelated \r\nwith the theory of nonlinear waves and integrable systems. Consequently, a comprehensive conference covering these topics is planned.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference speakers will report the latest theoretical and experimental results in the areas mentioned above. Participants, especially younger scientists, will benefit from becoming aware of the latest results in their respective fields, and will also be able to discuss with leading international experts. Because of the inter-disciplinary nature of the conference, experts will become aware of the latest work in fields related to but different from their own. Thus, the conference will provide a forum for cross-fertilization of ideas amongst various disciplines. In addition, the inclusion of students and scientists at the beginnings of their careers in the conference will promote the transfer of this expertise to the next generation of mathematicians and applied scientists.\r\n\r\n",
