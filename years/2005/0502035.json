 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site program at the University of Pittsburgh entitled, \"Bringing Innovative Design into Urban High Schools on a Sustainable Basis: University of Pittsburgh Design Team RET Site,\" under the direction of Dr. Michael R. Lovell.  The mission of this RET site program is to implement several of the University of Pittsburgh's innovative design research activities at the high school level in an effort to foster creativity and promote interest in science, technology, and math (STEM) subjects, particularly for underrepresent pre-college students.  Two well recognized units of the University of Pittsburgh are joining together to attain this mission-the Swanson Center for Product Innovation (SCPI) and the Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC).  To gain an additional real-world industry perspective, Westinghouse Electric Corporation (WEC) will also significantly contribute to the propsed research program by providing leadership, projects and financial support for the RET activities.\r\n\r\nCo-funding is being provided by the NSF Partnerships for Innovation Program (PFI).",
