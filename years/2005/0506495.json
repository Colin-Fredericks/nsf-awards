 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract, DMS 0506495, R Goodman, New Jersey Inst of technology\r\n\r\nTitle: Mathematical methods for nonlinear wave interactions  \r\n\r\nThis project studies interactions between waves in models from optics \r\nand mathematical physics, and the relative stability of waves trapped \r\nby localized potentials.   Wave interactions in many applications have \r\nbeen known for many years to display resonance structures in which wave \r\ncapture and reflection alternate in a surprising fractal-like manner. \r\nMethods from the theory of dynamical systems, including Melnikov \r\nmethods, matched asymptotics, and transport theory of iterated maps, \r\nare to be applied to ordinary differential equations models of such \r\nwave interactions, extending recently published work of the PI.  In a \r\nsecond thread of research, we look at the nonlinear interaction between \r\ntrapped modes at potentials engineered into optical fibers, modeled by \r\nthe nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS), or the nonlinear coupled mode \r\nequations (NLCME) in the case of fiber Bragg gratings.  The NLCME \r\nsystem lacks an energy-minimization principle (all bound states are \r\nsaddle points of the energy), yet somehow a ground state is chosen.  We \r\nstudy this using numerical analysis, derivation of simplified ordinary \r\ndifferential equation models, and ideas from the spectral theory of \r\nHamiltonian systems.\r\n\r\nNonlinear wave phenomena are ubiquitous in physics.  An important \r\nengineering example is in optical communications, where information is \r\nsent as pulses of light through glass fibers.  It is important to \r\nunderstand how these waves interact with each other, and with local \r\nstructures in the medium through which they travel, in order to better \r\ndesign devices that exploit their novel properties.  The aim of this \r\nresearch is to extend mathematical theory from dynamical systems to \r\nexplain phenomena seen in wave interaction, such as wave-trapping.  It \r\nwill use sophisticated computational and analytical methods, some \r\ndeveloped in the study of Bose-Einstein condensates, to study the \r\nbehavior of light in novel physical configurations.\r\n",
