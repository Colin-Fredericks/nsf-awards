 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research:AfricaArray - Imaging the African Superplume\r\n\r\nThe African Superplume is a large region of low seismic wave speeds in \r\nthe lower mantle under southern Africa that has long been recognized as \r\none of the most prominent features of the mantle. Above the African \r\nSuperplume lies the African Superswell, suggesting a geodynamic link \r\nbetween lower mantle dynamics and geologic processes shaping the \r\nAfrican plate. The origin and nature of the African Superplume is \r\ncontroversial. The initial interpretation of the low wave speed region \r\nunder southern Africa attributed it to a long-lived, hot mantle \r\nupwelling. A number of seismic studies since then have suggested the \r\npresence of chemical heterogeneity within the superplume.\r\n\r\nWhat parts of the superplume anomaly are thermal vs. chemical (or both) \r\nremains uncertain, as does its origin. In this project, the structure, \r\ncomposition and origin of the African Superplume will be investigated \r\nusing the first 3 years of broadband seismic data from AfricaArray, \r\ntogether with existing data, and concentrating on four types of \r\nanalyses; 1) tomographic imaging of the upper and lower mantle using \r\nbody wave travel times, 2) modeling waveforms of teleseismic body wave \r\nphases that sample the Superplume, 3) jointly inverting receiver \r\nfunctions and surface wave dispersion measurements for crust and \r\nuppermost mantle structure, and 4) stacking and migrating receiver \r\nfunctions to image topography on the 410 and 660 km discontinuities.\r\n\r\nAfricaArrayis a new 10-year-long Pan-African training and research \r\ninitiative in geophysics, with an emphasis on seismology, set up by the \r\nUniversity of the Witwatersrand, the Council for Geoscience (South \r\nAfrican geological survey), and Penn State. AfricaArraywill provide the \r\nU.S. geophysics community with important seismic data on earth \r\nstructure and processes for many years. AfricaArraywill greatly \r\nstrengthen scientific ties between the U.S. geophysics community and \r\nearth scientists throughout Africa. Once established, AfricaArraywill \r\nprovide opportunities for promoting geophysics to U.S. minority groups, \r\nas well as other students, through summer internships and a summer \r\ngeophysics field course (both in Africa).\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
