The PVSO REU site will focus on the study of the space environment represented by the Sun and its effects on Earth's magnetosphere and upper atmosphere. Within the Sun-Earth space environment theme, students will participate in current research projects at PVSO. Research projects encompass two main research areas: (1) the study of solar activity based on observations performed at PVSO and (2) computer modeling to ascertain the response of Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere to solar activity. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThe faculty and research staff of PVSO will individually mentor students during their research experience. Tutorials/seminars will familiarize students to the Sun-Earth space environment, the basic concepts of space physics, and the impact of solar activity on satellite and ground-based systems. Under the guidance of their mentors, participants will prepare a written report on their research and give a presentation at a group seminar. Selected students will be afforded the opportunity to attend and present their research results at a scientific conference. The PI proposes to establish both summer and academic-year programs open to undergraduates who have satisfactorily completed at least their freshman year. Eight students each will be recruited for the programs. The summer program will consist of 8 full-time weeks, while the academic-year program will consist of 34 part-time weeks. Emphasis will be on the participation of minorities and women, groups that are underrepresented in solar and space science. Recruitment efforts will be directed mainly towards students from PVAMU and students from HBCU's nationwide. During the academic year, only students enrolled at PVAMU will be accepted. To retain their interest in solar and space science and further develop their skills as independent researchers, promising students will be selected to continue in the subsequent summer/academic-year programs. PVSO's REU program will introduce undergraduate participants to a realistic and fulfilling research experience in solar physics, space plasma physics, and the near-Earth space environment by working directly with active professionals. Participation in PVSO's REU program will help undergraduates develop a greater interest for disciplines related to the space environment, as well as consider future careers in solar and space sciences.\r\n\r\n",

The proposed projects were operated by Prairie View Solar observatory.  In the whole period, besides the P.I.

In the first five years, each year there were ten to fifteen undergraduates, among them 95% were minority, participated in the program to work on solar observation and space science research projects.  In the last year there were eight students participated in the research projects.\n\nThe program had detailed arrangement for all undergraduate participators to be trained with research skills.  At first, through given a series of special lectures and seminars by the program mentors and visitors, the REU participators acquired the basic knowledge on Sun-Earth space environment and space science.  On the research, the REU participators worked on solar observation and conducted assigned research tasks with the guidance of the mentors.  Thus the undergraduates learned research experiences.  The students also were requested to write research report and give presentation.\n\nThis REU program has been a highly attractive program for PVAMU undergraduates.  It is positioned to give the students to reach a series of advanced research program.  It has been selected by NSF as one example program published in the document FY2006-2011 Strategic Plan (page 15).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tian-Sen Huang"
