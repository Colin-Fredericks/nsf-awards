This proposal involves experiments to apply ground\r\npenetrating radar (GPR) for (1) estimating the amount of biogenic gas stored in peatlands,\r\n(2) determining the spatial distribution of biogenic gas within the peat, and (3)\r\nmonitoring biogenic gas release to the atmosphere. Data from a large northern peatland in\r\nMaine (EAR-0242353) show that (1) higher CH4 and CO2 concentrations correlate with\r\nhigh velocity/high attenuation zones in cross-borehole GPR data as well as shadow zones\r\n(loss of reflections) in surface GPR data, (2) shadow zones (indicative of high gas\r\ncontent) are frequently observed in the +11 km of surface GPR data collected in this\r\npeatland. The experimental objectives are: (1) a laboratory evaluation of the relationship\r\nbetween dielectric permittivity and gas content for a profile of peat cores from the surface\r\nto the mineral soil; (2) a cross-hole GPR and surface GPR monitoring experiment,\r\nsupported by measurements of water levels, hydraulic conductivity and time domain\r\nreflectometry, to observe rates of biogenic gas release to the atmosphere; (3) a surface\r\nGPR study, supported by in situ measurements of biogenic gas concentration, to estimate\r\nthe volume of biogenic gas stored in two well studied northern peatlands (Caribou Bog,\r\nME and Glacial Lake Agassiz, MN). Important milestones include (a) a predictive\r\nequation for gas content estimation in peat as a function of depth from dielectric\r\npermittivity measurements, (b) new insight into the temporal pattern of gas release and\r\nebullition flux from peatlands, and (c) new estimates of the free gas content of peatland\r\ncarbon reservoirs accounting for the spatial/depth distribution of the gas.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis proposal incorporates educational activities, curriculum development, community\r\noutreach and international collaboration within an applied research framework. Honors\r\nUnderGraduate (HUG) researchers from the Rutgers-Newark Honors College (HC) will\r\npartner with a postdoctoral scientist to obtain the research training required to complete\r\nfour of the primary research tasks. Each HUG will complete a yearlong senior project on\r\ntheir research and contribute to a publication. The status of Rutgers-Newark as the topranked\r\nNational US University with respect to campus UG diversity facilitates HUG\r\nopportunities to minority students. Students in Earth/Environmental Sciences at Rutgers-\r\nNewark frequently express interest in fieldwork experiences. Part of the fieldwork will be\r\nconducted by students participating in a new class, Summer Field Camp in Applied\r\nGeophysics, developed as part of this project. Community outreach will occur via guided\r\ntours, poster boards and presentations on the hydrology, ecology and carbon cycle in\r\nCaribou Bog, facilitated by the recently opened 2 km long Orono boardwalk that now\r\nprovides public access to this bog. Finally, collaboration with a prominent peatland\r\nscientist in Europe will draw international attention to our work and provide an\r\nopportunity to conduct comparative work on a unique European peat bog.\r\n",
