 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues first principles studies of quantum chromodynamics (the theory of the strong interactions) through the use of high performance computer simulations. In calculations of known quantities the improved computational algorithms in use have been tested in the past couple of years with excellent results. In the next phase these algorithms will be used to extract the most precise values to date of key numbers in the Standard Model of the fundamental interactions in Nature. Results to be obtained are essential for analyzing experimental measurements at national accelerator laboratories and for testing the internal consistency of the Model. They may lead to clues about more fundamental interactions. They will also be used to continue studies of the high temperature phase transition between confined matter and the quark-gluon plasma and of the strange quark content of the plasma. Such a phase transition occurred in the evolution of the early Universe and is thought to be achievable in the laboratory in collisions of heavy ions at the RHIC accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Through studies of the performance and limitations of improved algorithms, this work also broadens our understanding of lattice field theory. The broader impacts are that these studies are important for extending our understanding of the most fundamental basis of our physical world and of the origins of our Universe. Algorithmic ideas are likely to have applications in other computational fields. The supported activity promotes the development of young scientists trained in computational skills.",
