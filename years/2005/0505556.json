 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies several problems in the theory of fractional \r\nfactorial design. Some recent results in finite projective geometry \r\nprovide powerful tools for characterizing the structures of regular \r\nfractional factorial designs of resolution IV in certain important cases. \r\nOne major research activity is to expand these tools and apply them to \r\ndevelop a comprehensive theory for the determination and construction of \r\noptimal regular fractional factorial designs of resolution IV under the \r\ncriterion of minimum aberration. The results are further extended to \r\nnonregular designs and the situation where the experimental units are \r\ndivided into more homogeneous blocks to improve precision. The research on \r\nnonregular designs provides new methods for constructing orthogonal arrays \r\nof strength three. Hidden projection properties of multi-level designs are \r\nalso investigated. Under the assumption of effect sparsity, a design with \r\ngood projections onto small subsets of factors can provide useful \r\ninformation after the small number of active factors have been identified.\r\n\r\nExperimental design is used extensively in a wide range of scientific and \r\nindustrial investigations. In industrial experiments, often a large number \r\nof factors have to be studied, but the experiments are expensive to \r\nconduct. In this case, only a small fraction of all the possible \r\ncombinations can be observed, and how to choose a good fraction is an \r\nimportant issue. In recent years, such fractional factorial designs have \r\nreceived considerable attention, mainly due to the success in applying \r\nthem to conduct experiments for improving quality and productivity in \r\nindustrial manufacturing. This research is to study the construction of \r\nefficient designs to extract more information. Experimenters will be \r\nbenefited by having a rich source of new and good designs, and will be \r\nable to run their experiments more efficiently. Better industrial \r\nexperiments can improve the quality of products and reduce production \r\ncost.\r\n\r\n",
