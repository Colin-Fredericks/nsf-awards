 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study focuses on the generation of several large databases for several males belonging to five species of birds endemic to Australia, the Fairy-wrens.  These databases will be the repository of the reproductive biology of fairy-wrens that differ in their social and mating behavior.  This study will quantify aspects of the reproductive anatomy of males and females integrating anatomical, physiological, behavioral, and evolutionary methods.  To determine how the mating behaviors of females relate to reproductive anatomy and physiology in males, sperm numbers and quality, spermatogenesis, hormone levels, paternity, and morphology will be measured in males of each species. Experiments with captive birds will investigate the reproductive allocation by males to females according to whether the females are social mates or extra-pair mates. Lastly, laboratory studies of histology will investigate cellular aspects of sperm production and the relationship between sperm production in males and sperm storage in females.  The research described in this proposal will produce impressive databases that will have to be managed and exploited by cyber approaches to permit compilation and synthesis by the principal investigator, his collaborators, and others with access to these data.  Besides providing critical and novel information on the reproductive biology of wild species of birds, this study will add to our understanding of the interaction between social behavior and physiology and the sperm production process, and it will permit the testing of important hypotheses in behavior and evolutionary biology. Furthermore, it contributes to the training of undergraduate and graduate students, strengthens collaborations and interactions between the University of Chicago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and several Australian universities.",
