 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is devoted to investigation of the area lying at the \r\ncrossroads of the representation theory of Lie groups, quantum groups, birational algebraic geometry, \r\nand piecewise-linear combinatorics. A new approach to the study of Lusztig's canonical bases and Kashiwara's\r\ncrystal bases is proposed, based on quantum cluster algebras and geometric crystals. \r\nNew information resulting from this study will be applied to computing  the multiplicities for the representations of reductive groups \r\nand for constructing new totally positive varieties.  The results of this study will also be used for solving problems emerging in the representations of discrete subgroups of reductive algebraic groups as well as for explication and elaboration of related combinatorial and geometric structures. \r\n\r\n\r\nRepresentation theory of Lie algebras and quantum groups is one of the most dynamically developing fields of modern Mathematics. This theory has a large impact on other fields of Mathematics and generates numerous applications in other Natural\r\nSciences. In their turn, the concepts of canonical and crystal bases are of great importance for the representation theory: a mere establishing of their existence has helped in solving classical enumeration problems (e.g., the problem of  computing \r\nmultiplicities of irreducible representations or decomposing tensor \r\nproducts of irreducible representations). Therefore, any information on canonical or crystal bases would be very beneficial for the representation theory.  Understanding the relationship \r\nbetween the discrete (i.e., combinatorial) and continuous (i.e., geometric) structures of the canonical bases is one of the main priorities of this project. This relationship has proved to be a useful tool in the study of a famous Langlands correspondence -- the most mysterious \r\nand inspiring correspondence between Algebra and Geometry of the 20th century Mathematics.\r\n",
