The program has focused on a demographic sector of American society that has had an acute need for more STEM participants and is benefiting from the NAMSS' mentoring activities. The program has been so successful that it is been duplicated in additional communities and in the process of being replicated in others\r\n\r\nThe submitted nomination package is in support of a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) to recognize outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that enhance the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science, mathematics, and engineering at K-12 grades through the graduate school level.\r\n",
