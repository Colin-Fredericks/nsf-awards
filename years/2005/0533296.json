 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop for Inter-American Materials Collaboration (CIAM) will be organized as part of the XIV International Materials Research Congress to be held in Cancun, Mexico, on August 21-25 2005. The one-and-a-half day workshop will bring together researchers funded under the CIAM umbrella, to present results from their CIAM collaborations and to discuss with each other and with representatives from national research funding agencies within CIAM the various challenges and opportunities encountered while carrying out their CIAM-funded research.\r\n\r\nAs part of a larger meeting, which will also feature the 10th.Anniversary of the Materials World Network, the CIAM workshop will provide an additional opportunity for other researchers not currently funded under the auspices of CIAM to learn more about the collective activities of CIAM researchers. Students participating in CIAM activities will also have an opportunity to attend and interact with other CIAM student researchers - both platform talks and a poster session are scheduled to encourage and foster these interactions. The anticipated discussions and exchange of ideas will serve to stimulate future collaborative research activities and proposals connecting scientists and students from the participating CIAM countries.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\n",
