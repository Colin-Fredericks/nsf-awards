 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Gordon Research Conference will be held July 17-22, 2005 on the Chemistry of Electronic Materials. Topics include new materials, new devices, and novel approaches to synthesis and characterization. Sessions will be held on: carbon-based electronics, novel polymers and patterning techniques, organic thin film electronics and optoelectronics, molecular conductance and switching, self-assembled molecular and biomolecular systems, frontiers of electronic and magnetic materials, and electronic and photonic nanostructures.  Objectives are to stimulate communications among  researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds--chemistry, physics, engineering and materials science, and to formulate and delineate critical research necessary to further basic understanding and move concepts closer to technological success. The conference is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific issues in the area of synthesis, processing and characterization of electronic materials. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established between universities, research institutions, and industry. \r\n%%%\r\nAn evaluation of the progress and status of synthesis and processing phenomena involved in the growth and processing of electronic materials and device related structures along with current assessments of the most important developments in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of materials in computing, data processing, and communications. The requested NSF funds will be used to facilitate participation in the meeting by young faculty, postdoctoral research associates and graduate students.\t \r\n***\r\n \r\n\r\n",
