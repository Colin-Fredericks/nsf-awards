 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this new RUI award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Richard Nagorski of the Department of Chemistry at Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois.  The research project involves investigations of structure/reactivity correlations and catalysis in the aqueous reactions of carbinolamides and N-(hydroxyalkyl)urea derivatives.  Carbinolamides are intermediates in the enzyme catalyzed formation of peptide hormones and N-(hydroxyalkyl)ureas are involved in the production of urea from purines. Despite the biological importance of these compounds, the reactivity and mechanisms by which they react are poorly understood.  In order to achieve a better understanding of the chemistry of these species, the rates and products of their aqueous reactions as a function of pH and structure will be investigated. Since very little data exists concerning the reactivity of these compounds, the results will be unique and of broad interest to the biochemical community.\r\n\r\nThese studies, which will increase our knowledge of the underlying reaction mechanisms of molecules and molecular systems that are a part of important biological processes, will have significant impact on the fields of biology, medicinal chemistry, biochemistry and pharmacology.  Of equal importance are the benefits to the undergraduate and graduate students who will carry out this research.  For many, these studies will represent their first steps into performing scientific investigations that involve techniques and methods that are accessible, yet challenging, to both undergraduate and graduate students. Opportunities of this kind will lead to a scientific community that is better trained and with a wider range of experience.\r\n",
