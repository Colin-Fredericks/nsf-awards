 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of the proposed research is to prepare hybrid inorganic-organic materials containing nanosize metal clusters with predictable structural and physical/chemical properties. The work will test  novel methodologies for the preparation of cluster-based materials with specific dimensionality and framework topology . The approach takes its roots in crystal-engineering principles in which a series of specifically designed building units, an octahedral metal cluster and a metal complex with preferred directional bonding requirements are used to prepare extended frameworks through coordination bonds. The dimensionality and properties of the extended frameworks obtained will depend on i) the properties of the clusters and metal complexes used; ii) the function and type of bridging ligands; and iii) the roles played by the shape, function and charge of counterions. The work will ultimately lead to an understanding of the chemical conditions that allow the preparation of cluster-based materials with structural and physical properties that can be adjusted either before or after obtaining the inorganic-organic polymers. The research proposed will significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between composition, bonding, and properties of materials allowing the preparation of materials with specific properties by design.\r\nThe work will advance the field of solid-state materials chemistry, and will support the education of young scientists participating in this important and exciting area by serving as a vehicle to train young individuals in state-of-the-art research methodologies and techniques to prepare them for research and development careers. The project will advance research/inquiry based teaching and training at all levels (undergraduates, graduate, and postdoctoral fellows) which is an essential component of the research project described in this proposal. Students at all levels of training will become experts in materials chemistry and physics through direct research experience.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nThe need for high-technology has advanced exponentially in recent decades leading to high demand for new materials with greatly improved properties offering both better performance and new applications. Organic-inorganic hybrid materials with well-defined structures controlled at the molecular scale represent a very important class of materials both for their use as composites and because of their potential use in a wide range of technologically advanced as well as more conventional applications areas such as photonics and electronics, chemical and biological sensors, energy storage, and catalysis requires better understanding of the assembly of well defined chemical species into functional materials.  The objective of this work is to develop new hybrid materials based on nanosize metal clusters, using a new methodology recently developed based on crystal engineering principles. The materials will be prepared through the assembly of molecular nanoobjects into well organized materials with desired physical and chemical properties. The use of transition metal clusters as building blocks of well organized hybrid materials is of special importance due to their nanosize, electronic flexibility, magnetic and photophysical properties, and chemical stability. The work will contribute significantly to training of students at all levels (postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students) in cutting edge techniques and methodologies in materials preparation and characterization, preparing them for excellent research and development, and academic careers.\r\n\r\n",
