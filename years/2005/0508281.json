 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to understand the fundamentals of nano gas flows and to assess/demonstrate the feasibility of using thermally induced molecular gas flows for the two proposed applications, namely nanostructure metrology and highly efficient gaseous separation. This is achieved by the following planned research activities: (1) model and understand the limits of thermal transpiration in nanosystems, particularly the Knudsen force and thermal diffusion; and (2) design, fabricate and test simple structures to validate the models and to demonstrate the utility of gas flows in metrology. An integrated modeling and experimental approach is proposed and will be carried out by a team led by a theoretician and an experimentalist. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are achieved by (1) creating impact on homeland security, nanotechnology and nanoscience via fundamental studies of nano gas flows and novel concepts for nanostructure metrology and gaseous separation with potential applications in bioterrorism prevention, etc., and (2) making available software or tools resulted from this research to the public. In addition, the research developed in this proposal will be carried out in conjunction with an educational program. The main objective of this one-year project is to develop demonstration modules and simulation projects based on the proposed research for both graduate-level and undergraduate-level courses. These new components will focus on teaching and illustration the fundamentals of nano gas flows, nanofabrication techniques and molecular simulation methods. \r\n",
