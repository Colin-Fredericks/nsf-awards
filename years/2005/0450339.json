 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP) will implement a \r\nvariety of innovative and proven strategies for the recruitment, admission, retention and preparation for faculty positions of underrepresented minority graduate students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  For the past five years, a number of these strategies were developed and evaluated by the faculty at five Alliance (University of Massachusetts Amherst, Boston University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Pennsylvania State University and Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey) and  five  Partner  (Jackson State  University,  Lincoln University,  Long  Island  University, Medgar  Evers College and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez) Institutions.  NEAGEP will be expanded and enhanced by the addition of the five other major land-grant universities in the Northeast (the Universities of Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont) into the Alliance. Two new Partner Institutions, Bennett College and, beginning in the second year of the new funding cycle, Trinity College, will  also  join  NEAGEP.    Together,  the  New  England  Land-Grant  Universities  bring  to  NEAGEP  the \r\nresources of 6,000 faculty members, a half-billion dollars in annual sponsored research, connections to 26 additional minority-serving (predominantly African American and Hispanic) institutions and access to the growing Native American population in northern New England. Building  upon  the  foundation  laid  and  the  experience  gained  in  the  past  five  years, this  expanded Alliance will more effectively coordinate efforts to match graduate students' interests and skills with a broad range of graduate programs. It will also create a critical mass of minority graduate students with \r\nsimilar research interests.  To address the national shortage and increase the number of underrepresented STEM minority doctoral students, NEAGEP proposes the following strategies: \r\n\r\nRecruitment:    (a)  design  a  common  supplementary  NEAGEP  application;  (b)  facilitate  faculty \r\ninvolvement  in  Diversity  Teams;  (c)  revise  practices  in  summer  research  programs;  (d)  continue  fall recruiting  weekends;  (e)  ensure  multi-institutional  presence  at  national  meetings;  (f)  invite  Partner faculty  to  research  residencies  at  Alliance  Institutions;  (g)  hold  Partner  Science  Days  at  Partner Institutions; \r\n\r\nAdmissions:  (a) initiate Rapid Response contacts; (b) involve NEAGEP graduate program directors; \r\n(c) expand NEAGEP Research Internships; (d) offer NEAGEP first and last year research assistantships; \r\n\r\nRetention: (a) participate in the Graduate School mentoring grant competition; (b) offer mentoring \r\nworkshops; (c) set up mentoring website; (d) rotate NEA Day among Alliance Institutions; \r\n\r\nFuture  faculty  preparation:  (a)  integrate  teaching  and  research  preparation  for  underrepresented minority  STEM  graduate  students  and  postdoctoral  fellows;  and  (b)  offer  career  counseling  and placement assistance. \r\n\r\nNot all strategies will be undertaken by all institutions, but all will embark on some activities in each area  and  take  part  in  cross-cutting  initiatives  such  as:  (a)  implementation  of  a  NEAGEP-wide Networking  Group;  (b)  expansion  of  the  NEAGEP  office  structure  and  functions;  (c)  execution  of NEAGEP-wide sharing of admissions information; (d) establishment of joint Partner-Alliance doctoral programs; and (e) participation in an Alliance-wide comprehensive evaluation. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:   The NEAGEP strategies  proposed  are  both  innovative  and  transferable.  The \r\nunderlying  principle  is  that  they  are  faculty-driven  and  championed  by  the  administration.  \r\nImplementation of these strategies will advance fundamental cultural change in academia and promote the success of underrepresented minority students in STEM doctoral programs.   The prior success with the Alliance structure provided the impetus for the logical extension of activities to the neighboring New England  Land-Grant  Universities.    By  extending  the  Alliance  activities  to  this  group,  hundreds  more underrepresented minority STEM students and beginning faculty will benefit. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The number of U.S. citizens applying for graduate study in STEM disciplines is \r\ninadequate to meet the growing national needs in these areas.  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the number of international graduate students applying to STEM graduate programs has decreased by over 30% nationwide this year.  The number of U.S. STEM scientists needs to be increased if this country is to remain competitive on the world stage. The fundamental, and most important, impact of this program will be to create an environment in which minority persons can succeed in the STEM disciplines in the U.S.  The proposed efforts will lead to the successful recruitment, admission  and retention of a diverse  group  of  graduate  students  and  will  encourage  these  students  to  pursue  careers  in  the professoriate.",
