 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project CAREER: GAS-PHASE CATALYTIC PROCESSES ON METAL NANOCLUSTERS aims to improve the understanding of the processes taking place in nanocluster-catalyzed reactions by systematically studying how the nanoparticle size, shape and composition affect its chemical reactivity. The low temperature carbon monoxide oxidation and the direct propylene epoxidation reactions on metal-oxide-supported gold nanoparticles will be used as model systems. The experiments will involve a unique combination of ex-situ size- and shape-selected nanoparticle preparation methods and in-situ (UHV) reactivity measurements at different stages of thermally and chemically-induced structural transformations. Interconnections between directly measurable electronic phenomena and surface chemistry will be established by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Temperature-Programmed Desorption. The fundamental knowledge gained may lead to the discovery of new catalytic processes while making efficient use of energy and raw materials with minimal influence on the environment. The educational component of this program includes the development of a new graduate course entitled \"Basic concepts of surface science applied to nanotechnology\", the involvement of K-12 teachers, undergraduate and K-12 students in the proposed research through summer fellowships, and an outreach program directed to local high school female students and their families that will facilitate field-trips to the University of Central Florida (UCF) and the participation in round table discussions with UCF faculty members.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nExciting new opportunities are emerging in the field of catalysis based on the use of nanotechnology. Nanostructured surfaces show modified chemical reactivity due to changes in surface morphology and electronic structure. This project aims to improve the understanding of the processes taking place in nanocluster-catalyzed reactions by systematically studying how the nanoparticle size, shape and composition affect its chemical reactivity. The fundamental knowledge gained may lead to the discovery of new catalytic processes while making efficient use of energy and raw materials with minimal influence on the environment. In addition, this program will help to promote and consolidate the research in nanoscience at UCF through the development of a new graduate course entitled \"Basic concepts of surface science applied to nanotechnology.\" The students trained in these and related areas of nanoscience and engineering are very competitive in both the academic and industrial job market.\r\n",
