 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear transport equations model a variety of physical phenomena\r\nwhich often occur in real life. Examples of such phenomena are\r\nfluid mechanics, meteorology, reactive flows, multi-component flows, \r\nimage processing, financial and biological modeling and others.\r\nComputing the solutions to these equations remains an important and \r\nchallenging problem that requires development of fast, reliable and \r\naccurate numerical methods. At the same time, understanding \r\nthe analytical properties of their solutions is not only useful \r\nfor developing fast solvers, but remains imperative for real world\r\napplications. \r\n\r\nOn the analytic side, we propose to utilize techniques from approximation \r\ntheory and Harmonic Analysis to prove  analytical results for nonlinear \r\nequations and to use these techniques to develop numerical methods.\r\nThe   techniques to be employed include Littlewood-Paley theory, wavelet \r\ndecompositions, maximal functions, interpolation and K-functionals. \r\nEmphasis will be placed on the understanding the relation between micro- \r\nand macroscopic models for transport, where a main vehicle in moving from \r\nthe micro to the macro level are averaging lemmas.\r\nOn the numerical side, the project aims to  further develop the Godunov \r\ntype central schemes for multidimensional systems of conservation \r\nlaws and related problems. These schemes do not employ Riemann problem \r\nsolvers and characteristic decomposition. Their high resolution and \r\nsimplicity turns them into a universal tool for solving a wide range of \r\nproblems. The application of these schemes to multi-phase and multi-fluid \r\nflow models, the Saint-Venant systems of shallow water equations, \r\nmulti-layer shallow water systems, shallow water equations on a rotating\r\nsphere, granular material flows is another goal of the proposed \r\nresearch, which requires further development of central schemes and \r\nincorporation of various adaptive techniques into the central framework.\r\n",
