 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nOur proposed research is concerned with the design of distributed algorithms for networks of agents\r\nwith communication/sensing capabilities. Our novel algorithms will be capable of exploiting fea-\r\ntures of the communication/sensing topology and heterogeneities in the design paradigm in order to\r\ncomplete coordinated tasks in the face of constraints (such as actuator saturation or communication\r\nrate constraints) and stochastic or nonrandom topological variations. Hence, the algorithms will be\r\nwell-suited for modern applications such as autonomous-vehicle coordination, sensor network-based\r\ndetection, and air trafficc  flow management, among others.\r\nOur proposed methodology for designing these sensing-network algorithms is control-theoretic\r\nin nature. We will draw on several control-theoretic tools|most prominently, tools that use the\r\nnotion of a fixed-mode in decentralized control theory and the influence model paradigm|to gain\r\ninsight into distributed algorithm performance and design. In particular, we will systematically\r\ncharacterize and design algorithms for a sequence of canonical tasks, including formation, agree-\r\nment, and self-partitioning tasks, and tasks for internally-coupled networks (such as Air Traffic\r\nSystems or electric power systems). For each canonical task, our goal will be to identify the topo-\r\nlogical structure and degree of design heterogeneity needed to achieve high performance in the\r\nface of realistic contstraints and topological variation. The underlying control-theoretic tools will\r\nbe extended based on our algorithm-design needs (e.g., they will be extended to be account for\r\ntopological variation), and simulations and experiments of complex tasks will be performed.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal is evident: difficult distributed control problems are\r\naddressed to in order to develop novel sensing-network algorithms. The broader impact of our\r\nresearch is significant: a new course on network dynamics and control has been designed and is\r\ncurrently being taught here at Washington State University, and efforts will be made to foster\r\ninterest and disseminate information about sensing networks and their control.\r\n",
