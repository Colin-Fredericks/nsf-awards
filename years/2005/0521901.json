 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will develop a prototype Induced Positron Manufacturing Damage System (IPMDS) to be used to assess initial component quality, and manufacturing damage effects for Ti-6Al-4V and IN738 components. The IPMDS is based on the Induced Positron Annihilation technologies whose capabilities to assess alpha inclusion and fatigue damage effects have been previously demonstrated. The IPMDS is an innovative damage assessment tool that will be developed with support from Precision Cast Corporation (PCC) as a manufacturing quality control and damage assessment tool to be used to reduce costs in place of current destructive methods, which are expensive and do not provide adequate sensitivity to either manufacturing or operational damage effects. The IPMDS will contribute to extended use component designs, cost savings, and efficient operations for the titanium and nickel super-alloy industries. \r\n\r\nCommercial applications of IPMDS will be targeted at the structural and turbine engine industries, which extensively utilize expensive titanium and nickel super-alloy components. The IPMDS has a high potential for becoming a critical and necessary inspection tool in these industries due to its potential for minimizing manufacturing variability, assessing operational damage, optimizing maintenance requirements, reducing costs, and improving safety. The IPMDS capability is expected to extend inspection applications to a wide range of industries where improved knowledge of manufacturing variability, induced damage effects, minimization of inspection and replacement costs, and component life extension are important. \r\n",
