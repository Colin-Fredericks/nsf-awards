 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference on the \"Neurobiology of Drosophila\" will convene a group of junior and senior scientists to discuss the latest advances in the neurosciences that are being made in a highly successful model system, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The 2005 conference is the 11th biennial international meeting in a series that focuses on the advances made as the combined power of genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, electrophysiology, imaging and behavioral analysis are brought to bear on fundamental problems in neurobiology. This simple organism can be easily studied and many advances that are made are relevant to the human nervous system.  The topics covered will range from molecular biology to complex behavior and include: nerve cell specification, axon guidance and target recognition, synaptic function, neurophysiology, neuronal cell biology and pathology, and complex behavior (for example, circadian rhythms and learning and memory).  By vote of the previous participants, the meeting will remain of moderate size (430 participants) to facilitate discussion, exchange of ideas and techniques, and to promote new collaborations in this rapidly evolving field.  All applicants will be encouraged to submit an abstract and the majority of participants will either give a talk or present a poster. The speakers will be chosen from the most timely and interesting abstracts submitted a few months in advance of the conference, to ensure that late-breaking science is covered in all of the talks.  In the event that the conference is oversubscribed, participants will be chosen to include at least one representative from each participating laboratory.  This conference has an established history of highlighting the work of younger investigators and women.\r\n\r\n",
