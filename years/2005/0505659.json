 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal has two main scientific components. The first part is a\r\nproject to understand relatively hyperbolic groups and CAT(0) spaces\r\nwith isolated flats, two topics that are tightly connected by previous\r\nwork of the PI with Bruce Kleiner.  The PI plans to continue a joint\r\nproject with Kim Ruane to study the topology of the boundary of a\r\nspace with isolated flats and its relation to group splittings.  The\r\nPI also plans to continue work in progress with Daniel Wise on\r\na-T-menability and its relation to CAT(0) cubical complexes.  In\r\nparticular, they plan to cubulate many classes of hyperbolic and\r\nrelatively hyperbolic groups.\r\nIn second main component, the PI plans to continue a program to study\r\nthe lattice theory of the automorphism group of a simplicial complex,\r\nin a joint project\r\nwith Benson Farb.  This program is at the frontier between geometric\r\ngroup theory and the theory of discrete subgroups of Lie groups and\r\nlinear algebraic groups, and generalizes recent work of Bass--Lubotzky\r\non tree lattices.\r\n\r\nThe PI is interested in the large scale geometry of spaces with\r\nnonpositive curvature.  That is, they have a nontrivial mixture of\r\nnegative curvature (like a saddle) and zero curvature (flat like a\r\npiece of paper), but no positive curvature (like the surface of a\r\nball).  More specifically, his research has focused on nonpositively\r\ncurved spaces with isolated flats.  These spaces are almost negatively\r\ncurved in  the sense that the flat, zero curvature, parts do not\r\ninteract with each other.  Thus techniques from the elegant theory of\r\nnegatively curved spaces can sometimes be adapted to hold for spaces\r\nwith isolated flats.  In a separate project (joint with Benson Farb),\r\nthe PI is studying the symmetries admitted by nonpositively curved\r\nspaces built by gluing together polygons along their edges.  This\r\nproject is an attempt to bridge the gap between the mathematical\r\nfields of geometric group theory and linear algebraic groups.\r\n",
