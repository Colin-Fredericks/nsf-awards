 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will develop a novel radial magnetic field actuator for fully flexible electromagnetic automotive engine valves. Electromagnetic valve actuators are rapidly emerging as the technical solution for improved emissions, fuel consumption and greater engine performance. Dramatic improvement in engine performance and reduction in environmental impact is possible with this technology.  A fully electronically controlled inlet/exhaust valve actuating system eliminates camshafts and other mechanical components completely, thus (1) allowing optimization of the gas-exchange process across the whole engine speed and load range, and (2) eliminating the packaging restrictions placed upon an engine by conventional camshaft profiling. \r\n\r\nThe primary application of the actuator is automotive internal combustion engine valves. The ability to alter the lift and timing (opening and closing) of automotive engine valves will create more powerful engines that require less fuel and create fewer emissions. In fuel savings alone, an estimated 15% savings can be achieved, which equates to saving approximately 475 million barrels of oil per year for US consumption worth approximately $21 billion per year. Improving fuel economy is a worthy national goal: it will reduce America's dependence on imported oil, cut the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming, and increase automotive competitiveness.\r\n",
