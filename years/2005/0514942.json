 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThe present award focuses on the directional mesophase ordering in mixtures of polymers and liquid crystals subjected to intensity gradient created by optical interference during fabrication of active and passive-type holographic polymer dispersed liquid crystals and photonic crystals. Photopolymerization induced phase transition is a phenomenon driven by photochemical reaction, in which directional phase ordering occurs by virtue of light intensity gradient during photo-patterning. The holographic photo-polymerization technique operates based on the principles of optical interference of multiple waves that has been applied to fabrication of holographic polymer dispersed liquid crystals and photonic crystals, as well as development of related electro-optical devices. The electro-optical switching performance and diffraction efficiency of the holographic imaging critically depends on the optimization of the two-phase structure within the stripes and/or arrays of spheres. The dynamics of structure ordering again depends not only on thermodynamics and kinetics of phase transition, but also on the confinement effect caused by the nano-size within these striations. The understanding of nano-science associated with anisotropic phase separation and diffusion within the confined nano-patterns of polymer dispersed liquid crystals based holographic films is of paramount importance for practical applications. The proposed studies entail several trust areas; (i) photopolymerization-induced phase transitions involving phase separation, crystallization, and mesophase ordering, (ii) coarse-grain modeling of non-equilibrium non-linear dynamics of polymer photonic crystal systems containing liquid crystals and conductive organic crystals, (iii) effects of thermal gradient and light intensity gradient on directional ordering, and (iv) confinement effect on microstructure development in 2-D and 3-D photonic band-gap structures.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY \r\nPolymeric photonic band-gap structures operate on a similar principle to that of electronic transistors or semiconductor band-gap materials, except that information is transmitted through light which is faster than electrons, and thus the development of such technology is vital to optical computers and chips for telecommunications. In addition, the proposed studies on the arrays of columnar cavities, if successful, will lead to immediate applications, e.g., (1) fabrication of the microporous contact lens would have high impact on the current market by virtue of excellent oxygen permeability. The microporous arrays, upon filling with water (i.e., tear), would perform like microlens with enhanced vision similar to the compound eyes of some insects and thus the proposed nano-porous films may be used as bio-mimetic membranes. (2) In the case of miscible polymer blends, the refractive index gradient structure can be created to produce thin flat converging lens of optical quality which has great advantageous over the existing converging lens that invariably has convex curvatures. The proposed flat converging lens may be useful for imaging where space is limited. The Principle Investigator's (PI) group will develop a web-based experimentation on holographic imaging as part of the distant-learning program of the Akron Global Polymer Academy AGPA at University of Akron. The enriched morphologies in polymer soft matter share the common origin with a variety of patterns in nature such as snow-flakes, ice crystals, metal welding, and coating growth in electrochemical deposition. Growth of snow-flake-like structures will be demonstrated in life-mode during class-room teaching; this subject matter would be of interest to students of all ages (K12) and also to the general public. The PI's group will continue their collaboration with Dr. Tim Bunning's group at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Although the PI's group is reasonably equipped with the holographic optical equipment (primarily Argon ion laser) and time-resolved light scattering for in-situ monitoring of the diffraction efficiency, the Air Force group is better equipped with UV laser which certainly gives added flexibility in the design and fabrication of photolithography with commercially available photo-curatives and matrix resins. The PI's group has demonstrated capability of theoretical modeling and simulation on the formation of microstructures in holographic polymer dispersed liquid crystals and photonic crystals, which is of immense interest to our counterpart at the Air Force.\r\n",
