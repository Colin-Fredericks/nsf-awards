 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Description for\"The micromechanics of the lateral line system of zebrafish.\"\r\nFish have a sixth sense that detects the flow of water around their bodies. This ability, known as\r\n\"distant touch\" or the lateral line sense, allows fish to find the direction of flow in a stream, detect obstacles\r\nin the dark, coordinate schooling, locate prey, and avoid predators. Despite the broad importance of the\r\nlateral line sense to the behavior and ecology of fish, it is not understood what mechanical information the\r\nlateral line organ extracts from its environment. The work proposed by Dr. McHenry will examine the\r\nmechanics of individual lateral line structures in order to understand how they filter the mechanical signals\r\nthat facilitate flow sensing.\r\nThe lateral line detects water movement with an array of microscopic, finger-like structures that\r\nproject from the surface of the body. Each structure, known as a superficial neuromast, is composed of a\r\ngelatinous cylinder that is anchored at its base to a group of hair cells, which is the type of mechanosensory\r\ncell found in the human ear. Water movement over the body's surface causes a deflection in the neuromast\r\nthat is transduced into a nervous signal by the hair cells. The properties of this signal depend of how much\r\nthe neuromast deflects in response to flow, which depends on its shape and material stiffness.\r\nIn order to examine the mechanics of superficial neuromasts, McHenry and collaborators will use\r\nlarval zebrafish because their transparent bodies allow superficial neuromasts to easily be observed and\r\nmanipulated. By measuring the deflection of neuromasts in response to a push by a force probe, they will\r\ncalculate their material stiffness. The shape of neuromasts will be measured from a series of high-resolution\r\nimages at varying distance away from the body's surface. These measurements will provide the basis of a\r\nmathematical model that treats the neuromast as a flexible beam anchored to a stiff spring.\r\nThis model will allow investigators to consider how flow speed affects the signals filtered by the\r\nneuromasts and how different neuromast shapes and their position on the body affects the signals that they\r\ndetect. With this understanding for the mechanics of superficial neuromasts, neurobiologists and\r\nbehavioral biologists may consider what mechanical signals the lateral line system uses for schooling,\r\nobstacle avoidance, and predator/prey interactions.",
