First, fundamental research on \"bio-inspired\" catalysts will be performed using state-of-the-art molecular simulations to understand the behavior of these biological components in fuel cells. Second, undergraduate and graduate students will conduct competitive research in this area by designing and implementing a novel course, \"Introduction to Nano/Bio Systems Modeling.\" This course will be geared toward the application of molecular modeling techniques to stimulate the student discovery process and to stimulate inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning. Finally, research and education will be effectively integrated through a learning kit designed by students for students, educators, and a general audience as part of a final project. \r\n\r\nThe project will serve to complement the ongoing collaborative efforts on nano/bio-technology-related doctoral, master, and baccalaureate degree programs to enhance teaching and research quality within the College of Engineering and Science (COES) at Louisiana Tech (Tech). \"Introduction to Nano/Bio Systems Modeling\", a technical elective course in Chemical Engineering, will also serve the multiple degree programs in Tech's highly interdisciplinary environment. Learning kits and \"in vivo\" demonstrations of computational research activities will be distributed to: (a) teachers during the teacher preparation programs currently administered at Tech, (b) students during Engineer's Day and K-12 programs at Tech, and (c) a general audience through a web page specially designed to disseminate the outcomes of \"Introduction to Nano/Bio-Systems Modeling\". These educational activities will have a direct impact on K-12, high school, and prospective students from small rural and small town schools around Tech's region, contributing to increase teacher quality, improve classroom instruction, provide additional support for teachers and students, and ultimately improve student achievement. Moreover, the proposed project will reach rural high school women, increasing their opportunities to learn about the excitement of science in engineering research.\r\n\r\n",
