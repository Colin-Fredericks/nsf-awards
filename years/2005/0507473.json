The\r\ntechnique employed here allows the astrophysics of this region to be probed by the polarization\r\nproperties of the silicon monoxide maser components located in the extended atmospheres via\r\nsynoptic imaging campaigns across complete pulsation periods of the central star. Here Very Long\r\nBaseline Array observations of maser emissions in the near-circumstellar regions of asymptotic\r\ngiant branch (evolved) stars will be carried out. The goal is to provide constraints on various\r\nastrophysical models by: 1) measuring the magnitudes and orientation of magnetic fields in the\r\nextended atmospheres, 2) determining whether asymmetric mass loss begins at an early phase of\r\nasymptotic giant branch evolution, and 3) exploring the possible connection between the central\r\nstars and their close circumstellar environments. A series of specific research tasks (and associated\r\nsub-tasks) are outlined which employ synoptic maser observations over entire pulsation cycles to\r\n(among other goals) map kinematics and shocks, to use polarization and population inversion to\r\ninfer magnetic fields and turbulence, and to discriminate between various models for polarized\r\nmaser propagation and silicon oxide maser pumping. The latter studies are vital in order to provide\r\nunambiguous estimates of the surface magnetic fields in these stars. The results of this work are\r\nexpected to have an impact on studies of the physics of maser polarization, models of evolved stars\r\nand the process of planetary nebula formation.\r\n\r\nThis work will help to train graduate students in the data reduction methods and analysis. In\r\naddition, the animated movies of maser emission toward late-type stars which are a by-product of\r\nthis research, will be disseminated to the public through various outreach efforts. The final steps\r\nnecessary to automate fully the existing calibration and imaging pipeline, which will be developed\r\nhere, will also be available to the community. This will sharply lower access barriers to the Very\r\nLong Baseline Array.",
