 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal deals with the long term behavior of RWRE (random walks in \r\nrandom environments). More precisely, one looks at random walks on the \r\nd-dimensional lattice, whose transition probabilities form a random field \r\nindexed by the vertices of the lattice. Not only is the RWRE providing a \r\nserious mathematical challenge, many of the results proved in this field, \r\nespecially in the one dimensional case, stand in sharp contrast with the \r\nbehavior of classical random walk. For example, in dimension 1, \r\nsubdiffusive behavior and aging phenomena are present, whereas in high \r\ndimension one may construct RWRE's with nonzero (averaged) local drift \r\npointing in one direction while the walk drifts away (with positive speed) \r\nin the opposite direction. Some of the mathematical challenge emanates \r\nfrom the fact that in the multidimensional case, conditioned on the \r\ntransition probabilities random field, the RWRE is not reversible. This \r\nprecludes the use of much of the available theory of homogenization, and \r\nrequires the development of new techniques, most notably through the use \r\nof regeneration times and of renormalization ideas. In spite of rapid \r\nprogress that was achieved in the last few years by several researchers \r\nincluding Bolthausen, Sznitman, Varadhan, Zerner, and the PI, many \r\nfundamental questions remain unanswered. Among these one notes the \r\nexistence of 0-1 laws, laws of large numbers in full generality, \r\ntransience and recurrence criteria, the relation between quenched and \r\nannealed large deviations behavior, the existence (or non-existence) of \r\nsub-diffusive behavior for high dimension, and the behavior of RWRE's in \r\nmixing (as opposed to i.i.d.) environments.\r\n\r\n\r\nRandom walks are arguably the stochastic processes most studied by \r\nmathematicians, having the widest range of applications in fields as \r\ndiverse as the physical sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. \r\nThough the theory of random walks is by now well developed, this is not at \r\nall the case when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a \r\nrandom medium, thus obtaining a random walk in random environment (RWRE). \r\nSuch RWRE's can be used to model many problems of motion in random media \r\nin the physical and engineering sciences, and are mathematically appealing \r\nbecause on the one hand the model is very simply stated, while on the \r\nother hand established tools for studying processes in random media are \r\nnot applicable in the study of RWRE. The goal of the current proposal is \r\nto develop new basic probabilistic techniques that will allow to make \r\nprovable predictions concerning the behavior of RWRE. It is expected that \r\nsuch techniques will be useful in the study of other processes, and link \r\nnaturally to the study of trapping models and reinforced random walks. \r\nWhile not explicitly targeted in this proposal, trapping models have \r\nrecently been used to study the environmental impact of nuclear waste, and \r\nRWRE's can naturally be used in this context to model the spread of \r\ncontamination in a real environment, once the required mathematical \r\nbackground and tools are in place.\r\n",
