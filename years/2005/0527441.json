These large showy butterflies are popular in butterfly houses, and link two regions of the globe: the Neotropics and Old-World tropics.  Some of these butterflies are vertically stratified between forest canopy and forest understory, many are active only at dawn and dusk, and most have complex male scent organs and sexual displays.  Despite their intriguing biological characteristics, little is known about the evolutionary history of these butterflies. This study combines fieldwork in Brazil, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea, plus comparative morphology and natural history to reconstruct the phylogeny (genealogical tree) of these butterfly groups. \r\nPhylogenetic information provides a means of evaluating ecological and evolutionary patterns, and serves as a crucial link among disciplines within biology.  For example, flight height in the canopy or understory is established for many species of Morphinae and Brassolinae, and suspected in the Amathusiinae.  Establishing the genealogical relationships within these groups allows us to assess whether canopy and understory habitats provided an ecological opportunity for species diversification, to explore the flight physiology among species, and to evaluate if these groups are informative for testing prevailing theories in ecology and conservation biology. This project provides educational training in field sampling methods, species identification, and conservation issues for local colleagues and students in Brazil, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea.  The results will be disseminated in scientific and popular journals and talks, and made available to distance learning labs and museum exhibits.\r\n",
