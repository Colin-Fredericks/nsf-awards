 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long-term, sustainable collaboration is proposed between the Maryland Science Center and the Johns Hopkins University to develop research-based content for Science Center exhibits and programming. Although the request is for funding to work on specific exhibits, the thrust of this proposal focuses on the anticipated lessons learned during the training of graduate student interns, as well as the evaluation, design, and implementation of exhibits. These initial experiences will be used to develop an effective mechanism for sustaining a reliable pipeline between the two institutions, through which student interns will work to create research-based exhibits beyond the period of IPSE startup funding.\r\n\r\nA three-phase plan has been devised to create the building blocks of a long-term collaboration. In Phase 1, graduate-student interns will focus on three specific projects. These projects will cover a broad array of MPS disciplines (Materials Science, Astronomy, and Particle Physics) and will represent three very different levels of readiness for exhibit creation.  A process will be identified for each of these levels of readiness, so that future interns will be able to follow a roadmap and collaborate successfully. Each project in Phase 1 will involve one graduate student intern working together with a faculty member and professionals at the Science Center.   In Phase 2, focus will shift to three new projects, using the insights gathered on the Phase 1 projects. Phase 2 will be funded by public outreach budgets from existing research grants, and will demonstrate that a sustainable model has been achieved. In Phase 3 (well beyond the period of IPSE funding), the program will be expanded to include intern positions for undergraduate students.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact. The intent is to create a model that can be shared broadly so that other institutions can benefit from the process that is developed. A strategy has been devised to disseminate the results of the study to four groups: JHU research investigators, investigators at other universities, other museums, and K-12 teachers.  The initial collaboration with the Maryland Science Center is viewed as a first step towards a more meaningful and larger-scale collaboration. \r\n\r\n",
