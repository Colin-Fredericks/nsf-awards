 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe proposal seeks financial support for the technical symposium \"Coupled non-linear\r\nphenomena: Modeling and simulation for smart, ferroic and multiferroic materials\" to be\r\nheld at the MRS Spring Meeting 2005 in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe symposium addresses the field of multi-ferroic materials like, e.g., ferroelectrics,\r\nferromagnetics, magnetostrictive materials, shape memory alloys, ferromagnetic shape\r\nmemory alloys, which are increasingly being used as active materials actuators and\r\nsensors in structural systems across many scales from micro level (MEMS) to macro\r\nlevel (smart aero space and civil systems). The symposium has a strongly interdisciplinary focus, combining current modeling efforts with recent experimental\r\nresults and applications, and is expected to cross-fertilize research activities in all three\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThe organizers have strived to bring together well-known international experts in the\r\nfield and the intent is to give an overview the current state-of-the-art of this important\r\nmulti-disciplinary field. It is our vision to establish this symposium as a regular part of\r\nthe MRS meeting, and we made an effort to attract high-quality researchers to help the\r\nsymposium to a good start. Funds are intended to provide partial support for the invited speakers as well as for graduate students.\r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impact, papers from the symposium will be published as part of the\r\nMRS proceedings of this conference after a peer review process. Additionally, the best\r\npapers will be published as a special issue of the Springer journal Continuum Mechanics\r\n",
