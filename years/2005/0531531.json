The intellectual merits of this project are embedded in the identification of high impact research issues of mutual interest to the U.S. and China in the area of advanced sensing systems, mechatronics and smart structures technologies, and in strengthening the U.S.-China network for conducting joint collaborative studies to address these research issues for the benefit of the research community and general public in the two countries. The workshop is designed to have a broad impact in the areas of integrated sensor systems, mechatronics and smart structure technologies for aerospace, civil and mechanical systems through international collaborations both in terms of research and education. The workshop will invite, and make every effort to include, the participation of young and underrepresented groups of researchers to enhance the diversity of representation and their involvement in scientific activities. \r\n",
