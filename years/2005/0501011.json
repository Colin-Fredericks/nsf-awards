 "awd_abstract_narration": "The core of an ideal in a commutative ring encodes information about all\r\npossible reductions of the ideal. It also has a close connection to\r\nBriancon-Skoda type theorems and to a conjecture by Kawamata about\r\nsections of line bundles. The proposer intends to further explore this\r\ninterplay by studying the relation between cores and adjoints or\r\nmultiplier ideals. Having worked on a formula for the core in\r\nequicharacteristic zero, he wishes to obtain a similar explicit expression\r\nin positive characteristic, where the shape of the core is markedly\r\ndifferent. Likewise he would like to find a combinatorial description for\r\nthe core of monomial ideals. The investigator plans to continue his work\r\non blowup algebras of ideals, most notably of zero-dimensional ideals in\r\nregular local rings. He asks whether the quasi-Gorenstein property of the\r\nextended Rees algebra implies the Gorensteinness of the associated graded\r\nring. He also suggests that the normality or Cohen-Macaulayness of the\r\nspecial fiber ring of a Gorenstein ideal may force the ideal to be a\r\ncomplete intersection. On a more computational note, he addresses the\r\nproblem of constructing the integral closure of algebras, in particular of\r\nRees algebras. Passing to the integral closure of the Rees algebra of an\r\nideal is the first step towards resolution of singularities and the only\r\nknown general method for computing the integral closure of the ideal. The\r\nproposer wishes to estimate the complexity of this process by finding bounds\r\non the number of generators of the integral closure, the degrees of the\r\ngenerators and the number of steps required in the computation. As another\r\nmeasure of complexity he plans to study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity\r\nof powers and symmetric powers of homogeneous ideals having dimension at\r\nmost one. He expects that estimates on the regularity do not only persist\r\nwhen the ideal is raised to powers, but that they actually improve. Similar\r\nimproved bounds for the regularity of symmetric powers would help finding\r\nthe equations of Rees algebras and thereby lead to efficient algorithms in\r\nelimination theory. The proposer also intends to continue his work on\r\ngeneralized principal ideal theorems. The goal is to bound the codimension\r\nand prove connectedness properties for degeneracy loci of maps of modules\r\nthat are not necessarily free; here one has to assume that the maps are not\r\n`too generic'. The investigator proposes a weak version of this condition\r\nby introducing a notion of ampleness for modules over local rings. He\r\nhopes to prove principal ideal theorems that only require the weaker\r\nassumption, thus generalizing the known results in both local algebra and\r\nprojective geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigator works in Commutative Algebra, an area concerned with the\r\nqualitative study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables.\r\nSuch systems arise in numerous applications outside of mathematics. Over\r\nthe past two decades commutative algebraists have become increasingly\r\ninterested in computational aspects, thereby emphasizing connections to\r\napplied areas such as computer algebra, robotics, cryptography and coding\r\ntheory. This investigator's research too has a strong computational\r\ncomponent.\r\nPart of the project involving the  collaboration with mathematicians in Brazil is funded by the NSF\r\nOffice of International Science and Engineering \r\n",
