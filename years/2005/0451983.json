 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Title: The Generation of Geo-Referenced Video Mosaics in Support of Submersible and ROV Operations\r\n\r\nProject Summary\r\n\r\nThe PIs propose to develop an easy-to-use software package for PCbased computers that is tailored to convert video imagery acquired from any underwater vehicle, operated within both absolute or relative navigation networks, and quickly produce a set of geo-referenced photomosaics, whichcan then be directly layered within a Geographic Information System (GIS). In developing this software, we hope to enable those collecting video imagery to quantitatively explore relatively large areas of the seafloor in the same way that land-based processes can be observed through aerial photographs or satellite imagery. The initial approach will be to develop a system that is suited to efficiently process video imagery from deep submergence vehicle dives. Their objective will be to use and refine the proposed software developed by the UNH group and generate geo-referenced mosaics within a few hours so that subsequent diving and sampling programs can be optimized. They will focus on establishing a robust, and well-documented software suite that will permit video mosaicking by a wide range of personnel. The processing approach proposed will also be equally applicable to the large amounts of video data already collected and sitting in archives at numerous oceanographic institutions and with past users of deep submergence vehicle systems. To test the mosaicking system for near-real-time application, the PIs propose to construct video mosaics at sea during two upcoming cruises. The PIs have assembled a multi-disciplinary group of scientists to test the mosaicking system and apply it to questions relevant to marine geology and marine biology at mid-ocean ridges, including the integrated measurements of vent fluid chemistry and sampling of vent communities on successive dives with the submersible Alvin at the EPR ISS. Shore-based analyses of near-real-time and legacy mosaics will be used to aid in the interpretation of temporal changes in community structure at EPR vents visited repeatedly over the past decade. Geo-referenced video mosaics will be incorporated into a GIS currently developed for the Galapagos Rift and the EPR ISS.",
