 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Collaborative Project of theoretical/computational research on strongly coupled plasmas \t\twill be continued by Boston College (BC; Dr. Gabor J. Kalman, Principal Investigator) and \t\tthe University of Vermont (UVM; Dr. Kenneth I. Golden, Principal Investigator).\r\n\r\nStrong Coulomb interactions are featured by a variety of physical systems. Of primary interest are laboratory dusty plasmas, charged particles confined in cryogenic traps and storage rings, layered charged particle systems in semiconductor quantum wells, and astrophysical plasmas (giant planetary and white dwarf interiors, e.g.). The joint BC/UVM research project will focus on these systems.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research addresses some of the major theoretical issues related to\r\nExperiments in strongly coupled systems: correlation and static structure functions, \t\t\tthermodynamics (equation of state and phase boundaries), dielectric response and \t\t\tcollective mode behavior. Similar issues arise in multi-layer semiconductor plasmas whose \t\tconsideration also forms a part of the proposed work.\r\n\r\nThe main approach to be used in the proposed investigations relies on a series of works by \t\tthe Principal Investigators in which a method especially appropriate for the description of the \t\tdynamical behavior of strongly coupled (correlated) plasmas was worked out. This method, \t\treferred to as the Quasi-Localized Charge Approximation, was used in the previous funding \t\tperiods and has provided theoretical, transparent models for the interpretation of laboratory \t\texperiments and computer simulations. This analytical work will be paralleled by molecular \t\tdynamics simulations done in collaboration with a research group of the Hungarian \t\t\tAcademy of Sciences (Budapest)].\r\n",
