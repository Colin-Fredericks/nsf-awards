 "awd_abstract_narration": "In higher plants, the division of the zygote is asymmetric and establishes two fundamentally different cell types: the smaller daughter of the zygote assumes an embryonic cell-fate, while the larger daughter forms the mainly extra-embryonic suspensor. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the signaling events responsible for this fundamental cell-fate decision. Previous work by the P.I. has led to the discovery of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase gene, YDA, that functions as part of a molecular switch to regulate extra-embryonic cell fates. This project will further characterize the YDA signal transduction pathway in the model plant Arabidopsis by: (1) characterizing the receptor-like protein kinase gene SSP, which is predicted to link YDA function to the activation of a cell surface receptor, with standard methods of molecular biology and histology; (2) identifying as yet unknown components of the signaling chain with genetic and biochemical approaches. This research will elucidate a fundamental aspect of plant embryonic development with potentially important results for the efficient production of plant embryos and seedlings in culture. The project will provide training opportunities for a postdoctoral researcher as well as undergraduate and high school students in cutting edge molecular biology and genetics.",
