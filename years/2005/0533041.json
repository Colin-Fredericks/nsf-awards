 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proliferation of Internet technologies, services and devices, have made the current networked system designs, and management tools incapable of designing reliable, secure networked systems and services. In fact, we have reached a level of complexity, heterogeneity, and dynamism that our information infrastructureis becoming unmanageable and insecure.  A series of preceeding workshops have focused on the research issues and challenges facing the development of\r\nautonomic computing systems. The objectives of this conference are two-fold. First, by bringing together researchers in this field, this meeting  further understand and address the challenging research issues facing the development and deployment of autonomic systems and applications and support dynamic, data-driven application systems, i.e., applications that dynamically interact with others by sharing processing and data in novel ways. Second, its output can be helpful in focusing  and crystallizing potential  directions  of future NSF emphasis areas  to maximize the scientific and technological returns  from those research investments.\r\n\r\n",
