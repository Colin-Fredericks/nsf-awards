 "awd_abstract_narration": "The formation of memories in the brain is thought to involve the strengthening of connections between brain cells.  To accomplish this strengthening, brain cells need to communicate with each other via chemical signals.  The major aim of this project is to investigate the contribution of one such chemical signal: nitric oxide.  The role of nitric oxide signaling will be investigated in a behavioral paradigm called fear conditioning.  In this paradigm, an animal comes to learn to fear an initially emotionally neutral stimulus or object after it has been presented together with the presentation of a noxious or an aversive stimulus.  Fear conditioning is known to involve alterations between brain cells in the amygdala, a specific region of the brain's temporal lobe.  This project will use biochemical techniques to examine nitric oxide signaling in the amygdala during and after fear conditioning.  Other experiments will employ behavioral and electrophysiological recording techniques to examine the role of nitric oxide and its targets in the formation of fear memories in the amygdala.  Collectively, these experiments will add further to our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying learning and memory in the amygdala.  Further, the projects will provide an ideal training opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students in a number of different neurobiological techniques, leaving them well prepared for advanced study in the Neurosciences.",
