 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports theoretical research on fundamental issues related\r\nto the implementation of quantum computation in solid-state\r\ndevices. Since the discovery that certain tasks could be performed\r\nwith great efficiency by algorithms based on quantum mechanics, an\r\nintense effort has been made to find suitable quantum\r\nhardware. Although several proposed implementations, such as those\r\nbased on nuclear magnetic resonance and atomic trapping, have passed\r\nthe proof-of-principle, few-qubit phase, the path to achieving a\r\nreliable multi-qubit quantum computer is still undefined.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal we investigate the physical limitations to resilient\r\ncomputation with solid-state quantum bits (qubits), such as\r\nsemiconductor quantum dots and superconductor junctions. While\r\nsolid-state qubits seem easily scalable from the fabrication\r\nviewpoint, they also present high decoherence rates as compared to\r\nother implementations. One major concern is that such strong \r\ndecoherence may lead to errors occurring at a rate too large to \r\nbe controlled.\r\n\r\nHowever, differently from other nuclear, atomic, and optical qubits, \r\nthe interaction of solid-state quantum devices with the environment \r\ncan introduce strong memory effects. As a result, temporal correlations \r\nmay appear during the operation of multi-qubit systems. Current quantum \r\nerror correction codes are not designed to cope with this situation, \r\nwhich may then invalidate any error threshold estimate for solid-state \r\nqubits based on the efficiency of those codes.\r\n\r\nWe will explore these issues in a comprehensive way. Starting from a\r\nthorough study of the mechanisms of decoherence in single- and\r\ndouble-qubit systems, we will study a model of multi-qubit systems in\r\nthe presence of correlated noise in a variety of realistic\r\nconditions. Our results will help set up new strategies for the\r\noperation of multi-qubit systems. They will also let us understand\r\nwhat are the constraints that error correction codes will need to\r\nsatisfy in order to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation in\r\nlarge-scale solid state implementations. To achieve our goals, we have\r\nput together a team of researchers with expertise in nanoscale physics \r\nand computer science. The final outcome of our project will be a much\r\nbetter understanding of how a real solid-state quantum computer would\r\nbehave.\r\n\r\n",
