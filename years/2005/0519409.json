The tsunami generated by the earthquake in Sumatra hit the northern, eastern and southern coastlines of the island. The rapid movement of saline water inland due to massive waves has impacted water supply sources and other natural resources in the coastal regions. A technical field team associated with a voluntary project on well decontamination coordinated by the PI is currently involved in desalination and mapping of wells in the northeast and southern coastlines.   Initial assessment indicates that that in some of the wells the water level has risen by almost a meter and the indications are that a subsurface salt front has propagated into the aquifer. In any future strategies for development and use of groundwater, it is necessary to get an assessment of both short-term and long-term effects of the tsunami on the water quality of these coastal aquifers. To our knowledge, there has not been a well-coordinated effort to evaluate the impact of tsunami on groundwater resources. Clearly, an urgent need exists to assess the situation in the field to identify science and technical issues to help to develop future strategies for groundwater use in the areas that are directly affected by the tsunami and also has the potential to be affected in the future. Funds are requested to assemble an expert panel of groundwater scientists to visit and provide an assessment of tsunami impacts on water supplies in coastal aquifers in Sri Lanka.  The panel includes researchers from US universities, federal research laboratories, and US Geological Survey and state agencies.  Some panel members are familiar with the conditions in the region through their past and ongoing research activities and collaborations. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this visiting panel from the US is to provide expertise on the assessment and restoration of groundwater resources impacted by tsunami in Sri Lanka's coastal regions.  However, it is expected that the experience gained from this effort will be broadly applicable for managing other costal aquifers in Indonesia and India. The panel will visit the affected areas in the northeast and southeast in Sri Lanka.  They will meet with local researchers in universities and other governmental and non-governmental agencies to study and assess the impact of the tsunami. The panel plans to spend a week in Sri Lanka visiting the affected areas and other information gathering activities. The current methods, technologies and the strategies that are used to assess the extent and complexity of the problem will be evaluated. Any phenomena that have not been observed or recorded in the past in relation to saltwater intrusion and flow in aquifers will be identified. A workshop at a central location for the panel to exchange, share, and gather information related to the problem will be organized with the assistance of local collaborators from universities, water agencies and international and non-governmental agencies. The technical needs where US scientific community can assist local scientists and engineers will be identified. Existing data will be reviewed for data gaps. Future data needs will be identified and recommendations for strategies for collecting and processing new data using new technologies will be made. Existing technical capabilities will be assessed and areas where   immediate and long-term training are required will be identified. The panel's assessments and findings of the effect of tsunami on coastal aquifers and recommendations on action and future activities will be included in a report that will be submitted to NSF as a deliverable. It is our expectation that the panel's findings will help to identify areas of research and possible technical collaboration with US scientists. The local scientist and planners will benefit from recommendations that will be made for both short-term and long-term strategies needed for assessment and restoration of ground water supplies in coastal regions of Sri Lanka. \r\n",
