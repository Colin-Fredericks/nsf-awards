 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the numerical solution of partial \r\ndifferential equations, as applied to layered models of ocean \r\ncirculation.  Particular issues that are addressed include the \r\nfollowing.  (1)  Develop numerical methods for applying the spatial \r\n``B-grid'' to layered models with vanishing layers, and compare this \r\ngrid to the ``C-grid'' in such situations.  Each of these grids is a \r\nstaggered grid for which the mass variables and velocity components are \r\ndefined at different locations.  Presently, the B-grid is widely used \r\nin z-coordinate models, whereas layered models more typically use the \r\nC-grid.   Of particular interest in the present project are behavior \r\nnear variable bottom topography and the possible generation of grid \r\nnoise.  These issues have interfered with previous attempts to use the \r\nB-grid with layered models, but the B-grid nevertheless has attractive \r\nproperties that warrant consideration.  (2)  Compare different \r\nformulations of the momentum equation for numerical discretization, and \r\ncompare different advection methods for solving the equations for mass \r\nand momentum.  One issue of interest is the nature of the nonlinear \r\ninteractions within the discrete system.  The choice of numerical \r\nscheme is also influenced by the need to transport multiple scalar \r\nfields simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe overall purpose of this work is to improve the algorithms that are \r\nused in computer simulations of ocean circulation.  The ocean plays a \r\ncrucial role in the global climate system, and a better understanding \r\nof that system relies in part on numerical simulations of the ocean's \r\ncirculation over long periods of time.   The investigator has developed \r\nan improved time-stepping method and related algorithms, and the \r\npresent project represents further work towards the goal of improving \r\nthe accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of the algorithms that are \r\nused in numerical models of ocean circulation.  The investigator has \r\nextensive contacts with practicing ocean modelers who provide valuable \r\ninsights to help guide this research.\r\n",
