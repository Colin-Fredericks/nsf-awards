In 2005, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held August 7-12, 2005 at the Tilton School in New Hampshire.  The theme of the conference will be \"Changing Views of Ocean Chemistry Overlain on a Changing Ocean\" which emphasizes the need to understand environmental variability and reversing degradation of coastal/open ocean waters.  Presentations and discussion at the 2005 Gordon Conference will center around the following session topics: (1) CO2 induced changes in ocean calcification; (2) land-ocean interactions; (3) science from sensors; (4) coastal-open ocean connections; (5) oceanic iron: concentrations and isotope compositions; (6) anaerobic biogeochemistry; (7) crustal recycling and fluxes; (8) biomolecules, speciation and paleo-proxies; and (9) reconstructing the chemistry of past oceans.  The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary filed of marine chemistry and forge new scientific alliances.  For this reason, the National Science Foundation, along with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of 30 graduate student/post docs and 31 invited speakers/discussion leaders in the 2005 Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference.\r\n\r\n",
