 "awd_abstract_narration": "Patterns of import protection and export promotion vary widely across countries. So do\r\nmethods of industry support. Part of this variation reflects differences in economic structure and\r\nin the political organization and activities of industry interest groups. But political institutions\r\nmatter as well. Whereas much recent research has focused on the relationships between voters,\r\ninterest groups, and politicians that help determine trade policy in a particular political setting,\r\nmuch less is known about the role that political institutions play in the formation of trade policy.\r\nIn this project, the principal investigators will examine how variation in political institutions\r\ntranslates into predictable and testable differences in the structure and form of trade protection\r\nand industry support.\r\nComparative politics is, of course, one of the core fields in political science, where it has a long\r\nand venerable tradition. But, whereas political scientists often focus on the implications of\r\ndifferent political institutions for political outcomes . such as the number of political parties that\r\nare active in a country, the stability of the government, and the representation of minority groups\r\n. the principal investigators will address the effects on economic policy outcomes. By studying\r\nthe comparative politics of trade policies, they will contribute importantly to the analysis of\r\npolitical regimes. The existing formal models of presidential and parliamentary democracies are\r\nquite rudimentary and do not allow for political parties and interest groups as distinct participants\r\nin the political process. The principal investigators will develop extensions of the formal theory\r\nthat will add significantly to its realism and domain.\r\nThe principal investigators are well known for their earlier research on the political economy of\r\ntrade policy. That work, published in numerous articles and two books, focuses on the role that\r\nspecial interest groups play in the policy process. Whereas the earlier research assumed a\r\nparticular, stylized political regime with a given set of institutions, the principal investigators now\r\nintend to re-focus their analysis on a comparison of outcomes in different political settings.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to our understanding of trade policy formation and of the\r\nimportance of political institutions. The principal investigators will investigate how trade policies\r\ndepend on the strength of party discipline, how outcomes differ in presidential versus\r\nparliamentary political systems, how trade policies are affected by electoral rules and by the\r\norganization of the trade bureaucracy. Moreover, they will examine how the institutional setting\r\naffects the incentives facing industry lobby groups and will ask which institutional arrangements\r\nare best able to generate policies that serve the general interest of the polity. Thus, the project\r\nwill help identify characteristics of the institutional setting and trade bureaucracy that can\r\ncontribute to the formation of better trade policies.\r\nThe project also will develop new conceptual tools that will help other researchers study the\r\ndemocratic policy process for a wider range of economic policies. The results will be\r\ndisseminated widely to the research communities in the social sciences via journal publication\r\nand participation in national and international conferences. The authors plan to integrate graduate\r\nstudents into the project; they will help to assemble data, check the analytical results, and prepare\r\ncomputer simulation models. In this way, the project will promote the education of the next\r\ngeneration of researchers in economics and political science.",
