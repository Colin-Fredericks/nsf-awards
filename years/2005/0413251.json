 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores new locomotion techniques that will enable\r\nrobotic systems to recover from a variety of failures. The primary\r\nfocus is on a class of robot locomotion termed dynamically coupled\r\nlocomotion. The most familiar forms of locomotion, such as human\r\nwalking or automobile rolling, employ kinematic coupling.  But\r\nlocomotory systems are subject to error conditions such as falling or\r\nbecoming high-centered.  Recovery from such errors sometimes requires\r\nlocomotion modes that, while less efficient, are nonetheless essential\r\nto the robustness and overall competence of the robotic system. One\r\nexample would be a six-legged robot that has become high-centered on\r\nan obstacle such that its legs no longer reach the ground -- by\r\naggressively moving its legs it is possible to excite vibration modes\r\nthat cause the robot to gradually move off of the obstacle.  The\r\nspecific goal of this project is to explore the theoretical and\r\npractical capabilities of such locomotion modes, to survey their\r\npotential application in mobile robotic systems, and to demonstrate\r\ntheir usefulness in real robots.  The main theoretical thrust of the\r\nwork is to characterize the motion capabilities of dynamically coupled\r\nlocomotion, and to synthesize motion patterns for mobile robots to\r\nrecover from errors.  Experimental and simulation work will serve to\r\ndemonstrate and validate the research.  Surveys of mobile robot\r\nstructures and failure modes will provide context and grounding to\r\nassess the potential usefulness of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
