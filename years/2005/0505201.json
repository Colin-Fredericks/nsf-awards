This work is motivated in part\r\nby the need to more effectively compare survival distributions in \r\nclinical trials and cohort studies.\r\nMethods of finding confidence intervals for split points, as \r\nrepresented by jumps in  parametric regression models within\r\nbroader semiparametric models, are also being investigated.  This \r\ninvolves developing cube-root asymptotics for hybrid likelihood \r\nmethods. A new  confidence set is constructed by inverting a\r\nhybrid likelihood ratio statistic.  This part of the project is \r\nmotivated by an application to the development  of a phosphorus \r\nthreshold standard for the Everglades. Finally, hybrid  likelihood  \r\ntechniques are being  developed for use in HIV vaccine efficacy trials \r\nin which it is important to take into account dependence of the \r\nrelative risk of infection  on the divergence of infecting HIV viruses.\r\n\r\nHybrid likelihood provides a unified way of looking at techniques\r\nthat adapt a nonparametric likelihood based approach in some way, for \r\nexample through the use of plug-in estimates for nuisance parameters, \r\nor by the use of a likelihood derived from a working (but not \"true\") \r\nmodel. The use of hybrid likelihood has become increasingly\r\ncommon in recent years and is attractive in many applied areas because \r\nit combines the power of likelihood based methods with a pragmatic \r\nsense of the need to find  tractable and easily implemented\r\nsolutions to complex statistical problems.  The investigator is \r\nextending the scope of hybrid likelihood  methods in a variety of \r\nsettings.  Methodological work is conducted on three specific topics:\r\nempirical likelihood with applications in survival analysis,\r\nconfidence intervals for split points with application to the  \r\nestimation of pollution thresholds, and comparison of mark-specific \r\nrelative risks with application to the  detection of\r\nviral divergence in HIV vaccine efficacy trials.\r\n\r\n",
