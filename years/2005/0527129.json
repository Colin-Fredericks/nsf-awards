 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWe are submitting this proposal to request NSF support for a Quantum Control Summer\r\nSchool, to be held 8-14 August 2005 at the California Institute of Technology. This\r\nschool is being organized in response to burgeoning interest among physicists, engineers\r\nand applied mathematicians in exploring the principles and applications of control in\r\nsystems whose behavior is manifestly quantum mechanical. The lectures will be addressed\r\nmainly to graduate students and senior researchers who are just getting started in the\r\nfield, but will include some advanced presentations to provide some perspective on\r\nresearch frontiers. We have already secured seed funding for the summer school from\r\nCaltech's initiative in Information Science and Technology, but we are seeking additional\r\nsupport from government agencies including the NSF and AFOSR.\r\nIntellectual merit: Control theory is a central discipline in modern engineering, but so\r\nfar there has been only preliminary research on extending its constitutive methodologies\r\nto incorporate quantum dynamics and measurement. Applications areas for quantum control\r\ntheory range from protein structure determination to precision measurement and metrology,\r\nand deep connections have been identified with the field of quantum computation. We\r\nanticipate that this summer school can play a critical role in stimulating the development\r\nof quantum control, as it has the enthusiastic support of important constituencies in\r\ncontrol theory, mathematical physics, atomic physics, quantum optics and condensed matter\r\nphysics.\r\nBroader impact: This summer school will provide a unique educational experience for both\r\nstudents and senior researchers who attend. Its topic is inherently interdisciplinary and\r\nhas sufficiently strong intellectual appeal to draw the attention of leading researchers\r\nin both engineering and pure physics. It seems reasonable to hope that events of this\r\nkind will spur a synthesis of quantum physics, dynamical systems theory and probability\r\ntheory in the same way that early workshops on quantum computation facilitated the\r\ndevelopment of a common language for physicists and computer scientists.",
