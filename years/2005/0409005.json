 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research consists of 3 main items. The first item aims to \r\nmake use of the noncommutative geometry framework in order to\r\nreformulate the index formula in CR and contact geometry.  It also fits \r\nnicely with the long term program of\r\nFefferman and Stein and others aiming to relate the subelliptic \r\nanalysis of the Kohn-Rossi to the CR geometry of the\r\nunderlying manifold. Moreover, it has some overlap with recent work of\r\nEpstein-Melrose-Mendoza. This project has two natural follow-ups. One \r\nin collaboration with\r\nHenri Moscovici dealing with an index formula for strictly pseudoconvex \r\ndomains relating the subelliptic\r\nanalysis of the dbar-Neuman problem with  the geometry of the domain \r\nand its boundary. The other\r\none aims to study Lorentzian manifolds with Fefferman metric from a \r\nnoncommutative geometric viewpoint, hence\r\nis a first step towards a general noncommutative geometric study of \r\nLorentzian manifolds. The second item is\r\n  a joint project with George Marinescu and\r\ndeals with obtaining CR analogues of the holomorphic Morse inequalities \r\nof Demailly\r\nin order to get embedding theorems for CR and complex manifolds. The \r\nlast item proposes to\r\nto develop a geometrically adapted hypoelliptic calculus on equiregular\r\nCarnot-Carath\\'eodory manifolds in order to be able to make use of the \r\nnoncommutative geometry framework in this\r\nsetting and to solve the Yamabe problem on contact quaternionic \r\nmanifolds.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this proposal is at two levels. The first level \r\nis within mathematics but outside the scope of\r\nnoncommutative geometry which is the primary field of the PI. On the \r\none hand, it is proposed to make use of\r\nthe framework of Connes' noncommutative geometry for solving\r\ngeometric problems related to CR, contact and complex manifolds. On the \r\nother hand, the pseudodifferential tools\r\nof the part (iii) of this proposal will provide a powerful tool  for \r\nstudying hypoelliptic PDE's.\r\nThe second level is that of other sciences. First, at illustrated by \r\nits part on Lorentzian geometry this proposal\r\naims to contribute to the compelling program of unifying quantum \r\nmechanics and\r\ngravity, hence should contribute to a better understanding of the \r\nUniverse. Second, hypoelliptic PDE's arise in\r\nmany fields of science, for example physics, engineering,  finance, and\r\nrobotics. Therefore developing tools for studying hypoelliptic PDE's \r\nshould help making progress in these fields.\r\n",
