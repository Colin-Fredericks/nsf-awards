 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposers intend to establish a three-year science and engineering (S&E) and information technology (IT) program to serve 110 middle and high school students with disabilities.  Building on a technology infrastructure established through an existing public-private partnership between Tech-Now, Inc., the University of Oklahoma-Norman plans to create innovative S&E and IT activities for these targeted students.  To further ensure success of the program, this effort will be guided by lessons-learned from 40 years of experience by the university in training and developing a variety of service programs targeting citizens with disabilities.  The importance of the proposed work is well-documented based on national, state and local data that show a significant percent of Oklahoma City School's students are disabled.   \r\n\r\nThe leadership of the proposed program is uniquely qualified to implement the project given its long history of working with persons with disabilities.  The proposers intend to engage the students in year round, innovative, in-depth activities using the Tech Now curriculum.  Students will also conduct individual projects, visit college and technology training centers and industry sites, participate in job shadowing and in internships for which they will receive a stipend.  \r\n\r\nThe aim of the partnership is to promote greater understanding among a select number of persons with disabilities, and later all stakeholders in the broader community about the usefulness of S&E and IT knowledge and skills in everyday life.  The project accomplishments will be disseminated via the statewide high school high tech program under the financial sponsorship and guidelines of the U.S. Department of Labor and the Oklahoma Department of Education.  \r\n",
