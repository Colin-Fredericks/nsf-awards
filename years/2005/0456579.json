It also represents a research area that is vital to the economy and security of this nation. Recognizing this vital importance, the three United States sections of the Combustion Institute initiated a biennial national meeting on combustion.  Beginning in 1999, these meetings have been highly successful, based on the attendance and the number of presentations. Consequently, this biennial event has gained a prominent stature and become the premier national conference in fundamental and applied combustion.  This proposal requests funds to provide partial support for the Fourth Joint Meeting of the US Sections of the Combustion Institute, which will be held at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 20-23 March 2005. The NSF funds will be targeted to provide partial travel support to graduate students who make podium or poster presentations.  The information about the availability of travel support to graduate students will be provided in all the meeting announcements and on appropriate websites.  In addition, an announcement about the availability of travel support will be mailed to members of the Combustion Institute.\r\nThe purpose of any technical meeting is the sharing of knowledge and the exchange of ideas.  Providing resources to allow the next generation of researchers to participate will have significant intellectual merit and impact on the combustion community, which is vital to the energy future of the country.  Making travel more affordable may allow PIs to send more students than could have been accommodated with research funds, thereby sparking interest in a broader population.\r\n\r\n",
