This conference is the premier venue for disseminating research findings for India's thermal sciences and engineering community.  The American Society of Mechanical Engineers co-sponsors this event to enhance interactions between Indian and US thermal sciences researchers.  The interactive workshops in six topical areas are designed to seed US-India research collaboration in areas of mutual interest.  \r\n\r\nThe US delegation includes 6 senior scientists, 4 postdoctoral researchers, and 10 graduate students.  The workshops, which target fundamental areas in heat and mass transfer, are expected to enhance US-India cooperation on future thermal technologies, share information and build institutional bridges, and promote educational and cross-cultural experiences for all participants.  US delegates include women and members from under-represented groups that are early-career faculty, graduate students, or senior researchers.  The report on the workshops and conference will be disseminated through a website so that heat transfer researchers worldwide will be able to access this information.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
