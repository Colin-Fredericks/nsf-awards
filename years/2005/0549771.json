 "awd_abstract_narration": "A radar wind profiler will be deployed in support of the Megacity Impacts on Regional and Global Environments (MIRAGE) Mexico City study. This project is supported as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) because it will fill an urgent need for a facility that normally could be provided by an NCAR Integrated Sounding System; however, those are not available during the time period. This project involves the repair, installation, and operation of a wind profiler at Vera Cruz, Mexico, during the field project. Data will be collected, quality controlled, and provided to the scientific community. In particular, the data will be used directly by meteorological forecasting models, which will provide crucial support for the operations of the aircraft during the study.\r\n\r\nThe MIRAGE study will characterize the potential impacts of the Mexico City urban plume in the surrounding regions; doing so will substantially increase our understanding of chemical and physical reactions and dynamics on urban to regional and global scales. The field effort will be merged with projects of several other agencies (U.S. Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Mexican scientists and agencies) under the umbrella organization MILAGRO (Megacity Initiative: Local and Global Research Observations).",
