 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2005 FASEB Summer Research Conference on Chromatin and Transcription will be held July 9-14, 2005 in Snowmass, CO.  The conference will assemble an international group of scientists whose collective goal is to understand how the genome is packaged and how this packaging impacts nuclear processes, especially the regulation of gene expression. One key objective of this FASEB conference series has been to bring together researchers who study transcription factors with those that study chromatin structure. This conference also takes a lead in championing genetic studies as well as those of nuclear structure, chromosome organization, chromosome behavior and maintenance, and, more recently, RNA-mediated mechanisms of gene regulation.  Sessions will focus on nucleosome structure and histone modifications, DNA replication and chromatin assembly, active chromatin, repressed chromatin, the inheritance of chromatin states, differentiation and disease, genome-wide control, and higher-order organization.  There are also two broader impact goals of the conference: to support the efforts of young investigators to launch independent careers, and to incorporate researchers from diverse backgrounds.",
