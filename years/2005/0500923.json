 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nDeift\r\n\r\nThe PI will continue his work on the analysis of various asymptotic\r\nproblems in mathematics and mathematical physics. The steepest-descent \r\nmethod for Riemann-Hilbert problems will continue to play a key role.\r\nIn particular, the PI will consider\r\n\r\n** the perturbation theory of specific infinite-dimensional integrable \r\nsystems which support soliton solutions\r\n** universality problems in random matrix theory\r\n** asymptotics for multiple orthogonal polynomials, with a view to proving\r\nthe irrationality of certain distinguished constants\r\n** the asymptotic evaluation of Toeplitz and Hankel determinants, of the \r\nkind that arise in the analysis of Bose-Einstein condensation\r\n** statistical experiments which demonstrate the prevalence of random \r\nmatrix theory in mathematics, physics and also in the \"real world\".\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most fascinating scientific developments over the last fifty \r\nyears has been the discovery that an extraordinarily wide variety of \r\nmathematical and physical phenomena are modelled by the eigenvalues of a \r\nrandom matrix. In particular, random matrix theory describes the \r\nscattering of neutrons off large nuclei, as well as the statistics of the \r\nzeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line in the complex \r\nplane. More recently, it has been discovered that random matrix theory \r\nalso describes problems in the \"real world\", such as the bus scheduling \r\nproblem in the city of Cuernevaca in Mexico, the distribution of telephone \r\nnumbers in the Manhattan telephone directory, as well as the statistics of \r\na form of solitaire called patience sorting. A central focus of the PI's \r\nwork will involve the analysis of random matrix theory per se, as well as \r\nthe application of random matrix theory to new problems in mathematics, \r\nphysics and the \"real world\".\r\n\r\n\r\n",
