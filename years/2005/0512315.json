 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop more accurate turbulence transport models than are currently in common use in CFD simulations of variable-density fluid flows. The innovation of this Phase I project will be a new, partially validated model that will be an extension of the popular K/epsilon turbulence model and will explicitly incorporate non-gradient transport terms. Phase I research will include the development of a numerical methodology for efficient computer solution of the model equations, and will include validation through comparisons of numerical solutions with experiments in one-dimensional geometries.\r\n\r\nThe innovation will bring a significant new capability to CFD software because it will improve the accuracy of calculations of variable density turbulent flows, resulting in more reliable results and better design guidance in engineering applications than with currently available CFD software.  CFD is increasingly being used as an aid in designing IC engines, and the innovation will result in lower research and design costs and better designed IC engines because of the improved reliability of CFD predictions. Other applications of the innovation are to flows in gas turbine engines, industrial furnaces, electric-power generating systems, and high-speed propulsion devices\r\n",
