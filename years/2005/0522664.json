This\r\nquestion consumed participants ranging from naval policymakers to\r\nscience administrators, and it was taken up by a diverse but mutually\r\nrecognized group of naturalists and scientists from a variety of distinct\r\nbackgrounds and disciplines. What united them was a common discourse\r\non the formation of coral reefs, but what divided them promises to offer\r\ninsights into the practice of studying nature and the ways of formulating\r\ntheories as they changed over this time.\r\nScientists have used coral reefs as a place to juxtapose kingdoms of\r\nnature, the present and the past, and conceptions of the individual and the\r\ncommunity. Reefs have constituted a point of intersection for many of the\r\nclassic notions of how the study of nature should be divided: they are at\r\nonce animal, vegetable, and mineral. The \"life\" of a single reef unites the\r\npresent and the ancient past. They are renowned as complex ecosystems,\r\nbut students of their growth and shapes have treated them as organic\r\nindividuals.\r\nFor these reasons, the coral reef problem at issue in this dissertation has\r\nbeen of sustained intellectual significance to scientists over the past two\r\nhundred years. The project will be a history of the ideas those scientists\r\nproduced. And when science has commanded the attention of politics and\r\nthe fascination of society-as over evolution and the Bomb-coral reefs\r\nhave been the experimental and explosive proving ground for some of\r\nscience and culture's deepest reaching questions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis project will be of interest, then, to anyone who hopes to understand\r\nhow science has brought coral reefs from the periphery of our\r\nunderstanding to the center of our conceptions of what is most complex,\r\nfragile, and valuable about nature. It will also be of substantial relevance\r\nto historians, philosophers, and science teachers interested in the way that\r\nscientific problems have been asked, answered, challenged, and tested\r\nduring the development of modern professional science. This project\r\nshows how members of very different scientific disciplines-natural\r\nhistorians, geologists, zoologists, ecologists, and physical geographers-\r\nset about attacking the exact same question: how are coral reefs formed?\r\n",
