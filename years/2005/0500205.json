 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nQuantum unique ergodicity and rigidity in dynamical systems\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research proposed lies at the interface of dynamical systems\r\nand several other mathematical disciplines, and in particular number\r\ntheory and the theory of automorphic form. It is well\r\nknown that the collections of invariant probability measures and closed\r\ninvariant sets for hyperbolic maps or flows is very large; remarkably,\r\nin many dynamical systems of algebraic origin where there are two\r\n(or more) commuting hyperbolic maps or flows it is conjectured that\r\nthere are actually very few measures or closed sets invariant under this\r\nbigger action. Substantial progress has been made in the study of such \r\nsystems, which has yielded a proof of arithmetic quantum unique \r\nergodicity of compact arithmetic surfaces, and has given a partial \r\nresult towards Littlewood's Conjecture in diophantine approximation.\r\nThe author\r\nproposes to build on his research on the various facets of this problem\r\nto further our understanding of this rigidity phenomenon, as well as\r\nto apply these techniques and methods and the methods developed\r\nby other authors towards potential applications in number theory and\r\nother subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn dynamical systems we study evolution of a mathematical system. \r\nErgodic theory\r\nis a specific flavor of the theory of dynamical systems. The tools of \r\nergodic theory applied to concrete algebraically defined dynamical \r\nsystems can be used to prove theorems and conjectures in other seemingly \r\nunrelated fields, notably number theory. In our previous work we have \r\nshown how these tools can also be used effectively to study problems \r\nmotivated by quantum mechanics, specifically the arithmetic\r\ncase of the Quantum Unique Ergodicity Conjecture. The\r\nconnections that have been found between these special dynamical systems \r\nand problems in number theory, mathematical physics, and automorphic \r\nforms (the study of the spectrum of certain fundamental arithmetic \r\nmanifolds)\r\nsuggests that this interdisciplinary approach is likely to have additional\r\napplications. In addition to the research itself, substantial effort \r\nwill be given to human resources development, particularly at the \r\ngraduate level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
