First, jointly with Jiu-Kang Yu, the PI will\r\nconstruct K-types in certain tame case and show that they are types in the\r\nsense of Bushnell-Kutzko. These types have Hecke algebras associated to\r\nthem. In the second project, the PI will study the structure of\r\nthese Hecke algebras. Lastly, the PI will consider various applications of\r\nthese K-types in Harmonic analysis. Recent progress in the theory of\r\ntypes suggests that the Harmonic analysis on p-adic groups can be\r\ncompletely understood via harmonic analysis on the associated Hecke algebras.\r\nThese projects are necessary steps towards advancing the theory of types.\r\nIn the tame case, one can expect them to lead to a significantly improved\r\nunderstanding of representation theory of p-adic groups, and\r\nthey should also prove useful in the more general situation.\r\n\r\nRepresentation theory is a major mathematical technique for exploiting the\r\npresence of symmetry. For example, the structure of the hydrogen atom, one\r\nof the fundamental computations in quantum mechanics, is controlled by\r\nrepresentation theory. Another way of thinking about representation theory\r\nis as a generalization of the theory of eigenvalues and matrices that many\r\npeople see in a college course on basic linear algebra. The investigator\r\nstudies certain infinite groups of infinite dimensional symmetries.\r\nThis project addresses important questions in representation theory,\r\nwhich potentially has applications to number theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
