 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the mathematical and algorithmic theory of the newly emerging field of network coding.  Network coding offers the promise of improved performance over traditional network routing techniques.\r\nEmphasis is placed on the fundamental theory of communication in networks that allow coding in addition to routing.  Applications include improved throughput in packet networks and power savings in wireless ad hoc\r\nnetworks.  Specific subtopics studied include network solvability, linear coding, non-linear coding, the algebraic structure of symbol alphabets, multicast communications, point-to-point communications, and\r\nbi-directional coding and routing.  The theory of network coding is still in its infancy and little is known about practical algorithms for exploiting coding in real networks, such as the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are to achieve a deep mathematical understanding of network coding and to develop practical algorithms that can be effectively used in real applications.  The work exploits the diverse mathematical and\r\ncomputer science backgrounds of the PIs.  The investigation involves mathematical analysis, algorithm design, and computer simulation.  The main topic areas investigated are: (i) Applications of matroid theory to\r\nnetwork coding; (ii) Algorithms for network solvability, capacity computation, and code design;  (iii) Theory and algorithms for bi-directional networks; (iv) Theory and design of robust networks\r\n",
