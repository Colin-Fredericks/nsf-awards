 "awd_abstract_narration": "Baldwin proposes work on three topics in model theory: abstract\r\nelementary classes, generic expansions of fields, and the\r\npreservation of stability under expansion by naming predicates.\r\nThe last two are in some sense dual.  The twenty year old search\r\nfor a bad-field tries to construct a sufficiently generic subgroup\r\nof the complex numbers that omega stability is preserved.  Both\r\nrefined model theoretic and algebraic tools are essential.  In the\r\nother direction Baldwin is exploring with Baizhanov, the most\r\ngeneral conditions under which can hope to preserve stability when\r\na subset is named.  Baldwin has been writing a monograph\r\nsummarizing the current state of `Morley's theorem' for Abstract\r\nElementary Classes.  This monograph, tries to clarify and organize\r\nthe general work in this topic, underline the connections with\r\nboth Zilber's work on complex geometry and the `Hrushovski\r\nconstruction, and lay the foundation for a more general stability\r\ntheory in this context.\r\n\r\nThe general perspective of logic in understanding the foundations\r\nof various mathematical topics has provided in Baldwin's work\r\nlinks among fields as diverse as database theory (computer\r\nscience), random graphs, abstract algebra and complex analysis. In\r\nmany cases the role of logic is place limits on what can be proved\r\nand direct research into more productive endeavors.  Baldwin has\r\nserved as a link between the logic and mathematics education\r\ncommunities for the last fifteen years.  He is currently director\r\nof the Office of Mathematics Education at UIC.  He aims to provide\r\nfuture teachers with a profound understanding of fundamental\r\nsecondary school mathematics. A teacher with profound\r\nunderstanding of school mathematics is not only aware of the\r\nconceptual structure of secondary mathematics, but also\r\nunderstands the common strategies that students use to solve\r\nproblems along with common student misconceptions.  A background\r\nin logic is invaluable in helping future teachers develop the\r\nability to communicate mathematics clearly.",
