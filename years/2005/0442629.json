 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99). This project is creating a set of instructional spreadsheet modules that connect mathematics to nonmathematical contexts to support the diffusion of Quantitative Literacy throughout the curriculum. Each module addresses a topic in a particular discipline by posing a problem that students must figure out how to solve by applying mathematics. In the process they are also challenged to design and define the spreadsheet calculations that are needed. The intellectual merit of this full development effort includes its grounding in an earlier \"proof-of-concept\" project, DUE 0126500, \"Spreadsheet Exercises in Geological-Mathematical Problem Solving.\" This initial work sparked interest at the Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education. Now a major partner in this full project, the center is facilitating the engagement of a large community of faculty in creating, editing, curating, and disseminating these modules. Evaluation includes pre- and post-use testing of student learning and attitudes at various institutions together with site visits, focus groups, and in-depth studies of selected students as part of a robust study to determine how problem-solving using such spreadsheet-based modules affects student learning. In promoting Quantitative Literacy, this project is having a broad impact by developing habits of mind in future citizens to engage quantitative material in relevant contexts. Working through a statewide network offers a model that is transportable to other states and regions.",
