 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emerging field of p-adic dynamics has received a sizable amount of\r\nattention from around the world, including a course at the College de\r\nFrance given by J.-C. Yoccoz in 2000.  The subject promises new\r\ndevelopments in the near future for research in number theory,\r\ntopological dynamics, and ergodic theory.  In this three-day workshop\r\nscheduled for May, 2005, participants with strengths in these three\r\nfields of mathematics will exchange ideas via lectures and discussions\r\nconcerning the work which has appeared up to now, helping to generate\r\nideas for future research in this subject.  Even in the relatively few\r\nyears of its existence as a research area, p-adic dynamics has\r\nattracted interest from a number of dynamicists and ergodic theorists\r\nfor its parallels and contrasts with complex dynamics, as well as from\r\nnumber theorists for its applications to the study of iteration of\r\nfunctions over global fields.  A number of fundamental theorems and\r\nsurprising pathological examples have already been discovered, while\r\nat the same time several conjectures have emerged as key open\r\nquestions in the subject.\r\n\r\nErgodic theory and dynamical systems are relatively young subjects\r\nwhich evolved to study the chaotic and seemingly random behavior of\r\nnonlinear systems.  Their descriptions of chaotic behavior have led to\r\nmyriad applications in physics and engineering.  On the other hand,\r\nnumber theory is a subject which has been studied since ancient times,\r\nbut whose beauty and intricacy has kept it alive and strong into the\r\npresent day, where it has even found applications in cryptography and\r\ncoding theory.  Now, p-adic dynamics provides an opportunity for\r\nthese vibrant subjects to interact in a way that ultimately has\r\nthe potential to provide further understanding of all these\r\napplications.\r\n",
