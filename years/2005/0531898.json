 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a critical need for bio-scientists with quantitative knowledge and skills to conduct research in molecular biology, genetics and cellular systems. This interdisciplinary education and research training project for undergraduates in biological and mathematical sciences will recruit junior undergraduate students, with half majoring in biology, and the others in mathematics (including statistics).  The research will be directed towards qualitative and quantitative approaches to understanding molecular structures and mechanisms. This includes dynamics and regulation of the pathways and networks involved in gene expression and signal transduction in cells.  It will involve using technical strategies from biochemistry, genetics and cellular biology, and mathematical tools such as DNA and protein microarray analysis, data mining, dynamical systems, numerical simulation, and partial differential equations. The students will assimilate and employ these mathematical techniques under the direction of faculty from the Department of Mathematics, and the Department of Statistics and Probability. Beyond providing intense education and research training to the participating undergraduates, this project will influence the future direction of curriculum changes.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the mathematical sciences in the development of 21st Century biology has been noted, just as they have been important in the past development of physical sciences and engineering.  Yet the traditional training of biologists and that of mathematical scientists did not expose one population to the tools, problems, opportunities for progress, and challenges of the other.  This project will train budding mathematical scientists in cutting-edge biology and will train undergraduate biology majors in quantitative analysis relevant to the fields of genetics and cell biology.  The particular research projects being addressed by these students under the guidance of faculty in the biological and mathematical sciences include mathematical analysis of processes within cells, such as communication between parts of the cell and the assembly of the molecules necessary for proper life functions.  The mathematical description of molecular processes allows for the simulation of these highly complex mechanisms, which brings understanding that could otherwise be unavailable. The mathematical description on the other hand, relies upon careful laboratory experimental work and data analysis, and so it is essential that future scientists be trained in both the laboratory approach and the mathematical approach to research into cellular and genetic processes.  This integrative analysis and understanding should help in devising novel therapies to treat human diseases such as cancer, Huntington's, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.",
