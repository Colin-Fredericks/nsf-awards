 "awd_abstract_narration": "An exciting recent development in geometric group theory is Zlil\r\nSela's beautiful work on the Tarski problem. This problem asks whether\r\nthe elementary theory of a non-abelian free group is independent of\r\nthe free group in question.  Feighn proposes two projects in this\r\ndirection, both joint with Mladen Bestvina. The first is a\r\ncontinuation of a project to simplify Sela's work. In the second,\r\nrepresenting a new direction, a solution to a modified form of\r\nTarski's problem is proposed. This will lead to new information about\r\ndefinable sets (objects of primary importance) and will answer\r\nquestions of Rips and Sela. A third proposed project is to explore the\r\nextent to which the JSJ-decomposition of a group can be found\r\nalgorithmically. The specific class of groups to be examined consists\r\nof graphs of free groups, which are of current interest on a number of\r\nfronts. With Guo-An Diao, the principal investigator has shown that\r\nthe Grushko decomposition (a coarser decomposition than the JSJ) of\r\nthese groups can be found algorithmically. There are two possible\r\nsatisfactory resolutions, namely a construction of an algorithm to\r\nproduce the JSJ-decomposition of a group in the class or a proof that\r\nthis problem is unsolvable. For this class of groups, which exists on\r\nthe boundary of what can be understood algorithmically, either\r\nresolution would be important.\r\n\r\nGeometric group theory is a relatively young branch of mathematics\r\nthat uses geometric methods to understand groups. The idea to take a\r\nproblem in group theory, translate it into a problem in geometry, and\r\nthen use geometric methods to solve the translated problem. The\r\nprincipal investigator proposes to use geometric methods to explore\r\ntwo general areas. The first is motivated by Zlil Sela's geometric\r\nsolution to the Tarski problem which on the face of it is a problem in\r\nthe intersection of group theory and logic. Roughly, the problem is to\r\ndistinguish groups using the truth of statements formed using only the\r\nusual symbols of logic (\"there exists\", \"for all\", variables, etc) and\r\ngroup operations. For example, you can tell if a group is abelian by\r\nasking whether it is true that, for all elements x and y, xy=yx.  The\r\nfirst proposed project, joint with Mladen Bestvina, is to simplify and\r\nextend Sela's ideas. This project is ongoing and there has already\r\nbeen significant progress. The second proposed project follows another\r\ntrend in group theory that is encapsulated by the question: How much\r\ngroup theory can a computer understand? Much as molecules can be\r\ndecomposed into simpler pieces (atoms), groups can be often be\r\ndecomposed into simpler groups. The project is to understand such\r\ndecompositions for a class of groups called \"graphs of free groups\", a\r\nclass which has attracted much recent attention. It turns out that\r\ndecomposing groups translates into the geometric process of cutting a\r\nspace into simpler pieces. The goal is to use this geometric idea to\r\ndiscover an algorithm that, given a group, finds its decomposition.\r\nThe principal investigator, with Guo-An Diao, has already constructed\r\nan algorithm for a related process that can readily be implemented on\r\na computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
