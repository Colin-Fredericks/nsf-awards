 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many embedded systems rely upon communication systems to exchange\r\ninformation and coordinate activities in distributed\r\napplications. Developing communication systems which are fast,\r\nreliable, energy-efficient and error-free is a challenge due to the\r\nmany trade-offs involved. Software implementations are often\r\ninefficient due to poor coding practice.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing new ways to develop and implement\r\ncommunication protocols for embedded networks using a building-block\r\napproach.  A tool is being developed which offers a collection of\r\ncommonly used protocol components which the developer tunes and\r\ninterconnects as needed for the application. The tool then generates\r\nan efficient program from these components using software thread\r\nintegration. The tool also estimates protocol performance and\r\ncomputational requirements, allowing system designers to have quick\r\nfeedback on the impact of design decisions.\r\n\r\nA major goal of this project is making rapid prototyping of embedded\r\ncommunication systems accessible to non-specialist researchers and\r\npractitioners, as well as to address real-world problems. Two specific\r\napplications are being used to promote these interdisciplinary\r\ngoals. The first application is ultrasonic marine biotelemetry, which\r\nenables the analysis of movement, physiological function and behavior\r\nof marine organisms.  One team member is a marine biologist with\r\nextensive experience in this area who is defining requirements and\r\nguiding testing.  The second application is structural health\r\nmonitoring (SHM) of bridges using wireless sensor networks.  Another\r\nteam member is collaborating with civil engineers on an SHM project,\r\nand leverages the sensor network protocol experience gained.\r\n",
