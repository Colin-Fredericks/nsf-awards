 "awd_abstract_narration": "My project focuses on studying connections between inner models\r\nof set theory and large cardinals on the one side, and infinitary\r\ncombinatorics and descriptive set theory on the other side. It\r\nconsists of four parts that are connected through methods of\r\nresearch. The first part is devoted to the analysis of the internal\r\nstructure and combinatorial properties of extender models, an area\r\nof research launched by Jensen in the late 60's; the emphasis here\r\nis on extending the methods recently developed by Schimmerling and\r\nZeman, and creating a \"catalogue\" of such methods with broad\r\napplicability. The second area focuses on optimal forcing\r\nconstructions in infinite combinatorics. A typical question in\r\nthis category is obtaining the exact consistency strength for\r\nthe failure of Jensen's principle \"square\" at a singular cardinal.\r\nAlthough the emphasis here is on developing new forcing methods,\r\ninner model theory (even at its current state of development)\r\nprovides large cardinal axioms that are likely candidates for the\r\nconsistency strengths in question. The third area comprises\r\napplications of inner models in establishing lower bounds for\r\nconsistency strengths at large cardinal levels below one Woodin\r\ncardinal, as well as applications in descriptive set theory\r\nrelated to correctness of canonical inner models and inner model\r\ntheoretic characterizations of descriptive set theoretic objects.\r\nThe last area focuses on the theory of inner models; the main\r\nobjective here is to make a progress on extender models matching\r\nhigher levels of the large cardinal hierarchy, as well as\r\nexploring possibilities for constructions of the core model below\r\none Woodin cardinal with no background large cardinal assumption\r\non the set-theoretic universe.\r\n\r\nSet theory can be viewed as a mathematical theory that formalizes the\r\nmethods currently accepted as valid working methods in mathematics.\r\nIt is based on the so-called Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms that describe\r\nbasic mathematical constructions. The developments in mathematics\r\nin the twentieth century brought the entire subject to a new stage:\r\nIt turns out that there are more and more natural questions answers\r\nof which are sensitive to the background axioms, that is to the axioms\r\nof set theory. Such questions arise even in classical disciplines like\r\nalgebra or analysis. They cannot be decided from Zermelo-Fraenkel\r\naxioms alone. In order to decide such questions, it is necessary\r\nto augment the axiomatic system by additional axioms; such axioms\r\nare usually formulated in the language of infinitary combinatorics.\r\nThis has to be done in a manner that will not introduce an\r\ninconsistency of the augmented axiomatic system. In some cases,\r\nthe consistency of the augmented system (relative to the\r\nZermelo-Fraenkel system) can be proved using methods formalizable\r\nin the Zermelo-Fraenkel system itself. However, there is an entire\r\nhierarchy of axioms, the so-called large cardinal axioms, which do not\r\nallow this. It is believed that every mathematical statement that is not\r\ndecidable from the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms alone -- or at least the\r\nconsistency of such a statement -- can be decided using the right large\r\ncardinal axiom. The mathematical praxis provides a lot of support for\r\nthis belief. Thus, the large cardinal hierarchy constitutes a kind of\r\na \"scale\" that \"measures\" the complexity of mathematical statements, and\r\neach such statement has an exact match on this scale. The large\r\ncardinal axiom, that together with Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms provides\r\nthe very piece of information necessary and sufficient to decide the\r\n(consistency of) the statement, is called the consistency\r\nstrength of the statement. Expressed informally: By determining the\r\nconsistency strengths, set theory is able to isolate the precise amount\r\nof information that that has to be used along with the standard\r\nmathematical methods in order to decide certain mathematical questions.\r\nInner model theory, forcing, descriptive set theory, and infinitary\r\ncombinatorics constitute crucial tools for this task.\r\n\r\n",
