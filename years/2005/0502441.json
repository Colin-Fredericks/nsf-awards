 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal centers around 3 topics. The first is about questions in\r\ngroup theory motivated by the first order predicate calculus in\r\nlogic. The questions involve e.g. understanding the sets of\r\nhomomorphisms of a fixed group into a free group that extend to\r\nanother fixed group. The second topic concerns the topology of moduli\r\nspace of curves and of the Torelli subgroup of a mapping class\r\ngroup. The idea is to see if homology can be computed using a suitably\r\nchosen Morse function on the moduli space, and on the quotient of\r\nTeichmuller space by the Torelli group, respectively. The Morse\r\nfunction is geometrically defined -- it is the systole, i.e. the\r\nlength of the shortest curve (or the homological version of this in\r\nthe case of Torelli groups). The last topic is on the quasi-isometric\r\nrigidity of right-angled Artin groups. The subject has seen some\r\ngreat advances in the last 15 years or so, but this particular class\r\nof groups raises many issues not addressed before.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the proposal is the study of topological and geometric\r\nproperties of several objects that naturally appear in\r\nmathematics. For example, consider the collection of all possible\r\n\"shapes\" of a surface with a fixed number of holes. This collection\r\nforms a space, called moduli space of curves. The calculation of the\r\n\"number of holes\" for this space has been recently completed by a\r\ntopological tour de force. A different method for this calculation is\r\nproposed here, one that would also give additional\r\ninformation. To describe the method, consider the following\r\nanalogy. When water is slowly poured into a\r\nnormal glass, the surface of water in the glass will always be a\r\ndisk. By contrast, if water is poured into a glass with a hollow\r\nhandle, the surface of water will consist of two disks once water\r\nreaches the handle. Thus, by examining the shape of the surface of\r\nwater we can tell if a glass has a handle or not. Topological spaces,\r\nsuch as moduli space of curves, can be analyzed similarly. A\r\nparticular way of \"pouring water\" is proposed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
