 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of West Georgia (formerly known as the State University of West \r\nGeorgia) will be host to the Integers Conference 2005, a conference\r\nin the areas of combinatorics and number theory. The conference will follow the \r\nstyle of the successful \"Integers Conference 2003,\" also held at the University \r\nof West Georgia. The Conference will also honor Professor Ronald Graham, on the \r\noccasion of his seventieth birthday. The 2005 conference will be somewhat \r\nlarger than that of 2003; in particular, it will cover four days rather than \r\nthree. The conference will attempt to serve as a catalyst for significant \r\ncollaborative projects among mathematicians and computer scientists \r\nrepresenting the areas of additive number theory, multiplicative number theory, \r\nprobabilistic number theory, combinatorics, combinatorial optimization, game \r\ntheory, and Ramsey theory. There will be four plenary\r\nspeakers: Doron Zeilberger, Joszef Solymosi, Daniel Goldston, and Neil Hindman. \r\nThere will also be approximately sixty 20-minute invited talks.\r\n\r\nThe conference will gather mathematicians, graduate students, undergraduate \r\nstudents, and others interested in combinatorics\r\nor number theory. It will include student research talks, and promote\r\ninteraction among research mathematicians representing the spectrum of\r\n\"career stages,\" from the talented undergraduate to  the \r\ninternationally distinguished researcher. Various areas of expertise will be \r\nrepresented from the general area of discrete mathematics. Leading experts will \r\npresent their latest work, and there will be much collaboration among \r\nparticipants. The research areas have many applications, including \r\ncryptography, genetics, neural networks, mathematical biology, radio frequency \r\nassignment for mobile telecommunications, coding theory, sequences for\r\ncommunications applications, and interconnection networks.\r\n",
