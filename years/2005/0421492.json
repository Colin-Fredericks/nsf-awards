 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyclic inelastic deformations are the primary mode of seismic energy dissipation in steel structures. \r\nDuring  earthquakes, beam-column moment connections undergo a phenomena  called Ultra-Low \r\nCycle  Fatigue (ULCF), which is characterized by very  few (<10-20) large strain cycles.  ULCF is \r\nquite distinct from low cycle fatigue, which has been more widely studied but does not address the \r\nconditions prevalent in seismic design. Relatively little attention has been given to characterizing the \r\nfundamental failure mechanisms associated with ULCF, due to the lack of suitable micro-scale models \r\nto simulate ULCF and the computational requirements necessary implement the models for studying \r\nlarge structural components. Existing research on ULCF of steel structures in earthquakes relies \r\nalmost exclusively on semi-empirical methods, which cannot be transferred to  varied structural \r\nconfigurations. Moreover, most of  the existing empirical research is based on quasi-static  testing, \r\nwhich does not account for earthquake loading rate effects. Such knowledge gaps represent serious \r\nissues for seismic hazard mitigation. The proposed research aims to (1) identify  and quantify the \r\nunderlying failure mechanisms of earthquake-induced ULCF, (2) develop and implement models to \r\nsimulate ULCF in steel structures (3) conduct large scale subassembly  tests at earthquake loading \r\nrates to verify and demonstrate the models (4) apply the ULCF models to develop practical guidelines \r\nand recommendations for earthquake resistant design. \r\n\r\nA recent study by  the PI and his collaborator at Stanford succeeded in developing some of the first \r\nmicromechanical models for predicting earthquake-induced ULCF crack initiation in steel structures. \r\nBased  on these initial advances, the proposed study will integrate  micromechanics concepts with \r\nadvanced simulation techniques and parallel-computing to realistically simulate fundamental fatigue-\r\nfracture processes in steel structures. The first phase of the research will include integrated testing and \r\nanalyses of welded components to calibrate the material properties in the micromechanical models. \r\nThe second phase will use the fast hybrid testing facility at NEES Colorado to test full-scale welded \r\nsteel connections results of which will be used to validate micromechanical simulations for predicting \r\nULCF fractures. The third phase will use the micromechanical model-based simulation framework to \r\naddress unresolved practical problems of interest to the design and construction industry, e.g. the \r\ninitiation and propagation of ductile fractures in welded steel construction.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Research: This research will develop powerful tools to model \r\ncrack initiation and propagation at a very fundamental level in structural steel components under \r\nearthquake loading effects. The research will substantially advance the state  of knowledge in \r\nfracture/fatigue  mechanics and effectively demonstrate the power of  micro-scale modeling for \r\naddressing important earthquake engineering problems.  This will have both a positive effect on \r\nsimulation practices in general and the migration towards a more extensive model-based simulation \r\nenvironment. Consistent design recommendations based on the simulations will address important \r\ndetailing issues and mitigate earthquake hazard. The research will utilize the fast hybrid testing facility \r\nat NEES-Colorado, and the research team is committed to free sharing of data, simulation models, and \r\nother information through the NEESgrid and publication in refereed journals.  \r\n \r\nBroader Impact of Proposed Research: This research will have a significant impact on the state of \r\nthe art in earthquake fatigue mechanics, model based simulation, and design guidelines to protect \r\nagainst ULCF in earthquakes. Involving expertise from structural engineering, materials and \r\ncomputational science, this research will promote interdisciplinary technology transfer and \r\ncollaboration between the between the two participating schools and the NEES site at CU-Boulder.  \r\nAn educational impact of this study will include the education of two doctoral students, one each at \r\nUC Davis and Stanford. Moreover, the PI and the co-PI are both responsible for teaching steel design \r\nclasses at UC Davis and Stanford, which  provide a natural educational opportunity for students to \r\nbecome engaged in the research through the  NEES teleparticipation and database facilities. The \r\nproject team is committed to involving under-represented groups in research and will collaborate with \r\non campus engineering diversity programs to achieve these aims.",
