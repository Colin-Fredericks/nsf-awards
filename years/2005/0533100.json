 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to develop a parallel microfabrication technology that allows for integration of inorganic materials and microstructures with mm-scale insects.\r\nSpecifically, fruit fly is used as a model insect. Fruit fly embryos are self-assembled into a patterned substrate via fluidic self-assembly to form an array. They are encapsulated in\r\nmicrochambers and the development cycle is allowed to progress. The development is halted in the larva stage to perform a microfabrication step, for example metal evaporation, onto the larvae in the microchambers and then the insect development cycle is allowed to proceed. This technology allows for modification of mm-scale insects in a massively parallel fashion. In future extensions it can be used to incorporate control/RF circuitry or sensors into the structure of colonies of insects. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits:\r\nThis project develops a novel hybrid manufacturing method that combines biology and solid-state microfabrication. It provides the first example of direct microfabrication on a live and functional insect.  The project will establish the possibilities and limits of parallel solid-state processing on insects at various levels of their development and will demonstrate a massively parallel method to modify a large collection of biological entities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe project directly contributes to training of students at the interface between biology and solid-state fabrication.\r\n",
