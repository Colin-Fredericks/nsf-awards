 "awd_abstract_narration": "From early childhood throughout early adulthood, individuals are under \r\nthe supervision of parents, caregivers, teachers, advisors, and other \r\nexperts. Typically, supervisors can influence, at least to some extent, \r\nthe learning activities of young people. A basic trade-off emerges in \r\nthe learning environments, such that a supervisor may wish to prevent \r\nthe learner from making costly mistakes, but in doing so hinder the \r\nlearning process. This research project develops a family of formal \r\ntheoretical models of supervised learning, and analyzes their \r\npredictions. Within these models, key features of successful adult \r\nsupervision identified in the child development literature may be \r\nunderstood as the result of the parent's optimizing behavior. Similarly, \r\nthe analysis can shed light on the widely documented variability in \r\nparenting practices across different human societies, as well as across \r\nanimal species.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the role of adults as experts supporting children's \r\nlearning activities is a long-standing objective in developmental \r\npsychology, and the focus of a sizable experimental and empirical \r\nliterature. The theoretical approach pursued in this project complements \r\nthe mainly experimental and empirical approaches adopted in the child \r\ndevelopment literature.\r\n",
