The focus of this meeting will be genomics and genome-enabled biology in model and crop legume species.   The specific objectives of the Model Legume Congress 2005 are (1) to bring together legume scientists with vigorous research programs, complementary expertise and diverse technological strengths, in an environment conducive to the intellectual exchange and (2) to facilitate formal and informal interactions that will lay the foundation for a strong and cohesive legume research community over the coming decades.  The meeting is timely since there have recently been extensive sequencing efforts in Medicago, Lotus, and soybean.  This congress is organized to stimulate interaction between scientists working with legumes for both basic research and applied agriculture.  The congress will host an estimated 200 national and international scientists and the organizers have provided many opportunities for junior scientists to give presentations in parallel scientific sessions.  The organizers will use the funds from NSF to support the attendance of students at the conference.\r\n",
