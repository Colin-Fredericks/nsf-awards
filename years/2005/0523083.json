 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this NSF GOALI collaboration between Caltech and Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPC) is to enable a new, integrated manufacturing paradigm in which the molecular attributes of a polymer are selected in coordination with processing parameters to create superior products at increased throughput rates.  The approach is to bridge from molecular-level observations of the earliest events in flow-induced nucleation to the final performance characteristics of polyethylene film (e.g., tear resistance).  Using state-of-the-art instruments developed at Caltech and a series of systematically varied polyethylene structures provided by CPC, this research will establish the molecular level processes that give rise to highly nonlinear effects of processing on the rate and form of solidification, particularly in polyethylene. \r\n\r\nThis research accelerates development of new products by enabling rapid design of molecular and processing parameters that deliver desired macroscopic properties in polyolefins, the largest segment of the thermoplastics industry-used at a rate of over 70 million metric tons per year.  Societal benefits include increased fuel efficiency because of thinner, lighter automotive parts, improved infrastructure through longer service life gas pipelines, and reduced food costs due to packaging that better preserves freshness.  The research supports the economy by improving the U.S. position in the enormous polyethylene industry.  In addition, GOALI support fosters ongoing outreach activities, including the Sally Ride Science Festival that draws many middle-school girls, Caltech lab tours for local students, and the Caltech Engineering Preview that provides information on graduate studies to undergraduates from groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering.\r\n",
