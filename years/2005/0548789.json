 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Massachusetts and Rutgers University propose to plan and lead a two-day workshop on Integrative Computing Education & Research (ICER), to be held in late October or early November 2005 in the metropolitan Boston or New York area. The purpose of this workshop will be to bring together a broad range of stakeholders from the northeast region with strong interests in CISE undergraduate education. Professors Jim Kurose of the University of Massachusetts and Barbara Ryder of Rutgers University will serve as workshop co-chairs. The two PIs are senior faculty members at public research universities, active in curriculum efforts at their schools, and leaders in the professional community.\r\n\r\nThe ever-changing technical nature of our discipline, the growing need for integrative\r\nand systems-level capabilities, and the new challenges faced by the students we educate\r\n(as well as those we currently fail to reach) together provide the impetus for this\r\nworkshop. The workshop will bring together a broad range of stakeholders from the\r\nnortheast region with strong interests in CISE undergraduate education, to identify and\r\ndiscuss needed transformations in undergraduate computing education in the USA. The\r\nworkshop will provide an important step forward in organizing and creating innovations\r\nin an undergraduate curriculum in computing, cognizant of its relationship to other\r\ndisciplines and recognizing its nature as a constantly evolving discipline. The output of\r\nthe workshop will be a report documenting the ideas emerging from the workshop, as\r\nwell as a set of recommendations to the NSF for programmatic activities that could help\r\ninitiate the needed transformations.\r\n\r\nThe workshop recommendations will be aimed at long-term, high impact, and potentially\r\nhigh-risk, strategies to catalyze the transformation of undergraduate computing education\r\nthroughout the nation. Strong emphasis on issues of inclusion of currently underrepresented groups in computing education also will further broaden the\r\nworkshop's impact on society. The proposed workshop is inherently a community-oriented activity, as its goal is to develop new curriculum ideas consistent with\r\ntechnological advances in the field.\r\n",
