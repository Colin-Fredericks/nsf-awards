The focus of this conference will be on the emerging research areas including genomics and proteomics, quantitative systems biology, cellular regulatory networks and signal transduction, cellular physiology, biochemical engineering approaches to cancer, biocatalysis, miniaturization of bioprocesses, evolutionary approaches, production of complex structures, and important core areas of biochemical engineering (fermentation/cell culture and downstream process development). The aim of this premier international conference is to bring together influential established researchers, young investigators, industrial researchers and practitioners, and graduate students from both sides of the aisle (engineering and biology) to assess the present and chart the future of this dynamic field.\r\n\r\nBiochemical Engineering has evolved dramatically over the last 50 years from a supporting role to a leading role in the applications of biological systems to human health, production of chemicals, food and biologicals, and solving environmental problems. This continuing series of conferences has also seen a large evolution of focus, but has remained central to the vital community of Biochemical Engineering & Biotechnology. Biochemical Engineers have always embraced new challenges and modern biology with high energy and enthusiasm. This is no exception for the now emerging era of Systems Biology, Nanomedicine, and NanoBiotechnologies. We expect that Biochemical Engineering XIV will provide comprehensive coverage of the state of the art and future directions in biochemical engineering. The resulting cross-fertilization of ideas enriches and strengthens the discipline as a whole.\r\n",
