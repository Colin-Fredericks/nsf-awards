The co-organizers are Professor Karen Wooley at Washington University and Professor Toshio Masuda at Kyoto University in Japan.  Polymers are playing an increasing important role in every person's life, by serving as structural materials, insulating materials, packaging materials, etc. for commodity and high-end products.  Furthermore, there is enormous potential benefit to society by capitalizing on emerging polymer materials that have resulted from the more recent development in synthetic chemistry to control the macromolecular architecture, size, and size distribution, supramolecular chemistry to control their assembly into complex structures, and physical chemistry to study the properties and behaviors.  All of the above topics, plus additional ones, will be discussed with a common focus on future directives for polymer chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe co-organizers have complementary scientific expertise in the field.  This enables them to evaluate and attract the best science researchers to participate.  Many advances have been realized by researchers in Japan and the US and each of these countries is recognized as a leader in the synthesis of polymers having control over the macromolecular topology, stereochemistry and regiochemistry, and in the design of such well defined materials for \"programmed\" supramolecular assembly, often with cues being taken from biological systems.  The topics covered by the workshop are not only at the forefront of polymer chemistry, but have direct relevance and impact to major growth areas such as nanoscience and bio-related materials.   The workshop organizers have made a special effort to involve postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students as both participants and observers. The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Conference proceedings will be published in the \"Journal of Polymer Science.\"        \r\n\r\n\r\n",
