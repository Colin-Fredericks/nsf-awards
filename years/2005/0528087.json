 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing concern with security issues in the world has led to greater interest in improving the technology and methods available for detecting deception.  Under direction from Congress, the NSF and the Office of Science Technology Policy are facilitating a series of six workshops to address current and future research on the science and technology of security evaluations.  This workshop focuses on the use of language in detecting deception.  Through an examination of word usage and computer based approaches to word or phrase patterns, scientists are developing new methods to evaluate the truthfulness of the speech of individuals.  Levels of analysis range from individual word choice, to word and phrase networks, and the evaluation of stories and narratives.  Real world applications will be discussed alongside issues of bilingual language use and virtual and electronic communication.  Participants will also address the ethical, legal and privacy concerns of current research. The workshop will bring over a dozen leading experts and practitioners together for two days in June 2005 at the NSF to present overviews of cutting edge research and work together to outline a series of proposed research directions.  A final report will be prepared summarizing presentations and views of the workshop participants.",
