 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support for this project brings together nine women scientists to share their paths to careers in mathematics, science and engineering with undergraduate and graduate students, recent Ph.D., teachers and more seasoned professionals.  These nine women are members of the most under represented minority ethnic groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in the United States, Americans of Mexican descent, Chicanos.  Each contributor will read an excerpt from their collection of autobiographical essays that will comprise the book, \"Flor y Ciencia: Chicanas in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering\".  The session will occur at the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) National Conference to be held in Denver Colorado September 29-October 2, 2005.  The structure of the session enhances interactions between the young scientists and the presenters by providing an extensive question and answer period following the readings.  The broader impact of this activity includes training for young investigators in the culture of science, providing role models for young investigators attending the conference and when the book is published, it is anticipated that it will be used in history of science, women's studies and ethnic studies courses.",
