Specifically, counts of globular cluster stars (i.e., luminosity functions) will be\r\nemployed to determine evolutionary timescales. Also, internally-consistent photometry will be\r\nmeasured to compare stellar properties (luminosity, temperature) at different phases of evolution\r\nand at the same points of evolution across different clusters. Three aspects of the cluster colormagnitude\r\ndiagrams will be examined: 1) The epoch of red giant branch ascent, including red giant\r\nevolutionary timescales, the red giant branch bump (its luminosity and sharpness), and the\r\nlocation of the red giant branch-tip; 2) horizontal branch and asymptotic giant branch morphologies,\r\ndistributions, and evolution; and 3) blue stragglers and their radial distributions, distributions on the\r\ncluster color magnitude diagrams, and the presence of unusual blue straggler populations. The\r\nstatistical nature of these investigations requires quality photometry of large samples of cluster stars\r\nwhich will be extracted from previously obtained wide field (for cluster outskirts) and high\r\nresolution (for cluster cores) images obtained at national and international observatories telescopes\r\n(plus archival images, including the Hubble Space Telescope where possible). Novel (within the\r\nastronomical community) statistics will also be employed in the analysis to assess\r\nsignificance/confidence levels of trends and relations.\r\nUndergraduate and Master's students at San Diego will be heavily involved in this work - both with\r\nthe reduction and analysis of the astronomical data and the application of advanced statistical\r\nmethods. The training of a graduate student at UCSC is also supported here. The final photometry\r\nwill also be made publicly available.",
