This  proposal  is  for  travel  expenses  for \r\ninvestigators  from Koc University  in Turkey  to  visit M.I.T.  in  order  to  perform  collaborative  research.  \r\nThe  proposal follows the format  of the  Scientific  and  Technical  Research National  Science Council  of \r\nTurkey  (TUBITAK).    The  proposal  is  also  submitted  to  Tubitak  in  Turkey  for  support  of  research \r\nexpenses of our collaborator in Turkey.   \r\n\r\nHigh-energy  femtosecond  oscillators  based  on  solid-state  media,  such  as  Ti3 :Al2O3  and \r\nCr4+:forsterite  have numerous  applications  in  ultrafast  phenomena  and  nonlinear  optics,  including  such diverse applications as nonlinear frequency generation, pump probe measurement, micromachining and \r\nbiomedical imaging.  Recently it was proposed that the pulse energies of laser systems can be scaled up \r\nby using extended laser resonators.  For a given average power, extending the laser cavity length lowers \r\nthe  pulse  repetition  rate  and,  therefore,  increases  the  pulse  energy;  thus,  generating  high-energy  pulses without the need for more complex and expensive methods such as cavity dumping or amplification.  In a practical system, it is also important to maintain compactness as cavity length is increased.   \r\n\r\nThe subject of  this proposal is femtosecond laser development.  It involves the design and experimental \r\ninvestigation of laser oscillators that are compact and can produce high-energy pulses.  The femtosecond \r\nlasers to be investigated are based on the tunable, solid-state Ti 3+ :Al2O3 and Cr 4+ :forsterite systems that \r\noperate  in  the  near  infrared  range  between  700  and  1400  nm.    The  broad  gain  bandwidths  of  these \r\nmaterials  enables  the  generation  of  femtosecond  pulses.    Kerr-lens  mode-locking  (KLM)  will  be \r\nemployed, along with intracavity dispersion compensation using double-chirped mirrors to achieve broad \r\ntunability or very short pulse, broadband operation.  Multi-pass laser cavities (MPCs) will be designed \r\nwhich  can  dramatically  reduce  laser  repetition  rate  and  increase  pulse  energies  while  maintaining  a \r\ncompact laser design.   \r\n\r\nThe  scope  of  the  proposed  project  is  the  design,  development,  and  application  of  compact,  high-\r\nenergy femtosecond lasers.  The objectives include:  \r\n1)  Design multi-pass cavity (MPC) lasers using Cr4+:forsterite for generation of femtosecond pulses in \r\nthe 1.1 to 1.4 um range,  \r\n2)  Experimentally  investigate  the  femtosecond  MPC  lasers  using  Cr4+:forsterite  in  the  1.1  -1.4 um \r\nrange, and Ti3+:Al2O3 in the 700 -1000 nm range,  \r\n3)  Explore the fundamental limits of pulse energy that can be generated with MPC laser designs,   \r\n4)  Perform second-harmonic generation studies with the MPC Cr4+:forsterite laser to obtain high pulse \r\nenergies at visible wavelengths, and  \r\n5)  Demonstrate selected applications of the MPC Cr4+:forsterite and Ti3+:Al2O3 lasers for biomedical \r\nimaging and ultrafast pump-probe studies.   \r\n\r\nIf  successful,  this  research  will  enable  the  development  of  a  new  class  of  femtosecond  lasers  that \r\nachieve pulse energies significantly higher than what is currently possible with current femtosecond laser \r\noscillators.   This  will  enable  a  wide range  of  new  applications  without  the  need  for  femtosecond laser \r\namplifiers.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This program is an international collaboration.  It will develop new laser technology \r\nin both laboratories in the U.S. and in Turkey that can be used for future applications, such as biomedical \r\nimaging, pump-probe measurements, and micromachining.  It will train graduate students at the master's \r\nand doctoral levels who will be specialized in lasers and ultrafast phenomena.  Both countries will gain \r\nexpertise  in  fundamental  and  applied  research  in  the  field  of  ultrafast  lasers  and  measurement.   These fields  are  important  to  future  advances  in  areas  including  high-speed  photonics  and  communications, semiconductor physics, biology, and photochemistry.  The development of new technologies in optics and photonics can enhance high-technology and industrial development, leading to economic growth.   \r\n\r\n",
