 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Houston at Clear Lake, whose student body is entirely juniors and seniors, has a Noyce project to prepare 15 current and transfer students to become highly qualified secondary-school mathematics teachers.  Mathematics and Education faculty collaborate with over 55 local schools in 22 districts to prepare teachers in a program that includes a two-semester internship and opportunities for interaction with the adjoining NASA Johnson Space Center, among other local scientific agencies.  Students are trained not only in mathematics content and pedagogy, but are taught to use critical thinking, instructional technology, and strategies to address English-language learners.  The program allows potential scholars to explore mathematics teaching as a profession through the Success Through Education Programs and opportunities to conduct internships at summer camps or other mathematically oriented programs.  Once selected as Noyce Scholars, the students complete their mathematics major while enrolling in courses to learn pedagogy.  After completing their degrees and certification, alumni of the program serve as mentors for newer preservice teachers and receive continuing professional development in their induction period. Since most of the students are transfers from community colleges, they come from diverse backgrounds.  The UHCL program deliberately recruits students who are underrepresented minority, low income, or first in their families to attend college.  Since they are from local secondary schools and community colleges, and since their practice teaching will also be local, they are likely to remain in the area, \"home-grown\" teachers of the next generation.",
