 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a workshop to bring together the Users of Experimental Rock\r\nDeformation data with the Practitioners of Experimental Rock Deformation. Users are those who\r\nmake direct use of laboratory data in models, calculations, or in the interpretation of geological\r\nor geophysical observations. Practitioners are those actively engaged in laboratory-based\r\nexperimental research on the mechanical properties of Earth materials; some Practitioners are\r\nalso Users. The purpose of the workshop is to assess the scientific and technical needs of these\r\ngroups and to begin a process of responding to those needs. There are important research\r\nobjectives in geomechanics that can be identified, from both a scientific and societal\r\nperspective, and there are recognized needs for technological and community resources in\r\norder to meet the scientific needs. The workshop will focus on geomechanics of the relatively\r\nshallow portion of the Earth. This will include the mechanics of the upper mantle and lower-to-mid crust, the seismogenic zone, accretionary wedges, energy- and waste-related subsurface systems, and the role of thermalhydro-chemical processes in all these environments.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will support attendance by early career scientists and students. The results will be broadly disseminated and will produce a strategic, community-building document for rock deformation.",
