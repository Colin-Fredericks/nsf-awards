 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to explore the application of a targeted nanodelivery system for both treatment and efficacy monitoring in patients with adult leukemia. Unlike solid tumors, for which surgery, radiation, and conventional treatments are an option, leukemias are cancers of the blood, which have very poor prognosis due to the fact that they are disseminated diseases from inception. In this project, the targeted and drug-filled nanoparticle will be optimized for effective tumor killing in cell culture, followed by validation using established in-vivo methods for adult leukemia in a mouse model.  It is expected that this targeted nanodelivery system will increase the therapeutic window and minimize systemic therapy related toxicity, demonstrating the superior margin of safety compared to the standard methods for treatment.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a technology that is capable of delivering a wide array of drug molecules (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) or drug cocktails using multiple tissue targeting ligands. The specific focus of this project is adult acute leukemia for which there is currently no curative treatment, and the adult survival rate is only 30%.  Highly robust, customizable, stable, and easy to manufacture, this particle delivery system is anticipated to make a major impact on the treatment of adult leukemia.",

While therapeutic nanoparticles have been introduced into clinical practice (AbraxaneTM and DoxilTM) and others are in development, none to our knowledge have been developed that show tumor target specificity (as opposed to increased affinity). We are endeavoring to show that targeted delivery of cancer therapy can improve therapeutic response while minimizing the toxic effects on healthy tissue, for virtually any cancer treatment. The innovation of this approach was demonstrated by dramatically reducing the tumor burden in a mouse injected with human leukemia cells. The ability to demonstrate this objective is both highly significant and transformative, as most efforts to date have shown drawbacks in the targeting of nanoparticles or delivery of therapeutic content. Through this study, the field of knowledge with respect to cancer treatment by nanoscopic-sized particles has been significantly advanced. This project supports the NSF objectives of furthering research in bioengineering, with treatment-related goals, by applying engineering principles to problems in medicine. Completion of this phase of the project allows NanoValent to advance closer to completing preclinical studies in anticipation of human clinical testing, requiring investigational new drug (IND) status for this material with the FDA.  \n\nThe broader societal implication of realizing a new, effective treatment for adult leukemia is tremendous.  Within the U.S. alone, there are an estimated 274,930 people living with leukemia. In 2011, it is estimated that 44,600 people (25,320 men and 19,280 women) were diagnosed with leukemia, including 10 times as many adults as children and adolescents, with the median age at diagnosis being 66 years. Also in 2011, 21,780 of those already afflicted with leukemia were expected to die from the disease. The American Cancer Society projects even higher figures for 2012, estimating that 47,150 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with leukemia and that approximately 23,540 patients will die from it.\n\nAs off target toxicity is driving the level of drug that a leukemia patient can receive, the fatality rate will be dramatically reduced if more drug substance can be delivered to the tumor with concomitant avoidance of toxicity to normal tissues. The nanoparticle technology described here is well positioned to advance the drug delivery field on a scientific level by demonstrating efficient delivery of therapeutics to leukemia cells. Combined with tumor delivery this technology could facilitate highly effective, \u00e6personalized\u00c6 cancer therapy that is not currently possible with routine systemic therapy. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/16/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jon O Nagy"
