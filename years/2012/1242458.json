 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a Virtual Institute called LIFE (Linked Institutions for Future Earth). This virtual institute aims to coordinate international research built on sharing unique experimental facilities, theoretical strengths, and field observations for advancing the quantitative, predictive understanding of the Earth surface system and its response to change. The project will  establish LIFE as a hub of international exchange in earth surface sustainability research, education, and public engagement.  \r\n\r\nThe focus of LIFE is on understanding and quantifying the vulnerability of the Earth surface system.  This virtual institute would embrace an interdisciplinary approach that brings projections of future climate and human activities to bear on Earth surface vulnerability, from watersheds to deltas through theme-based focused research campaigns with an emphasis on actionable research.\r\n\r\nLIFE will focus on seven major interconnected programs: (1) researcher exchange, (2) shared and co-mentored postdoctoral researchers, (3) international shared graduate degree programs, (4) theme-based focused research (mainly experimental and theoretical) campaigns, (5) international summer institutes for graduate students and young researchers, (6) data/model sharing for actionable research, and (7) science-to-public international exchange.  The approach also includes disseminating science to broader audiences by engaging the public on issues related to the sustainability of future Earth, the role of research in preventing and adopting to change, and the development of a forum for international exchange of science museum exhibits.  The project leverages resources in six countries: Uruguay, Chile, Italy, France, UK, and US.\r\n\r\nThis award is designated as a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.",
