 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digging into Human Rights Violations will develop methods and tools for discovering and visualizing the stories of hidden victims and unidentified perpetrators in collections of human rights violations reports and witness statements. This research in natural language processing is necessary because, a) collections documenting human rights violations frequently number many tens of thousands to tens of millions of documents, a scale that conceals victim, violation, and violator; b) many victim?s stories are only present as fragments in the reports and accounts of observers and survivors; and c) current tools excel at searching, not reading. \r\n\r\nThis project's computational reader, developed using collections compiled for various Truth and Reconciliation and Historical Clarification Committees, will consist of an engine for reconstructing stories from fragments scattered across a collection, and an interface for navigating those compiled stories and the documents from which they come. Although developed for use by investigators and prosecutors of human rights violations, this novel tool will expand the possibilities of text mining and will be generally useful for scholars, researchers, and practitioners with a need to track entities, events, and patterns across large document collections. The key development is to further work on anaphora resolution (where anaphora is the existence of an expression referring to another -- usually a pronoun to its antecedent). In some cases identifying anaphora relatively straightforward, but in many cases it presents a significant challenge to traditional natural language processing methods. This project will involve a combination of natural language processing and qualitative language analysis.\r\n\r\nThis project's broader impacts lie in its clear potential to inform scholars and government officials working on issues of human rights and in truth and reconciliation contexts. Further, the project includes significant student training, including training in interdisciplinary research methods.\r\n\r\nThis grant was made as part of the Digging Into Data Challenge, an international competition designed to foster research collaboration across countries and to encourage innovative approaches to analyzing large data sets in the social sciences and humanities. The US based researchers will collaborate with scholars in Canada to achieve the goals of this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nDigging into Human Rights Violations (DHRV) has worked for three years to develop a computational tool to support the reading of large text archives of human rights abuses in ways that facilitate the discovery of the stories of hidden victims and unidentified perpetrators that are only apparent when reading across large numbers of related documents.  This project was necessary because while collection efforts and the social web have vastly increased the number of witness statements to mass violence, technology supporting the reading of those collections did not exist.  Pursuing this goal required building an international network of statement custodians, developing a model for data sharing and the infrastructure to securely host it, learning from investigators about how they search and what kinds of data analysis facilitates investigations, consulting with archivists and lawyers about methods to preserve the integrity of the documentation, building a language processing infrastructure, adapting existing language processing tools to the task of reading diverse witness statements, developing new language processing resources to handle the unique challenges posed by those witness statements, and testing this complex infrastructure with real documentation of mass violations of human rights.  In collaboration with NGOs from the Netherlands, the US, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this project developed and tested its methods with an eye to better understand and investigate mass violations that occurred in Bosnia, Central Africa, South Africa, and the United States.\n\n \nThe most useful information, to investigators, government organizations, and prosecutors, emerges from unique and verifiable witness accounts.  In casualty counts, for example, only unique names make the final tally.  To arrive at the assessment that a report is unique and verifiable almost always requires uniquely identifying the victim.  The challenge presented by this need emerges from the storytelling origins of witness statements: rarely are full names used.  Witnesses, for many reasons, use pronouns to refer to most of the people in their observations of violence and survival.   Linguistically, a pronoun is an example of an anaphora, or a general word which carries forward the meaning of another more specific word, its corferent.  In language processing, anaphora resolution is a challenging but well-researched area that can help with the challenge posed by pronoun-filled testimony.  However, it is often only by looking to other documentation in a collection that a pronoun\u00c6s referent can be found.  This task is called cross-document coreference, and is a challenging and less-well researched area.  For three years, DHRV has worked to improve methods of cross-document coreference as they offer the best chance to help investigators of violations make their cases.\n \n \nThis research required building a team of computer scientists with expertise in data visualization and machine learning, historians, computational linguists, applied linguists, archivists, literary scholars, statisticians, and investigators.  In the course of this project, they developed methods to turn collections of unstructured witness statements into maps and graphs of pathways of individuals during crises; they developed new visualization techniques for this kind of data; they collected requirements from the community who works with this data day in and day out; they linked academic institutions, government agencies, and non-profits in the pursuit of mechanisms to facilitate discovery and research into the documentation of rights violations; they built capacity for future research in the area; and they helped train many graduate students in the many disparate fields that comprised this research endeavor.  One of the most poignant examples that emerged from this research occurred in our work with first responder reports from the World Trade Center attacks of 2001.  In our automated proc..."
