 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workshop on Recent Advances in General Topology, Dimension Theory, Continuum Theory and Dynamical Systems\r\n \r\nNipissing University, North Bay, Ontario will offer a Workshop on Recent Advances in General Topology, Dimension Theory, \r\nContinuum Theory, and Dynamical Systems in order to bring senior and junior researchers and students in these areas together \r\nfor a five-day series of talks and seminars. The workshop will be held at Nipissing University campus in North Bay, May 17-22, \r\n2012.  It will be jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the Fields Institute of Canada.  The scientific focus \r\nof the workshop will be on recent advances in topology, including dimension theory and continuum theory, and dynamical systems.  \r\nSenior researchers will share fundamental research techniques and recent results with attendees, including post-doctoral, \r\ngraduate and advanced undergraduate students, and junior researchers who received the PhD within the last 6 years.  Among other \r\ntopics, recent results on the topology of buried points in Julia sets, the solution of Lelek's problem on the span of continua, \r\nand extending isotopies of plane continua, all of which have application in both topology and dynamical systems, will be \r\ndiscussed.\r\n \r\nDynamical systems uses tools from many areas of mathematics, and motivates these same areas by raising questions, both \r\nfundamental and applied.  In the workshop, students and junior researchers, whose focus on the way to a PhD has necessarily \r\noften been narrow, will be exposed to research techniques and results that draw from multiple sources.  The areas of topology, \r\ndimension theory, and dynamical systems traditionally have experienced overlapping research interests, but it is somewhat \r\ndaunting for students to acquire the background needed to work in the overlap.  NSF support will enable at least 10 US-based \r\nstudents and junior researchers to attend the workshop and expand their research horizons.  Major speakers with international \r\nreputations are being selected who are active in these research areas.  The format of the workshop is designed to maximize the \r\nopportunities for interaction among the participants beyond the lectures.  Time is provided in the workshop schedule for both \r\nformal talks and informal interactions among the junior and senior participants, including every afternoon an informal question \r\nand answer session for the students and junior researchers with the day's speakers. The links formed are likely to have \r\ncontinuing impact on the research direction of both junior and senior participants.\r\n \r\nurl: http://www.nipissingu.ca/topology",
