 "awd_abstract_narration": "Korean Collaborators at the Ewha Womans University have expertise in fabricating an unusual type of MEMS (microelectro-mechanical) mirror array with a very large angular travel. We have expertise in astrophysical instrumentation and investigations. In order to apply the MEMS micromirror devices to astrophysics, we need to work with our collaborators in Korea to demonstrate that the devices can be scaled up in size, and refined to improve specific performance goals relevant to astrophysics observations, including the PSF spread. We therefore propose to work with our Korean collaborators to move our projects forward to the formal instrument proposal stage. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits\r\n\r\nThe proposed activity will make new astrophysics instrumentation possible. One application will allow pointed observations of astrophysical transients at least three orders of magnitude faster than ever before, opening up a completely new parameter space for inquiry. An obvious application is the study of optical emission from gamma-ray bursts, where observations of fast-peaking optical emission would be greatly advanced. A second application would bring a radical new technology to bear on multi-object and integral field spectroscopy, offering an alternative to previous fiber optic systems. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nUCB/SSL and Ewha will work together to build up new experimental astrophysics knowledge at Ewha, particularly among their post-doctoral researchers and students, while our UCB post-doctoral researchers and students will receive training and hands-on experience with MEMS mirror devices and instrumentation. Our group has collaborative education programs with exceptional engineering students at various universities and colleges in our area. These students will participate in our activities, including the development and operation of our instruments, in order to broaden participation of this student population in astrophysics, space research, and international collaborations. This student population is largely made up of groups that are underrepresented and underserved in astrophysics, space research, and international collaborations, including a large fraction of Hispanic students.",
