 "awd_abstract_narration": "For this CAREER proposal the researcher will study the structure of the lithosphere, from a characterization of its long-term mechanical strength (elastic thickness from gravity and topography inversions) and its short-term elastic response (seismic structure all the way down to the oil exploration scale), to its propensity for deformation in the context of plate tectonics and geodynamics (via the anisotropies detectable in both types of observables). The researcher uses existing data from land campaigns (gravity, magnetics, heat flow), satellites (gravity, magnetics, geodesy) and seismic networks and data centers (USArray, IRIS); some processed, some raw, some for which new processing methods are very much part of the research. He is building on his recent development of mathematical functions and statistical estimation theory. \r\nThese share the common ground of analyzing noisy and incomplete geophysical observations in a variety of acquisition geometries, and building parsimonious interpretations of them based on recent insights in statistical inference and geophysical inverse theory. In this way the geophysical and geological interpretation that he produces is accompanied by a rigorous analysis of modeling errors, an assessment of the uniqueness in the inversion, and the effective communication of uncertainty to the audience. The tools the researcher develops are put at the service of the community via a series of outreach initiatives aimed at enabling rather than merely informing the public over a range of prior exposure and ability, from middle-school students to post-doctoral scholars. The education and outreach building on these activities are geared towards training young people to do science rather than watching it being done.\r\n\r\nHow strong is the rigid outer layer of the Earth called the \"lithosphere\", how is this strength best measured, and how does it relate to other geophysical and geological observables such as the depth and frequency of earthquake occurrence, the measurable heat flow through the crust, the large-scale patterns of deformation and mountain building? How do we tackle huge data-rich \"inverse problems\" in seismology, by which the structure of the Earth at both the largest scale or at the scales of an oil field is mapped via the recording and modeling of earthquake- or explosively generated seismic waveforms? What characterizes the magnetic properties of the lithosphere and how are they best measured from primary satellite observations? The answers we hope to provide are of a geological and geophysical nature and significance, but also impact us in our daily lives. Earthquakes are an obvious example; but perhaps not everyone knows, that oil drilling requires detailed models of the lithospheric magnetic field in order to keep the desired bearing, or that medical imaging techniques such as x-ray tomography and magneto-encephalography work with some of the same principles by which we probe the Earth's interior. With our focus on the development of theory and algorithms that help us extract signal from observations, and facilitate its representation, analysis and characterization, and the subsequent evaluation of the distribution of errors in the modeling, we serve a broader purpose than the specific areas in which these methods are first applied. To ensure this, the researcher also develops lesson materials at the middle-school and high-school level with the student as participant, a hands-on research and writing-heavy Freshman Seminar that combines geology and geophysics to aid with archaeological excavations on Cyprus, the continued publication and documentation of computer software on the web, and the mentoring of undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs on their path to delivering ``reproducible research'' to the society at large.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe lithosphere is the relatively rigid outer elastic layer of the Earth overlying its mantle, which deforms visco-elastically and plastically. Lithospheric structure is apparent from how fast seismic waves travel through it; this speed has an isotropic component and one that depends on the direction and polarization of the waves. Isotropic seismic wavespeed variations are sensitive to temperature and compositional contrasts, and their anisotropic behavior provides a measure of geologic deformation, as recorded by the preferential alignment of intrinsically anisotropic minerals such as olivine, a primary constituent of the Earth's upper mantle. Wave speeds are also influenced by mass density, and this suggests that spatial variations in Earth's gravitational field provide complementary information about mantle structure. In an original twist on this well-known dependence we have been investigating how the Earth's gravity field may also be sensitive to large-scale deformational  structures.\n\n\nTeasing out the mechanistic interdependence between seismic wave speeds, gravitational perturbations, and topography required the development of specialized multivariate, multidimensional directional power-spectral measurements of the relation between those three fields. The identification of predominant directions of ``mechanical anisotropy'' (which we first identified in the Australian continent) and their analysis in comparison with measurements of seismic anisotropy that this enabled, delineated the 250--300~km thick stable part of the lithosphere from that affected by mantle flow, and established new constraints on the local depth profile of mantle viscosity. With the support of this grant, we revisited the issue of continental strength anisotropy, with a now global scope. Suprisingly, our primary case study, the North American continent, does not exhibit meaningful anisotropy in its mechanical strength. Similarly, a global reanalysis of continental gravity and topography produces only scant evidence for lithospheric flexural anisotropy. We developed a series of statistical and geophysical tests for anisotropy, and specifically evaluate the potential for spurious results with synthetically generated data.  \nThe detailed consideration of the statistical nature of some geoscientific problems primes them for new discovery. What is the elastic thickness of the lithosphere? Some have maintained that old continents respond elastically to tectonic loading and mountain building over a thickness well exceeding 100 km, but some have argued instead that all the elastic strength resides in a merely 25 km thick upper region. The debate has profound implications for understanding the generation of crustal earthquakes and the long-term maintenance of stability through elastic forces in the  lithosphere. Both interpretations use the same data: topography and gravity anomalies. Why are the conclusions so divergent? At the largest scales, gravitational anomalies express terrestrial dynamics such as mantle convection. At shorter scale lengths they reflect perturbations to the density structure some tens of km below the surface. In places an isostatic balance prevails: mountains float like icebergs with roots in the deformable mantle. Where isostasy fails to explain the data, elastic, flexural stresses may support topography. Mountain-building, magmatic and other geological processes are loads that perturb an undisturbed and layered state, thereby producing gravitational anomalies. We know the differential equations that express the balance of both terms but we do not know the inputs precisely, and we only observe the sum of the outputs: gravity anomalies and surface topography. Mathematically speaking, the flexural strength is the unknown parameter of the differential equations. Geologically, it is the depth to which elastic effects play a role in shaping the Earth's surface. Geophysically, this quantity has much bearing onthe overall rheology, or deformation-behavior, of the lithosphere, and thereby on processes such as the generation of earthquakes at depth.\n\n\n\n\nReformulating the thick-versus-thin lithosphere problem in a form amenable to maximum-Whittle-likelihood theory yields unbiased, minimum-variance estimates of flexural rigidity and some auxiliary quantities, separably resolved.  We derived the properties of the estimators and showed how they can be found by a computational implementation of theoretical results that yields analytical forms for their variance. Our procedure is well-posed and computationally tractable.  The resulting algorithms are validated by extensive simulations whose behavior is well matched by an analytical theory. There are numerous tests for its applicability to real-world situations. In particular we have commenced a Matern-covariance-parameterized analysis of the statistical properties of the lithospheres of Venus and Mars, with that of other planets and moons forthcoming.\n\nThroughout our support period we have focused on the development of computational methods, and on the teaching of computational literacy to undergraduates, graduate students, and colleagues, through seminars, lectures, workshops, and conference sessions. In equal measure with the scientific outcomes from this grant, publications, and methodology in the form of publicly available software that we developed, we pride ourselves on leaving a legacy in the form of a new generation of computer-savvy problem solvers with geosciences degrees, ready to tackle the scientific and societal problems of the future. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frederik J Simons"
