 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study seeks to address how the genomes of different birds respond to hybridization and what keeps them distinct. The two forms of the Western Scrub-Jay, one found in coastal California and the other in the interior United States, have different plumage colors and different bill shapes that are adapted to local resources. This study will look at an area of contact between them to address two important questions that are currently intensely debated in the field of evolutionary theory: (1) whether genetic divergence on the sex chromosomes plays an outsized role in keeping species separate; and (2) whether genomic divergence tends to accumulate in just a few places in the genome, or whether divergence is more evenly spread out throughout the genome. To accomplish this, the researchers will use novel methods for sequencing large subsets of the genomes of many individuals found inside and outside a contact zone near Lake Tahoe.\r\n\t\r\nUnderstanding how species remain distinct despite the fact that they sometimes interbreed and exchange genes is an important basic question in evolutionary biology bearing on how and why biodiversity is generated. It is also important from the standpoint of protecting and managing our country's existing wealth of biodiversity, because there are many natural and human-mediated cases of hybridization between economically important species. This research will lead to a better understanding of how the genome responds to hybridization, and what keeps species distinct.",

Basic knowledge of the units of biodiversity and how they are formed &ndash; and sometimes unformed &ndash; help us understand how species adapt to a changing world and how we can protect biodiversity in the future. We focused on a common North American backyard bird, the Western Scrub-Jay, which has a distinct appearance in different parts of its geographic range, suggesting the formation of new species.

In practical terms, this means that the common backyard bird, the Western Scrub-Jay, will soon likely be split into three species, one along the Pacific Coast, one in the Interior United States and northern Mexico, and one endemic to southern Mexico. We also determined that there is only one location where two of these groups come into contact and hybridize, in the mountain of western Nevada.
