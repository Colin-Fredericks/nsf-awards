 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support hosting LittleFe buildouts as part of the HPC Educators Program at the Supercomputing 12 and Supercomputing 13 Conferences, and for the first external evaluation of the LittleFe project. LittleFe is a complete 6 node Beowulf style portable computational cluster which supports shared memory parallelism (OpenMP), distributed memory parallelism (MPI), and GPGPU parallelism (CUDA). These low-cost light-weight units are well-suited for institutions and teaching environments that do not have access to parallel platforms for parallel and distributed computing education. Teaching key concepts such as speedup, efficiency, and load balancing are much more effectively done on a parallel platform. These units will also support parallel programming and distributed computing in the undergraduate CS curriculum at colleges and universities. They will also support student programming contests which will be hosted at e.g. the XSEDE12 and XSEDE13 conferences, and outreach events at junior and senior high schools across the United States.",
