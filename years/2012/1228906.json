(The German participant costs are supported by their own funds.)  By sharing ideas and technology, and by exchange of visits between PIs and students, the project is accelerating progress in autonomous mobile manipulation in human environments.  The labs have complementary strengths and the project is expected to benefit both sides.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to expand the applications of robotics to include autonomous manipulation in human environments.  As this technology is refined and ultimately commercialized, it will expand the impact of robots, as well as transform the robotics industry.  Likely applications include eldercare, assisting the disabled, and rehabilitation, which are of great significance both economically and in the quality of our lives.\r\n\r\nThe project directly supports the education of graduate students, and scientific communication and collaboration across the Atlantic. Recruiting and outreach associated with the project will continue the PIs' tradition of inclusion of underrepresented groups.  When appropriate, results will be incorporated into course curricula and in the PIs' ongoing outreach efforts.  Code will be distributed open-source.",
