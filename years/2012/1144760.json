 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Diana Karwan is awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to implement a research and education program based at the University of Delaware.  The research will be conducted between multiple sites in the Critical Zone Observatory network.  Specifically, this study aims to quantify suspended sediment composition and link geochemical differences in stream sediment to their distinct watershed sources and the hydrologic paths by which sediments move from the landscape to the stream.  First, the stream and watershed sediments will be analyzed for their composition with particular emphasis on elemental mineral content, stable isotopes, such as Carbon-13 and Nitrogen-15, and radioisotopes, such as Carbon-14, Cesium-137, Lead-210.  This data will be used in combination with statistical models and knowledge of the watershed hydrology to assess the likely source of stream sediments and how this source varies seasonally and with precipitation.  Understanding variations in sediment source and composition will lend valuable insights into the relative importance of different mechanisms by which sediment reaches the stream, such as bank collapse, surface erosion, and bank seepage.   This insight will, in turn, allow for the design of more effective and targeted watershed management and restoration strategies.\r\n\r\nConsiderable environmental concerns surround the watershed export of suspended sediment, such as drinking water quality, stream habitat health, biogeochemical cycles, and estuarine and delta function.  In addition to studying the mechanisms behind sediment delivery, Dr. Karwan will work with an established environmental education program to increase the watershed literacy of school-aged children.  By adding her study watershed to the existing Model My Watershed project, urban and sub-urban students will be able to explore the links between forests and stream water flows in an interactive, online simulation game.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n This project investigated the source, movement, and output of sediments in two Pennsylvania watersheds associated with Critical Zone Observatories.  Throughout this project, we have compiled and analyzed unique sediment and stream geochemical data to answer questions about sources and exports of stream sediments.  We have documented the importance of storm-timescale chemical data to sediment fingerprinting and the usefulness of chemical profiles within the soil as time-scale markers to align with much longer landscape formation studies.  Such information is critical for understanding the links between landscapes, land cover change, disturbance and water quality as measured by suspended sediment.\n\n  In the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, we have determined an average of 270 kg per year of solid material exited the 8 ha watershed between 2010 &ndash; 2013, equaling approximately 0.01 mm of material per square meter of watershed area.  This is less than the long-term erosion rate computed by colleagues, suggesting storage in the watershed prior to export and, perhaps, differences between short term and long term erosion processes.  Within this forested watershed, tip up mounds, generated from trees blown over by wind, provide one key source of mobile soil and sediment.  We have evaluated soil profiles from tip up mounds using radionuclide profiles and found that representative older mounds, where the trunk of the tree has already degraded, were likely formed after c. 1963.\n\n In the White Clay Creek watershed of the Christina River Basin Critical Zone Observatory, we investigated the patterns of sediment export and used chemical signals from sediments and water to investigate their recent source and flow paths.  Water and sediment samples analyzed during the course of this project were collected between the fall of 2010 and the fall of 2012.  This includes Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee, Hurricane Sandy and several smaller storms.  Sediment rare earth element composition indicates many similarities between suspended sediment and gully wall material.  Sediment radioisotope composition indicates differences in sediment cycling between individual events.  Stream sediment is likely stored within the channel prior to export during typical summer thunderstorms, however, not necessarily during more extreme events. Chemical data from the isotopic composition of water molecules supports this &ndash; indicating different combinations of rain, soil, and groundwater comprise the stream water across events.  This includes major differences between the hurricanes.  Hurricane Irene had a relatively large contribution from precipitation and is one of the few events, with sediment chemistry indicating landscape surface contributions to the suspended sediment.  Stream water during Hurricane Sandy had proportionally higher contribution from soil water and groundwater.  Throughout the course of this project, we have also documented storm level variation in the fallout of beryllium-7, a naturally-produced radioisotope currently popular with short term erosion tracing.  Such variability was previously hypothesized, but not measured.\n\n During the course of this postdoctoral fellowship, Dr. Karwan furthered her cross-disciplinary education in hydrology and fluvial geomorphology.  Students from both the University of Delaware and the University of Minnesota were trained in field collection techniques (sediment collection and soil coring) and laboratory analysis of water, soils, and sediments for chemical composition including short-term fallout radionuclides.  The data produced from this project has been presented at national and international science conferences, local watershed management meetings, published in scientific journals, and included in problems for the hydrology and watershed management class at the University of Minnesota.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Diana L Karwan"
