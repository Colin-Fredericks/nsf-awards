 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Connecting Researchers and Public Audiences project will engage the public in understanding how species are born.  The project builds on the PI's NSF-funded research on speciation and signal diversification in Monarcha Flycatchers of the Solomon Islands (NSF CAREER, #1137624).  Project deliverables include a one-hour television program, website, and the use of social media.  The team proposes to film an engaging tale that weaves historical research with modern molecular techniques to communicate to the public how new species are born.  It will also illustrate the process of science and the people behind the research.\r\n\r\nThe potential national audience is large, with a particular effort to reach 18-49 year olds.  The program will be nationally distributed by one of the major television or cable channels.  The website will provide a video gallery of short videos and photos, a blog from the field, and an in-depth learning section with new research about speciation. \r\n\r\nEvaluation of the project, conducted by Education Northwest, will focus on changes in audience knowledge and interest about speciation.  The findings of the summative evaluation will be made available online at InformalScience.org.",
