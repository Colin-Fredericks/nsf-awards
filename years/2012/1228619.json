 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social scientists know at least two important things about law and politics in the United States. First, public opinion matters. What the public prefers - and what it will tolerate - is an important element of many aspects of law and politics, as in the support the public is willing to extend to legal institutions, especially when they make unpopular decisions. Second, states matter. The U.S. is a federal system, so states always matter. But when it comes to law, the vast majority of legal activity takes place in the individual states. It follows, therefore, that public opinion in each of the American states is important.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the social sciences, the large survey data bases have been far more concerned with ordinary politics (primarily electoral), rather than law and politics, and therefore have not surveyed the American people on issues relevant to those concerned with law and politics.\r\n\r\nThis project will produce a state public opinion data base on this topic that can be used by scholars of widely varying theoretical foci. Marrying a newly developed statistical methodology that can derive state-level estimates from national survey data to an existing survey data base focused on legal matters, this project promises to create a treasure-trove of measures of how the residents of individual states feel about numerous issues of law and politics. For instance, this project will allow the assessment of whether the methods of selecting and retaining judges in the American states have any consequences for public attitudes toward law and courts. By creating and disseminating state-level measures of public opinion on law and legal institutions, this project will stimulate new efforts to understand the relationships between the judiciaries and their constituents, the people of the American states.",
