 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide the Phase 2 systems engineering for the Global Environment for Network \r\nInnovations (GENI) project.   GENI, a virtual laboratory for exploring future internet technologies \r\nand protocols  at scale, creates major opportunities to understand, innovate and transform \r\nglobal networks and their interactions with society. Via the flexible and dynamic deployment of \r\nexperiments onto common infrastructure, GENI re-imagines the methodology of both network system \r\nresearch  and of potential early deployments and evaluation. It enables repeatable experiments \r\non large, complex, networked systems  At scale demonstrations of transformational ideas \r\nincreases the opportunity for significant socio-economic impact. \r\n\r\nAt the start of the GENI program it was not clear that GENI was technically feasible. An early major goal was to show \r\nits feasibility. To this end, the GPO started a series of rapid, community-created prototypes via ?spiral development? \r\nso that hands on experience could drive its evolution. Each GENI spiral is 12 months long, and aims to drive down \r\nspecific technical and programmatic risks.  This proposal supports the engineering activities of spirals 4, 5 and 6.   \r\nThe task categories associated with the proposal are:\r\na)\tExperiment support and direct aid to the research teams attempting to use the GENI prototype, including training \r\nand tools.\r\nb)\tContinued progress towards full Integration and Operations of the current GENI prototype including \r\ndeployment of GENI racks, enhancing the integration with Internet 2 and National Lambda Rail, additional \r\nWiMax integration, campus expansion with the goal of having between 100 to 200 campuses ?GENI enabled?, and \r\ntransition for 24x7 operations managed by Indiana University.\r\nc)\tFormalization and documentation of the GENI architecture.\r\nd)\tSystems Engineering work including security analysis of the GENI infrastructure, instrumentation and \r\nmeasurement tools and infrastructure, and subcontract technical management.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The engineering process of building GENI has directly engaged the newest generation of \r\nfaculty in students in a large-scale systems project.   The experience of building a large-scale system \r\nis an educational opportunity that is providing direct benefit to the US computer research community. GENI \r\nis already being used as an instrument for research.   This proposal supports and broadens the availability \r\nand usability of the research instrument.\r\n",

The GENI project office and the GENI community have built GENI with an initial at-scale deployment now in place. GENI&rsquo;s use in the classroom is lowering the barrier for laboratory-based learning in computer science education.

More researchers from the GENI community are publishing their results &ndash; the <a href=\"http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/GENIBibliography\" target=\"_blank\">bibliography of GENI-relevant publications</a> now includes hundreds of entries.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Educators continue to develop GENI-based curriculum and employ GENI in their classrooms. Over 55 different instructors now regularly use GENI in their classes. In the last complete semester (Spring 2016), instructors used GENI in at least 25 different courses with total enrollment of hundreds of students.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Future Directions</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The GENI community and GENI technology are playing a vital role in leading the development of research cyberinfrastructure.
