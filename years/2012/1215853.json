 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geological carbon dioxide storage can be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions only if the carbon dioxide remains in deep geological formations for thousands of years. Unfortunately free-phase carbon dioxide in sedimentary basins is less dense than the formation water and therefore leakage of carbon dioxide from these storage reservoirs back to the surface is a major concern. Over time, however, carbon dioxide dissolves into formation waters and increases the water density. Dissolved carbon dioxide will then sink to deeper parts of the sedimentary basins and it is very unlikely to surface again. The faster carbon dioxide dissolves the sooner it is stored safely. This project will evaluate the dissolution of CO2 on two scales:  (1) The geological and geochemical record of a large natural carbon dioxide reservoir called Bravo Dome in New Mexico will be used estimate how fast carbon dioxide has dissolved on the geologic timescale and how tight the natural CO2 trap has been; (2) This study will also build scaled laboratory models for the transport of the dissolved carbon dioxide that determine the overall rate of carbon dioxide dissolution. The spatial structure of the dissolved carbon dioxide currents will be imaged with x-ray tomography. The experiments will be used to calibrate a dynamic model that can then be used to model laboratory observations and to interpret the observed field data to constrain the dissolution and sequestration rates for CO2 over long time.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together fluid mechanics, geology, and geochemistry and will provide a first estimate of carbon dioxide dissolution rates in the field, to inform the debate about the long-term safety of geological carbon dioxide storage. The experimental study will address several fundamental questions about the migration of solutes due to density differences that have implications for a broad set of questions for salt-water intrusion to geothermal energy.  The models that will be developed will capture the essential physics of these processes. The development of such models is key to enable uncertainty quantification in geological CO2 storage.",

The CO<sub>2</sub> is captured and injected into a deep geological formation for storage.&nbsp; One of the scientific question is simply: \"Is the injected CO<sub>2</sub> is stored permanently or will it leak back into the atmosphere?\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Injected CO<sub>2</sub> can leak to the surface, because it is less dense water and hence rises like CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles in sparling water - albeit much slower. An argument for the permanency of storage is that CO<sub>2</sub> will&nbsp; dissolve into the surrounding water. Interestingly, CO<sub>2</sub>-saturated water is denser and will sink towards greater depth, ensuring permanent storage. The convective currents set up by the density increase of CO<sub>2</sub>-saturated water can also accelerate the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution. However, even in the presence of convection, CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution is still too slow to observe it in pilot projects and so questions remain as to how fast this dissolution occurs and whether all injected CO<sub>2</sub> will dissolve.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Natural CO<sub>2</sub> reservoirs &nbsp;provide the only&nbsp;analogue for the long-term evolution of geological CO<sub>2</sub> storage. &nbsp;It is important to understand to what extent these natural CO<sub>2</sub> fields can serve as&nbsp;analogues for engineered geological CO<sub>2</sub> storage.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the first aim of this project was to understand the evolution of Bravo Dome, the largest natural CO<sub>2</sub> field in the U.S. and answer two basic questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is Bravo Dome a good&nbsp;analogue for engineered geological CO<sub>2</sub> storage?</li>\n<li>Why has the CO<sub>2</sub> at Bravo Dome not dissolved into the aquifer entirely?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The short answer to question 1 is that the Bravo Dome CO<sub>2</sub> reservoir is not a good analogue to understand the dissolution of CO<sub>2</sub> into the aquifer.</p>\n<p>This is due to two important differences between Bravo Dome and engineered storage sites. First, the CO<sub>2</sub> at Bravo Dome is at low pressure and therefore gaseous, while engineered storage projects aim to inject CO<sub>2</sub> under supercritical conditions. Second, Bravo Dome is compartmentalized and does not communicate with the larger aquifer (Figure 2). This means that CO<sub>2</sub> at Bravo Dome is stored in a set of closed boxes, while engineered&nbsp;storage projects must inject CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;into open formations to reduce pressure build-up during injection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our work has shown that convective dissolution of CO<sub>2</sub> at low pressure and in a closed system (Bravo Dome) behaves differently from that of supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> in an open system. In the closed system, CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution leads to a pressure drop&nbsp;in the gas&nbsp;and hence to a reduction of the dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the water. This provides a negative feedback that progressively slows down convection and hence the CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution rate (Figure 5). In contrast, in an open system&nbsp;the inflow of water maintains the pressure and convective dissolution can proceed at approximately constant rate.</p>\n<p>This means that CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution at Bravo Dome is slower than would be expected in an engineered storage site and may have ceased altogether. Our conclusion may also be applicable to other natural CO<sub>2</sub> reservoirs in the continental U.S., because many are at relatively low pressure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second objective of this project was to understand the dynamics of convective dissolution and how they control the dissolution rate of the CO<sub>2</sub>. Our experiments aimed to quantify two aspects of convection:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What controls the convective pattern?</li>\n<li>What controls the convective mass flux?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our experiments show clearly that the convective pattern is controlled by mechanical dispersion, i.e., the additional spreading of the solute induced by&nbsp;variations of the fluid velocity around its mean. Because dispersion increases linearly with both bead size and convective velocity the pattern in a permeable&nbsp; bead pack with large beads is coarser than in a fine grained one (Figure 3). This is the opposite of the predictions from previous work, which used a Rayleigh number based on molecular diffusion (Figure 4). A major fundamental result of this project is that we have identified a new dispersive Rayleigh number that does predict the convective pattern.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our experiments also show that mechanical dispersion reduces the convective flux and hence the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution. We have used direct numerical simulations to show that it is the inherent anisotropy of mechanical dispersion, i.e., its dependence on the direction of flow, that reduces the convective flux. The anisotropy breaks the symmetry of the columnar pattern and leads to a fan flow pattern. The fan flow geometry is less effective because it forces the plumes further apart and hence reduces the number of downwelings per unit area.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While it has long been suspected that mechanical dispersion influences convection in porous media. This project is the first to quantify the effect of dispersion and to explain how it affects both flux and pattern. Our results are important because they show that numerical simulations that ignore dispersion will overestimate CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution and make predictions for storage security that are too optimistic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/04/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marc&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hesse</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215853/1215853_10199566_1533233416327_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215853/1215853_10199566_1533233416327_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Convective pattern formation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215853/1215853_10199566_1533233416327_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Convective pattern formation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4: Image on the left shows the spacing of the convective fingers as function of the molecular Rayleigh number.
