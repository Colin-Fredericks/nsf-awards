 "awd_abstract_narration": "1241582\r\nThomas\r\n\r\nThis proposed research will significantly enhance the body of knowledge for water remediation, environmental sustainability, nano porous filtration membranes, and sensing and delivery platforms using non-toxic natural materials, supporting the basis for the next generation of economically sustainable devices. Strategies to assess structure, properties and performance, resulting from this research, will include determining how precursor type and viscosity, composition, temperature, catalyst, substrate surface energy constrain fabrication of nanofiber membrane systems. The scientific goal is to enable the cost-effective production of nontoxic sustainable biodegradable cactus membranes for two specific applications: (i) filtering and (ii) sensing. Preliminary investigations by the PIs have led to a successful experimental fabrication of novel cactus nanofiber membranes with varied geometry, providing promise for scalability for future commercialization. The research activities in this proposal will contribute to scientific breakthroughs for understanding and implementing natural materials as membrane systems. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will provide fundamental understanding of how current and future natural material membrane systems can affect water, wastewater, overall environmental quality, and public health issues. With the knowledge gained from this novel research we will be able to make a global impact, addressing environmental, social/health care, economical, and engineering design needs. This research can impact worldwide water filtration and ultimately lead to further investigations for air and gas filtration, oil absorption, sensors, tissue scaffolding, drug delivery, enzyme transporting, food additive, and textiles. In addition, through workshops and student mentoring with the Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NSF AMP), Society of Women Engineers (SWE), the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), we will broaden the research impact for underrepresented minority students and faculty. Overall, this novel research will increase the body of knowledge in the field of electrospun natural fibers through comprehensive optimization and characterization of this novel nanofiber and transform how natural products can be utilized by engineers and scientists for future technology to help sustain separation technology on a global level.",
