The CSR provides an apolitical forum for leaders in the chemical sciences and engineering, with the objective of enhancing understanding of issues that affect government, academic, national laboratory and nonprofit sectors. These discussions provide a vehicle for interaction among the participants, and for education, exchange of information and discussion of issues and trends that affect the chemical sciences. CSR members are appointed by the National Research Council's Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology; membership consists of 30-35 volunteer chemical scientists and engineers from academia, industry, government, the national laboratories, and the non-profit sector. The results of CSR discussions and workshops will be disseminated through workshop reports made available through professional societies, scientific and trade publications, and on the web.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Chemical Sciences Roundtable (CSR) is a long-standing activity of the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.  It is a unique, science-oriented, apolitical forum of leaders of the chemical enterprise with three objectives:\n  \n1. to enhance communication across industrial, academic, and  governmental sectors, across chemical sciences and engineering, and across the subfields of chemistry;\n2. to identify and explore important, relevant topics in a neutral, high-profile setting; and\n3. to disseminate information about the topics, and any related events and discussions, to the chemical and chemical engineering community.\n\nThe Roundtable accomplishes these objectives in two ways.  First, through an exchange of information among its members at two annual in-person business meetings and two virtual meetings, where members discuss issues and topics and which of those merit further exploration through the organization of a workshop.  Second, by organizing workshops on highly relevant and important topics and disseminating published summaries or proceedings throughout the chemical sciences community and beyond to the policy, industrial, or education communities, as appropriate.\n\nBelow are descriptions of the CSR workshops held from 2012-2015 (workshop summaries are available for free download at http://dels.nas.edu/bcst/Workshop-Summaries):\n\nChemistry and Engineering of Shale Gas and Tight Oil Resource Development May 2015\n\nThis workshop focused on the role of chemistry and chemical engineering at each stage of the hydraulic fracturing process--from formulation of the chemicals and fluids that enable hydraulic fracturing to development of methods to enhance resource recovery. \n\nMesoscale Chemistry, November 2014\n\nThis workshop centered on research on chemical phenomena with a particular focus on the collective and emergent behaviors at the mesoscale.\n\nTechnological Challenges in Antibiotic Discovery and Development, September 2013\n\nThis workshop explored the current state of antibiotic development, examining the technology available to facilitate development, the technical challenges present, identifying approaches to antibiotic discovery, and discussing the incentives and disincentives industry faces in antibiotic development.\n\nUndergraduate Chemistry Education, May 2013\n\nThis workshop focused on identifying potential drivers for change, barriers to curricular modifications, and new results from large-scale innovations with special emphasis on those that are transferable, widely applicable, and/or proven successful.\n\nOpportunities and Obstacles in Large-Scale Biomass Utilization&mdash;the Role of the Chemical Sciences, May 2012\n\nThis workshop explored the current state of sustainable fuels and chemicals, and the issues surrounding their scalability for large-scale use. The workshop also discussed the chemistry and chemical engineering opportunities to sustainably produce large-scale quantities of biofuel.\n\nThe CSR is a neutral forum for discussion and illumination of important issues and topics related to the chemical sciences and engineering, bringing together researchers, administrators, and representatives of industry, who may not cross paths in other venues. CSR workshops involve researchers from diverse disciplines and subdisciplines, providing a venue that enhances research networks and collaboration by fostering new relationships between disciplines and industrial sectors.\n\nThe results of CSR workshops are disseminated to the chemistry and chemical engineering communities, policy and decision makers, and the broader public, enhancing awareness of issues that impact the conduct of research and improving scientific and technological understanding of issues of national concern. The CSR serves as an important and unique bridge between the science and engineering communities and the federal sector. More information about the Chemical Sciences Roundtable is avail..."
