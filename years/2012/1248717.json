Current market tools do not appear to have the capabilities to detect these security holes in an automatic fashion. Parameter tampering vulnerabilities are rampant in commercial as well as open source web applications. Further, it has been shown that these vulnerabilities could be exploited by malicious actors to make financial gains.  \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the proposed solution is unique in the sense that it offers not only to detect the web security, but also to fix the issue by correcting the code.  If successfully deployed, this effort holds the promise of addressing an emerging security threat in a manner that is both robust and cost-effective.",
