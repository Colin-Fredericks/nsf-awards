 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Brigham Young University Herbarium is the largest herbarium in the Intermountain west in size (560,000 specimens), species representation, and geographic breadth. Increased storage capacity has become an urgent priority for the herbarium given normal growth rates and the acquisition of 36,000 specimens by gift and adoption of a regionally important collection orphaned by the Forest Service.  This project will address immediate needs and long term growth by installing compact storage with 113 double-wide herbarium cabinets. This project will also provide the means to capture digital images of specimens and to database collection data associated with each specimen, both of which will be made available on-line for public accessibility.  In total, 84,000 specimens will be imaged and databased, resulting in a 620% increase in databased specimens and 17% of the total collection being online by the project termination.\r\n\r\nThe BYU herbarium is frequently used by government agencies and land managers, for scholarly research, and for public outreach and education. By providing physical accessibility to the orphaned collection and online accessibility to collection data and images, this project will enhance the value and usefulness of this resource by all patrons. Accomplishing this project will provide training to student curators in a mentored-learning environment that emphasizes curatorial practices and the value of specimen-based data.  Online accessibility includes tools for exploring biodiversity in several ways.  A museum exhibit focusing on collection-based research will be constructed that includes a computer kiosk for exploring plant diversity and the role and application of biological collections in contemporary life.",
