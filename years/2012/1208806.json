 "awd_abstract_narration": "Past deep ice cores recovered from the Greenland Ice Sheet have failed to obtain intact Eemian ice, ice from the last interglacial period.  The recent NEEM effort has successfully recovered ~150 m of such ice.  The proposed continuous sonic monitoring of the ice fabric will resolve small scale variability that is missed by the traditional techniques used in thin section analyses of ice cores, which tend to under-sample the core.  The scales to be recovered with the sonic sampling are more comparable to those that can be observed with new gas-sampling technologies.  The proposed work would add to the physical data set required to fully interpret data being recovered from the NEEM ice core, such as the gas content analyses used to infer past atmospheric conditions.  The presence of a special USGS winch this summer, a winch required for the operation of University of Washington instrument proposed for deployment, and the planned abandonment of the NEEM field camp after the summer of 2012, make this proposal appropriate for a RAPID award.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe project will provide international experience for a graduate student and support for a female scientist during the formative years of her career.  It will contribute to international collaborations with Scandinavia.",

This ice core is currently being interpreted by scientists for its record of climate history.

Of particular interest, the core contains the first recoverable fold ever reported in an ice core. The folding caused certain time periods recorded in the ice core to appear multiple times and upside down. Since the folding is recoverable, NEEM researchers have been able to \"unfold\" the fold to determine the original order the ice layers were in before folding. Recent new observations from deep ice-penetrating radar images collected by NASA's IceBridge Program show that folding of the deep layers is relatively common across central and northern Greenland.\n\nThe value of sonic logging and fabric studies\n\nThe goal of our project was to measure the velocity of sound through ice, which tells us about the effective viscosity of the ice. An ice crystal has a layered structure &ndash; similar to a deck of cards. It is much easier to shear an ice crystal along the molecular layers than to deform it any other way. Because of the 'slipperiness' of shearing along the layers within the ice crystal, the orientation of ice crystals matters.\n\nThe orientation of a single crystal is defined by its c-axis, the vector that points perpendicular to the molecular layers. Crystal fabric, then, is the statistical distribution of c-axes directions. Deep in an ice sheet, the deformation tends to rotate the crystals until most of the crystals have their layers oriented horizontally and c-axes oriented vertically.

We can then compare this measurement to thin slices (\"thin sections\")of the ice observed through crossed polarizing lenses to further understand the fabric that are measured every 10-50m. \n\nIntellectual merit and broader impacts\n\nThis study is the first sonic-log based crystal fabric study of ice in the zone of the first identified, recoverable folds in an ice core. The interplay between folding, crystal fabric, and ice rheological behavior is a mostly uninvestigated area that may prove critical for characterizing and modeling ice sheet dynamics.

A Greenland-wide melt event was observed for the first time in historical record during the summer of 2012; several similar events have been identified during the Eemian portion of this ice core.\n\nResults to date\n\nOur study presents the results of the sonic log, a continuous record of fabric throughout the entire depth of the borehole. We corrected the sonic velocities for pressure and temperature in order to calculate fabric values. Our continuous sonic-based fabric log agrees well with the thin section-based fabric record, b..."
