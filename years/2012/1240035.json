 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I project establishes the STEM EduGators to increase the quantity and quality of STEM majors who enter the teaching profession.  A total of fifty $10,000 scholarships for undergraduate students entering the final student teaching experience and ninety $4950 summer internships are being awarded. The Program is expanding opportunities for 10 undergraduates per year who need financial assistance as they continue their major in a mathematics or science discipline while acquiring a minor in education. The Noyce Summer Internship Program provides 18 STEM EduGators with job opportunities in informal science education settings.  Project partners include the University of Florida's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and College of Education, the Alachua County school district, and the PK Yonge Development Research School. The project, using formative and summative assessment as well as an external evaluator, is tracking the Noyce scholars to determine outcomes of bringing STEM majors into teaching. The project includes research on and support for Noyce Scholars as they enter the teaching profession. \r\n\r\nThe Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program operates as a component of the University of Florida UFTeach program. During their first four years of full-time teaching, the Noyce Scholars are expected to impact and enhance learning for approximately 18,000 students. The first cohorts of UFTeach students recruited from fall 2009 through spring 2011 indicate that the program is significantly increasing the number and diversity of STEM majors going into teaching. Over the five-year duration of funding ninety informal science education internships are being awarded. Each intern is reaching out to hundreds of school children and citizens.",
