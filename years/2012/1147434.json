 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a long-term project to study regeneration in tropical forests. The neoSelvas project unites six independently developed studies in a coordinated effort to understand and predict vegetation change during regeneration of tropical forests following pasture abandonment or shifting cultivation in Central and South America. It compares temporal variation in forest structure and species composition within plots with spatial variation observed among plots of different ages (a chronosequence). Over the coming five years, annual inventory data will be used to calculate rates of recruitment and mortality of tree and shrub species in different stages of regeneration and to characterize changes in the functional characteristics of tree species across plots and study areas and over time. At the end of this project, the accumulated data will provide a deeper understanding of the factors affecting species colonization, dispersal, functional trait distributions, and community assembly during succession. \r\n \r\nProject results will provide new insights into mechanisms of regeneration in tropical forests. Datasets from the project supply essential information to guide forest restoration, carbon storage, and biodiversity conservation, and to enhance ecosystem modeling and global change predictions. These are all topics of direct societal relevance. Study plots provide collaborative opportunities for over 30 undergraduate, masters, doctoral, and postdoctoral researchers from Brazil, Costa Rica, US, Mexico, and The Netherlands.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe largest and most diverse rainforest on Earth is the Amazon Basin, which occupies much of Brazil and its neighboring countries.  The rainforest harbors over a thousand tree species that together convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into oxygen, as part of the Earth?s global carbon cycle.  When the forest is cut, the cycle is interrupted and carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere causing global warming.  Therefore, it is important to develop a road map to regenerate the forest. \n\nAfter the forest is cut, the land is subsequently converted into pasture or agriculture or simply unused.  Following various economic uses, land is abandoned or fallowed during which regeneration begins.  Sometimes, regeneration returns the land to the original rainforest, but other times what grows is a simplified shrubland.  Our research project, funded by the National Science Foundation, studied the pathways of forest regeneration in the heart of the Amazon Basin with an eye toward management of abandoned land to facilitate the return to the original rainforest.   \n\nThe conclusion from the research very clearly indicates that cut forest regenerates naturally into rain forest; however, cut forests that are subsequently converted into pastures for a few years before regeneration grow into an abbreviated /shrubland dominated by only a few kinds of trees.  The results strongly support the recommendation that rainforest land, cut for timber, should be idled to permit forest recovery, not converted to cattle pasture.   \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n \n\nAfter forest clearing, regeneration requires centuries to produce a species rich, dynamic, mature rainforest.  Historically, regeneration, called succession by ecologists, takes centuries as the groups of species that colonize first are replaced by other groups until some stability is reached after several hundred years.  Humans are too short-lived to study such a lengthy process, so ecologists frequently rely on a chronosequence in which sites of different ages are compared to infer how a single site would change through time.  For example, sites that were cut 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 and 100 years ago can be aligned to predict how a single site would change over 100 years, if all sites were subjected to the same forces. This project asked the question: How well do tropical rain forest chronosequences predict changes in time at a single site?  \n\nTo answer the question, different sites had to be compared through time, in our case for 19 years.  While we would prefer to study are sites for several hundred years, even in 19 years, we were able to observe that different sites did not follow the same successional trajectories.  The primary factor causing differences in succession was land use prior to the start of regeneration.  Sites where rain forests were cut and cleared regenerated along a successional path whose composition approximates a return to the original forest.  Sites that were converted to pastures for 6-8 years before regenerating were colonized by a group of species that remained dominant over the 19 years of the study.  Therefore, to predict forest changes where Amazon rainforest is cut requires knowledge of the land-use history after the forest was cut before it was allowed to regenerate.  Each land use is engenders a characteristic successional pathway, leaving a kind of \"land-use legacy.\"  Some land uses have successional pathways leading back to the original rainforest, whereas others follow alternative pathways to shrublands and woodlands much less diverse from the original rainforest.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/14/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: G.
