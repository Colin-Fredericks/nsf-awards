 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop spin-coatable liquid precursors for extremely high etch resistance pattern transfer layers (hardmasks) to enable novel devices in advanced integrated circuit manufacturing. The approach is to employ the fully inorganic metal oxide dielectric precursors demonstrated during the Phase I project to provide unparalleled etch selectivity for lithography spin-on hardmask layers. Such materials enable new architectures and deep etches required for future device generations which demand increasingly complex integration of materials to compensate for the limited etch selectivity of conventional organic patterning materials. The expected outcome is one or more inorganic spin-on hardmask materials ready for scale up to manufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide materials to improve performance of integrated circuit devices manufactured at dimensions below 22 nm. This project addresses key challenges in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors related to patterning requirements for future high performance electronic devices. The aqueous precursors are synthesized from environmentally benign raw materials, thereby reducing the environmental impact relative to conventional organic materials. The materials and low temperature processes developed in this project will also lay the foundation for broader applications in electronics, energy, and optical coatings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA key factor in the half-century growth of the semiconductor industry to over $400 billion has been the periodic doubling of integrated circuit (IC) feature density commonly known as Moore's Law.  Far from being inevitable, this cadence has been enabled by sustained investment in the materials, tooling, and methods of semiconductor patterning - primarily photolithography and etch.  These processes are fundamental to transferring device designs into silicon wafers and the chips powering the digital revolution.\n\nThis Phase II SBIR project at Inpria focused on the continued development of a unique class of patterning materials for use in photolithography and etch pattern transfer.  These photo-patternable metal-oxide hardmasks have demonstrated phenomenal capabilities that address key resolution, image fidelity, and pattern transfer challenges to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors for feature sizes below 22 nm.  The functionality of these materials is enabled by the use of break-through chemistries based on metal oxides that are outside the standard lithography and etch toolbox made up of carbon-based polymers, silicon oxides, and metal nitrides.  Important progress has been made transitioning this performance and functionality into an industry-compatible product based on improvements to formulation and scale-up, removing fab-compatibility roadblocks, and etch process development\n\nNew materials, particularly metals, introduced into yield-driven semiconductor fabrication process must meet rigorous criteria for quality and performance.  We have demonstrated synthesis and formulation improvements that enable manufacturing of large batches of metal-oxide hardmask precursor solution while reducing trace metal contaminants to &lt;10 parts-per-billion for all tested metals.  We have simultaneously demonstrated the use of state-of-the-art 2-nm pore size filtration flows to reduce precursor particle counts below industry standard detection limits.\n\nWhile contamination and quality are crucial, the novel metals used in these materials must be qualified in fab processes to undergo minimal migration to other tools and wafers during processing.  We have undertaken cross-contamination tests with industry partners using etch tools common to leading-edge fabs.  These tests clearly show target metal residues and particle levels within the etch chamber are below critical detection limits after processing our metal-oxide hardmask materials, and that nominal tool operation specifications are maintained.\n\nOnce cross-contamination concerns were mitigated, an etch process flow was developed based on a material stack comprising the directly photo-patterned metal-oxide hardmask on top of a conventional spin-on carbon layer.  Cross-sectional scanning-electron images illustrate successful etch transfer of 22-nm diameter, 12-nm thick pillar arrays into the 70 nm spin-on carbon film, and subsequent stripping of the hardmask without damage to the spin-on carbon layer.\n\nTaken together, these results represent significant progress towards adoption of this class of hardmask by addressing key risk areas identified by multiple customers.  Such systematic risk reduction is vital to industry acceptance and realizing their unique patterning capabilities to advanced-node lithography in coming decades.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/16/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Grenville"
