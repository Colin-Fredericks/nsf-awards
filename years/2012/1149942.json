 "awd_abstract_narration": "Classic debates on the formation of new species center on the relative significance of geographic isolation and adaption to different environments. New tools in genomics allow a closer look into how these features influence population differentiation. By analyzing how patterns of genomic variation among populations are affected by local ecology, behavior and extent of geographic isolation, important insights about how biodiversity forms can be achieved. Barn swallows are comprised of six closely related sub-species worldwide, where populations vary in: (1) geographic distance from one another, (2) different combinations of mate-selection traits, (3) climates they encounter, and (4) their extent of migratory behaviors, and thus provide powerful opportunities to explore the relative significance of these factors in population divergence. Fifty-five sampling sites across the entire breeding distribution of barn swallows have been established to conduct nearly 1,500 pair-wise population comparisons of genomic and phenotypic divergence. \r\n\r\nThis investigation will be among the most comprehensive analyses of the relative significance of migratory behavior, climate variability, mate selection, and geographic distance on population genomic divergence, with important insights about how these factors affect the evolution of new species.  Here, the scientific goals can be achieved through intermeshing the research with international collaboration, integrative training in Biology and outreach. Two Science Education Fellows will be used to help implement and assess innovation to two courses taught by the PI. Public engagement in this research will be achieved via a newly established Citizen Science program and an exhibition on avian diversity.",
