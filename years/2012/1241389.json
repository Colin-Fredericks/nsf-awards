The principal speaker will be Professor Davar Khoshnevisan from the University of Utah. The goals of the conference are to systematically study the fundamental notions, existing techniques and applications around SPDEs, to develop powerful new methods for investigating local behavior and intermittency of nonlinear SPDEs, and to reformulate and investigate problems which are significant for future development of SPDEs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the 10 main lectures by Dr. Khoshnevisan, six lectures will be presented by other experts in these fields. This award will support approximately 25 participants at different stages of their careers, and a monograph will be produced.",
