 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this planning effort, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) will lay the foundations for developing the Unique Research Experiences for two-year College faculty And Students (URECAS) program, which is intended to support Earth and space science faculty at two-year colleges as they engage their undergraduate students in research activities.  AGU is convening a two-day workshop with 30 attendees to increase awareness about existing opportunities for summer research experiences for undergraduates, identify best practices for engaging two-year college students in research, and consider strategies for overcoming some of the barriers to success.  The ultimate goal of this effort is to establish a distributed community of two-year college instructors engaged in geoscience research and develop a strategic plan for new programs that help undergraduate students successfully transition between two-year and four-year programs in the geosciences.  Many students who attend two-year colleges come from underrepresented communities in STEM disciplines; as such, this project directly supports the NSF and GEO Directorate goals of broadening participation in STEM disciplines, in general, and in the geosciences, specifically.",
