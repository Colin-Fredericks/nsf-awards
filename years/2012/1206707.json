 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nBulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which can be formed under similar processing conditions as the familiar silicate glasses, are finding an increasing number of technological applications. Why a few metallic liquids form BMGs, while the majority of metallic liquids do not, remains unclear.  Previous studies by us and by others have demonstrated that metallic glasses contain medium-range and short-range structural order, with icosahedral short-range ordering (ISRO) being most common.  We have demonstrated that this structural ordering originates in the high temperature liquid far above the glass transition temperature, and is often accompanied by chemical ordering. Since ISRO is incompatible with crystal periodicity, it raises the nucleation barrier for the crystal phases, thereby enhancing glass formability in some cases. Molecular dynamics studies indicate that this ordering influences the atomic motion underlying viscous behavior, which also plays a key role in glass formation. Additionally, fine-scale phase separation has been observed in many glasses; whether this occurs in supercooled liquids, where it would also impact glass formation, has not been investigated previously.  Investigations of these issues require that the liquids be processed in a containerless environment, eliminating heterogeneous nucleation on container walls and increasing the amount of supercooling.  This group has pioneered the use of electrostatic levitation techniques to make X-ray structural studies of deeply supercooled metallic and semiconductor liquids.  Under this grant, those studies will be extended by making wide and small angle synchrotron X-ray and elastic neutron scattering studies, and correlating those with measurements of the densities, viscosities and crystallization of metallic glass forming liquids. The insights gained from this research will lead to improved control of glass formation and nanostructure development during controlled devitrification.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nSilicate glasses are familiar materials, used for thousands of years to produce decorative and practical objects.  Metallic glasses are much less familiar.  First discovered in 1960, they typically require that the liquids from which they form be cooled at rates approaching one million degrees per second, significantly limiting their technological usefulness. A few metallic glasses are now known that can be fabricated using much slower cooling rates, comparable to those used to produce silicate glasses.  These novel materials are often stronger than steel, extremely hard and resistant to corrosion.  Further, they can be molded into complex shapes that cannot be obtained with conventional metals.  These glasses are now used in pressure sensors, micro-geared motors, transformer cores, biomedical components and sports equipment. However, it remains unclear why a few metallic liquids will form these glasses, while most will not.  The research that will be carried out under the support of this grant will address this key question.  This group has pioneered the use of electrostatic levitation for containerless studies of liquid structures, and has demonstrated that metallic-glass-forming liquids develop significant topological short and medium-range order.  The scattering of X-rays and neutrons from these liquids will be measured to determine the chemical ordering and to investigate possible liquid phase separation on the nanometer scale, which may accompany the structural ordering.    These data will be correlated with measurements of key physical properties important for glass formation, including the liquid density, viscosity, and resistance to crystallization. In addition to their relevance to improved basic understanding, the results of these studies will lead to refined methods for metallic glass formation and for the control of nanostructure development during glass and liquid crystallization.  The research will provide scientific training to both graduate and undergraduate students.  Simple and practical materials science experiments and demonstrations inspired by this research, will constitute a series of workshops for secondary high-school teachers, led by the PI and his students, to help teachers convey scientific principles and the excitement of a scientific career to high school students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGlasses are familiar materials, having been used for thousands of years.  While glasses are solids, their atomic structures are more like those of the liquids from which they are formed.  Both are amorphous, lacking the long range order found in crystal phases.  Most commonly used glasses are silicates, composed of mixtures of silicon, oxygen and alkali metals such as sodium and lithium.   Less well known are metallic glasses, i.e. glasses made of metals. First discovered about one-half of a century ago they long remained a laboratory curiosity, because they could only be formed by cooling the liquid at close to a million degrees per second.  In the 1990?s, however, metallic  glasses were discovered that could be formed at cooling rates similar to those required for silicate glasses.  Studies of metallic glasses have revealed an interesting array of desirable properties, including desirable magnetic properties, high hardness and corrosion resistance, and large tensile strengths and elastic strain limits.  Recent work has shown that these glasses can be molded into intricate shapes by plastic forming, something that is not possible with normal crystalline metals.  These properties suggest that metallic glasses could be developed into materials that are well suited for novel technological applications.   However, not all metallic liquids form glasses.  Searches for those that do is currently based on a set of empirical rules that are only partially predictive. \n\nOur research has focused on determining whether properties of the high temperature liquids, focusing on the viscosity and structural ordering, holds clues to glass formation.  Fragility, based on the temperature dependence of the liquids viscosity, is a concept that is commonly used to characterize liquids and one that often believed to correlate with glass forming ability.  However, the microscopic mechanism of fragility is unclear.  Our research has focused on determining how dynamical processes underlying the viscosity are related to structural ordering and how they relate to the glass transition (the transformation from a liquid to a glass).  Since metallic liquids have a tendency to crystallize easily below their melting temperature (Tl, called the liquidus temperature for alloys), metallic liquids were processed in a high vacuum environment without the use of a container, employing the technique of electrostatic levitation (ESL).   Structural data as a function of temperature were obtained from high-energy X-ray scattering studies and elastic neutron scattering studies.   Our results show that fragility is reflected in the rate of structural ordering.  Fragile liquids (generally taken to be poor glass formers) show much more rapid ordering as the glass transition temperature (Tg) is approached than do the strong liquids that are believed to be good glass formers.   One of the most important experimental findings is the existence of a high temperature, TA, where the viscosity begins to increase more rapidly with decreasing temperature, as predicted earlier in molecular dynamics (MD) studies.   What was not predicted by MD at the time, however, is that Tg can be predicted accurately from TA.   This experimentally demonstrate the strong link between dynamics and structure in liquids and confirms that the glass transition is the end step for cooperative processes that begin at much higher temperatures.  Additionally, the results allow quantitative predications to be made between experimental results and MD predictions, which is not possible at Tg since the relaxation time scales for experiment and MD differ by over ten orders of magnitude.   Practically, they also offer a path for the prediction of glass formation.  Recent studies have shown that a combination of fragility and the reduced glass transition temperature (Tg/Tl) is a good predictor of glass formability.   Our results show that both of these quantities can be determined from studies of high temperature liquids.  Also, our results provide new liquid structural and physical property data that can be used to develop improved atomic potentials and realistic computer models that will allow broad materials development, following the guidelines of the Whitehouse Materials Genome Initiative.  The research was an integral part of graduate and undergraduate training.  It also contributed to the PI?s ongoing outreach activities with regional high school and middle school teachers, using the science of materials to provide a more approachable platform for the study of physical principles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth F Kelton"
