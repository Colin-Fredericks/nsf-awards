 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multi-core processors with hundreds of embedded functional blocks are designed to achieve unprecedented performance benefits for a wide variety of applications such as graphics, financial and scientific modeling, networking, multimedia and wireless infrastructure. The Network-on-Chip (NoC) is an enabling methodology to integrate many embedded cores on a single die. However, with growing levels of integration traditional NoCs suffer from high latency and energy dissipation in on-chip data transfer due to conventional metal/dielectric based interconnects. The wireless NoC (WiNoC) simultaneously addresses the latency, power consumption and interconnect routing problems of conventional NoCs by replacing multi-hop wired links with high-bandwidth single-hop long-range wireless channels. Recent investigations have characterized silicon integrated on-chip antennas operating in the millimeter (mm)-wave range of 50-110 GHz, and this is now a viable technology. Coupled with significant advances in mm-wave transceiver design, this development opens up new research opportunities for designing high bandwidth and low power WiNoCs.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will develop a cross-layer design methodology for an on-chip wireless micro-network. Suitable physical, data link and network layer protocols will be developed for the WiNoC. The expected contribution of this work is the development and demonstration of broadband and integrable mm-wave WiNoCs. The transformational aspect of this proposal lies in addressing the on-chip interconnect problem from a fundamentally new perspective, namely by developing a broadband millimeter wave wireless network at the micro/nanoscale, as opposed to pursuing incremental improvements in traditional wired interconnects. By bringing wireless networking to the on-chip environment, the proposed research will introduce a paradigm shift in the design of multi-core chips. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will facilitate the education of undergraduate and graduate students by allowing them to apply classroom knowledge to a research problem requiring hardware, software and theoretical expertise. Such expertise will be developed in both university and industrial laboratory settings using state-of-the-art test equipment and computing facilities, and will ultimately be necessary to maintain the technological leadership of the United States. Students from various underrepresented groups, including women, African Americans and Hispanics, will be engaged in this project. The project's educational impacts will be complemented by the positive effect that the research outcomes are expected to have on society as a whole.",

These applications call for increased data rates from conventional technology and drive the consumer demand for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) wireless devices, where an increase in operative frequency corresponds to a wavelength in the millimeter-range. Broadcasting at a higher frequency enables designers to achieve a greater bandwidth and data rate with a smaller footprint, however careful consideration must be placed on the layout, assembly, and packaging of these devices to ensure wireless efficiency at the system level. This has led to the development of system-in-package (SiP) solutions, where various wireless components, including amplifiers, filters, antennas, and passives, are all integrated within the same package, reducing parasitic loss typical from conventional system-level packaging methods. Additive manufacturing technologies, such as inkjet and 3D printing, are promising candidates for fabricating these highly-integrated, application-specific wireless packages in a reconfigurable low-cost fashion.</p>\n<p>The efforts of this project are focused on the development and evaluation of inkjet and 3D printing technologies for integration with mm-wave wireless devices on the chip level, enabling a cost-effective and highly versatile tooling platform for the wireless system package of tomorrow. First, the dielectric properties of popular 3D printing materials are characterized at E-band (60?90 GHz), a popular band of wireless real estate used for automotive radar devices, finding that the materials used within 3D printing are electromagnetically similar to those traditionally used with microelectronic packaging. With these materials established, focus is placed on how additive manufacturing technology can add increased functionality to the standard wireless package, specifically the encapsulant molding that is used to protect the chip die from its surrounding environment. 3D printing allows for non-traditional 3D topologies such as lenses and 3D reliefs to be integrated directly within an encapsulant, offering a single tooling platform where various stamps and transfer molds would be required for traditional approaches. Additionally, 3D sloped interconnects, or through-mold vias (TMVs) are demonstrated using inkjet and 3D printing for the interconnection of an embedded chip with various components integrated directly within an encapsulant. The TMVs were able to achieve low insertion loss for E-band operational frequencies with slopes reaching up to 65?, demonstrating the ability to utilize additive manufacturing technologies for mm-wave SiP solutions. These key components, including printed encapsulants and TMV interconnects, allow for the realization of ?smart? wireless packages, where intelligence is added to the package through the inclusion of application-specific components, including antennas, passives, and microfluidic networks for thermal management. Whereas achieving this level of integration with traditional technology would require a vast catalog of tools, the robust and reconfigurable nature of additive printing technology significantly reduces tool costs while enabling an unpresented level of heterogenous integration.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>Fig. 1 ? 3D-printed chip encapsulant achieved with stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing.</p>\n<p>Fig. 2 ?
