A US Coordination Committee has been established to lead the effort with widespread representation of expertise and with strong links to the QB50 program organization.  A specific product of the effort will be a report outlining a US participation plan, including descriptions of the CubeSats US organizations intend to provide, a participation packet and guidelines for US institutions, an easy to use participation program for high schools and colleges that don't have satellite programs, and policy hurdles and plan for participation in a EU led satellite program. Broad US community input, interest, and participation will be sought through a community workshop being conducted as part of this activity.",
