 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the AugSTEM program, Augsburg College is awarding 70 scholarships to a cross-disciplinary cohort of students.  The program builds on past successes in attracting transfer and underrepresented students to Augsburg's small urban campus and successful retention strategies in introductory STEM sequences.  Approximately 50% of the scholarship recipients began their postsecondary careers at area community colleges.  Students are united by their common educational stage and a shared objective of graduating and pursuing a STEM career.  Programming encourages students to finish their degrees with strong academic credentials and clarity of purpose.  \r\n\r\nObjectives of the AugSTEM program are to:\r\n     -  Increase the number of transfer students who obtain a STEM degree by building partnerships and providing programming tailored to the needs and timelines of such students;\r\n     -  Provide financial support for 30 academically talented upper-division STEM students;\r\n     -  Retain junior and senior STEM students to graduation by extending earlier successes in first and second-year programming;\r\n     -  Enhance the readiness of STEM students for successful transitions to the scientific workplace; and \r\n     -  Develop sustained excellence in undergraduate STEM education.\r\n\r\nThe AugSTEM program is increasing the College's efforts to create a diverse campus, especially serving underrepresented populations who might otherwise leave the STEM pipeline.  The program is also pairing with S-STEM programs at partner community college to better serve the increasing population of undergraduates who begin their careers at two-year institutions.  Ultimately, the AugSTEM program is increasing the number and diversity of STEM graduates entering the workforce, fostering interactions between Augsburg STEM faculty and community college colleagues, enhancing professional preparedness for students, and providing a foundation for future growth of a vibrant division of natural sciences and mathematics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAugsburg College received a four-year S-STEM award in 2012.  The AugSTEM Scholars program focuses on supporting STEM students in their junior and senior years.  We chose this focus because we see students who manage to complete their STEM degrees but do not necessarily transition to the STEM workforce &ndash; which could include either entering the workforce immediately or first continuing their education in a graduate or professional program.  Financial hardship can impede academic success as well as participation in high-impact experiences such as undergraduate research and internships. Poor academic performance and lack of experience, in turn, impedes success in transitioning to the STEM workforce.\n\nWe also chose to set the goal that by the end of the funding period approximately half of our annual scholarship awards would go to students who had started at a community college.  We know that many students with limited financial support choose to attend community colleges and then transfer to a four-year college.  Students who follow this path do not always have an easy time.  In some cases, they choose to \"take care of their generals\" and arrive with an associates degree but essentially at the beginning of their STEM major &ndash; which may not compact easily into two additional years.  Opportunities such as undergraduate research and internships, which we know to be supportive of student success, are not always as available at two-year institutions.  At the four-year institutions these opportunities are often mediated through relationships with faculty and staff &ndash; which may take time for new transfers to develop.  Overall time to degree completion often exceeds four years, and students hit financial aid \"cliffs\" such as running out of state aid.\n\nAt the onset of our project, we identified the following goals: (1) increase the number of STEM transfer students who successfully obtain a STEM degree at Augsburg; (2) provide financial support for academically talented upper division STEM students; (3) retain Augsburg?s junior and senior STEM students to graduation; (4) enhance the readiness of STEM students for successful transition to the scientific workplace; and (5) develop sustained excellence in undergraduate STEM education.\n\n Here is a summary of some of the outcomes over the lifetime of the award.\n\nApproved and offered in fall 2015 a 1-credit course for new STEM transfers called SCI310 - Science for the World, adapted from the Mount Holyoke S-STEM, NSF-1058164, Improving Recruitment and Retention of Community-College Transfer Students to STEM Majors at Mount Holyoke College.\nDeveloped 84 STEM Transfer Advising Pathways between Augsburg?s STEM departments and seven area community colleges.  These are not full articulation agreements, but are advising documents that provide crosswalks between the curricula.\nPartnered with the Minnesota High Tech Association (MHTA) SciTechsperience internship program and received a Great Lakes Higher Education Guaranty Corporation Career Ready Internship Grant.  These two programs provided support for 25 paid STEM internships during the 2015-16 year, including seven AugSTEM Scholars. \nAdapted our recruitment process to include AugSTEM Provost Awards.  Highly qualified transfers undergo an earlier expedited scholarship review process and enter the institution through our summer research program.  This was modeled after S-STEM NSF-1060131, Moravian College Scholars in Mathematics and Computer Science Program, which engaged transfers in research experiences.  \nUtilized contributions of staff from Advising, Financial Aid, Admissions, our Undergraduate Research Office and McNair in both development and ongoing improvement of the program.\nExamined our progress and integrated community college perspectives through annual visits by external evaluator Ron Ulseth of Itasca Community College.\nGathered input on program effectiveness through scholar interviews and focus groups. \n\nThis grant provided 80 annual scholarships with an average amount of $6,038 to four overlapping cohorts of upper-level transfer and non-transfer students majoring in Augsburg?s five STEM departments: biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics and physics.  Of the 66 students who have been awarded scholarships, 41 have graduated with STEM degrees and 25 are continuing STEM majors at Augsburg; 100% either graduated or are continuing in STEM at Augsburg. \nAcademic success: The cohort included two Goldwater Scholars (one a transfer), one Goldwater honorable mention (also a transfer), and three NSF Graduate Fellowship recipients and a Rossing Physics Scholar.
