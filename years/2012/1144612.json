 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research team from University of Wisconsin and California State University Stanislaus, in collaboration with scientists from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, France, Mexico, and Spain are carrying out an integrated study of faulting and the earthquake cycle in northern Central America, at the deforming western end of the Caribbean plate. The major emphasis is to better measure and model deformation around a continental triple junction in southern Guatemala, where the Motagua and Polochic fault system terminates the Caribbean-North America plate boundary. Existing and new data from 110 campaign and continuous GPS sites in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and southern Mexico will be compiled and analyzed to create the first consistent regional-scale GPS velocity field for the western Caribbean. The new velocity field will be used to study four important topics, including: 1) how deformation is accommodated around the continental triple junction; 2) the motion and internal deformation of the Central America forearc sliver; 3) the manner in which the Jalpatagua fault and other volcanic arc faults in Guatemala accommodate this movement and interact with the magmatic arc; and 4) how extension is accommodated between the sinistral Motagua-Polochic fault system and the dextral Jalpatagua fault and the influence on subduction coupling and upper plate deformation of a 50 degree change in the dip of the subducting Cocos plate. Complementary outcrop, gravity, paleomagnetic, radiometric, and geochemical data will be collected in Guatemala and Honduras to provide a geological framework for interpreting and modeling the GPS velocity field. Forward and inverse modeling that integrates the available geodetic and structural observations and suitable earthquake constraints will be used to better understand the factors that dictate deformation in the region and optimize estimates of block rotations, fault coupling and locking depths, and strain rates and directions within quasi-rigid blocks.\r\n\r\nEstimates of interseismic strain rates and long-term fault slip rates that will result from this work will inform risk analysis in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where destructive earthquakes have occurred in the past 35 years. The study complements publicly funded studies of natural hazards in neighboring countries (i.e. Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica) and together will substantially advance understanding of these hazards in much of Central America and southern Mexico. Training workshops to be held in Guatemala and El Salvador will target one or more techniques and will constitute a mini-forum for presenting project results and educating students, scientists, and the broader public in the host countries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated the deformation associated with one of the few places above sea level where three of the Earth?s lithospheric plates come together in what is known as a continental triple junction.  In northern Central America the oceanic Cocos Plate dives beneath the North America Plate and the Caribbean Plate at the Middle American trench subduction zone, while the overriding plates are separated by a transform boundary with the Caribbean plate moving to the east relative to North America.  The interaction of these plates produce the dynamic landforms, and the volcanic and seismic hazards of the region and presented an opportunity to document the specific contribution of plate motion to deformation patterns across an actively deforming triple junction using field-based Global Positioning System (GPS) techniques in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nFor the Honduran section, field based collection of GPS data involved occupying the entire GPS network of roughly twenty five sites for a period of two-three days each to collect precise positioning data to establish deformation within the western Caribbean plate near the triple junction.  Concurrent with GPS data collection, orientations and motion indicators from exposed faults along roads were recorded to constrain the response of near surface rocks to triple junction deformation.  Execution of project as planned in Honduras was hampered by escalating safety concerns associated with the rise in drug trafficking in Honduras.  Planned undergraduate student involvement with in-country data collection was precluded.  Following the extended 2013 field season (6 weeks) in Honduras, field activities were postponed and eventually halted due to ongoing safety and security concerns  U.S. State Department has issued travel warnings to Honduras noting the county?s homicide rate is ranked among the world?s highest and that criminal gangs associated with drug trafficking operate with impunity.  These condition reflect the PI?s first hand observations.  To date, information from this effort appears in an American Geophysical Union abstract and in a peer-reviewed journal article.  These results have aided in earthquake hazards assessment for the region.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert D Rogers"
