This conference has drawn attendees from all over the United States.     \r\n\r\nThe Midwest Thermodynamic and Statistical Mechanics (MTSM) Conference will likely continue the longstanding tradition of promoting research and collaborations in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics as participants take advantage of the small attendance (approximately 80 people) to establish contacts in the community.  This conference will be a venue where the latest research on computational, theoretical and experimental thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are presented, discussed and debated.  Thermodynamics is a major pillar of scientific and engineering disciplines.  Statistical mechanics provides an additional, necessary molecular understanding of thermodynamic properties.  The MTSM Conference provides a great vehicle to learn thermodynamics in the context of statistical mechanics.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe meeting participants range from established senior faculty members to undergraduate and new graduate students.  An attractive feature of MTSM is its focus on graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty members.  By design, the majority of presentations are given by young scientists and engineers.  These meetings are wonderful learning experiences for young researchers.  As done in the past, the organizers will attempt to keep the costs at a minimum for students to encourage participation.  This proposal, combined with funds committed by the University of Minnesota?s College of Science and Engineering, the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute and the Digital Technology Center, will provide funding to help defray meeting expenses.",
