 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Volker P. Brendel (Indiana University) \r\n\r\nCoPIs: Karin Dorman (Iowa State University), Shannon Schlueter (University of North Carolina - Charlotte) and Shailesh Lal (Oakland University) \r\n\r\nSenior Personnel: Jon Duvick and Yasser El-Manzalawy (Iowa State University) \r\n\r\nThe premise of this project is that the scale of sequence and other data accumulation in plant genomics necessitates the development of novel, highly automated, scalable, comprehensive, and accurate approaches to genome annotation. The depth of transcript data accumulating for many plant species under numerous experimental conditions provide unprecedented evidence for the evaluation of all aspects of transcription, including precise mapping of transcription start sites as well as dominant and alternative splice sites. This project engages a team of experts in a wide range of fields, including genomics, molecular biology, bioinformatics, statistics, machine learning, high performance computing, and software engineering to jointly work toward a solution for accurately predicting the expressed protein-coding gene transcriptome from plant genome sequences. Successful completion of the project will result in the deployment of (1) software that implements the novel prediction algorithms, (2) visualization and data access portals, and (3) a cyberinfrastructure environment implementation of the developed tools for distributed computing, sharing of protocols, and analysis provenance recording. In the long run, the project seeks to explore the extent to which genomic biology can transition from a largely descriptive to a highly predictive science driven by quantitative measurements, with algorithms and computation as the domain-adapted language. \r\n\r\nThe project will generate standardized, accurate protein-coding gene structure annotation for 25 plant genomes from a wide range of the phylogenetic spectrum. Initial emphasis will be on improved annotation of recently sequenced genomes, which will benefit the entire community of researchers working on these important crops. The anticipated algorithms for transcriptome prediction will be essential to the analysis of the thousands of complete plant genome sequences likely to become available within the next few years. Through the development of reliable gold standard annotations and the dissemination of training and test sets for algorithmic development, a larger community of computational data analysts, in particular from the machine learning community, will be engaged. All software developed and data generated in this research is freely available through project Web sites, in particular www.plantgdb.org. The project's plan for integration of research and education will train a new generation of scientists to work on genomics data with the broad range of interdisciplinary approaches represented by the project team.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlant biology (as all other branches of biology) has arrived in the genome era when virtually every research question can be addressed in the context of knowledge of the underlying genomes of the plants being studied.  This framework is of huge importance particularly in applied plant research as it relates to studying crop yield and plant resistance to environmental stresses and pathogens.  Genome data are produced rapidly with current sequencing technology.  This project's contribution concerns the computational analysis of the assembled genomes: once the DNA sequences of the genome are as complete as possible given the sequencing effort, the next computational part is to annotate these sequences with respect to gene content and to make all those annotations readily available for public inspection.  The product produced software tools that automate that process. Although the annotation task involves large-scale computation, these are hidden from the enduser.  A biologist only needs to supply relevant input data in standard file formats, adjust display and analysis parameters via web forms, and then launch the program.  The software will then use NSF-funded high performance computing resources in the background, transparent to the user, and automatically funnel results back to the user's interface.  The end result is a web-accessible genome browser that displays predicted gene models, their similarities to known genomes, and the overall genome organization.  Embedded tool functions allow further analyses on the data via the web forms. In particular, the genome browser includes community annotation tools that allow domain experts (as well as students in training) to interactively contribute annotation modifications.  In this way, the xGDBvm software will enable reproducible and scalable annotation for any plant genome sequences and thus solve the current bottleneck between rapid sequencing and slow computational processing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Volker Brendel"
