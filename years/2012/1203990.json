 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide new data on the paleoclimates, paleoenviroments and the biodiversity impacts of sea level rise on the southern edge of the Bering Land Bridge (BLB), and is intended to facilitate a better understanding of why woolly mammoths survived late into the mid-Holocene only in the environments of Arctic islands of this area. Furthermore, this research will attempt to establish the actual time of extinction of the Holocene mammoth population on St. Paul Island, Pribilof Islands, Alaska, and apply this information to test various proposed causal hypotheses for the extinction.\r\n\r\nCores from Cagaloq Lake, St. Paul, will be sampled for chironomids (aquatic invertebrates), pollen, coprophilous fungi spores, plant macrofossils, charcoal, ancient DNA and cryptotephras. Oxygen isotopes from the heads of chironomids will provide an independent climate record that can be supplemented by paleoecological analyses of the chironomid assemblages. Studies will also test chironomid species for isotope fractionation to disentangle climate signals from ground water effects. Terrestrial community changes will be reconstructed from pollen, spores and plant macrofossils; and charcoal frequency will be used to document fire events. Analysis of ancient DNA will provide data on cryptic plant and animal species that have not been detected by traditional methods of analysis, and can also be used to identify taxa to species.\r\n\r\nSpores that grow on animal dung will be used as proxies for the mammoth population size and to document the time of mammoth extinction on the island. Ancient DNA will serve as an important cross-check by helping to resolve specific identifications of these spores as well as providing an independent estimate the time of extinction by the absence of mammoth DNA.\r\n\r\nDigital elevations, bathymetric data, sea level curves, and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology will be used to reconstruct island size from the time of its isolation until today. A highly constrained chronology of the Cagaloq record will be achieved by using 14 C dates and tephras. All data can be compared temporally in order to test hypotheses for mammoth extinction. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide opportunities for two PhD students, a postdoctoral fellow, graduate student assistant and undergraduate student. Results of the study will be disseminated widely in peer-reviewed journals. An exhibit on the results of the project will be prepared by the EMS Museum at Penn State University with a web component. In addition, a special on-line, interactive exhibit will allow participants to reconstruct the island at various sizes, populate it with differing mammoth populations and define different climate and environmental factors to observe how each of these components affects mammoth extinction. The interactive exhibit will be available on the Neotoma database. Members of the group will make presentations on the project at the Alaska Quaternary Center in Fairbanks, which serves as a hub for promoting Alaska Quaternary research and outreach to the public.",

To answer these questions, our collaborative team traveled to St Paul Island to collect and date fossil remains and to recover a series of sediment cores from the base of Island&rsquo;s only source of fresh water, the Lake Hill volcanic caldera (Figure 1). We traveled to St Paul twice: during March 2013 to take the core while the lake was still frozen, and during July od 2013 to explore caves, work with the local community, and collect surface sediments and plants for comparative analysis.&nbsp; After the core was recovered, we sampled plugs of soil down its length (Figure 2). Using these sediment plugs, we established a robust and detailed timeline of environmental changes on St Paul from around 28,000 years ago, up to and throughout the mammoth extinction. Using reconstructed plant, fungal, and algal assemblages, isotopic and magnetic data, and DNA extracted directly from sediment, our interdisciplinary team discovered that mammoths on St Paul Island went extinct around 5600 years ago, and that this extinction probably happened because they ran out of freshwater to drink. Our results, which were published in the journal <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science </em>&nbsp;in 2016 (<em>PNAS</em> 113:9310-9314), conclude that Lake Hill became shallow, salty and turbid simultaneously with the disappearance of mammoth DNA and fungal spores that are indicative of the presence of mammalian dung (Figure 3). We found no evidence of changes in the vegetation community, suggesting that the drought leading to lake shallowing need not have been long. However, the drought was sufficiently long to reduce the source of freshwater to a point where it could no longer sustain mammoths. Interestingly, the fungal spores that indicate the presence of large mammals are absent on St. Paul from the time of mammoth extinction until several hundred years ago, when they are once again found in the core at a time that is coincident with human colonization of the island and the introduction of reindeer. This study is the first to reveal the cause of a population extinction event in the absence of humans, and provides important insights into the fragility of Arctic ecosystems during periods of environmental change.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to this scientific work, our project ran outreach events on St. Paul Island for the community, including insect trapping and plant identification workshops for the local schoolchildren.
