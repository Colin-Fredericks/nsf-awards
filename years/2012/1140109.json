 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Carolina A&T State University is transforming a traditional laboratory course to incorporate real world sustainable topics and case studies. By using guided-inquiry methods, this project is creating a collection of portable case study and Problem Based Learning (PBL) modules that can be used by STEM instructors to increase students' interest in and retention of course material related to environmental engineering, as well as to enhance students' critical thinking skills. The case studies are short, realistic scenarios that provide relevant detail about an environmental problem, while the PBL modules use real world problems that are assigned as large projects to student teams. The goal is to determine if these methods improve student learning about the ideas, principles, and practices for sustainable practices and design. A community of faculty is working toward promoting the use of these methods in undergraduate laboratory courses by recruiting other faculty to test the sustainability modules and develop additional guided-inquiry based STEM labs. The case studies and PBL modules are available for faculty and teachers to use in courses to introduce hands-on activities in college level courses, middle to high school courses, and for outreach activities focusing on real-world cases in sustainability. Assessment includes collecting and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data concerning student and faculty attitudes toward sustainability and student engagement and comprehension of the material.",

The cases were added to the laboratory course as a way to update laboratory content with contemporary themes, real world examples, and topics to teach sustainability. The rationale for implementing the cases within a traditional laboratory was to determine if the cases impacted student engagement; helped students to see the link between laboratory exercises and real world applications; increased students' critical thinking levels above the lower levels of knowledge and comprehension from Bloom\u00c6s Taxonomy; and improved the quality of student laboratory reports.\n\nThe new cases developed addressed: 1) E-waste to teach environmental ethics and statistical analysis of data; 2) The 2014 Duke Coal Ash Spill in North Carolina to teach physical and chemical water quality and treatment; 3) A case to teach microbial quantification in water samples from contaminated recreational water; 4) A case addressing water quality and environmental justice related to Confined Animal Feeding Operations water contamination; and 5) Green buildings to teach sustainable engineering concepts and alternative energy.
