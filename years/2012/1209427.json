Means of identifying such ?hot spots? of sensitivity to change would allow us to target remediation and other management measures where they will do the most good. This project will test and explore the ecologic and management implications of a novel hypothesis termed human-amplified natural change (HANC), which states that the areas of the landscape that are most susceptible to human, climatic, and other external changes are those undergoing the highest natural rates of change.\r\n\r\nThe research team will develop a theoretical framework for vulnerability assessment and will test the HANC hypothesis through intensive study of the Minnesota River Basin (MRB), a 44,000 km2 agriculturally-dominated watershed in the upper Midwest. The MRB encompasses an extremely broad spectrum of natural and human-induced rates of change and sensitivity to land-use practices. Of particular interest is the complex nonlinear coupling between land use and river network processes, which has already resulted in severely impaired waters for sediment and nutrients. What will be the future condition of the waters and ecosystem services in the MRB under changing human actions and climatic conditions? Of the many potential land and water management options, which are most likely to produce a sustainable, resilient, and thriving coupled economic-environmental system?  To answer such questions, this study seeks to:\r\n\r\n(1) determine the extent to which current high rates of sediment production are concentrated in areas that were undergoing high rates of natural change before the external changes were imposed; \r\n(2) study how thresholds and localized features in the system amplify and accelerate change and how such nonlinear effects can be parameterized in an integrated predictive modeling framework; \r\n(3) investigate the extent to which the human-amplified natural changes (HANC) in the geomorphic system contribute to observed ecological changes in the MRB; and \r\n(4) develop means to include HANC-based reasoning in decision analysis frameworks, including a suite of methods to identify sensitive regions, along with spatially targeted monitoring activities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Strong relationships previously developed with State regulatory agencies will ensure that the results from this project directly influence future land and water policy and management decisions.  The research team will disseminate new knowledge directly to the public in close collaboration with State agencies via stakeholder meetings, widely attended regional meetings and informational reports. Further, they will develop a HANC-based analytical toolbox for evaluating areas prone to rapid change in the landscape, beginning with Midwestern agricultural landscapes. New knowledge generated from this work will be used to inform Science Museum exhibits related to the Anthropocene, develop innovative K-12 curricula in environmental science and engineering, and disseminate NSF?s Earth Science and Climate Literacy Principles via teacher training.  The project supports three early-career PIs and training of graduate, undergraduate, and ?synthesis-postdoctoral? students in an interdisciplinary environment, co-advised by scientists in hydrology, geomorphology, ecology, biology, engineering, and economics.",

In particular, they construct bankfull channel width and bankfull channel depth, such that at bankfull discharge, the river water is at the edge of spilling onto the floodplain. In previous work, bankfull discharge has been characterized as the \"1.5-year\" recurrence flood, with no physics to back up this estimate. Here we develop a full morphodynamic theory of the bankfull characteristics of a channel, and how they evolve in response to imposed changes. The key input is the flow duration curve, or cumulative probability distribution of discharge. If \"bankfull\" conditions are set too low, the flow will spill out onto the floodplain, and sediment will deposit to make a deeper channel. If they are too high, meander bend erosion will \"shave\" the depth back into balance. We have successfully applied our model to the present-day Minnesota River. We have also used it to predict changes resulting from increased storminess, increased sediment supply and change of vegetation. Our model is generalizible to other sand-bed meandering rivers in a straightforward way. It represents a major new advance in self-formed river morphodynamics, and provides a new tool with which to evaluate imposed change, including climate change, on river morphology. More specifically, this tool allows for the prediction of the change in channel form in response to land use conversion or climate regime change, which are likely to modify the probability distribution of discharge. Our tool will provide the response behavior as well as the response time scales of the river system to such perturbations. This knowledge can then be used for various purposes including land use decision-making practices and flood management practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/15/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gary&nbsp;Parker</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1209427/1209427_10202023_1509562549973_FlumevsField--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1209427/1209427_10202023_1509562549973_FlumevsField--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Field and Flume\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1209427/1209427_10202023_1509562549973_FlumevsField--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Field and Flume\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Experimental results from the Kinoshita flume (left and middle) and Shimanto River in Japan (right).
