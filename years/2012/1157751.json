 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vanderbilt and Leipzig Universities in the area of Chemical Biology will establish a sustainable collaboration in education and research to study the fundamentals of ligand-macromolecule recognition by combining chemical tool compounds with biophysical techniques. The similar research foci of both institutions combined with complementary technologies will provide students and post-doctoral fellows with a comprehensive education. Jens Meiler of Vanderbilt University (VU) and Annette Beck-Sickinger of Leipzig University (LU) spearhead this initiative. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Although ligand-macromolecule recognition is at the core of biological\r\nprocesses, it is still poorly understood. LU offers basic science expertise with unique tool compounds\r\nsuch as carbaborane analogues, non-natural amino acid peptides, leading technology for expression of labeled human membrane proteins and solid-state NMR studies of such membrane proteins. This is complemented by VU?s translational science expertise in liquid-state NMR and EPR studies, a high-throughput screening facility to identify novel tool compounds, and computational modeling technologies unique for ligandmacromolecule recognition. The collaboration is further strengthened through\r\nthe joint development of novel biochemical assays. \r\nBroader Impacts: This project will support a) planning visits, and b) exchange of students and\r\npost-doctoral fellows on all levels. Four planning visits of Jens Meiler and five other VU faculty to LU in\r\nLeipzig, Germany will occur on an annual basis.  During their stay the VU researchers will present at scientific symposia, participate in roundtable discussions, and meet with potential collaborators one-on-one. Technology exchange will be\r\nfostered through tutorials offered by the faculty. The faculty will also develop and implement mentorship\r\nplans for student exchanges. At least six research visits per year will involve the exchange and co-mentoring\r\nof students or post-doctoral fellows from VU. Participating in an international program, teaching\r\nand learning new ideas, publication of a scientific manuscript, and attending research seminars are\r\ncollectively experiences that are invaluable for a young scientist. Their participation in international\r\nexchange will broaden their perspectives, thus making them more competitive in their field. The students\r\nwill share ideas and techniques with their collaborators, and similarly instruct their home laboratory with\r\nthe knowledge gained at LU. Additionally, their experiences will enhance applications to the ?International\r\nResearch Fellowship Program? and ?Graduate Research Fellowship Program?. Exchange visits are\r\ncomplemented by a comprehensive set of off-site tools such as joint website (www.leipzig.vanderbilt.edu),\r\nproject wiki pages to exchange data and tutorials, and video conferences. The proposal further involves\r\nexchange of undergraduate students with focus on groups underrepresented in science leveraging the\r\nPI?s CAREER award undergraduate open house. The collaboration is mutually beneficial as it provides\r\naccess to complementary knowledge and technologies. Researchers will travel in both directions: U.S.\r\nresearchers supported through the present proposal, German researchers through grant support from the\r\nGerman Academic Exchange Service and the German Research Foundation.\r\n",
