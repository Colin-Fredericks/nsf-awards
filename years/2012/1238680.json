The PI's participation in Bering Sea Days includes a number of presentations introducing students and community members to zooarchaeology and how the field contributes to an understanding of the ecology of key cultural species, fur seals and sea lions. By introducing students to zooarchaeology through hands on activities using the bones of culturally important species, Dr. Etnier hopes not only to inform students about zooarchaeology and their local environment, but to engage them in science in ways that other projects cannot.",
