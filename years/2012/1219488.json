Because frictional slip generates heat, measuring the temperature increase of\r\nfault zones above background temperatures can elucidates the strength of the fault. Here\r\nwe describe a new paleothermometer that can establish time-temperature histories for\r\nfaults hosted in sedimentary rocks by examining the thermal maturity of organic\r\nmolecules within the fault. This technique is widely applied in petroleum geochemistry\r\nto determine burial heating. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will establish a new paleothermometer for fault zones by\r\nrepurposing an existing paleothermometer used to establish long duration heating\r\nassociated with burial. Quantifying the frictional heating in a fault zone will allow them to\r\nconstrain fault and earthquake parameters like shear stress along a fault during failure and\r\nslip of the largest event. In order to extend the time-temperature range of this\r\npaleothermometer and establish thermal maturity indices at the short time scales and high temperatures that fault rocks experience during earthquakes, the investigators will design and conduct rapid heating experiments on organic-rich sedimentary rocks at various combinations of time and temperature relevant to seismic heating and determine the kinetic parameters of these reactions at short time scales.\r\n\r\nMeasurement of the coseismic friction is critical for determining the conditions under which an earthquake can expand into a major, societally significant event. This work will devise a new way to directly measure friction from slip on faults.\r\nFurthermore, two early career scientists will be funded.",
