 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID project proposes a model for preparing K-12 teachers to implement the new Framework for next generation science standards. The model is based on current evidence of effective professional development in disciplinary content and will also develop evidence in a rapid fashion about its potential effectiveness that will be used to refine and improve the model in time for it to be disseminated widely to networks of teacher educators, curriculum leaders and others as states begin to adopt the new standards.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the model will support teachers in developing understanding of \"core ideas\" and how to blend core ideas with scientific practices and crosscutting concepts to develop learning goals; modify existing materials; and developing learning tasks and assessment measures that meet learning goals.\r\n\r\nThe recently released National Research Council Framework for K-12 science education provides the basis for standards development.  It is anticipated that Achieve will take about a year to develop the standards.  This project will develop, test, and refine a model of professional development related to the standards that will be one of the factors essential to successful implementation.",

Our work focused on the science practice of developing and using models; however, the strategies we developed can be used with any science and engineering practices. \n\nWe planned and conducted a two-day pilot workshop and two day workshop that focused on helping teachers understand the Framework. The workshop focused on introducing teachers to the three dimensions of Framework -- core ideas, practices and crosscutting concepts -- and providing teachers with support and practice in integrating core ideas and the practice of using and developing models. We used our experiences to design a three-hour workshop that we conducted at National Science Teacher Association (NSTA) Area conferences (fall, 2012) and National conference (spring, 2012). The NSTA workshops focused helping teachers use the Framework and the NGSS.\n\nTo support teachers in integrating disciplinary core ideas and the practice of modeling, we designed process in which teachers should evaluate the current model or modeling practice by asking the following questions:\n 1. What learning goals will/do students achieve when they use the model?\n 2. What are the content ideas that align with the model?\n 3. How does the model help students reach the learning goal?\n 4.

They also provide a way teachers can discuss the practice of using and developing modeling with colleagues.  Teachers can apply these questions to integrate other science and engineering practices into their teaching.\n\nWe further defined our strategies to include a 10-step process to guide teachers in developing a sequence of lessons to build student proficiency in a bundle/group of performance expectations (PEs).\n\nStep 1:  Select performance expectations that work together &ndash; a bundle or group &ndash; to promote proficiency in using the ideas expressed.  Often the bundle will include performance expectations from a single NGSS topic or Disciplinary Core Idea (DCI), but a bundle or group of performance expectations could draw in performance expectations from other topics or DCI.\n\nStep 2:  Inspect the PE, clarification statements, and assessment boundaries to identify implications for instruction.\n\nStep 3:  Examine DCI(s), science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts coded to the PEs to identify implications for instruction.\n\nStep 4:  Look closely at the DCI(s) and PE(s).  What understandings need to be developed?  What content ideas will students need to know? What must students be able to do? Take into consideration prior PEs that serve as the foundation for cluster of PEs the lessons will address.\n\nStep 5:  Identify science and engineering practices that support instruction of the core ideas. Develop a coherent sequence of learning tasks that blend together various science and engineering practices with the core ideas and crosscutting concepts.\n\nStep 6:  Develop lesson level performance expectations.   Lesson level expectations guide lesson development to promote student learning; they build to the level of understanding intended in the bundle of performan..."
