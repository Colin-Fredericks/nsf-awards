This research examines how and why people \r\nin an authoritarian and changing society understand, valorize, and obey the law. While some suggest \r\nthat either coercion or legitimacy is the central explanation, we go further to test the interrelationship \r\nof these factors. We hypothesize that the precise role each plays will vary with the type of law considered.\r\nTo better understand the role of societal transitions on support for law, we explore how memories of important \r\nhistorical events and figures affect the level and nature of support for law. \r\n\r\nThe research design combines a social survey and in-depth interviews in a major provincial capital city, Chengdu,\r\nin southwest inland China. The survey will inquire about people's tendency toward legal (non-)compliance \r\nand their evaluation of different types of laws in terms of their legitimacy (i.e., how much they think each law \r\nreflects social values they support)and associated punishments (i.e., how likely they think the violation of \r\ncertain laws will entail harsh punishment).  The survey also inquires about memories of important events and \r\nfigures in Chinese history.  The survey will be followed by semi-structured interviews with a subsample\r\nof the respondents. The interviews will uncover the mechanisms that shape people's perceptions of laws' legitimacy.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This project expands legal compliance research beyond the boundaries of the Western world.\r\nWith a quarter of the world's population, China constitutes one of the largest and most influential\r\nsocieties in transition. A careful look into legal compliance in China will deepen understanding of how power and \r\nauthority shape individuals' minds. It will produce data for more comprehensive insight into Chinese society and \r\nculture that will be shared in scholarly communities inside and outside of China.",
