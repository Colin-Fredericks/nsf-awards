 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute (MCI) has established an REU program that provides exciting and challenging research experiences for undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary fields of archeology and museum conservation science to help them prepare for future careers in science. The program serves to enhance traditional classroom education that lacks a 'hands-on' component with mentored laboratory research in one of seven MCI project areas. Students engage in aspects of ongoing research projects or propose their own unique project. In so doing they acquire basic laboratory skills and an in depth understanding of the scientific method under the immediate supervision of a staff mentor. Students receive training in professional presentation and career and graduate school selection, and are included, as appropriate, in co-authored peer-reviewed publications and professional presentations at scientific meetings. Students are selected from a pool of highly motivated undergraduate applicants with an emphasis on under-represented minorities. MCI is a a well established and diverse institute with the infrastructure, staff, and resources capable of supporting this program. All MCI mentors have experience providing undergraduates with research opportunities and an infrastructure to recruit and process student interns is already in place through the Smithsonian Center for Education and Museum Studies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe fundamental goal of this program is the education and training of undergraduate students who utilize their unique interdisciplinary experience at MCI to achieve graduate degrees and establish themselves as professional scientists. Students are placed with a staff mentor according to their mutual interests and participate in all aspects of a project including planning, execution of analyses, data analysis, and formulating conclusions. Students contribute their results to a peer-reviewed publication and are assisted in pursuing graduate appointments. Insofar as all student interns are enrolled in external universities, this program establishes partnerships with institutions across the country and provides their students with hands-on laboratory experience in an established research group. Applications are solicited through the NSF REU Sites website and the larger Smithsonian Internship Program. Several established minority programs within the Smithsonian Institution provide additional venues to recruit underrepresented groups of young scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute (MCI) hosted an REU program from 2012-2015 that provided exciting and challenging research experiences for undergraduates in the interdisciplinary fields of archeology and museum conservation science.  Our program matched students with one of 10 professional researchers from MCI or other Smithsonian museums and research centers working collaboratively in seven defined project areas.  Over thirty projects were completed within these areas, producing significant scientific results that broaden our understanding of human history and enhance our ability to preserve our cultural heritage for future generations.  A few project examples include analysis of stable isotope signatures from North American 18th-19th century human remains as indicators of provenance and demographics, analysis of corrosion on mount pins of WWII aircraft recognition models, and characterization of daguerreotype corrosion.   Results have been disseminated to the research community and public in over 30 papers, presentations, posters, reports, and databases with several REU interns holding first or subsidiary authorship.\n\n \n\nOne fundamental purpose for our program was the education and training of undergraduate students. Our program enhanced traditional classroom education that lacks a \u00e6hands-on\u00c6 application of scientific analysis to archeology and museum conservation science, with mentored laboratory research.  Students participated in all aspects of their project including planning, execution of analyses, data analysis, formulating conclusions, and disseminating results.  Students acquired an in-depth understanding of the scientific method while gaining literacy in current archaeological and museum conservation topics.  All students were given additional training in research ethics, communication, and presentation skills.  Students had a chance to present their results to their peers at a final seminar day and some were even supported to travel to conferences where they shared their results. \n\n \n\nIn our efforts to train the next generation of scientists we supported 28 diverse and promising undergraduate students.  Many have gone on to pursue research and careers in STEM fields.  Seventy-five percent of our accepted interns were women and almost half were from liberal arts colleges, two populations that are traditionally underserved in scientific research fields.  As of this report, all previous interns that responded to follow-up surveys were still in school (graduate and undergraduate), planning to attend graduate school, or gainfully employed.  Most were pursuing scientific and engineering fields with several in archaeology and museum conservation.\n\n \n\nThe MCI REU internship program established with this award revitalized our mentorship and infrastructure resources for research and education.  We developed a seminar program for all MCI interns (REU and non-REU) that introduces students to topics and careers within archaeology and museum conservation science, provides networking with other interns and professionals, and teaches professional skills.  We fostered a new group of scientists that will become our future colleagues and collaborators.  They brought with them new excitement for science and a fresh perspective on scientific training that keeps our staff current and challenges us to explore new approaches to our field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/08/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christine A France"
