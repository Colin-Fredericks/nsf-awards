PACT is the premiere forum to bring together researchers from architecture, compilers, applications and languages to present and discuss innovative research of common interests.  The grant will primarily fund US citizens/residents, and the highest priority will be given to under-represented groups. Attending the conference is an important educational/training experience for the participants and helps create the next generation of researchers in this area.",

We were able to support all the students who applied for a grant.

Moreover, four student awardees have U.S. citizenship or are U.S. permanent residents. There was no student from other under-represented groups (e.g. Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Blacks or African Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders, and Persons with Disabilities) applying for the travel grant.
