 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds William Sharpee of NC State University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Dissecting the molecular mechanisms that cause Rice Blast Disease,\" during the summer of 2012 at Seoul National University in Seoul, Gyeonggi provence, Korea.  The host scientist is Yong-Hwan Lee. \r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in determining at the molecular level how the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae causes Rice Blast Disease, a particularly devastating disease of rice.  Current methods to control this organism are insufficient, resulting in the loss of millions of acres of rice each year.  Research into how M. oryzae overcomes its host will lead to novel control methods and result in more sustainable, high yielding rice crops. \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs the world population is currently estimated at approximately seven billion people, it is impressive to imagine a population this large can be sustained by modern agriculture.  In the 1980s, the United States enjoyed a surplus of food so great that commodity prices sank and caused the farm economy to collapse.  Even as of 2003, the USDA bought surplus powdered milk to support dairy prices and prevented another collapse 1.   However, with the world population continuing to grow and recent droughts causing food prices to increase, the previous surplus of food produced by the United States has dwindled.  Droughts across the globe has the UN preparing for a possible global food crisis as corn and wheat prices have risen by 50% on international markets since June 2012 2.   In order to stem the tide of massive starvation and promote more sustainable agriculture, new technologies that increase agricultural yield must be discovered.  Of the numerous factors that hinder crop yields, plant diseases such as Rice Blast Disease caused by the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae have a devastating effect and cost growers billions of dollars annually in lost crops.  In order to discover new ways to control this disease in an economically and ecologically viable manner, research into how M. oryzae gains entry into the host plant will indicate areas of exploitation for novel control methods.\n\n                In order to gain entry into the host, plant pathogenic fungi have been shown to utilize what are referred to as effector molecules.  By definition, effectors are small molecules that are secreted by the pathogen to manipulate the host cell for the benefit of the pathogen.  While the mechanisms by which many of these operate are not yet known, it is accepted that they function to suppress host cell defenses and facilitate pathogen entry.  During my time in Korea, I had the opportunity to analyze the genome sequences of 41 re-sequenced isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae with the intention of looking for conserved hypothetical effector genes throughout every isolate.  It was our hypothesis that if a given effector gene is important for pathogen infection into the host, it should be conserved across all or many of the isolates.   To date this is the first study to look at the conservation of putative effectors from a single species across multiple isolates and could provide fruitful information about the evolution and function of effectors within plant pathogens.\n\n            Upon compiling the data, it was shown that across all the M. oryazae isolates the potential effector genes were largely conserved.  This result should not be surprising since it was shown that nucleotide diversity among 46 M. oryzae isolates was extremely low which is indicative of recent pathogen dispersal3.  At the 95% nucleotide similarity threshold, none of the effectors from the M. oryzae isolates were shared among M. grisea, which is a closely related species that was included in the study.  When the threshold of similarity was reduced to 60%, however, 17 genes were found to be in common among the two species.  In addition , we searched the genomes of two closely related species Magnaporthe poae and Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (GGT) and found 12 of the 17 were present in all 4 species.  We are currently analyzing data to understand how these genes are expressed when the fungus is growing within the plant.  If any of the aforementioned genes are expressed more while the fungus is residing inside the host plant, it would indicate that it must be important for infection and potentially acts as an effector.\n\n            Having the opportunity to study in a world class institution such as Seoul National University was a wonderful experience.  I would like to thank the NSF, the NRF, and all those involved in the EAPSI program for selecting me and allowing me the opportunity to expand my borders.  It was a great honor to be selected and I greatly appreciate all th..."
