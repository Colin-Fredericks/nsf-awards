 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop a cost effective, robust, reproducible, stable SERS (Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy) substrate with high spatial resolution for ultra-sensitive biodiagnostics. SERS is a powerful, versatile bioscreening technique based on molecular vibrations that currently lacks a tunable, homogenous, repeatable, inexpensive and sensitive substrate of uniform geometry. The central focus of this research is to address the existing SERS challenge through the development of a robust, mass manufacturable, ultra dense, reproducible ordered array of ion implantation seeded silica nanowires of well defined geometry as an effective SERS substrate. \r\n\r\nThe research objectives of the proposal are to (a) investigate and study the growth kinetics of ion-implantation seeded selective nucleation of silica nanowires, (b) synthesize ultra-dense massively parallel array of vertically aligned wires of controlled geometry, (c)  develop and apply robust, dynamic nanomanufacturing schemes to achieve reliable and reproducible fabrication of these batch fabricated nanowires, (d) validate the spatially confined SERS substrate for active bioscreening by real-time detection of the desired species and (e) develop a strong interdisciplinary, laboratory-based  research, education and outreach program focusing on integration of biology,  nanomanufacturing,  and  microsystems that will have an impact on the training of middle school, high school, community college students and teaching fraternity from all backgrounds.\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The research opens the gateway for using ion implantation as a general purpose nanoscale catalysis tool towards mass manufacturing bottom-up controlled nanosystems for wide variety of applications. \r\nBroader Impact: Advancements in the field of nanoscale science, tools and techniques with emphasis on emerging disciplines like nanomanufacturing would be widely disseminated through the innovative \"K- PhD\" program. Moreover, the research has participation of the underrepresented groups (minority, women) and fosters partnerships through ongoing international collaboration and exchange. The results of the research will translate into case studies in course modules and seminars/presentations rendered by the investigators.\r\n\r\n",

VLS grown nanowires catalyzed with Palladium were electrophoretically deposited and used to detect Glucose Oxidase.  The immobilized nanowires were able to detect Glucose oxidase in a range of 25&ndash;300 mg dl&minus;1, with a detection limit of 11 mg dl&minus;1, sensitivity: 0.463 &micro;A (mg dl&minus;1) &minus;1 and regression coefficient of 0.992. Additionally, a method for direct nanowire integration was developed that allowed for silica nanowires to be grown directly into interdigitated sensing structures. This technique eliminates the need for physical nanowire transfer thus preserving nanowire structure and performance integrity and further reduces fabrication cost. Successful nanowire integration was physical verified using Scanning Electron Microscopy and confirmed electrically using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of immobilized Prostate Specific Antigens (PSA).\n\n \nOver the course of the grant period opportunities were offered that allowed for the training and development of future scholars. Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) participants from various universities contributed to the goals of the work by developing experiments and gathering data.
