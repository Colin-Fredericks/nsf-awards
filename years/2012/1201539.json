The conference covers a wide range of active research areas and  features 14 Invited Plenary Lectures presented by leading specialists. In addition, there will be 40 special Invited Sessions, consisting of three talks each, as well as Contributed and Poster Sessions covering many aspects of applied and theoretical probability, statistics and stochastic processes.",
