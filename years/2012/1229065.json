 "awd_abstract_narration": "Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) proposes to support technical services on two global class research vessels, both operated as part of the U.S. Academic Fleet which is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).  Ships to be supported are R/V Atlantis, a 274? general purpose research vessel and R/V Knorr, a 279? vessel of the same class.  R/V Oceanus, a 177? intermediate class vessel, changed from a ship operated by WHOI to a vessel operated by Oregon State University.  Support is requested for the period of transition in 2012, roughly 28 days.  As part of their basic operations WHOI will provide two technicians on each seagoing research project, and will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation, including use of the multibeam bathymetric sonars on Atlantis and Knorr. \r\n\r\nWHOI also proposes to provide several elements of specialized support for investigators, with separate charges. Specialized support requested for 2012 include \r\n1) Support for Sea Education Association (SEA) \r\n2) Tech Pool Pilot Program \r\n3) Support for the Vertical Plankton Recorded (VPR). \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
