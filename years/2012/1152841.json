 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to understand the interaction of language and culture on the perception of color. The Standard Model of color vision asserts that the visual system of all humans with normal color vision is organized around six fundamental sensations in a color-opponent fashion: red vs. green, blue vs. yellow, and black vs. white.  Yet most of the world languages do not have a specific term for the colors that English speakers call \"blue.\" Some speakers use a word meaning black, others use the term gray to mean blue, and still others use a single word that means green-or-blue. In what sense, then, is the mental representation of color in these individuals \"color-opponent\" if identical names are given to two sensations that fall on two presumptively independent color dimensions?  How do the language differences affect how people think about color? To answer this, color naming studies will examine in detail the structures of the named color categories in monolingual American English speakers and a group of recent immigrants from Somalia who now live in Columbus, OH. The Somalis, who do not yet speak English, do not use a specific word for blue. Experiments based on color sorting and similarity, which do not require a color name response, will examine the possibility that classical color-opponency is observable in their non-language representation of color. Control studies of spectral sensitivity and discrimination will test for the possible interplay between cultural and sensory factors (including congenital and acquired impairments in color vision) in shaping an individual's mental representation of color. \r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to understanding the foundational processes by which innate and cultural factors shape an individual's understanding of their world. In addition, it will bring the Somalis, who came to the US as refugees from political upheaval, into a research environment in a university and will give students a better understanding of people from a vastly different culture.",

One line of work extended our previous studies of within- and cross-cultural similarities and differences in named color categories revealed by the World Color Survey.  Additional detailed studies of color naming of American English and Somali languages also show similar trends. Our studies of the Hadza, nomadic Tanzanian hunter-gatherers, show that within-language differences in color lexicon are present at the earliest stage of color term evolution.

This discovery represents a major advance in our understanding of human color cognition and how color lexicons evolve over time.  What remains unclear from our work is the basis for the universal cognitive and perceptual biases that govern how cultures around the world carve up color space into modest numbers of basic color categories.\n\n2.  We have also devised and empirically tested a powerful information-theory-based methodology &ndash; the color communication game&mdash;for studying the dynamics of color communication within as well as across cultures.  We have applied this novel methodology to study of the efficiencies in color communication in languages around the world, showing how communication efficiency increases as color lexicons become more complex and language communities communicate with increasing consensus.  We have also collected data in which human subjects (Somali-speaking and English-speaking) actually play the color communication game in person, and we applied the color communication game to the study of the development of color communication in English-speakers across the life span. Our results showed that color communication develops to near-adult levels by about 12 years of age, with color term production unexpectedly preceding fluent color term understanding.\n\n3.  Other work comparing English- and Somali-speaking subjects shows clearly the substantial influences of language on the encoding of primary color sensations thought to underlie color appearance; in particular our abbreviated hue-scaling paradigm revealed important within- as well as between-language differences in the usage of color terms for the four Hering primary sensations: red, green, blue, and yellow. Additional measurements show that these differences are not due to congenital or acquired color vision deficiencies.  This work challenges the view that these primary sensations are innate and organized in a color-opponent fashion, as proposed over 120 years ago by Ewald Hering.  Work begun at the end of the project and still underway uses brain imaging techniques (fMRI) to examine the physiological bases for the Hering primary hue sensations and their functional roles in human color perception.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Delwin T Lindsey"
