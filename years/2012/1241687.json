 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is linking and integrating multi-media teaching materials (slides, videos and textbooks) used in Information Security courses based on a security ontology. The semantic linking of the multimedia course materials allows students to search and compose multimedia and interactive course materials based on the content, medium and learning styles, enabling flexible personalized learning. To achieve these goals, the project is focusing on several research tasks: (1) Segmenting and annotating learning media based on their learning content, (2) Building a Security ontology to be used for annotating and querying of the learning objects, (3) Adapting lecture content to student learning styles, and (4) Evaluating the usability and effectiveness of the linked multimedia security learning system.\r\n\r\nThe technology and methodology that is being developed by this project, including the ontology builder for a given learning topic, the semantic segmentation of multimedia learning objects, the search, and personalization of learning objects, can be adapted to any course. The outcome of this project helps students build upon existing knowledge as they are being introduced to unfamiliar material, by creating subject specific searches of all course content. This changes the way students learn by making course content more organized, interactive, and instantly accessible while adding individualization options. Students are able to fill gaps in their previous learning instantly by integrating search results into their current studying. By having instant access to learning, and experiencing a truly interactive, individualized learning environment, students are less likely to be overwhelmed by course materials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis collaborative project among three institutions (NJIT, CUNY/College of Staten Island, and Montclair State University) aims to facilitate cyber-security learning and education for millennial students, by designing methodologies and tools to link diverse multi-modal online learning materials and making them accessible according to security concepts and semantic relationships.   \n\nOur approach was to design and implement a specialized educational search and learning platform for accessing cyber security learning resources in diverse formats.  There are many learning resources available on the Web, but a search with a standard search engine often returns material that is not geared towards educational purposes.  In addition, a student often does not know the correct search term to find what she is looking for.  The learning materials that may cover the same topic are scattered over PowerPoint slides, educational video segments, textbook pages, or syllabi.  Linking these online security learning materials according to security concepts supports students not only in searching for teaching materials but also in organizing their learning process according to security concepts. The platform also allows students to collect a personal set of the learning resources of different types and different data sources according to their preferences. Thus they can create a personal library of cyber security learning resources.\n\nIntellectual Merit: To create a knowledge base of cyber security learning resources and to support the search for the resources, we have developed a cyber security ontology (SO) that can provide students with domain knowledge of cyber security concepts and relationships.  The semi-automated cyber security ontology engineering uses bootstrapping and text extraction methods to recognize the cyber security concepts from textbooks and Web pages. We also developed an ontology guided coocurrence analysis method to identify the relationships among security concepts, by extracting sentences from a cyber security textbook. \n\nWe designed and implemented the security experts tool (SOX) that allows experts to insert and edit concepts and relationships in the cyber security ontology.  We have developed the security ontology browser (SOB) for students to navigate the domain knowledge structure and to learn the definition of each security concept via the hierarchical taxonomic structure among concepts, and learn about related concepts via the horizontal relationships among them. \n\nWe implemented the Security Learning by Ontology Browsing (SLOB) platform that uses the cyber security ontology to dynamically build a collection of different types of Online Open Cyber Security Learning Objects retrieved from many available online services and repositories.   SLOB provides access to videos, presentation slides, book pages, images and scientific papers in a unified framework. These resources are indexed by the cyber security ontology.

The methodology and approach are transferable to any knowledge-based teaching domain for which an ontology has been created.\n\nBroad Impact:  The project has engaged seven undergraduate and twelve graduate students, providing them with research and system development opportunities.  Seven of these students were female. Three Master?s projects are completed and four Master?s projects are underway.  Three undergraduate students presented their work at the annual College-wide Undergraduate Student Research Conferences. \n\nWe developed and offered a new undergraduate course \"ISI 315: Information Security and Risk Management\" in the Information Systems and Informatics program at CUNY College of Staten Island.  This class uses the SLOB tool for as an additional learning tool.  The course attracted 17 students.   We supported twelve students who enrolled in the new course by purchasing textbooks  to motivate the enrolled students to take the CISSP certification exam.     \n\nWe also supported seven undergraduate students with cyber security scholarships.  Some students served as college mentors for the high school students enrolled in the summer camps, and evaluated the SLOB tool, while others are involved in research and system development.\n\nPI has organized four separate summer camps, in which we have trained almost 60 upper-middle and high school students on cyber security awareness.  About 1/3 of the students were female, and about 90% of the students were African Americans.  A co-PI at NJIT has demonstrated the tools to a group of high school teachers and to approximately 60 high school students. \n\nOur approaches and tools were presented in several research and educational conferences and described in published journals and book chapters.  PI has organized the conference tracks and workshops on the topic of  Cyber Security, and visited Korea University, a leading university in Cyber Defense and Cyber Security education in South Korea.  \n\nThese tools and the ontology are shared widely via the project website of the iSecure Lab.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/21/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Soon A Chun"
