The award will support participation (via lodging cost subsidy) by 20 individuals who would otherwise be unable to attend the meeting, with a particular emphasis on broadening participation by junior researchers and groups traditionally underrepresented in astronomy and astrophysics.\r\n\r\nThe SnowPAC workshop is an international meeting that reviews recent developments in particle astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy, astronomy, and cosmology. It seeks to establish new connections between these disciplines and establish new collaborative ties between individuals working in these research areas.\r\n\r\nThe main SnowPAC 2012 meeting will be a topical conference on \"gravitational lensing in the age of survey science\". This year's meeting will also incorporate a smaller workshop on dark-matter observations through gamma rays (titled \"SnowDOG\").",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe conference \"SnowPAC 2012: Gravitational Lensing in the Age of Survey Science\" was held from 18-23 March 2012 at Snowbird Resort in Little Cottonwood Canyon, UT.  SnowPAC 2012 was attended by 99 researchers from 14 countries.  Two smaller particle astrophysics workshops (SnowDOG and SnowTIGER) were also associated with SnowPAC 2012.\n\n\nGravitational lensing is a scientifically powerful phenomenon predicted by Einstein's theory of gravity (\"general relativity\") by which the light from distant astronomical objects can be magnified and distorted by the gravitational field of more nearby objects along the line of sight.  This lensing effect can be used to measure the masses of the nearby objects, and to provide a magnified view of the more distant objects.  The effect is observable across scales from extrasolar planets up to the large-scale structure of the universe as a whole.\n\n\nThe wide applicability of gravitational lensing lends itself to a broad range of scientific applications.  SnowPAC 2012 was the first broad-scope gravitational lensing meeting in North America in over 5 years, and brought together scientists working on extrasolar planets, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and cosmology.  The common thread of gravitational lensing provided a forum for interaction, collaboration, and intellectual cross-pollination between researchers who would otherwise not attend the same conferences.\n\n\nSnowPAC 2012 provided a unique opportunity for junior researchers (graduate students and postdoctoral scholars) working in the field of gravitational lensing to present their work and interact with more senior scientists.  Over 50% of the participants were junior, and over 50% of the conference talks were given by junior participants.  A poster session provided further opportunity for presentations by junior participants.  NSF funding, together with matching funds from the University of Utah, provided partial financial support for 41 participant, 33 of whom (80%) were junior researchers.\n\n\nThe slides presented by SnowPAC 2012 speakers are hosted online by the University of Utah Department of Physics and Astronomy, and provide a valuable repository of material describing the state of research in gravitational lensing as of 2012:\n\nhttp://www.physics.utah.edu/snowpac/index.php/past-workshops/snowpac-2012-talks\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adam S Bolton"
