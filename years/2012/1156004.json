 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research team will investigate the relative roles of shock acceleration, flare acceleration, suprathermal particle composition, and particle transport as a function of position (along the shock and/or the longitudinal distance from the solar source region). The relative contributions of flare and shock acceleration to solar energetic particle (SEP) events and their resulting compositional signatures are as yet undetermined, and this fact provides the motivation for this work. The research team will use observations of specific individual SEP events obtained from multiple spacecraft, rather than attempting to infer phenomenology through statistical studies of many events measured by a single spacecraft under varying conditions, as has been done in the past. This approach will allow a more accurate determination of the driving coronal mass ejection's source region and of its related properties. The team's analysis technique will also provide a more global view of solar activity and non-local effects, which may play an important role in the generation of SEP events and in determining their longitudinal extent. This effort will directly address open scientific questions regarding SEP composition and particle transport. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the production, composition, and extent of SEP events is critical for accurate predictions of space weather and its potential impact on astronauts and satellites. The team will disseminate their scientific results through published articles, scientific talks, and the web pages associated with the relevant NASA spacecraft missions. This project will contribute to the training of a postdoctoral researcher as a co-investigator at George Mason University, and, through an international collaboration, a graduate student in Germany. The team will also supervise and train students at the University of Arizona and the Naval Research Laboratory who will work on this project. The Lead Principal Investigator at the California Institute of Technology is an active participant in \"Solar Week,\" a local program designed to encourage high school girls to pursue careers in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Overview\n\n \n\nThe Sun\u00c6s activity can produce conditions in the interplanetary medium and inside the Earth\u00c6s magnetosphere that are hazardous to both humans and spacecraft.  One aspect of this is solar energetic particle (SEP) events which create an elevated radiation environment which is a significant health hazard to astronauts (particularly during extra-vehicular activities) and can cause spacecraft electronics to malfunction, degrade solar panels, and corrupt data.  Predicting the occurrence of these events is still an elusive goal within the umbrella of space weather forecasting.  The largest of these events are created by shocks driven by coronal mass ejections as they explode outwards from the Sun  Smaller SEP events, typically enriched in 3He but less of a space weather concern, are created through processes occurring close to and during solar flares, however the exact mechanism is still being debated. \n\n \n\nWith the launch of the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft, we have the capability to monitor SEP events and their associated solar phenomena from multiple positions around the Sun simultaneously.  This provides a huge advantage in studying the longitudinal extent of SEP events and how their characteristics change with distance from the solar source region.  It came as quite a surprise to find small SEP events could extend over more than 120 degrees in longitude, as the prior understanding of these events was that they were confined to a narrow region of space due to the compact nature of the associated solar flare.  It was also surprising to find large SEP events detected 360 degrees around the Sun within 30-40 minutes; this points to extremely efficient longitudinal transport processes at work, but what those are remains unknown.\n\n \n\nWe have made multiple studies of individual and groups of SEP events, both large and small, using data from sensors on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and both STEREOs.  Our work has advanced our understanding of the mechanisms that spread particles in longitude and illuminated the role of shock acceleration and large CMEs.  We have ruled out one suggested theory for the longitudinal transport in small, 3He-rich SEP events and found that particle rigidity does not seem to be an important discriminator for the processes at work in large SEP events, while ion speed or energy may be.  Finally we have found that the solar sources for 3He-rich SEP events are not always smaller, compact regions on the Sun or confined to spurts of solar material in the form of coronal jets; many events were found to involve movement of material over extended regions on the Sun.  All of these results help in the development of accurate predictions for the occurrence, characteristics, and severity of SEP events throughout the inner heliosphere.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christina Cohen"
