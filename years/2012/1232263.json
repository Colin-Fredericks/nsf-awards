 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to design and fabricate compact, low-threshold and narrow-linewidth microcavity-based mid-IR sources and to demonstrate their application as key components for ultra-sensitive gas detection. The approach is to use high optical quality (high-Q) Whispering-Gallery Mode (WGM) resonances in rare-earth-doped fluoride glasses microspheres and microdisks; these will be optimized to demonstrate narrow-linewidth ?comb-like? mid-IR luminescent sources and tunable low-noise mid-IR lasers. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The convergence of two recently emerging areas in photonics, i.e. mid-IR rare-earth-doped glasses and high-Q optical microresonators, not only enables the possibility of demonstrating novel mid-IR laser and sensor technologies, but also lays the groundwork for further investigation of different aspects of high-Q mid-IR resonances in areas such as nonlinear and quantum optical phenomena. Operation in the mid-IR regime and sensing based on the absorption spectrum of the target molecules will reduce the need for surface functionalization and affinity-based detection that is currently used in almost all high-Q WGM optical biosensors.    \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed mid-IR sources have immediate application in basic research on nonlinear optics, biochemistry, and sensor technology. Low-power, low-weight, compact, low-cost and high-sensitivity WGM-based mid-IR sources will benefit society in areas such as biomedical research, environmental control, medical diagnostics and microfabrication. The multidisciplinary nature of this project will stimulate collaboration among different departments at the University of New Mexico. The PIs have also developed plans for collaboration with minority serving colleges, K-12 and post-secondary teachers and students.",

The key component in this laser is a small (sub-mm) optical resonator called Whispering-Gallery Mode (WGM) microresonator. WGM microresonators are small spherical, toroidal or disk shaped objects made of a dielectric material (such as glass) with very small absorption in the desired wavelength range. When fabricated properly (i.e. small diameter, symmetrical shape and extremely low surface roughness), these resonators can trap and recirculate light in a very small volume and for a long period of time. Because of these properties, when made of active optical materials (that can generate light upon optical excitation), WGM resonators can generate ultrahigh purity (narrow spectral width) laser light in a small volume.<em> To our knowledge, the microlaser demonstrated in this project is the first mid-IR microlaser based on WGM resonator that operates at room temperature and generates continuous emission at wavelengths longer than 2 micron</em>. In general very small WGM resonators are fabricated using expensive techniques that involve crystal growth and cleanroom processing. However glass based spherical and micron size WGM resonators (and therefore lasers) can be made from thin glass rods using a relatively simple and low cost melting process. In the past active spherical microlasers have been used to generate laser light at several wavelengths within the visible and near infrared spectral region but not mid infrared. This was primarily due to unusual properties of the mid-IR transparent glasses (typically soft fluoride glasses). We have designed and developed a system and method for fabrication of high quality (symmetric and low surface roughness) spherical microresonators from soft-glass fibers and used it for fabrication of spherical WGM microlasers from a specific type of soft glass (Er:ZBLAN) doped for laser generation near 2.7 micron. We have fully characterized this microlaser and demonstrated its potential for gas sensing applications and designed and fabricated a mid-IR fiber optic amplifier to boost its output power by two to three orders of magnitude. We have also proposed a new family of high spectral brightness narrow linewidth mid-IR fiber lasers (&lt; 1 MHz) with single-mode operation at any target wavelength between 2.5 to 9.5 micron. Our theoretical analysis has demonstrated the feasibility of making such lasers with reasonable output power based on recent advancement in fabrication of soft glass microstructured fibers. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Intellectual merit</em>:</strong> By combining knowledge and techniques from two different fields in optics, i.e. mid-IR rare-earth-doped glasses and high-<em>Q</em> optical microresonators, we have shown the possibility of narrow linewidth mid-IR laser generation in Er:ZBLAN WGM microresonator. Our approach can be easily extended to WGM microlasers made of variety of active mid-IR gain media (typically soft glasses) and therefore a wide range of mid-IR lasers. We have developed a simple model to describe the multi-mode behavior of the mid-IR microlaser. This model has resulted in a deeper understanding of the lasing process in WGM microlasers and can be used for optimal cavity and coupler design for these lasers. Our theoretical and experimental work on gas sensing based on high-Q WGM mid-IR microresonators has defined a path way for designing WGM based gas sensors that do not require surface functionalization. We have also analyzed the performance characteristics and design requirements of mid-infrared distributed feedback (DFB) Raman fiber lasers (RFLs) based on pi-phase-shifted (PPS) Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) written in mid-IR fibers (made of certain low-phonon-energy glasses). <strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts</em>: </strong>Most gas molecules have strong absorption lines in the mid-IR range that can be exploited to detect and identify them at low concentrations.
