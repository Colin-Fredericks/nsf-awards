 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award has been made to Baker University in collaboration with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences to provide research training for 8 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013 & 2014. The research focus is on the three dimensional spatial and temporal variability of plant-invertebrate interactions in a temperate deciduous forest canopy. The PI team will train and supervise the students' accent into the canopy and their collection of tardigrades and leaves which will be measured, tested, and analyzed in the new Baker Ecology Laboratory. Students are trained in field ecology from the experimental design stage to a publishable manuscript.  Students will participate in classes, seminars, and workshops on subjects such as responsible conduct in research, scanning electron microscopy, geographical information systems, professional communication skills, single rope technique climbing, exposure to career opportunities in academia, museums, and industry, and the graduate school application process. Students will also be exposed to local industries, governmental agencies, and the Konza Long-Term Ecological Research site. REU students will learn to use remote access tools to monitor the environment, communicate with experts, and develop scholarly publications. The program's recruitment effort includes traditional \"hard copy\" formats, e-mail and Facebook digital advertising, and direct contact with organizations for students and veterans with disabilities.  The program is designed to accommodate students with ambulatory disabilities, expected to comprise about 50% of the cohort. Students will be selected based on academic record, desire to learn field biology, and potential for outstanding research in field or ecological biology. Students will be tracked to determine activity in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The program will be assessed by the REU Common Assessment Tool in addition to other tools. More information is available by visiting http://canopy.naturalsciences.org , or by contacting PI (Dr. William Miller at William.Miller@BakerU.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Meg Lowman or Dr. Elzie McCord at canopymeg@gmail.com).",
