This award will support a 1.5 day workshop during June 25-26, 2012 in Arlington, VA to bring together the community of OCI CAREER awardees. The workshop objectives are to: (1) encourage networking and discussion among awardees; (2) provide a forum to facilitate the discovery of new synergies and connections among researchers from the community; and (3) provide inspiration and motivation for new research through a series of keynote presentations from leaders in the areas of Grand Challenges in Cyberinfrastructure, Big Data, Computational Science, High Performance Computing, and Visualization. By bringing together leaders from these areas with cyberinfrastructure researchers, the workshop seeks to inspire new approaches to solving critical research problems. The results of the workshop will be widely disseminated through a final report and website containing project reports and presentation materials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe term cyberinfrastructure was coined in the late 1990's; it refers to infrastructure consisting of computing systems, data storage systems, advanced instruments and data repositories, visualization environments, and people that are linked together by software and high performance networks.  The goals of cyberinfrastructure are to enable scientific breakthroughs that are not possible without such an infrastructure and to improve research productivity.  Cyberinfrastructure has been developed to enable collaborations and scientific advances among various groups of researchers, such as researchers in plant sciences (e.g., through the iPlant Toolkit) and earthquake engineering (e.g., through NEES).\n\nAt the 2012 NSF CyberBridges Workshop, junior faculty with NSF CAREER Awards from the Office of Cyberinfrastructure and related areas who attended the workshop were exposed to cutting edge research in this field through keynote presentations by senior leaders in the field.  Such presentations also inspired them to further their research and education careers.  Program directors from the National Science Foundation (NSF) also served on a panel and described the cyberinfrastructure activities of several NSF divisions and directorates.  In addition, NSF CAREER Awardees in attendance presented posters on their NSF CAREER project research and education activities.  NSF CAREER Awardees also participated in networking activities and identified many potential research and education collaborations.\n\nThe keynote presentations and NSF CAREER project posters focused on various areas of cyberinfrastructure including grand Challenges in cyberinfrastructure and computational- and data-enabled science and engineering, data-enabled science and engineering, computational-enabled science and engineering, high performance computing, and visualization.\n\nThe workshop website is http://www.cse.psu.edu/conferences/cb2012/.  Posted on the workshop website are the keynote speaker talk slides and NSF CAREER Awardee poster abstracts.  The workshop report and conference program are also posted on the website.\n\nThe cyberinfrastructure research presented at the workshop advances the knowledge of the scientific community and will impact and transform the fields of computer science, mathematics, engineering, science, and medicine while encouraging and inspiring new approaches.  The cyberinfrastructure education presented at the workshop inspired new approaches in teaching and learning.  Workshop attendees also discussed several aspects of cyberinfrastructure.  Ten subthemes of this discussion were identified.  Five of the subthemes focused on interdisciplinary opportunities such as interdisciplinary initiatives and universities, interdisciplinary initiatives at NSF, academic-industry partnerships, collaborations, and education.  The remaining five subthemes focused on challenges in the field in the areas of data, people, engineering vs. science, sustainability, and cyberinfrastructure framework.  As a result of the networking activities, NSF CAREER Award attendees identified new synergies including 55 potential  collaborations in research and education as a result of the networking  activities.  In addition, NSF CAREER Awardees interacted and networked with thought leaders in the field and received career mentoring, as well.\n\nOur NSF grant was used to support the travel of the NSF CAREER Awardees and keynote speakers who attended the workshop.  This enabled faculty to attend the workshop, to present their NSF CAREER project research and education activities, to gain feedback on their work, to see presentations on cutting edge research in the field, to network with other NSF CAREER Awardees and leaders in the field, and to identify collaborations.  The grant also partially supported the efforts of the workshop co-chairs and workshop staff who organized and held the workshop.  The workshop co-chairs also wrote the workshop reports and gave a talk on the workshop to t..."
