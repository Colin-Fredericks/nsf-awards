The students will work on a research project side by side ith researchers in the group they are visiting, participating in active esearch projects with their European hosts.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are twofold, to develop human resources and o advance science.  From the human resources perspective, the project ill broaden the preparation of the students by exposing them to new research paradigms and approaches; it will reinforce the students' motivation and interest for a career as a scientist; it will increase the students' awareness of different research cultures, lifestyles, and academic systems, opening up new career opportunities for them and\r\nmaking them competitive in the global market.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of advancing science, the project will create synergies and build research bridges between the European hosts and the students' home research groups. This will facilitate long term research collaborations between U.S. and European research groups. This will benefit society by promoting research progress and increase the worldwide competitiveness of the U.S. high-tech industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project funded a selected group of Ph.D. students from the US to spend a period of six to eight weeks in a European research group to conduct joint research.  The students worked in different research groups, to ensure full immersion into the culture of the host's country. The groups represented  a range of specific research topics and methodologies in the area of robotics and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThe main purpose of the project was to promote international research cooperation between US and European researchers. Europe has a particularly large and strong community of academic and industrial researchers studying all aspects of robotics and AI. The European Community has provided and continues to invest significant funding in this area of research.  Cognitive Robotics, which encompasses robotics and its integration with AI, human robot interaction, modelling social system, and cognitive systems, is becoming one of the critical areas for industry competitiveness in the coming years. \n\nSharing research ideas and collaborating on research projects across national boundaries is becoming critical to accelerate the research progress, avoid duplication, and produce a greater return on investment. While collaborations between US researchers and European colleagues exist, opportunities are often missed because of lack of time to foster new collaborations and/or perceived difficulties with funding international collaborations.  This project addressed this issue by facilitating the start of new collaborations or intensifying already existing collaborations.\n\nThe students funded by this project have received unique and highly valuable training.  A valuable part of training new researchers is giving them the opportunity to interact and work with leaders in their research field outside their own research group.  This helps the students seeing their work in a broader context, gives them opportunities for receiving different feedback, and makes them more independent of their research advisor. The students in this project worked side by side with researchers from a different country, getting exposed to different research approaches, and building research bridges with their European host.  Students were exposed to the culture and lifestyle of the country they visited. This increased their awareness and understanding of different cultures, helping them become the global scientists that are needed for the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Maria L Gini"
