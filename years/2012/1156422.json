A group of 8 undergraduate students and 2 high school teachers will engage in state-of-the-art research with a specific focus on materials science applied to sustainable energy. The EMERGE program emphasizes first time research experiences for a diverse group of students who have limited access to research opportunities.\r\n\r\nFaculty from Chemistry, Physics and Engineering will mentor students and secondary school teachers on theoretical, computational, and experimental projects associated with energy storage, energy conversion, carbon capture and environmental monitoring. Seminars and lectures introducing the challenges of sustainable energy will complement the research. A series of presentations and discussion sections led by the faculty from Engineering, the Physical Sciences and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, will challenge the students to examine the role of science and engineering research against a broader global societal context. The combination of research and seminars will provide experience, training and professional development opportunities that are essential to the vitality of science and technology for the next generation. This award is funded by Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe EMERGE (Energy, Materials and the Environment: Researchers Gaining Experience) program at Princeton University will contribute to the training of the next generation of scientists and engineers to tackle the challenges of providing sustainable energy for the future.  EMERGE engages 8 undergraduate students and 2 high school teachers in state-of-the-art materials science research applied to sustainable energy production. A diverse group of students will be chosen for the EMERGE program that will emphasize giving students who have had limited access to research opportunities a first research experience.\r\n\r\nFaculty from Chemistry, Physics and Engineering will mentor students and secondary school teachers on projects associated with energy storage, energy conversion, carbon capture and environmental monitoring. Projects span the range of recovering the energy of bacterial motion to optimizing high temperature materials to confine nuclear reactions. Through a series of presentations, lectures by the faculty from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, and organized discussion groups, students are also challenged to examine the role of science and engineering research against a broader global societal context. The research opportunities provide students with hands-on experience to excite and motivate them for careers in research, business or government, while the RET program provides teachers with an improved perspective of the impact of science and engineering for sustainable energy to pass on to their students.   This award is funded by Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research.",
