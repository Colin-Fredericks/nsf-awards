The approach is to attain this objective through synergy created by grants to researchers with highly innovative ideas, support for intensive dialog at conferences and community building across disciplines.  Scientists who receive grants are typically not more than five years past earning tenure.  Such awardees are poised to attempt truly transformative research projects that were too risky while working toward tenure. Annual meetings are held at Biosphere 2 and are attended by a diverse group of scientists who participate in highly interactive sessions to identify bottlenecks, find avenues for breakthroughs, and build new scientific teams to facilitate the breakthroughs. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nConvening these outstanding early career awardees with other preeminent researchers to engage in alternative methods for creative dialog and for building scientific teams will have a transformative impact on the field of solar energy conversion.  Scialog is demonstrating a novel approach to convening scientists to accelerate high-risk research and showing that authentic dialog is a valid scientific methodology.\r\n \r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nScialog will directly support high risk projects for approximately forty outstanding early career U.S. academic scientists and their research groups, including postdoctoral researchers, undergraduate and graduate students, and technicians, many of whom are women and/or from underrepresented minorities.  Based on this support, many of these young researchers will be prepared to form the vanguard of the next generation of U.S. scientific innovators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch Corporation for Science Advancement (RCSA) initiated Scialog &ndash; science and dialog &ndash; in 2010 as a unique program that seeks to catalyze major breakthroughs needed to meet global challenges.  Scialog is focused initially on the conversion of solar energy to electricity and fuels.  The goal of Scialog is to accelerate breakthroughs in solar energy conversion to electricity and fuels through synergy created by grants to researchers with highly innovative ideas, support for intensive dialog at conferences and community building across disciplines. \n\n The purpose of NSF Award # 1238658 was for the NSF to co-sponsor, with RCSA, a Scialog conference with $50,000, matched equally by RCSA.  The Scialog Program has demonstrated the potential to be transformative in both process and experimental outcomes, thus responding to the National Science Board's mandate for NSF to fund such activities.\n\n Scialog provides catalytic funding to early career scientists in US academia engaged in innovative, high-risk research that has the potential to make transformative advancements in the efficiency, durability and cost of solar energy conversion systems.  Scientists who receive awards are typically not more than five years past earning tenure.  This timeframe is when academicians make the transition from early to mid career. It is the period in which the most important and innovative ideas of a scientific career often emerge.  Having recently received the affirmation and academic freedom conferred by tenure, awardees are poised to attempt that truly transformative research project they have been carrying in their \"back pocket\" but that is just too risky to try while working toward tenure.  RCSA is funding three-year research awards for these early career scientists with innovative ideas.  Eighteen single and six multi-investigator awards totaling $3,250,000 were made to 30 Scialog Fellows since the program's inception.\n\n Annual meetings are held at Biosphere 2 near Tucson, Arizona and are attended by a diverse group of scientists that participate in highly interactive sessions to identify bottlenecks, find avenues for breakthroughs, and build new scientific teams to facilitate the breakthroughs.  Conference participants are encouraged to self assemble into collaborative cross-disciplinary teams of two to four researchers and write short proposals at the conference for additional seed funding ($100K per team) for highly innovative ideas that emerge from the dialog.  About fifteen NSF SOLAR and/or SEP awardees attend the conference each year, including keynote speakers Eric Mazur (Harvard University), James McCusker (Michigan State University) and Luping Yu (University of Chicago).  Five NSF SOLAR awardees &ndash; Rene Lopez (UNC Chapel Hill), John Gilbertson &amp; Janelle Leger (Western Washington University), Boaz Ilan (UC Merced) and Christine Luscombe, (University of Washington) &ndash; are members of some of the twelve successful teams that have won Collaborative Innovation Awards based on proposals written at the conferences.  NSF support has been highly leveraged through the participation and success of its awardees at the conferences, as well as the success of Scialog Fellows and other participants.\n\nAt the heart of Scialog is dialog, a methodology involving a special form of communication that suspends immediate critical judgment and debate in favor of listening for what one does not know or understand and building on that.  As novel possibilities are built up in this creative process, it then becomes possible to form new collaborative teams to evaluate and refine novel ideas and hone them into specific projects designed to overcome bottlenecks.  Dialog as manifested in Scialog is aimed at unleashing human imagination.  Dialog erodes the barriers to cross-disciplinary science; uncovers the gaps in the intellectual landscape; and allows multifaceted, as opposed to either-or, opportunities to emerge.   It thereby opens door..."
