 "awd_abstract_narration": "As scientific research becomes increasingly interdisciplinary, computational skills are playing a vital role in problem solving within and especially across disciplines. Building upon the emphasis on interdisciplinary science at the college and the successes of an interlocking set of initiatives designed to increase both the number and quality of science graduates equipped with computational skills required in 21st century science, this project brings together and coordinates college services to support students interested in computational and interdisciplinary science. It implements strategies and programs designed to attract and mentor scholarship students, equipping them for graduate school or direct entry into the scientific workforce. It is part of efforts at the college to integrate computational work across the science disciplines, and to expand interdisciplinary student research opportunities and internships available to students. S-STEM scholarships provide significant incentives for academically talented students with financial need to pursue this program of studies. It aims to increase the number of students with the scientific and computational skills required to participate in the scientific discoveries of the future.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Disciplinary depth and interdisciplinary breadth are required to find solutions to complex, contemporary scientific problems like global warming, disease pandemics, environmental toxicology, and the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in human diseases. The synergy that results from collaborative efforts to address these problems and the satisfaction that come from making progress toward their solution are strong motivators for engaging in scientific research. To be part of the research teams that address such problems, students need an education that mirrors the interdisciplinary trajectory of science and responds to national calls to develop research experiences and educational models that support interdisciplinary science. In particular, there is a growing need for scientists with substantial computational skills and for computer scientists who can collaborate with researchers in other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The NSF scholarships, together with targeted recruiting and retention efforts and curricular reforms, are (1) increasing the awareness of the range of opportunities available in computational science among students, (2) encouraging academically strong students to choose to work in computational science, and (3) drawing such students into strong summer and academic-year research programs. These programs produce students well prepared for further research and study or for direct entry into the workforce. This program is specifically designed to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups, both ethnic minorities and women, in computer science courses through expanded recruiting and visibility, an emphasis on cross-disciplinary applications of computational skills, and intentional mentoring and cohort experiences throughout the undergraduate careers of the scholarship students. These efforts are augmented by ongoing college-wide efforts to increase the diversity of student population at the college.",
