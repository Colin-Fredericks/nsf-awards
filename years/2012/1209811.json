Zlotnik\r\n\r\nThis action funds Anatoly Zlotnik of Washington University in St. Louis to conduct a research project in computer science, entitled \"Control of Large-scale Or Uncertain Dynamical Systems (CLOUDS)\" during the summer of 2012 at Australian National University in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.  The host scientist is Matthew R. James.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this work stems from the need to investigate techniques for controlling large-scale dynamical systems subject to uncertainty.  Novel computational methods that enable applications in quantum control are being developed.  As engineered systems rapidly grow in complexity, the task of modeling, controlling, and optimizing their behavior becomes increasingly challenging.  This motivates research at the interface between control, optimization, and computation.  The ability to guide many structurally similar dynamical systems between states of interest, or calibrate a complex dynamical structure to a desired behavior, is fundamental to the development of new quantum technologies.  The discovery and optimal design of controls that are robust to variation or uncertainty in system parameters is paramount, and the analytical description and practical synthesis of such controls are challenging.  The proposed research develops new methods for control design and synthesis that solve optimal control problems arising in the study of such complex systems. \r\n \r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S., an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location, and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  In addition to enabling the solution of a wide class of complex control problems, additional impacts are expected in a variety of fields, e.g., emerging applications in neuroscience, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging, and power infrastructure management.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes (EAPSI) program is to enable US graduate students to foster scientific research collaborations with colleagues on the other side of the Pacific ocean. I was selected for this competitive program for the summer of 2012, in addition to 19 other U.S. students who would also visit Australia.  The grant funded my travel to Canberra, the federal capital of Australia, where I worked for seven weeks in the Systems and Control group at the Australian National University (ANU).  My research is on the theory and practice of controlling complex dynamical systems, and I worked at the Research School of Information Science and Engineering (RSISE) on emerging problems in the exciting areas of quantum information science and and quantum control engineering.\n\nCultural Experience\n\nVisiting Canberra this summer has been amazing and highly rewarding.  From the longest flight I have ever been on to the great expanse of the outback, going to Australia involves things on a much bigger scale than we are accustomed to even in the United States.  The strongest cultural difference between Americans and Australians that I noticed was in our work habits.  Whereas graduate students in the united states tend to arrive reasonably early in the morning and work late and occasionally work after dinner and on weekends,  the RSISE building was completely empty by 5:00pm every day.  I believe this is because Australians tend to place an equal priority on work as on other aspects of their lives, rather than build everything else around a professional culture.  Nevertheless, students somehow manage to complete their Ph.D. degrees there in only three years, compared with the five or more years that it typically requires in the U.S.  The U.S. and Australia work in close partnership in a number of areas, in particular on science and engineering, and it was a rewarding experience to learn about this history and be a part of it.\n\nProject Description and Outcome\n\nThe proposed research program focused on a fundamental investigation of mathematical models for control of large-scale complex systems with a particular focus on applications in the area of quantum control engineering.  In this context, large-scale refers to the quantity and complexity of systems, not necessarily the size.  The principal research goal stated in the program description is to identify large-scale optimal control problems of importance to researchers in the quantum domain that can be solved by leveraging recent advances in computational methods for optimal control of ensemble systems.  This aim was successfully achieved, in that I have initiated a promising collaboration with researchers in the physics department at the ANU on manipulating quantum arrays, which may lead in the future to quantum optical information processors.  In addition, the proposed educational and collaborative activities have been conducted.  I have reviewed the foundational and current literature on the field of coherent quantum feedback control, and exchanged perspectives on control theory by interacting with the my host as well as members of and visitors to the systems and control group at the ANU.  I was also able to present my recent work at the Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS 2012) conference at the University of Melbourne on July 13 to an audience of Australian and international attendees.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anatoly Zlotnik"
