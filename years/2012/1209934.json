 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Nicholas Cornell of University of Texas at Dallas to conduct a research project, entitled \"Investigating superconductors with coexisting ferromagnetism,\" during the summer of 2012 at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou.  The host scientist is Huiqiu Yuan.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to better understand the interactions of coexisting phases in a class of iron based superconductors called pnictides.  This includes synthesizing new materials of different compositions, measuring them, and making adjustments with the goal of improving their critical temperature and allowing them to withstand stronger magnetic fields while remaining superconducting.  Increased magnetic field tolerance would increase their industrial applications and allow them to operate in more environments.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
