 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: This proposal is for a new electron beam lithography and imaging system to augment the nanoscale fabrication capabilities at NC State University for a wide range of applications and users. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This acquisition proposal is expected to lead to high-performance nano-devices for nanoelectronics, opto-electronics, nanofluidic bio-sensors, and nanogap sensors. The electron beam lithography system and imaging system will have the capability to reach the resolutions down to 10 nm on six inch wafers. The PI manages the Microelectronics center, where this new tool will be located.  The new tool will be widely used, with over 40 faculty members actively involved in research that will be enabled by this tool; 20 specific research projects of high impact have been described in this proposal. This new instrument proposed here will catalyze and accelerate interdisciplinary research in nanoscience on a variety of technical fields.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The requested instrument will serve 4 colleges and 10 departments at NC State and hence is expected to serve a large population of faculty and their respective students.  The research enabled by the requested system will have significant impact in both graduate and undergraduate research and training at NC State and the instrument will be integrated into several lab courses. Outreach activities include involvement with Shaw University, a local HBCU, and summer internships for minority students providing getting hands-on education and research training.",
