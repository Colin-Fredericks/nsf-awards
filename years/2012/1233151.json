 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for research enabling the development of numerical tools and nanomanufacturing processes for characterizing the structure-process-performance relationships of nanosphere coatings on silicon thin films. These coatings have the potential to not only enhance solar efficiencies without introducing additional surface recombination, but also reduce manufacturing processes and costs. The developed numerical tools will determine optimal structures for enhanced efficiencies while considering both ordered and disordered structures. Detailed simulations will be performed on optimal structures to determine the role of scattering and whispering gallery modes as well as to determine the angular performance of coated solar cells and evaluate transport characteristics. Scalable, inexpensive spin coating methods will be used to understand how nanosphere coatings may be assembled onto silicon thin film photovoltaics.\r\nManufactured samples will be characterized structurally, optically, and electronically to validate simulations.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of next-generation solar cells. This could also have a profound impact on other nanophotonic applications that make use of whispering gallery modes such as optical filters and biosensors. A broad impact is envisioned in the areas of solar cells, topology optimization, and nanomanufacturing.  This project will also educate and outreach to next-generation engineers through open source software development, the introduction of various education modules, and involvement with the Pitt Office of Diversity's INVESTING NOW summer program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the grand challenges of the 21st century, as identified by the National Academy of Engineering, is to make solar energy economical.  Solar cells are modular, quick and easy to install, and do not require a grid.  However, conventional silicon solar cells are expensive, bulky, rigid, and brittle.  The silicon in solar cells is typically several hundreds of microns thick in order to ensure the absorption of most of the light.  Thick silicon is also brittle and will crack and shatter like glass upon impact.  In addition, expensive support structures are required such as glass and metal racks.  New types of solar cells must be developed that (1) may be incorporated into a variety of materials and applications, (2) are lightweight, bendable, and easy to install, (3) exhibit high efficiencies, and (4) perform reliably over a 25 year lifetime.\n\n This research established how to incorporate nanosphere coatings into solar cells.  Simulations were utilized to study various types of nanosphere coatings and how they can be utilized to improve efficiencies of solar cells.  It was determined how nanosphere coatings can be used to increase the absorption in the solar cell. \n\n Various procedures were studied for how to coat nanospheres onto different substrates and nanospheres have been used as etch masks to create nanowires and create metal nanomeshes.  Simulations were performed on various nanostructures to determine efficiency enhancements in different silicon and gallium arsenide nanostructures.  Metal nanomeshes were evaluated as transparent electrodes.  New processes were developed for controlling the number of layers of different nanospheres as well as over large areas. \n\nNanospheres were incorporated into flexible, ultrathin silicon solar cells and demonstrated to improve their efficiencies.  We further improved the efficiencies of ultrathin silicon solar cells by integrating them with a metal nanomesh. \n\n This work demonstrates flexible solar cells that are lightweight, bendable, and may be incorporated into a variety of unique materials such as paper, cloth, or plastics. They are easy to transport and easy to install. Solar cells may be integrated into creative applications such as clothing, curtains, paper, and furniture.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/05/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul W Leu"
