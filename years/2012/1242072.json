White\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funding to continue to provide information technology (IT) infrastructure support to the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) Office.  The Ocean Information Center (OCEANIC) at the University of Delaware?s College of Marine and Earth Studies serves as a centralized location for the UNOLS information technology infrastructure, web server, mail servers, file repository and backend relational databases. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBroader Impact and Intellectual Merit:  The Academic Fleet is well into its fourth decade of service to our nation's ongoing effort to study the vast majority of our planet that is covered by ocean.  In a time of intense budgetary constraints and competing pressures on scarce federal resources, this Fleet must stress cost-effectiveness, efficiency and wise utilization of the taxpayer's dollars.  The federal agency?s educational and scientific missions must be accessible to educators, policy makers and the public, and the maintenance of the UNOLS IT infrastructure directly contributes to this mission with regard to effective vessel scheduling and public outreach.",
