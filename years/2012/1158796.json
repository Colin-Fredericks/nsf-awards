Those issues include not only operational network security, but the application of network security research and development innovations, the proper role of IRNC activities as part of a comprehensive and secure NSF cyberinfrastructure, and the potential of IRNC activities to contribute to network security research and development. Experts from research and industry are engaged for this event.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit is found in the workshop's exploration of a combined set of technical, policy, legal, and behavioral issues in cyber security applied to a diverse set of network infrastructure activities. Broader impact is reflected in the role of IRNC activities in serving international research and education activities across science and engineering domains.",
