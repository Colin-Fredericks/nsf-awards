 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abramovich will continue studying problems in moduli theory; the main focus of the project is moduli spaces of stable logarithmic maps and associated Gromov-Witten theory. Additional topics include deformations of wild p-covers, and problems which also bear on birational geometry of varieties, including the study of pseudoideals as differential graded schemes, and the tropicalization of moduli space.\r\n\r\nThe area of study of this project lies within algebraic geometry, the branch of mathematics devoted to geometric shapes called algebraic varieties, defined by polynomial equations. Algebraic geometry has significant applications in coding, industrial control, and computation. But the topics of this project are more closely related to applications in theoretical physics, where physicists consider algebraic varieties as a piece of the fine structure of our universe. This is especially true with the first topic, moduli theory. This theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often manifested as an algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own right. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of \"organisms\" as itself being an \"organism\" is not just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. The other topic studied in this project is birational geometry, which is devoted to a certain abstract relationship, called birational equivalence, among algebraic varieties, which lies at the foundation of algebraic geometry.",
