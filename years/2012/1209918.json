 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Elias James Garratt of Western Michigan University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Influence of substitutional impurities on molecular bond state and distribution within nano-crystalline diamond films,\" during the summer of 2012 at Kyushu University in Fukuoka City/Fukuoka/Chikushi Campus.  The host scientist is Dr. Tsuyoshi Yoshitake.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to ascertain the influence of impurities introduced under different conditions on overall and specific nano-crystalline diamond film properties. By developing an understanding of how impurities introduced under such conditions affect film properties, it may be possible to refine nano-diamond materials for technological application.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
