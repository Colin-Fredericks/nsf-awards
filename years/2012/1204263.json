 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project will investigate year-around CH4 and CO2 fluxes at three Alaskan Arctic sites (Barrow, Aquasuk, and Ivotuk) across a latitudinal gradient of about 300 Km from the northern part of the Arctic Coastal Plain to the foothills of the Brooks Range, in Alaska. These measurements will be used to improve estimates of rates and patterns of and controls on annual GHG fluxes, with special contribution to understanding of the fall, winter and spring fluxes. This project will be among the first efforts toward the estimation of a full annual budget of both CH4 and CO2 net emissions from three tundra ecosystems across a transect in Arctic Alaska. Of primary importance is the quantification of non-summertime CH4 emissions because of the potentially large impact on overall climatic effects. This information has historically been very difficult to collect because of severe weather and remote monitoring stations. Recent advances in measurement technology will make these studies feasible in remote locations and under extreme weather conditions. In particular, this research will make use of the new closed-path LI-7200 and the self-cleaning and heated, low-power,open-path LI-7700 CH4 analyzer for the most remote site (Ivotuk). The team will employ the closed-path CH4 Los Gatos analyzer that corrects for the cross-sensitivity of water for the Barrow and Atqasuk sites.  A heated sonic Class-A METEK will be used to record turbulence measurements. In-situ measurements of oxidation-reduction potential, pH, dissolved gases, chemical characterization of soils and soil pore water, and metagenomic analysis will elucidate the dominant respiratory pathways.  Project scientists and SDSU will partner with the Reuben H. Fleet Science Centre to improve polar and climate change knowledge and understanding. Project activities will include workshops and seminars on climate change, and potential GHG feedbacks in the Arctic for teachers and the general public in the San Diego area, and for the community in Barrow.",

Measuring greenhouse gas emissions in the Arctic, particularly outside of the summer period, is very challenging due to extreme weather conditions. This research project provided the first annual balance of both CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in a total of five sites spanning a 300Km transect across the North Slope of Alaska (three sites in Barrow, one site in Aquasuk, and one site in Ivotuk). The results from the continuous year-round CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes across these sites showed how cumulative emissions for the cold season accounted on average for 50 % of the annual budget (Zona et al., 2016), a notably higher contribution than previously modelled, and also higher than observed in boreal Alaska. The analysis of the cold period CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes suggested that the presence of an unfrozen soil layer in the fall and early winter was a major control on cold season CH<sub>4</sub> emissions (Zona et al., 2016).</p>\n<p>We also cross-compared all instruments measuring ecosystem scale CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes operating at our sites, which allowed us to make recommendation of the best performing instruments under these extreme weather conditions. The best performing instruments were closed path analyzers and intermittently heated sonic anemometers which had the highest final data cover. A continuously heated anemometer increased data coverage relative to non-heated anemometers, but resulted in an overestimation of the fluxes (Goodrich et al., 2016). We developed an intermittent heating strategy that was only activated when the data quality was low, and appeared to be the preferable method to prevent icing while avoiding biases to the measurements. Closed and open-path analyzers showed good agreement, but data coverage was much greater when using closed-path analyzers, especially during winter (Goodrich et al., 2016).</p>\n<p>Given the importance of vegetation on greenhouse gas emissions, we also investigated the role of different vegetation types under a broad range of environmental conditions on the CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. We found that vegetation type can be a very useful tool to describe the spatial variability in CH<sub>4</sub> emissions over the landscape (McEwing et al., 2015), and that just two vegetation types were able to explain about 50% of the variability in CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes across ecosystems even hundreds of kilometers apart (Davidson et al., 2016a). To upscale these plot scale fluxes we completed high resolution vegetation maps in each of our tower sites (Davidson et al., 2016b), which are the finest resolution maps currently available from these sites, and also contributed to larger scale mapping effort (Walker et al., 2016). The soil microbial analysis from soil cores collected across our sites showed an association between overall microbial diversity and latitude, with a higher diversity found in the northerly site and lower diversity in the southerly site, contrary to current knowledge (Wagner et al., accepted). We also measured CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the soil, which showed to be orders of magnitude higher than in the atmosphere (Arndt et al., 2016). Our results contributed to model development (Xu et al., 2016; Kobayashi et al., 2016; Liljedahl et al., 2016; Luus et al., 2017), and to a wide variety of other projects as shown by the hundreds of download of our data from Ameriflux.
