 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millions of people around the world carry heavy loads, causing significant stress to their bodies.  This can lead to musculoskeletal injury, which is the second most common reason for seeing a doctor in the United States.  Based on previous NSF-funded research on load carrying during locomotion, the team has developed a proof-of-concept handle suspension technology for carrying loads that significantly reduce the likelihood of injury.  \r\n\r\nWith this I-Corps support, the team will investigate the commercial potential of the proposed effort.  Musculoskeletal injuries are common and cost over $850 billion/year in the United States alone.  If successfully commercialized, it is believed that the proposed innovation has the potential to address this significant market opportunity.",
