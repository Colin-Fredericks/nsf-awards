 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project will support a workshop for high level decision makers across the government, industry, and academia to explore how to align the interests of various groups to help veterans transition from military service into careers in engineering.  The workshop will widely communicate the outcomes to policy makers across organizations and produce several archival position papers that can help guide future policy.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project arises from the potential impact on the engineering and STEM workforce.  By seeking alignment between military service and academic course work, there may be ways to boost the nation's STEM workforce while drawing on the talent pool represented by veterans.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.",
