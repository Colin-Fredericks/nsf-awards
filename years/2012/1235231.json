 "awd_abstract_narration": "The presence of ice ponds from surface melting of glacial ice can be a significant threshold in assessing  the  stability of ice sheets, and their overall response to a warming climate. Snow melt has a much reduced albedo, leading to additional seasonal melting from warming insolation. Water run-off not only contributes to the mass loss of ice sheets directly, but  meltwater reaching the glacial ice bed may lubricate faster flow of ice sheets towards the ocean. Surficial meltwater may also reach the grounding lines of glacial ice through the wedging open of existing crevasses. The occurrence and amount of meltwater refreeze has even been suggested as a paleo proxy of near-surface atmospheric temperature regimes. \r\n\r\nUsing contemporary remote sensing (microwave) satellite assessment of surface melt occurrence and extent, the predictive skill of regional meteorological models  and reanalyses (e.g. WRF, ERA-Interim) to describe the synoptic conditions favourable to surficial melt is to be investigated. Statistical approaches and pattern recognition techniques are argued to provide a context for projecting future ice sheet change. \r\n\r\nThe previous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC AR4) commented on our lack of understanding of ice-sheet mass balance processes in polar regions and the potential for sea-level change. The IPPC suggested that the forthcoming AR5 efforts highlight regional cryosphere modeling efforts, such as is proposed here.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMelting snow is tangible evidence of a warming climate; in the mid latitudes, the seasonal melting of mountain snowpacks is a sure sign of spring and increasing temperatures.  On the Antarctic ice sheet, which is \"permanently\" covered in snow, melt events are currently relatively rare, although they have increased rapidly in places that are already relatively warm in summer, such as the Antarctic Peninsula.  In a warming climate, more widespread melting in Antarctica would have several important impacts.  Melting snow reduces the albedo, allowing more solar energy to be absorbed and encouraging more melting.  Runoff from snowmelt reduces the volume and mass of the ice sheet, adding to global sea level rise.  Meltwater can also percolate through the outlet glaciers of the ice sheet, reaching their base and providing a lubricating effect, allowing the glacier to flow faster to the sea.  Melting has also been shown to contribute to the collapse of ice shelves around the Antarctic Peninsula, which in turn has taken the brakes off numerous outlet glaciers, speeding them up and increasing their contribution to sea level rise.  \n\nThis project asked, \"how much melting occurs in Antarctica now and under what conditions, how well do climate models simulate these conditions, and how much will melting will occur in the future (50-100 years from now)?\"  To answer the latter two questions, the investigators wanted to use the best available climate models, which simulate both present-day and future climate.  The best global-scale climate models  (with a horizontal resolution of 100-500km) would then be used as input for finer scale, regional models (with horizontal resolution of 10-30km), which resolve terrain features such as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains and individual ice shelves.  The investigators evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of 26 different global climate models, focusing on variables such as surface temperature, cloud cover, solar radiation, winds, and albedo.  \n\nThe investigation revealed a large diversity of simulated present-day climate among the models.  The average summer temperature of the Antarctic Ice Sheet ranges by about 15 degrees between the warmest and coldest models; a difference roughly equivalent to the climate change between the last ice age and the present day.  Two factors contribute to this model diversity.  First, the surface albedo, which determines how much solar radiation is absorbed, varies substantially across models.  Second, the fluxes of energy between the atmosphere and surface also differ substantially across models, related to processes such as wind speed, precipitation, sublimation, and convection.  If these processes and properties were more consistently simulated, the surface temperature, the amount of melt, and related properties would likely also be more consistent across the models.  \n\nThe investigators also evaluated the surface climate of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, and found the relative warmth of the Southern Ocean to be unrelated to the relative warmth of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in the models.  The Southern Ocean surface climate is too warm in most models, largely because the cloud cover is too thin, permitting too much sunlight to reach the surface.  The investigators provided a number of recommendations for improving the climate models, so that questions such as the ones about future melting posed above, could be more confidently addressed.  \n\nCollaborators on the project have used a few of the best global models to run regional models, and to make predictions about melting across Antarctica in the latter half of the 21st Century.  These results will be reported separately.\n\nThe investigators have presented their findings at multiple professional conferences and workshops, and the main results are described in a peer-reviewed journal article.
