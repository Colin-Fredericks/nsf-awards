 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collaborative project between the University of Arkansas Little Rock and Indiana University is using Web 2.0 and social networking methods to create an OnLine Chemistry Course (OLCC) in the area of cheminformatics.  By leveraging distributed expertise, the project is enabling institutions to educate undergraduate chemists in a skill set that is rapidly increasing in importance to society.  In addition to filling a subject gap within the curriculum, the project team is providing an exemplar for a teaching method that can be extended to other areas of undergraduate science education.\r\n\r\nThe artfully constructed and implemented OLCC is based on prior experience with less demanding offerings.  It enables institutions of higher education to teach a class in the emerging area of effective use of computational and informatics techniques as part of the scientific discovery process.  Beyond providing state-of-the-art undergraduate educational opportunities at the PIs' institutions, the project is making the cheminformatics materials available to institutions that wish to participate in the hybrid course wherein a facilitator at each participating institution is responsible for the local students grades and assessment.  An additional intellectual merit of this sharing of experience is the latent faculty development that occurs as the non-expert facilitators gain experience in the content delivered by the distant experts.  Simultaneously, the community is developing experience in and appreciation of new digital learning modalities that are increasingly comfortable to the new generation of 'free-agent learners'.\r\n  \r\nThe OLCC is leading to the development of modules and digital Teaching and Learning Objects that are coded with meta data, retrievable via national and international archival mechanisms, and which can be repurposed and distributed into other curricular environments.  The use of experts distributed beyond one campus or one country is educating current students by a new model that makes traditional boundaries of historical interest only.  The on-line component of the hybrid course, with its many-lecturer-to-many-student components, coupled with nurtured student-to-student interactions will aid in the building of a diversified community.  The OLCC design is developing modern instructional opportunities that extend beyond the traditional classroom and that industrial learners, non-traditional learners, and distance-learners can all utilize in ways that meet their unique needs.",

This project was run under the premise that twenty-first century cheminformatics advances have generated new cognitive artifacts for the representation, manipulation and communication of chemical information, that these artifacts influence the problem-solving schema applied to scientific tasks and can enable new discoveries, and yet the field is noticeably missing from the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, being delegated the role of a niche science of the pharmaceutical/medicinal sciences.</p>\n<p>This collaboratively taught hybrid course involved both cheminformaticans within and without academia, who interacted as online lecturers with students from multiple campuses, while working with residential faculty facilitators, the instructors of record, who met face-to-face with students in the classroom. The course was taught on 11 campuses in the Fall of 2015 and the Spring of 2017, the OER material is available on both the course website <a href=\"http://olcc.ccce.divched.org/\">http://olcc.ccce.divched.org/</a>, and the Libretext hyperlibrary, <a href=\"http://libretexts.org/\">http://libretexts.org</a>.

We also created a special web content item called the Teaching and Learning Object (TLO), which had sections that could be embedded into each chapter, allowing the chapters to grow as the class was being taught. That is, it was felt that students could adapt new cheminformatic artifacts to cognitive processes in innovative ways (outside of those established by experts), because experts had already automated many of their cognitive tasks through automation of established schema (that resulted in reduced load), and impeded innovation, while students had no such benefit of prior knowledge.
