 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The proposed research seeks to develop novel algorithms and a simulator to quantum\r\nmechanically model nanoscale devices in both two and three-dimensions. Algorithms will be developed to model both the dc and ac current response. The focus of the proposed work is on a broad range of nanodevice structures within the effective mass and tight binding approaches. Examples of these structures include devices based on carbon nanotubes, graphene, silicon nanowires and quantum well superlattices.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The proposed work combines the expertise of co-PIs from electrical engineering and applied mathematics departments to probe the physics of nanodevices accurately and efficiently using the Green?s function approach. The developed algorithms will be applicable to devices in the areas of low power / voltage and energy applications. Further, the approach has the potential for a significant improvement in the simulation speed over current widely used approaches for steady state simulations with decoherence.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The proposed research will involve training of both graduate and undergraduate students in methods to model nanodevices and the study of their underlying device physics. We will make an effort to involve female students and students from underrepresented groups.  Both electrical engineering courses on devices and an applied mathematics course on high performance computing will leverage this research to explore nanodevices and algorithms respectively. Outreach to high school students will occur by interactions to illustrate the role of modeling and simulation in discovery and technology development.",

In addition, computational studies help by decreasing expenditure before moving to the important but expensive experimental steps of fabrication, characterization and testing of devices. The most challenging area in developing computational device modeling methods is to find algorithms to efficiently solve equations. This area is challenging because it requires collaboration between experts in devices, physics, applied mathematics and computer science. In this ECCS Division supported project, electrical engineering and applied mathematics co-PIs collaborated in designing a new algorithm to model the current flow in nanodevices using quantum mechanical methods. The developed algorithm is up to 250 times faster than the current fastest algorithm. The algorithm and accompanying code has been publicly released.

Using our algorithm and code, we were able to determine the importance of scattering on the performance of a device exhibiting Negative Differential Resistance (devices exhibiting this property can be used to build new kinds of logic gates and high-speed oscillators). We were also able to determine that these devices can potentially operate at room temperature, which is important for applications.</p>\n<p>We conducted a serious study of the performance of our algorithms for two and three dimensional device Hamiltonians that exhibit a dense matrix structure, and time dependent studies.
