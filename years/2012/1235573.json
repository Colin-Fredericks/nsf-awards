 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban centers worldwide are threatened by earthquakes. The effects of an earthquake on a community depend on the magnitude and location of the earthquake as well as on how well the community has planned for the future earthquake. Community resiliency to an earthquake depends on the capacity of individuals, households, businesses, and region to survive and to recover after a disaster strikes. The best lessons for earthquake resiliency can be obtained by the study of what worked and didn't work in regions that are struck by earthquakes. This proposal will design and conduct a focused earthquake reconnaissance effort to accelerate learning about seismic resiliency, such that a significant leap in knowledge can be made. The proposed research effort builds on the acclaimed multi-decade and multi-disciplinary EERI Learning From Earthquakes (LFE) program, but it proposes a major change and refocus of the LFE program to achieve the target result of superior understanding of community resiliency.\r\n\r\nA multidisciplinary Seismic Resilience Panel will guide earthquake reconnaissance to maximize resilience learning relevant to the U.S.; to conduct post-earthquake reconnaissance efforts focused on seismic resilience; to develop methods for systematic  data collection, archiving, and dissemination of the findings; and to prepare a synthesis report summarizing the principal findings of the project. The intellectual merit of the proposed program lies in (a) defining the key physical and human elements that contribute to, or inhibit, seismic resilience in U.S. communities, and (b) exploring those elements through focused earthquake reconnaissance in the U.S. and worldwide, as appropriate. In the process, better understanding of the physical, social, economic, governance and institutional factors that facilitate or slow recovery will be achieved. By understanding these complex conditions and their interactions in the post-disaster environment, the grand challenges that need to be addressed will emerge. Through the solution of these challenges advancement in resilience knowledge will be gained. The ultimate goal is to improve the seismic resilience of communities in advance of disasters.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEarthquakes continue impact urban communities around the world.  ?Earthquake reconnaissance? is an approach to rapidly conduct general damage surveys of a region or area following an earthquake to document initial important observations about earthquake impacts, and assess the need for follow-up areas of research. Traditional reconnaissance is typically conducted by a team of earthquake risk mitigation experts who investigate earthquake impacts immediately following search and rescue activities. Observations and findings from these teams support emergency response and recovery activities in the short term and improve the understanding of natural hazards and how to mitigate their impacts in the long term.  This project defined a new type of earthquake reconnaissance, named ?resilience reconnaissance,? that expands traditional reconnaissance into the realm of community earthquake resilience. \n\nAs defined by this project, the goal of ?resilience reconnaissance? is to understand how an earthquake affects the continuity of different services and functions (e.g., transportation, water, food, shelter, etc.), and how disruption of these vital services and functions impacts different groups within a community over time.  The research team developed an actionable framework to guide researchers conducting this new type of reconnaissance and implemented a series of activities to test and refine its new framework. \n\nThe framework for resilience reconnaissance provides guidance for earthquake reconnaissance teams and individual researchers who observe, document, and measure community resilience through field investigation and data collection in the months and years following a major earthquake. It also provides recommendations on what to observe and assess over time to: (a) understand the overall performance of systems within a community after a major earthquake, (b) identify critical elements that drive system performance, (c) describe interdependences between systems, and (d) determine transformative changes enacted to mitigate possible future disasters. \n\nThe Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) is using this new framework to guide data collection by early career researchers and practitioners during EERI?s Learning From Earthquakes Travel Study Program.  This program provides a field training experience in regions with recent earthquake impacts.  Participants conduct resilience reconnaissance in small teams with a focus on one vital community service/function (i.e., business, healthcare, education, and housing). The teams use the resilience framework questions to guide their investigations of each vital community service.\n\nBeyond this EERI program, it is anticipated that future resilience reconnaissance efforts will also use the framework. This framework (and subsequent updates) will have impacts on how future resilience reconnaissance is conducted, the types of data and tools that are most effective for documenting resilience, and the timelines needed to effectively measure and describe the state of resilience at the community level.  This knowledge will influence and change procedures used by many research groups who study post-disaster resilience by conducting field reconnaissance. Over time these resilience reconnaissance findings will contribute to the broader community's understanding of resilience and resilience-focused data collection during post event reconnaissance will become a key data source for development of community recovery best practices.  \n\nDuring this project, various resilience reconnaissance activities were also conducted in response to several major earthquakes with the goal of refining the framework approach and developing new reconnaissance tools.  For example, in response to the 2014 South Napa California Earthquake, this project investigated business resilience in the region impacted by the earthquake.
