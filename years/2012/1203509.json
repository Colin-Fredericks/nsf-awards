 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will safeguard and improve accessibility of the University of Hawaii Insect Museum (UHIM), which contains about 250,000 insect specimens from the Pacific Region. Infrastructure of the museum will be updated: dilapidated cabinets, which can't keep specimens safe from pests and mold, will be replaced. The improvements will also make space for additional specimens, since UHIM is currently close to capacity. UHIM will join a team of museums (InvertNet) to copy the data from the specimen labels using an efficient process in which labels are photographed and interpreted by computer. The data from every specimen will be available online, so that anyone can access the collection remotely for research or education.\r\n\r\nInsects are major pests of humanity, affecting agriculture, forestry and homes, as well as being vectors of deadly diseases. Yet some insects control pest insects and others are crucial pollinators of both agricultural crops and wild plants, which form the basis of natural communities. Hawaii has more invasive insects than any other state, and has lost many of its native insect species. UHIM is over 100 years old and houses rare specimens and unique data that allow scientists to track the invasions and disappearances of insects over time. UHIM provides essential information on the health of Hawaiian ecosystems, and guidelines for its restoration.",
