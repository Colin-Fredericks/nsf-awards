 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Virginia - North Carolina Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (VA-NC Alliance) will broaden the participation of underrepresented minority populations (UREP) in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The VA-NC Alliance consists of eight colleges and universities in Virginia and North Carolina: four historically black colleges and universities including Bennett College for Women, Elizabeth City State University, Johnson C. Smith University, and Saint Augustine?s College; and four doctorate-granting/research-extensive universities including George Mason University, the University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, which will continue to lead the consortium. The Alliance will be expanded with the addition of Piedmont Virginia Community College. \r\n\r\nThe VA-NC Alliance integrates students into their academic institutions and provides disciplinary socialization opportunities; in addition, partner schools collaborate to retain students across the critical junctures between secondary schools, two-year institutions, four-year colleges or universities, and graduate programs. The VA-NC Alliance?s goal is to substantially increase the number of STEM baccalaureate degrees earned annually by UREP students. Alliance students are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and experiences to transition successfully to graduate school. As a secondary goal, the Alliance will increase the number of UREP STEM students entering graduate school. The Alliance offers a broad array of activities including research experiences, symposia, workshops, and graduate school preparation retreats which are open to all students and faculty at partner schools. The synergy created by sharing resources across institutional lines in order to achieve a common goal is exemplified by the VA-NC Alliance Summer Research Program, which brings select students from partner schools to one campus to engage research projects with faculty. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe VA-NC Alliance project will create new knowledge, innovations and models for broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines and the STEM workforce. Results of these efforts will be disseminated.  Project evaluation and monitoring activities will yield evidence-based knowledge concerning the effectiveness of the various broadening participation models and innovations.    \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe VA-NC Alliance will yield broader impacts by increasing the quantity and quality of UREP STEM graduates well prepared to succeed at the graduate level, and contribute to the STEM workforce. In order to address the challenges of the 21st century, particularly in the science and technology sectors, the increased diversification of the United States labor force is critical to enhancing the nation?s competitiveness. By tapping into a workforce underrepresented in the STEM fields, the VA-NC Alliance will ensure that diverse perspectives are applied to complex and global problems, benefitting its geographic region and the nation as a whole.",

Smith University (JCSU), Saint Augustine's University (SAU), University of Virginia (UVA), Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), Virginia Tech (VT), and its first community college partner: Piedmont Virginia Community College (PVCC).

From it baseline to academic year 2016-2017, the Mid-level Phase of the VA-NC Alliance reported a 54 percent increase in the number of URM STEM students enrolled at its partner schools and a 109 percent increase in the number of URM STEM students who graduated (see attached graphs).&nbsp; Over the five years for which data are available during the Mid-level phase, 5,499 URM STEM students earned degrees at VA-NC Alliance partner schools. These students will have been well-prepared to succeed in graduate school and the STEM workforce, helping to meet the needs of the U.S. labor force.</p>\n<p>During its Mid-level Phase, the VA-NC Alliance provided professional development activities, financial support, community building opportunities, and academic programming for its students, including: transition programs, annual undergraduate research symposia, research experiences, tutoring, mentoring, and other activities designed to reinforce students' academic success. Many incoming freshman students began their participation with the VA-NC Alliance through bridge programs including traditional summer residential programs as well as online options. At GMU and VCU, students engaged in hybrid bridge programs with both online instruction and a short residential experience to become acclimated to their campuses. PVCC implemented a bridge program for local high school students. At JCSU, students received academic support from faculty during its Saturday Academy program.</p>\n<p>Engaging its students in undergraduate research remained a top priority of the consortium, and the VA-NC Alliance Summer Research Program continued to be one of the partnership's signature activities. During the Mid-level Phase and one-year no-cost-extension, the VA-NC Alliance hosted annual cohorts of summer researchers at UVA with research tracks in astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, data science, engineering, environmental science, neuroscience, and physics. The summer research program strengthened connections between the partner schools, UVA STEM departments, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia, leveraging UVA and local resources. At both Bennett College and ECSU, Alliance scholars were required to engage in STEM research under the guidance of a faculty member. The Alliance management team promoted participation in research experiences and sent regular email bulletins about opportunities to its partner schools and posted these on the LSAMP.VIRGINIA.EDU website. Several Alliance students participated in international research experiences including: the Organization for Tropical Studies REU in Costa Rica; the European Molecular Biology Laboratory REU in Grenoble, France; and the REU in Austria at Graz University of Technology.</p>\n<p>VA-NC Alliance students had numerous opportunities to present their research during the Mid-level Phase and one-year no-cost-extension.

Saint Augustine's University hosted the Tenth Anniversary of the VA-NC Alliance Undergraduate Research Symposium in the spring of 2017 and featured invited speakers from the NSF, the United States Congress, and other honored guests. For the 2017 symposium, the VA-NC Alliance created an award category specifically for community college students' presentations, and welcomed participation from a regional Bridge to the Baccalaureate program, the NC STEM Alliance. In addition to the Alliance's annual symposium, students presented their research at national conferences<em>. </em>The substantive knowledge contributed by students to the STEM fields demonstrated the <strong>intellectual merit</strong> of the VA-NC Alliance.</p>\n<p>VA-NC Alliance institutions hosted graduate school preparation retreats for students from partner schools, including but not limited to: the Alliance Graduate School Preparation Retreat at VT; GEM GradLab hosted by the GEM Consortium, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and UVA; and a graduate school preparation event hosted by the Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing in Richmond, VA in collaboration with UVA and VT.
