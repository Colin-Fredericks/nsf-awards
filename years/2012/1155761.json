 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contracts between private parties are ubiquitous. The relationships between buyers and sellers, employers and employees, lenders and debtors are all shaped by the contracts they write. Rather than existing in isolation, however, private contracts often have real and profound effects on third parties (i.e., generate externalities or spillovers). This raises important public policy questions about the appropriate role for the regulation of private contracts. While the theoretical economics literature on contracting with externalities is well-developed, there is little empirical work on the topic. This project will examine the private design of contracts and their social welfare effects in a laboratory setting with human subjects paid according to their performance.\r\n\r\nThe first project considers a class of inter- firm strategic environments. Business contracts often include clauses that restrain the ability of parties to deal with others in the future. Examples include exclusive dealing contracts, damages provisions, minimum commitments, and non-tocompete clauses. While these contractual arrangements serve the important role of protecting relationship-specific investment and mitigating exposure to risk, they may also adversely affect competition. The second project addresses intra-firm team production environments where the private contracts affect the magnitude and distribution of profits, and might affect social welfare. This research will make several important contributions to the literature. First, the findings will shed light on equilibrium selection in strategic settings where the theoretical implications are ambiguous. Second, the work will provide empirical evidence of the effects of behavioral factors, such as social preferences, moral considerations, social proximity, loss aversion and framing. Finally, the non-invasive software developed for these studies will contribute to the understanding of decision-making processes in complex strategic environments.\r\n\r\nThe current methodological approach underscores the importance of combining experimental and behavioral observation with theoretical modeling. This work will enhance understanding of the social welfare effects of private contractual arrangements, and thus help inform policy makers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nContracts between private parties are ubiquitous. The relationships between business partners, employers and employees, buyers and sellers, and lenders and debtors are all shaped by the contracts they write. Private contracts often have real and profound effects on third parties (i.e., generate externalities or spillovers on customers and competitors). This raises important public policy questions about the appropriate role for the regulation of private contracts.\n\nThis NSF-funded project examined the private design of contracts and their social welfare effects in a laboratory setting with human subjects paid according to their performance.  Our methodological approach underscores the importance of combining experimental and behavioral observation with theoretical modeling.\n\nLandeo and Spier (Yale J Regul 2014; Univ Chic Law Rev 2014; Econ Lett 2013) study the role that courts should play in resolving bargaining impasses and deadlocks in closely-held businesses.  We explore the use of shotgun (buy-sell) mechanisms, where the judge orders one party to name a price and then compels the other to either buy or sell shares at that price.   We identify circumstances under which the shotgun mechanism outperforms standard auction mechanisms.  This work highlights the active role that judges can and do play in managing business divorce.\n\nLandeo and Spier (J Econ Behav Organ 2015) explores the behavioral effects of incentive contracts on team behavior when the principal proposes incentive contracts and the efforts of the agents are complementary.  Depending on the structure of the incentive contract or sharing rule, the agents confront an endogenous prisoner?s dilemma or stag-hunt environment.  Ongoing interaction among team members positively affects the principal?s payoff. While greater team cooperation is successfully induced with low sharing rules in infinitely-repeated environments, low sharing rules can also backfire. We show that agents retaliate against the principal by putting in less effort when they perceive the incentive contract as insufficient. \n\nLandeo and Spier (J Inst Theor Econ 2016) provides experimental evidence on how contracting between upstream and downstream firms can extract value from (and consequently harm) more efficient competitors.  In our setting, an incumbent seller and a buyer negotiate a long-term contract in the shadow of a potential entrant.  If the buyer subsequently breaches, they owe stipulated damages to the incumbent seller.  Our study finds evidence suggesting that contracts serve as reference points in future negotiations, and the importance of social preferences for behavior.\n\nLandeo and Spier (2018) theoretically and experimentally investigate the incentives for members of criminal teams, and how enforcement mechanisms can be designed to detect and deter harmful group activities.  We focus on ordered-leniency mechanisms where the degree of leniency granted depends on one?s position in a self-reporting queue.  Our experimental findings suggest that in many settings, policy makers can achieve high levels of deterrence at lower cost by eschewing the prisoner?s dilemma strategic environment in favor of a coordination game.  Well-designed leniency policies can simultaneously lower the costs of enforcement and lower the incidence of crime.\n \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathryn Spier"
