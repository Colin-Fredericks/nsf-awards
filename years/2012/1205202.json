 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use computer simulations to explore the consequences of gravitational collapse and the formation of black holes and spacetime singularities.  The small scale structure of general singularities will be studied in detail. In particular the suitability of such singularities as precursors for the initial singularity of the big bang will be explored.  Simulations will also be done of the interior of a black hole to see whether the inner horizon of the black hole is replaced by a null singularity. Simulations will also be done of critical gravitational collapse and of gravitational collapse with a negative cosmological constant.\r\n\r\nThe simulations of gravitational collapse as a possible precursor of the Big Bang are a promising approach to the question of \"where did the universe come from?\"  Critical gravitational collapse is analogous to phase transitions in condensed matter physics and thus points to deep connections between two very different areas of physics. Gravitational collapse with a negative cosmological constant is connected through the so called AdS/CFT correspondence to such diverse physical systems as colliding heavy ion beams and high temperature superconductors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project I have studied black holes, spacetime singularities, and gravitational radiation.  A black hole forms when an objects gravity gets so strong that even light cannot escape from it.  Inside the black hole, gravity is so strong that even to stand still is impossible, so the object continues to collapse under the influence of its own gravity until it has become a point of infinite density called a spacetime singularity.  I have used computer simulations to find the properties of spacetime singularities.  I have found that the collapse proceeds at different rates in different directions, so that an object that falls into a black hole is alternately stretched and squeezed like dough in a bread mixer. \n\nThe big bang in which the universe started is also a spacetime singularity.  I have done computer simulations to attempt to find out the properties of the big bang.  In particular, I have simulated models in which the big bang is preceded by a \"big crunch\" in which the universe collapses followed by a bounce that turns the big crunch into a big bang.\n\nWhen black holes collide, they emit gravity waves.  These waves have recently been detected by gigantic laser interferometers that measure the distance between mirrors with extreme accuracy.  The distance between the mirrors after the wave has passed is different from what it was before the wave.  This difference is called gravitational wave memory.  I have found simple ways to calculate this memory using the properties of the energy emitted in the collision.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Garfinkle"
