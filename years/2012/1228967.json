It runs applications\r\nlike social networking, business productivity, and online banking, and\r\npromises isolation policies that keep these applications secure when\r\nrun side-by-side. Because of its crucial role, we would like the\r\nbrowser to be robust and secure against attack; but in fact browsers\r\nare fragile. They are complex pieces of software with rich features\r\nthat allow for flexibility and programmability, and even small bugs\r\ncan make the browser vulnerable to attack. Indeed, browser\r\nvulnerabilities have been used to infiltrate the internal networks of\r\nAmerican defense contractors and leading tech firms. Attempts to\r\nimprove browser security are often ad-hoc engineering efforts; and\r\neven when formal guarantees are provided, they come in the form of\r\nproofs over a model or idealization of the browser, not the browser\r\nitself.  A buggy implementation can invalidate intended guarantees and\r\nleave users open to attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to build a browser inside the Coq proof\r\nassistant, along with a proof of its correctness. Unlike previous\r\nresearch efforts, the proof covers the actual browser implementation\r\nrather than a model or abstraction.  This provides extremely strong,\r\nprecise guarantees about the security properties of the browser. The\r\nproof is made tractable by focusing the verification effort to a small\r\nbrowser kernel, and running legacy code in a sandbox to render\r\nweb pages. In this way, the browser can provide meaningful isolation\r\nguarantees even when the legacy code that renders web pages is\r\nuntrusted and potentially buggy.\r\n\r\n \r\nThis project will provide:\r\n* For users of the web, browsers that are more reliable and secure;\r\n* For software developers, a new approach for developing high-assurance systems;\r\n* For researchers, a framework for formally reasoning about security policies;\r\n* For students, security and formal methods education.",
