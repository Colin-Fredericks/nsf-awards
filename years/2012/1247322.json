 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will deploy a pilot Software-Defined Science Network (SDSN) to interconnect research computing resources on the University of Wisconsin-Madison  campus and link them to national WAN circuit fabrics via Internet2.  This pilot deployment will support both Computer Science applications such as GENI WiMax experiments and prototyping activities for the University of Wisconsin?s Science DMZ between campus partner sites and the Internet.  \r\n\r\nThe project will provide an opportunity to develop an operational model for the innovations promised by OpenFlow.   In particular, significant effort will be expended in integrating management tools such as the UW developed web application Authorized Agent Network Tool Suite (AANTS), network monitoring tools such as PerfSONAR and  traffic engineering tools such as Netflow/IPFIX.   The GENI toolsets (Expedient, FOAM) will be examined for suitability for enterprise use.   UW will partner with Cisco for the OpenFlow rollout.   Travel budget is included for sharing and presentations of findings to the broad GENI community and non-technical user communities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe pilot will provide an opportunity to gain experience with architectural, deployment, administrative and operational issues of OpenFlow in campus settings.   Integration with WiMax as an extension of the UW production network will allow for advanced opportunities to the research and education communities such as streaming live high definition video from campus natural areas into classrooms.  The PIs will report on issues and operational experience associated with the deployment.  These reports and the PI?s willingness to share their experience with other universities will reduce barriers to use of GENI from campuses, establish GENI technologies and OpenFlow as building blocks for science networking, inform ongoing upgraded to campus infrastructure in support of domain sciences on campus, and via the partnership with Cisco facilitate the broader deployment of SDN technologies.",
