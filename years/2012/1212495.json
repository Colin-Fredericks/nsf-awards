It therefore provides an excellent venue in which materials scientists can become acquainted with the latest applications of the principles and methods of materials science to materials of biological origin, biomimetic and bioinspired materials, and synthetic materials designed for compatibility with living systems.  The symposium is distinctive in emphasizing the significance of the study of materials of biological origin to the development of synthetic biomaterials and biomimetic materials and to the application of materials science and engineering principles to the study of biological materials.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  An important attribute of this symposium is its strong focus on bringing younger materials scientists, including many students, into contact with internationally recognized biomaterials investigators.  The completed symposium program displays an impressive group of invited and contributed presenters.  To engage students fully in the intellectual process, the symposium organizers have routinely scheduled both a large student poster session and a number of student oral presentations.  This activity has been particularly effective in developing student interest and participation.  The funds requested will all be used to support the attendance of students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report\n\n \n\nThe intellectual merit of the 8th Biological Materials Science (BMS) Symposium held at the 2012 TMS Annual Meeting was to provide a unique venue for researchers exploring the intersection of materials science and biology.  Materials science and engineering is expected to play a highly significant role in the foreseeable future of biomedicine.  Conversely, noting that materials science finds its roots in physics and chemistry, biology is logically the next great frontier for materials science. \n\nBiological materials science refers to the application of materials science and engineering principles to the study of biological materials, including the design, synthesis and fabrication of materials systems from biological lessons.  The BMS Symposium is unique in emphasizing the primacy of biological materials to the development of biomaterials and biomimetic materials.  Biological materials comprise the inorganic and organic constituents of biological systems, whereas biomaterials are synthetic materials developed to replace, restore or augment biological materials. Biomimetic materials (or bioinspired materials) have unique, tailored structure and properties based upon the study of structure-property relationships in biological materials. \n\nThe broader impact of the 8th Biological Materials Science (BMS) Symposium held at the 2012 TMS Annual Meeting was to generate enthusiasm and interest amongst students in the field of biomaterials.  Student participation is a key to the future vitality of the scientific field of biological materials science.  Therefore, the organizers are committed to making this symposium a premier venue for student participants amongst materials or biomaterials focused professional societies.  The funds from this grant were used to support a student poster contest and student oral presenters with travel stipends to defray the ever-increasing costs of travel for student participants. Additional impacts were to facilitate interaction of students and junior investigators (e.g., untenured faculty) with senior investigators.
