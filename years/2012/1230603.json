 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steering Committee: James Elser, Rimjhim Aggarwal, and Helen Rowe at Arizona State University;\r\nTauhidur Rahman, University of Arizona; David Vaccari, Stephens Institute of Technology; Anita\r\nStreet, US Department of Energy; Robert Mikkelsen, International Plant Nutrition Institute\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Phosphorus (P) is an essential element to life and, with few exceptions, a necessary\r\nfertilizer for high agricultural yield. Because P cannot be manufactured and global supply is limited,\r\nthis chemical element poses a unique, double-sided threat to sustainability. P scarcity leads to\r\nhigh prices and poverty for poor farmers in developing countries, but in industrialized nations, excess\r\nP from farms and in urban waste streams degrades downstream water quality. The issues surrounding\r\nP sustainability are deeply complex and involve diverse geological, biogeochemical, economic, and\r\ngeopolitical dimensions that are currently unconsolidated. Environmental degradation due to nutrient\r\nrunoff and potential threats to global food security urgently call for an end to this disjointed approach\r\nto phosphorus. The goal of the P Sustainability Research Coordination Network (RCN) is to spark an\r\ninterdisciplinary synthesis of data, perspectives, and understanding about phosphorus to identify and\r\nimplement solutions for P sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe RCN theme, objectives, and initial topics build upon broad agreement on key P sustainability\r\nchallenges reached at a recent Sustainable P Summit (SPS) led by  James Elser and colleague Dan Childers.\r\nThe RCN will involve two phases centered on three Challenge Areas. Phase I groups will work\r\non two Challenges: (1) Improving P efficiency in food production; (2) Developing robust pathways\r\nof P recycling. At the Kick-off Workshop, identified Core Members will develop Working Groups\r\ncentered around these challenge areas. These Groups will be further populated with At-Large Members\r\nrecruited through a widely advertised application process that will allow us to target qualified\r\ngraduate students, postdocs, and members of under-represented groups. In Year 3, a Synthesis Workshop\r\nwill report on the science and solution outcomes from Phase I and develop new Phase II Working\r\nGroups focused on Challenge 3: Integrating efficiency and recycling to create a sustainable food system.\r\nA Wrap-up Workshop, held early in Year 5, will be held to report on science and solution outcomes\r\nfrom Phase II and provide the push to finalize outcomes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Central to the P Sustainability RCN will be recruitment of a diverse network of\r\nparticipants of different professions, ranks, genders, races, ethnicities, and nationalities. The Steering\r\nCommittee will reflect this diversity, including three students in ex officio capacity, giving them invaluable\r\nexperience in leadership, networking, collaborative science, and policy. To communicate key\r\naspects of RCN work, we will produce two dynamic, high-quality videos to reach targeted audiences of\r\nfarmers, educators, fertilizer industry, and policy makers. The three RCN Workshops will be held in\r\nWashington DC in order to facilitate participation by policy makers, government officials, representatives\r\nof agriculture and the fertilizer industry, and urban planners with the aim of developing research priorities\r\nfor the RCN, presenting outcomes and planning implementation of sustainability solutions.",
