 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) grant provides funding for the research and development of a new manufacturing process for advanced composite parts called Press Curing with Rubber-coated Tooling (PCRT). This is a new alternative to the standard practice of using a vacuum bag to encase the composite part to enable it to be subjected to high temperature and pressure in an autoclave for the final manufacturing step of consolidation and curing. The PCRT process eliminates the autoclave from the process and imparts the desired temperature and pressure through the use of a specially designed rubber-coated mold. Research objectives include gaining a deeper physical understanding of the process through extensive simulation and experimentation, creating robust simulation tools for designing mold sets, fundamental materials research on tooling, rubber masks, and interactions with composite systems, and expanding process capabilities to allow for eventual commercialization. The GOALI partner for this grant, Kintz Plastics, Inc. (Howes Cave, NY), will help with all aspects of the research work and be the first adopter of this technology.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will fundamentally change how composite manufacturers make small- to medium-size laminate and sandwich parts requiring high consolidation pressure and temperature.  It will eliminate one of the major manufacturing bottlenecks facing the composites industry the autoclave step in the process.  A published study has shown that for a relatively complex three-dimensional composite laminate part, PCRT provides orders of magnitude reduction in preparation time, fixed and recurring costs and energy consumption as compared to using an autoclave, while still providing parts of similar quality.  It is expected that similar results will be demonstrated for a wider range of part shapes and material systems as a result of this work.",

Instead of traditional consolidation/curing of continuous fiber thermoset and thermoplastic composites by vacuum-bagging then autoclaving, SET uses highly engineered and temperature-controlled matched tooling (rubber-coated compression mold and heated curing mold) that when clamped together with known force using a simple hydraulic press provides uniform pressure and temperature over the composite part's surface. SET technology reduces the resulting capital expense, recurring costs, energy consumed and set-up time by 1-2 orders of magnitude as compare to traditional processing.</p>\n<p>Tooling design involves the use of finite element (FE) structural and thermal modeling combined with a proprietary algorithm to change the elastomer mask thickness distribution to achieve uniform pressure (see Fig. 2). The SET mask synthesis algorithm was refined from the original proof-of-concept version and implemented as a Python program, the scripting language for Abaqus FE software, to avoid having to manipulate simulation data externally (originally done with Matlab). The SET algorithm was applied to tooling design for multiple parts include flat laminates for mechanical property testing (carbon/epoxy, glass/epoxy, cellulose fiber/bioepoxy), a laminated kayak paddle (carbon/epoxy, glass/nylon), sandwich structure rowing seat (glass and carbon/epoxy), and a bike seat (carbon/EB-curable epoxy). Part performance was shown to be equal to or better than autoclaved parts in all cases. Another FE thermal study showed that although a thin-walled curing mold heated up significantly faster than thick-walled molds, there was a significantly higher temperature distribution. The best materials for the elastomer-covered compression mold are tooling board due to low thermal conductivity, ease of machining and relatively high stiffness, whereas for the curing mold it is aluminum due to high thermal conductivity and ease of machining.</p>\n<p>Although many castable SET mask materials were investigated, platinum-catalyzed RTV silicone rubber was clearly shown to be the best elastomer for this application due to its chemical resistance and good high temperature properties over 1000's of cycles at high pressure and temperature, RTV silicone exhibited slight hysteresis and a minor stiffening effect that appears to plateau at a particular modulus. Fatigue testing also demonstrated that a silicone mask should work adequately for hundreds, if not thousands of curing/compression cycles. For electron beam (EB)-cured resin systems, a silicone mask becomes embrittled after repeated doses of high energy EB radiation, although the effect is only 'skin deep.' Other SET elastomers tried suffered the same fate following EB exposure. One potential remedy to this adverse effect is to fabricate SET masks with a sacrificial skins that must be replaced every 10-20 consolidation/curing cycles.</p>\n<p>Best practices for casting a SET mask were established including a process using the compression and curing molds set a specific distance apart to form a casting cavity. Casting requires vacuum degassing if elastomer constituents are mixed by hand or the use of in-line mixing for automated injection. Subsequent work with 3D printed casting cavities used in combination with the compression or curing mold provided significantly more design flexibility with the mask synthesis process.</p>\n<p>SET technology was extended&nbsp;to liquid composite molding methods for both thermal cure and EB-cure resin systems. Novel tooling designs allowed dry fiber preforms to be infused with low-viscosity thermoset resin, uniform-pressure consolidation using SET, and curing in-place within a self-contained mold set. CFD modeling of the resin infusion was necessary for optimizing resin inlet and outlet locations to ensure full wet-out given the design constraints imposed by the infusion process (Fig. 3a). These hybrid processes, called SET for Resin Infusion (SETRI) and Electron Beam&nbsp;curing of SET for&nbsp;Resin Infusion (EB-SETRI), were first demonstrated using flat laminates and then later for a complex 3D composite part (bike saddle - mold design shown in Figs. 3b and 3c). SETRI was demonstrated to be economical for a wide range of parts, whereas EB-SETRI is only appropriate for high&nbsp;volume manufacturing where the high cost of an EB power source ($mllions) can be justified.</p>\n<p>Economic impact of this research project is significant including a patented process, a start-up company with full-time employees that is commercializing and continually advancing the SET technology, and commercial customers. Intellectual impact includes a new manufacturing paradigm for low-cost and low-energy curing and consolidation of advanced composite parts, a computationally based design capability for SET molds that accommodates both structural and thermal effects, material property data and insight into the mask material that is subject to repeated cycles and different resin cure mechanisms, and best practices for wider use of SET in the composites industry and elsewhere.
