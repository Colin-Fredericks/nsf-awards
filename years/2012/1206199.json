This convergence of scientists, mathematicians, and engineers from diverse geographic and ethnic backgrounds, includes both formal and informal gatherings, results in the free flow of ideas that is necessary to tackle the most challenging interdisciplinary problems of flow and transport in porous media. The associated Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) on Flow & Transport in Permeable Media will be held prior to the GRC. The GRS brings together early-career investigators for a two-day seminar of scientific sessions and informal discussions organized and executed by the junior members of the associated GRC community",
