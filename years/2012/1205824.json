 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are pursuing two experiments at Amherst College.  The first project is a continuation of our experiment to test Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI) and CPT invariance.  LLI is the notion that the laws of physics are the same in all locally inertial frames and independent of their orientation in space.  CPT is the product of the discrete symmetries charge conjugation, parity and time.  No violation of either LLI or CPT has ever been observed.  Much of our understanding of fundamental physics would have to be radically altered if a violation is observed.  We compare the relative precession frequencies of Hg and Cs magnetometers as a function of the orientation of an applied magnetic field with respect to the \"fixed stars\".  This comparison is sensitive to LLI violating couplings between a preferred universal frame and the electron, neutron and proton spins.  With our recently completed experiment, we have placed new limits on several LLI violating terms.  It has been pointed out that these limits may actually probe physics on the Planck scale, where String Theory suggests that violations might occur.  We indend to replace the magnetometers with ones of a new design that should be at least a factor of twenty more sensitive.  At this level, the experiment will provide the most stringent heavy-atom test of several possible mechanisms for violating LLI and CPT.\r\n\r\nIn our second project we are exploring the possibility of laser cooling thallium fluoride (TlF) using a transition between the v=0, J=1 of the ground state to the v'=0,J'=1 state of the triplet B state.  Methods to cool molecules using lasers have only recently achieved some level of success.  The difficulty with laser-cooling of molecules stems from the myriad of possible states available for decay.  It is hard to find a cycling transition which will allow the tens of thousands of absorption/emission cycles that are required to achieve significant cooling.  In recent work, we have demonstrated that with only one cooling laser and one repump laser it should be possible to achieve several thousand photon cycles on this transition without significant loss to other levels.  This should allow transverse cooling and collimation of a cryogenic beam.  Here, we intend to make precision measurements of the other critical Franck-Condon factors.  Their determination will tell us precisely how many repump lasers would be required to bring a cryogenic beam of the TlF to rest.  We also intend to measure the B state hyperfine structure (HFS) and isotope shifts.  The HFS plays a critical role in determining the rate of loss to other rotational levels.  If the laser cooling and trapping of TlF is possibile, this would open up the possibility of performing a high-precision search for the electric dipole moment of the Tl nucleus.  Such an experiment is sensitive to the Schiff moment of the Tl nucleus which is in turn sensitive to the proton edm and time-reversal violation in the nuclear interaction.\r\n\r\nBoth of these projects have as their long-term goal the investigation of the fundamental symmetries of nature.  Even though they are relatively modest table-top experiments, they have important possible implications for particle physics.  The local Lorentz invariance experiment can provide limits on String Theory while a future thallium fluoride (TlF) electric-dipole moment experiment would test time-reversal symmetry in the proton and in the nuclear interaction.  These projects, using the precision techniques of atomic and laser physics, provide a broad and flexible training for future scientists.  The TlF experiment will expose our students to the exciting and emerging field of the laser-cooling of molecules.  This project nicely compliments both the BEC work being done here by Prof. David Hall and the uv laser development that is being pursued by our new assistant Professor David Hanneke as part of his work on trapping single ions.  Our fundamental symmetries experiments at Amherst have drawn many talented undergraduates into careers in physics over the last 29 years.  This project will continue our tradition of pursuing state of the art experiments while providing exciting research opportunities and valuable training for undergraduates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA Test of Long-Range Spin-Spin Interactions (LRSSI) using the Earth as a spin source \n\nPrecision measurements of the spin interactions of elementary particles can provide new insights into the fundamental laws of nature.  Elementary particles have an intrinsic property called spin &ndash; they act as if they were constantly spinning around like tops.  Just as tops precess in the presence of gravity, the spins of fundamental particles precess in a magnetic field.  This precession is the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance which is the underlying physics used in the medical diagnostic known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Recently developed precision optical techniques have allowed the study of interactions with particle spins with unprecedented precision.   We used these techniques to investigate the fundamental forces and symmetries of nature.  At the most basic level, our present understanding of nature is summarized in the \"Standard Model\" of particle physics.  This model requires four fundamental forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong and weak) to describe all of reality as it is presently known.  We have looked for new long-range forces between particle spins that can?t be described by the Standard Model.  We optimize this search by measuring the interaction of our laboratory spins with all of the aligned electron spins within the Earth, the largest polarized spin source known (Fig. 1).  Our precision measurement of spin-precession frequencies as a function of the direction of the applied magnetic field, allows us to look for LRSSI between the geo-electrons and our laboratory spins.  While we have not yet observed a new force in nature, our results improve the bounds on theories that proposed LRSSI by as much as a factor of a million.  We are engaged in ongoing work to further improve the precision and accuracy of this experiment, hopefully by at least another order of magnitude.  If an effect is seen it would suggest the existence of a new force of nature.  In current models this force might be associated with an ultra-light vector meson, a \"dark\" photon, the \"unparticle\", or torsion gravity.\n\nAn unexpected \"spin-off\" of this work has resulted in an improved understanding of the interactions that an atom undergoes during collision with a surface.  In this work we investigated a frequency change induced in Cs atoms confined in non-spherical wax-coated glass cells.  We made the first observation of \"cell-induced quadruopolar splitting\" (CIQS) in an atom with an unpaired electron spin.  In addition to measuring this effect, we discovered a method for cancelling it that can be used to increase the effective spin-relaxation time of a cell.  We achieved more than a factor of two improvement in the spin-precession time of a highly asymmetric cell.  These results offer insights into possible limitations associated with secondary frequency standards that use vapor cells. \n\n \n\nSpectroscopic investigations of thallium fluoride (TlF).\n\nThe ultimate motivation for our investigation of thallium-monofluoride is to see if the fundamental laws of nature might be asymmetric in time.  Additional time asymmetry (beyond that which has already been observed) is believed to be necessary to explain the existence of our universe.  Without time-reversal violation, the big bang would have produced equal amounts of matter and anti-matter.  Their mutual annihilation would not have allowed for the formation of galaxies, stars, planets and life.\n\nThis breaking of \"time symmetry\" can be sensitively studied by looking for the electric-dipole moment (edm) of the thallium nucleus.  An edm would result in the precession of the thallium nuclear spin in the strong molecular electric field.  The sensitivity of this experiment can be increased by using a cycling transition and a very cold beam of molecules. We have measured critical parameters on the TlF X-B transition that determine the viability and ultimate sensitivity expected of an edm experiment in TlF.  Our measurements of branching fractions and hyperfine structure suggest that it should be possible to cycle about 100 photons on two different rotational transitions on the X(0)-B(0) vibrational transition.  This should allow efficient state preparation and detection in the edm experiment.  In collaboration with researchers at Yale we have also demonstrated that the ablation efficiency of TlF is high and allows for the creation of a robust cold beam.  Our results have been sufficiently encouraging that a new cold-beam TlF edm experiment is now being assembled at Yale.  The discovery of a permanent nuclear edm would imply a violation of time symmetry and could help explain the existence of our matter-dominated universe.\n\nBroader Impacts.\n\nOur groups tradition of strong undergraduate participation and training has continued under this grant.  Three honors thesis students and five additional summer research assistants have participated in this work.  One of the thesis students is a woman.  The three honors thesis students are now enrolled in PhD programs at Harvard, Rice and Berkeley.  The project has also provided a great training for the post doc involved.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/11/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Larry R Hunter"
