This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture, compilers, chips and systems, for technical exchange on current areas of architectural challenge. This proposal aims to support this highly regarded conference by obtaining travel support for students in order to defray the costs of attending and participating, with attention to broadening participation and building the technical workforce of the future.",
