 "awd_abstract_narration": "Susanna Widicus Weaver of Emory University, is supported by a CAREER award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program in the Chemistry Division to  conduct a terahertz (THz) spectroscopic study and astrochemical search for the weakly-bound clusters H5+ and HO3.  These and other weakly-bound clusters may play important roles in the development of complex chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM), but laboratory studies to guide observational searches have been limited.  This research seeks to examine the role of cluster ions in gas-phase interstellar chemistry through studies of the isotopologues of H5+; investigate the formation and stability of neutral clusters in dense interstellar environments through studies of the HO3 adduct; and integrate laboratory measurements with observational astronomy and astrochemical modeling to obtain a complete picture of the role of weakly-bound clusters in astrochemistry.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWidicus Weaver's research focuses on the emergence of chemical complexity in the star- and planet-forming regions of interstellar space.  Her research program draws from the forefronts of laboratory spectroscopy, observational astronomy, and astrochemical modeling.    She is combining these techniques to study unstable molecules that are important for understanding chemical pathways in interstellar chemistry.   She uses the spectroscopic results as a guide to search for these molecules in space.  From these observations, she can determine the abundance, temperature, and spatial distribution of these species in interstellar clouds. She then uses this information to model interstellar chemistry and test the influence of varying physical conditions to gain a better chemical understanding of the interstellar medium.",

Weakly-bound clusters have not been investigated as important participants in interstellar chemistry, yet cluster formation is possible in interstellar environments. Clusters are likely stepping stones to complex chemistry in star-forming regions, and may be a key chemical pathway to the development of biologically-relevant chemistry in space.\n\n \n\nDuring this award, we developed three new spectroscopic techniques that allowed us to combine high sensitivity, direct absorption THz spectroscopy with broadband, rapid spectral acquisition approaches.  We combined these instruments with electrical plasma discharge sources that produce molecular ions and radicals.  We then used these techniques to produce molecules of interest in astrochemistry, acquire their spectra, and use this information to compare to astronomical observations.  We focused our work on HO3, the Ar-H2O cluster, propylene oxide, and the isotopologues of H5+.  We completed laboratory characterization of the first three molecular targets.  We did not detect the isotopologues of H5+ during this work.  We have published the results from these studies in 8 peer-reviewed manuscripts. \n\n \n\nA total of 7 undergraduate students, 3 graduate students, and 3 postdoctoral scholars have participated in this research.  Of these, 3 undergraduate students have gone on to graduate school in chemistry, one has a job in chemical industry, one is in medical school, and one is teaching high school science; the remaining undergraduate student is completing his studies at Emory.  Two of the three graduate students have obtained their Ph. D. from Emory; one is currently a postdoctoral scholar, and one is beginning his career in science communication.  The third graduate student received a M. S. from Emory and works in air quality control.  Of the three postdoctoral scholars on this project, one is teaching at the university level, one is a staff scientist at a university, and one is a software engineer. \n\n \n\nIn addition to the laboratory work, during this award we implemented a new approach in teaching undergraduate physical chemistry at Emory.  We attempted to remove the \"black box\" approach to instrumentation in STEM disciplines by revamping the undergraduate physical chemistry lab experience.  We have introduced new techniques and new experiments, and changed the way in which this material is presented to students.  The results of this initiative are being incorporated into the new undergraduate chemistry curriculum being developed at Emory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susanna Widicus Weaver"
