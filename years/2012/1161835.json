 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transcriptional regulation of neuronal polarity and morphogenesis\r\n\r\nNeurons are highly polarized cells with distinct structures and functions localized mainly to either end of the cell. They are also intricately shaped and engage in myriad movements during development.  These features and processes are indispensable for the neuron to engage in its function of transmitting the directional flow of information through a neural circuit. However, little is known about how neuronal polarization and morphogenesis is regulated in vivo. This research will take advantage of the small size and experimental accessibility of sea squirt embryos to understand how these processes are regulated. Sea squirts, or ascidians, are the invertebrates most closely related to vertebrates and have emerged as a model organism for the study of animal development. More specifically, the research will focus on connecting the gene regulatory network, the basic blueprint of the embryo, to processes occurring during neural development such as polarization, migration, axon guidance, and morphogenesis. The hope is to identify rate-limiting genes involved in such processes, and their regulation by upstream genes which might be playing a similar role in vertebrates. Thus, the overall aim is to understand how each neuron is precisely shaped and formed as dictated by the gene regulatory network.\r\n\r\nThe Fellow is dedicated to engaging and inspiring other Latinos as they pursue a scientific career.  Students from underrepresented groups will be provided opportunities to participate in the research where possible. The project will take advantage of being located at a visible institution in a diverse city such as New York to reach out to underrepresented minorities not directly pursuing a career in science, through lectures, open forums, workshops, group visits, and other events that will stimulate their interest in science.",
