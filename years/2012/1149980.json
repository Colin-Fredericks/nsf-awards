 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mutualisms, cooperative interactions among species, are among the most widespread species interactions on earth. From tiny fungi that harvest nutrients for their plant partners, to large mammals that disperse the seeds of forest trees, to the pollinators that maintain global agricultural productivity, mutualistic partnerships play a central role in the global economy and the maintenance of biological diversity. A key unresolved question is, how do these interactions remain cooperative when natural selection should favor selfish individuals who reap benefits without paying the costs of cooperation? Studies addressing this question typically calculate the costs and benefits of interacting with a given partner species independent of an individual's life stage and interactions with other partner species. But natural selection acts on lifetime fitness, and many mutualists interact with multiple partners species throughout their lives. Evaluating how the costs and benefits of multiple partnerships integrate over the lifetime of mutualists is a critical link in understanding how these globally important interactions evolve and function. Focusing on a multi-species ant-plant (Acacia) mutualism found throughout East Africa, this study seeks to evaluate how the costs and benefits of mutualism change with variation in the life-stage of interacting partner species, and how the net fitness effects of multiple interactions change with variation in the timing, duration and sequence of plant partnerships with different ant species. The results will shed light on how this model mutualism remains cooperative, and what factors can precipitate its breakdown. \r\n\r\nThis research will also involve the development of four synergistic educational objectives aimed at engaging U.S. and African undergraduate students, K-12 students, and the general public. The program will develop a month-long field program that directly engages U.S. undergraduate students in original research and experiential learning, and allow for the training of exceptional undergraduates in the ecology of mutualism from both plant and animal perspectives. In addition, by partnering with an African collaborator, the program will bring 25 Kenyan K-12 students to the field site each year to learn about the natural history of East Africa, using the ant-Acacia system to actively engage kids in the process of scientific discovery.",

These partnerships can strongly influence the communities and ecosystems that surround them, playing key roles in reproduction and survival, providing critical ecosystem services such as seed dispersal and pollination, and driving global nutrient cycles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the past 30 years the study of mutualism has flourished, yet few studies have examined how interactions among mutualist partners vary across the lifetimes of the participating species. My goal project was to evaluate lifetime variation in the costs and benefits of interactions between a long-lived and widespread African acacia (<em>Acacia drepanolobium</em>) and the four symbiotic ant species that protect this tree from herbivores such as giraffes, elephants and destructive insects such as wood-boring beetles. Trees produces ant rewards, in the form of swollen thorn \"domatia\" (i.e., nest sites) and extrafloral nectar, in exchange for protection. Reward production begins within the first months of a tree's life, and continues until the plant dies, often 150 or more years later. Because ant colonies have much shorter lifespans (5-10 yr) than their host plants, trees associate sequentially with many different ant species over their lifetimes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A key part of this project was a 5-year ant removal experiment in which I contrasted growth, survivorship, herbivory and reproduction on acacia trees occupied by the four different acacia ant species with paired ant-removal trees, across 4 different life stages of the host plant. Over the course of this 5-year study, many exciting results emerged, which I detail below:</p>\n<p>1. With the exception of very small saplings, ants are very costly to host plants across all other plant life stages, with resident ants reducing rates of both tree growth and reproduction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. While ants are very costly to host plants across most plant life stages, they provide crucial benefits to trees in terms of protection from strong (and often catastrophic) herbivory by elephants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Even very small ant colonies on saplings (&lt; 70 cm in height) are capable of effectively deterring elephant herbivory, highlighting why these plants begin producing ant rewards at very early life stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. Turnover in ant occupancy on plants is highest at small plant life stages, and declines as host plants grow older.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. Host plants provide the highest levels of rewards to ants in intermediate life stages, when they are most subject to attack by larger herbivores such as elephants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6. High levels of nectar production on trees are positively correlated with ant aggression, suggesting that trees can modify the degree of ant protection they receive as the risk of herbivory changes throughout a tree's lifetime.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7. There is strong variation among the four different ant species in the costs imposed and benefits conferred to acacia trees, and these costs and benefits change across different tree life stages. Ant species with the highest benefits also often impose the highest costs, suggesting that these partners may not be optimal under all environmental conditions (see the next point, below).</p>\n<p>8. The ant species with the lowest cost is an important partner to the plant in this mutualism, despite providing low levels of protective benefit. When plants are energetically stressed (e.g., due to strong competition with neighboring grasses when trees are small, or drought), partnerships with this low-cost ant mutualist are more stable and persistent than partnerships with higher-cost ant associates, which often abandon stressed plants, leaving the plant exposed to lethal herbivory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, these results demonstrate the complexity of mutualist interactions across the entire lifetime of the participating species, and highlight the need for integrating this complexity into our understanding of these widespread interactions. The benefits and costs of mutualism may shift over time as mutualists mature, and the relative quality of mutualist partners may change over time, and with changing environmental conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to providing key insights into the long-term dynamics of mutualist interactions, this project also provided support for the training of a female post-doctoral associate (Dr. Kirsten Prior), who is now an Assistant Professor at SUNY Binghamton, as well as research opportunities and training for 53 undergraduate students, and 5 undergraduate research assistants who each spent 10 weeks in Kenya conducting independent research projects. The grant also allowed my team to work with the Daraja Academy for underprivileged girls in Kenya, introducing them to field ecology, experimental design, data analysis and the role of mutualism in both ecology and the conservation of biodiversity.</p>\n<p>It has been an absolute pleasure to conduct this NSF-sponsored research and offer these training opportunities to undergraduates and high school students from the United States and Kenya; the work has enhanced the lives of these students, and enabled capacity development in a country where such opportunities are few.
