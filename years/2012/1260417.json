 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merits. Duplex DNA, the information repository of the cell, is easily damaged. Cells have evolved several pathways that mount biochemical responses to the presence of such damage. One of these is the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is distinguished by the ability to process a chemically diverse set of damage. In bacteria, the first steps in NER are performed by three proteins: UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC. A large body of work has described the components that mediate NER and details of how they operate. The UvrA/UvrB ensemble recognizes damage and cooperates with UvrC and other factors to restore the original sequence. The structure of this large ~300 kDa UvrA/UvrB damage sensor and processor is unknown and this has stymied experiments to understand its mechanism of action. The goal of this project is to obtain a structure-based understanding of nucleotide excision repair. The specific aims address the following questions: 1) How does UvrA employ ATP to sense damaged DNA? and 2) How do UvrA and UvrB cooperate to process DNA damage? This work extends on the structure of UvrA and the first-ever view of the UvrA/UvrB ensemble. Understanding the structure and function of the NER pathway is important because of its central role in maintaining the integrety genetic information against damage and its role in DNA replication, gene expression, evolution and cellular processes such as apoptosis, senescence and tumorigenesis.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. The investigator developed an integrated multi-disciplinary teaching and research program in biochemistry, cell biology and structural biology targeting juniors, seniors and doctoral students. Lecture materials include elements from current and past research. In addition, the investigator tutors undergraduate biochemistry majors. A large group of talented undergraduates has trained in the investigators laboratory. The science is interdisciplinary and involves molecular biological, biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches. Results are published in peer-reviewed journals. Research materials are made available to the scientific community in several ways, including depositions in the Protein Data Bank.",

First, discrimination by UvrA during stage 1 is proposed to involve interconversion between two structural states. We have shown that UvrA adopts two conformations with significantly different DNA binding surfaces: the open-tray state exhibits an open tray-like DNA binding surface that accommodates both native DNA, <em>and</em> the DNA conformations induced by damaging agents. By contrast, in the closed-groove form, this surface collapses into a narrow groove that is <em>only</em> compatible with native B-form DNA. Genome scanning, therefore, involves cycles of narrowing and widening of the DNA binding surface of UvrA within the AB complex. Initial contact with DNA is made by the open form; this triggers conversion to the closed state. Successful closure indicates that the just-sampled DNA is native, and is to be released, with concomitant reversion to the open conformation for the next encounter. In essence, we suggest that UvrA searches for lesions by subjecting DNA to a shape test or an airport-style &lsquo;pat-down&rsquo;. Native DNA passes this test, and is released. However, distorted, damaged DNA fails, owing to inability of the AB complex to convert to the closed state; the resulting protein-DNA complex transitions down the NER pathway.</p>\n<p class=\"NIH-Arial11\">Second, localization of UvrB to the lesion, once UvrA has exited the DNA complex. Our structure places the two UvrB molecules at the periphery of the AB sensor, distant (~80 &Aring;) from the known site of damage. Upon eviction of UvrA from DNA, we propose that UvrB will translocate to the lesion using an ATP-dependent 5&rsquo; to 3&rsquo; ssDNA translocase activity. We note that the AB complex predicts involvement of two UvrB molecules in NER, not one as previously envisioned (evidence for two UvrB molecules in NER had also been previously developed). In this regard, we propose that the two UvrB molecules will translocate on distinct single strands to form a dimeric assembly at the lesion. As NER proceeds, this dimeric assembly is transformed into a species with one copy of UvrB bound to the lesion, a rearrangement that accompanies arrival of UvrC.</p>\n<p class=\"DJ-NIH-Arial11\">Third, we proposed roles for each of the three ATP sites in the AB sensor (UvrA harbors two sites, designated proximal and distal, and UvrB contains one site). We showed that the proximal site is involved in stabilizing contacts to UvrB and DNA, and we propose involvement of the distal site in genome scanning via the cycling scheme described above. Lastly, we suggest that UvrB uses ATP to localize to the lesion once UvrA has departed the complex.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"DJ-NIH-Arial11\"><strong>Broader Impacts.</strong> This project integrated teaching and research through the PI&rsquo;s efforts in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard University, and the Department of Chemistry at City College of New York.
