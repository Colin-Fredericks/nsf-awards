 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research of Professor James A. Phillips and undergraduate research students at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire (UWEC). Phillips and his students will extend their previous experimental and theoretical research on a novel class of Lewis acid-base complexes that undergo significant structural changes between various chemical environments (i.e., when they move from the gas-phase to a solution). Their primary experimental technique is low-temperature infrared spectroscopy, which is applied to two types of sample environments for these complexes: solid thin films comprised of the components, and samples of solid neon or argon seeded with small quantities of them. These measurements will be combined with theoretical calculations to determine gas-phase structural and energetic properties, which provide insight into the extent of the structural changes, as well as the mechanism by which condensed-phase environments manifest them. \r\n\r\nBeyond fundamental motivations, this work may ultimately lead to a new class of molecular machines or switches, because the complexes sought contain individual bonds that can be affected by a macroscopic, external stimulus. This is the key design feature of all systems that underlie nanotechnology applications. Moreover, this research will take place at a low-cost, accessible, public university with a track record of advancing the careers of low-income and first-generation students, of which a high percentage matriculate to PhD programs. As such, continued funding for this project will enhance opportunities for these students to gain experience with specialized instruments and computational methods that would not occur in a classroom setting, and also bolster their writing and presentation skills.",

We explored two distinct lines of research during the award period, one primarily of fundamental interest, and one geared to possible applications of this chemistry in long term. Pictures of three representative types of systems that were explored in this study are included (as Figure 1).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first of these were derivatives of the CH<sub>3</sub>CN-BCl<sub>3</sub> complex, in which we replaced one of the H&rsquo;s on the CH<sub>3</sub> unit with an F or Cl atom. In our previous work on CH<sub>3</sub>CN&ndash;BCl<sub>3</sub>, high-level theoretical predictions indicated that there were two possible structures, with two distinct B-N distances. For CH<sub>3</sub>CN&ndash;BCl<sub>3</sub>, the &ldquo;short-bond structure&rdquo; was significantly more stable (i.e., lower in energy), and we wanted to determine, to what extent adding the F or the Cl might affect the relative energies of the structures. What we found was the change raised the energy of the &ldquo;short-bond&rdquo; structure (relative to CH<sub>3</sub>CN&ndash;BCl<sub>3</sub>), and did not affect that of the &ldquo;long-bond&rdquo; structure to any great extent; which rendered the two structures about equal in energy for FCH<sub>2</sub>CN&ndash;BCl<sub>3 </sub>and ClCH<sub>2</sub>CN&ndash;BCl<sub>3</sub>. However, we were still unable to observe the &ldquo;long bond&rdquo; form in low temperature IR spectroscopy experiments. (<em>Had we done so it would have been an extremely significant finding that challenged decades-old chemical dogma</em>.) What we did learn from these studies, of great significance to the long-term goals of the project, was specifically how halogens act to adjust the interaction energy, which is key insight as we try to design new complexes with optimal properties for potential applications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The other major research thread involved the characterization of complexes involving SiF<sub>4</sub> and GeF<sub>4</sub>, as well as derivatives of these systems in which one of the F&rsquo;s was replaced by a carbon-containing group (<em>e.g.</em>, GeF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>) Similar to the rationale noted above for the BCl<sub>3</sub> systems, we had previously identified the potential for medium-induced structural change to occur in CH<sub>3</sub>CN&ndash;SiF<sub>4</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>CN-GeF<sub>4</sub>, and set out to amplify these effects by adding different groups of atoms onto the CH<sub>3</sub> unit. In short, we found that adding an F or a Cl atom to the GeF<sub>4</sub> systems (<em>e.g.</em>, FCH<sub>2</sub>CN&ndash;GeF<sub>4</sub>) dramatically increased medium-sensitivity, and were able to verify these effects with experiments. For the SiF<sub>4</sub> systems, theoretical predictions indicated a great degree of medium sensitivity with larger carbon chains (e.g. CH<sub>3</sub>CN<sub>2</sub>CN&ndash;SiF<sub>4</sub>), but like in the case of CH<sub>3</sub>CN&ndash;SiF<sub>4</sub>, experiments showed no evidence of structural change. For GeF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> complexes, which comprise the next essential step in terms of extending this behavior to systems prone to applications in nanotechnology or for electromechanical device design, we found the simple change from F to CH<sub>3</sub> caused a major reduction in strength/reactivity. This observation has enabled us to revise and fine-tune our selection of binding partners, and we are switching from &ldquo;nitriles&rdquo; (<em>e.g.</em>, &ldquo;CH<sub>3</sub>CN&rdquo;) to &ldquo;imines&rdquo; (<em>e.g.</em>, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N) in an attempt to further optimize the desired response.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond scientific outcomes, the educational impacts of this research program are of particularly note. One factor that amplifies these impacts is that UWEC is a low-cost public institution, for which about 60% of the student body is female, and roughly half is low-income/first generation. Moreover, the department has embarked upon an integrated effort to actively recruit minority students. The centerpiece of this effort is an NSF-REU site, and one of these students (a Hispanic female) worked on this project last summer.
