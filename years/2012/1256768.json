 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Statistics, Science, and Society: New Challenges and Opportunities (SSSNCO)\" is a four day international conference which will serve as the official meeting of the International Indian Statistical Association (IISA). Held January 2-5, 2013 in Chennai, India, this conference provides the international statistical community a unique opportunity to discuss new areas of research and exchange ideas.  The conference will include a strong mentoring component for students and young researchers working in areas in Probability and Statistics.  The SSSNCO conference theme is very aptly titled the Impact of Statistical Science on Society, and the conference will feature a discussion of new challenges and opportunities for statisticians in a data-centric world. The conference aims to provide a forum for leading experts and young researchers to discuss recent progress in statistical theory and applications, thereby providing new directions for statistical inference in various fields. The conference will have an excellent slate of plenary, invited and contributed talks, and poster sessions, covering a wide variety of topics of current statistical relevance and research activity.  These include, but are not limited to, Bayesian Computing, Bioinformatics, Biomedical applications, Clinical Trials, Data Mining, Multiple Comparisons, Nonparametric methods, Reliability, Stochastic Modeling, Survival Analysis, and Time Series.  In addition, panel discussions and student paper competitions will be held, providing an opportunity for junior faculty, graduate and undergraduate students not only to showcase their research work but also to benefit from some special sessions devoted to statistics education and funding opportunities, all of which should lead to acceleration and enhancement of research for participants.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the 2013 SSSNCO conference is to bring together both well established and emerging young researchers from around the world who are actively pursuing theoretical and methodological research in statistics and their applications in various related fields. Workshops, focusing on research and education, with a strong focus on mentoring students and young researchers, have been planned at the conference. The mentoring component in education and research will be strongly emphasized. These goals will have a strong impact on researchers and educators in probability and statistics, especially the next generation of professionals by interaction with peers and senior professionals from international institutions.  The funds will be used to provide partial travel support for students and junior researchers from US academic institutions to attend the conference. While selecting recipients, special consideration will be given to women and minority students. Participants receiving support will be required to actively take part in the conference by presenting a poster or a talk, as well as attending the workshops and the panel discussions.\r\n\r\nConference web page:\r\nhttp://www.iisaconference.info/",
