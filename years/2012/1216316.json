This project will create a computer-based game and supporting curriculum for promoting workforce development in the area of biotechnology; prepare teachers to implement the game and supporting curriculum through a summer professional development program; and determine how the game and supporting curriculum affects student disposition towards careers in biotechnology and understanding of biotechnology content. The project team (consisting of science educators, educational technologists, scientists, curriculum writers, and professional development providers) will collaborate with a professional game design company to design the computer game. The project will use a mixed-methods research design that makes use of case studies, pre/post test data, and comparison group to determine the efficacy of the game and supporting curriculum as a platform for improving student dispositions towards careers in biotechnology.\r\n\r\n",
