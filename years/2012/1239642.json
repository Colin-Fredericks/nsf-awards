 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for graduate students and early-career scientists to attend a workshop on data assimilation and numerical modeling for tropical cyclone (TC) predictions, held at the Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneshwar in Odisha, India, 9-14 July 2012.  The workshop is organized through the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum and is part of an ongoing collaboration between the US and Indian operational research communities, formed through a Memorandum of Understanding between the Indian Ministry of Earth Sciences and the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  The workshop has a lecture format, intended to educate a joint US-Indian workforce of researchers and operational TC forecasters, with an agenda that begins with fundamental observations and theory and proceeds through advanced modeling concepts, principles and applications of data assimilation, forecasting technologies, and societal impacts and needs.  Additional hands-on activities permit active learning through case studies that can become active research topics for participants.\r\n\r\nFunding for the workshop has broader impacts in three ways: first, by bringing together an international group of researchers and forecasters to advance international cooperation in an important scientific area; second, by contributing to the education of students and early-career scientists to develop the next generation of the scientific workforce in this area; and third, by helping to advance the state of the science in an area that has tremendous societal relevance, given the large segment of the population living in areas that are at risk from landfalling hurricanes.",
