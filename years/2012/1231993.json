 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on structured analytical and experimental analysis of magnetostriction in iron-gallium (Galfenol) thin films and nanowires to advance understanding of the magnetostrictive physics at this scale and to enable transformative new micro- and nano-scale device functionality. This alloy system has the distinct advantage of having high strains in response to magnetic fields (400ppm) while also exhibiting the mechanical ductility and strength of iron. The ability to electrodeposit this active material is possible due to preliminary work which overcame the difficulty of Ga oxidation in aqueous electrolytes, and which therefore enabled FeGa metallic alloys to be fabricated as thin films and nanowires. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research includes that insights from study of the proposed micro- and nano-scale test devices will lead to a deep understanding of the exciting device physics needed to facilitate utilizing magnetostriction at the nanoscale such as in artificial cilia sensors and actuators that mimic biological transducers in nature. As the only highly responsive material possible as ductile nanowires and conformal (nonplanar) thick films, this research is also expected to lead to the creative, new concepts for transformative sensors and actuators at the micro- and nano-scale. This work proceeds with an original plan to make the leap from materials science to devices with four important goals. The first goal is a simple, yet critical, step of measuring magnetostriction of electrodeposited Galfenol thin films as a function of composition, crystallographic orientation and magnetic domain orientation. A capacitance bridge will be used to measure the magnetostriction of these films and the optimal deposition parameters will be used in the subsequent goals. The second goal is to make a non-contact torque sensor as a test device to study the device physics of Galfenol films. The torque sensors will be evaluated in an existing rotating shaft torque test stand. The third goal involves high-risk, high-payoff measurements of magnetostriction in nanoscale devices (10-100nm diameter Galfenol nanowires). Wires with the right composition, crystal structure, and even necessary segmentation have been previously made, but measuring magnetostriction at this scale is difficult due to unknown strains, very small magnetic fields (from single wires), and general size constraints. Here, measurements of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) in individual nanowires will be used to determine the effect of applied tensile and compressive strains. In addition, magnetic force microscopy will be used to observe magnetization rotation in bent nanowires to verify GMR results. The fourth and last goal will involve making high-resolution tactile sensors using Galfenol nanowires to learn more about their behavior and integration into devices. \r\n\r\nThis research will have impact in a broad variety of fields including spintronics (FeGa on GaAs), vibration sensors, energy harvesters as cantilevers and/or nanowires, and a wide range of sensors and actuators using non-contact mechano-magneto coupling (e.g. conformal non-contact torque sensors and structural health monitoring sensors). This research will impact the education of undergraduates via REU programs at both universities, and especially underrepresented students via faculty mentoring programs. Graduate students will benefit from course development that will include the research results from this project and from interactions with industry via industrial centers with annual reviews, journal clubs, and seminars. Finally, the PIs' will train students in outreach to k-12 students to continue the broad impact in the next generation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nOutcomes\n\n \nBroad Impact. Nearly all fields of science and engineering rely on increasingly sophisticated sensors.  Therefore, our primary outcome of directly integrated \"smart\" materials will have broad impact on Electrical, Aerospace, Chemical, Biomedical, Mechanical and other Engineering disciplines.  In addition, a wide range of sciences also relies on sensors, either directly or via the engineering disciplines mentioned above.  Examples could include a pressure sensor for psychological measurements of human response or on-site magnetic measurements for field geologists and biologist. In fact, the only limit is the imagination.  We also reached out to high school robotics teams, which is an appropriate group to appreciate directly the impact of sensors\n\n \n \n\n \nIntellectual Merit. Currently, these \"smart\" materials and devices are typically made by planar, microelectronic processes.  The resulting materials and devices then have to be somehow adhered onto or into the component they are sensing (torque on shafts, curvature in mirrors, stress on airplane wings, etc). The properties of the adhesive are likely to impact measurements, especially if the component is not planar so adhesive stresses are uneven. In contrast, the overarching outcome of this project is a method by which a \"smart\" material (magnetostrictive Galfenol) can be electrochemically deposited in situ (eg: inside a MEMS or microfluidic system) and onto conductive surfaces of any size or shape. Although the devices developed here were fairly simple, torque sensors and tactile sensors, they are important many modern systems for automotive, aerospace, and robotics active responses.  The materials themselves, and the physics we\u00c6ve revealed, will have broad impact on future sensors.  \n\n \n \n\n \nSpecific outcomes include:\n\n \n\n\nNew adhesion layers (Cr/Cu) allowed Galfenol electrodeposition directly onto glass cover slips for the first ever measurements of magnetostriction in electrochemically deposited Galfenol.  Although electrodeposited Galfenol was known to have the right composition and crystal structures previously, its ability to provide active sensing has now been confirmed.\n\n\nMagnetostriction was measured in Galfenol films as a function of composition was verified to be the same as bulk polycrystalline Galfenol, Fig. 1.\n\n\nRotating Disk Electrode Deposition was adapted for Galfenol films and nanowires.  In this way, we were the first to electrodeposit Galfenol nanowires and films with uniform compositions and thicknesses over large samples.\n\n\nNovel Rotating Cylinder Electrode Deposition was developed for direct device integration.  The first device explored with this technique was a torque sensor with Galfenol deposited directly onto the shaft to be torqued.\n\n\nA simple, but remarkably effective technique was innovated for establishing anisotropy in electrodeposited Galfenol, namely sanding perpendicular to the direction to be sensed.  The first device explored with this technique was a torque sensor where the shaft was circumferentially polished before Galfenol deposition, Fig. 2 (Collaborator UMaryland designed and measured torque sensors from films made at UMinnesota).\n\n\nLong range order was achieved in nanoporous aluminum oxide for subsequent growth of ordered nanowires.  This result will enable better pixilation of tactile sensors in the future, Fig. 3.\n\n\nNew growth contacts (W/Cu) were developed in order to be able to etch nanowires off of the templates before dispersing the nanowires into solutions. All measurements on single nanowires will benefit from this development.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nA week-long electrochemistry summer camp was offered for 13-15 year olds, a FIRST Technical Challenge (FTC) community field was established at the University of Minnesota, and the 2015 Minnesota FTC Kick-off was hosted at the University of Minnesota (attended by over 500 high school kids and coaches).\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/11/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bethanie J Stadle..."
