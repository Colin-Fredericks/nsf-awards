 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Daniel Savin of the University of Southern Mississippi will synthesize study the interplay between the chemical composition and environment of coil-rod-coil triblock copolymers and their interchange between vesicle, disk and nanotube assemblies.  The approach is to synthesize symmetric, linear triblock copolymers and three-arm star copolymers; to explore their solution self-assembly as a function of composition; to use pH and temperature to induce changes in the solution morphology of the polypeptide-based block copolymer assemblies; and to determine what factors of helix assembly, pH and temperature responsiveness dictate the interfacial curvature for block copolymer assembly into vesicles, disks or nanotubes.  The broader impacts involve training graduate and undergraduate students to gain a comprehensive understanding of polymer chemistry, characterization and morphology from a fundamental and applied standpoint as well as outreach activities including the Kids' Science Challenge, web-based educational modules through NBC Learn, and the ACS Science Coaches program.\r\n\r\nPolymers are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.  Block copolymers are long chain organic molecules in which two or more chemically distinct polymer chains are attached by their ends. When a block copolymer is placed in a liquid that preferentially dissolves one of the segments, the individual chains assemble into a range of structures with nanometer scale dimensions.  This work aims to enhance our fundamental understanding of the chemistry behind the block copolymer assembly process.  The results of these studies could have important long term impacts on many applications including drug delivery, biosensing, pharmaceutical processing, and nanotechnology.",
