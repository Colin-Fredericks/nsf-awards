 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support a Doctoral Colloquium (workshop) of about 12 dissertation stage doctoral students, in a variety of visualization subfields, for a day of discussions and interactions with 6 distinguished research faculty, to be held in conjunction with this year's IEEE VisWeek meeting, which will take place during the week of October 14-19, 2012, in Seattle.  Visualization, or the use of interactive graphics to support data analysis and understanding, has become an integral part and critical component of many application areas.  IEEE VisWeek is the premier forum for visualization advances in science and engineering for academia, government, and industry, now bringing together about 900 researchers and practitioners from around the world with a shared interest in techniques, tools, and technology.  VisWeek consists this year of the 23rd annual IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis), the 18th annual IEEE Information Visualization Conference (InfoVis), and the 7th annual IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology Symposium (VAST).  Co-located symposia this year include the IEEE Symposium on Large-Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV), the IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization (BioVis), and the International Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VisSec).  The papers published in the special conference issue of IEEE Transactions of Visualization and Computer Graphics are rigorously refereed and widely cited.  More information is available online at http://www.visweek.org.  \r\n\r\nThe Doctoral Colloquium at IEEE VisWeek is a research-focused meeting which has taken place annually at the Visualization conference since 2006, and has helped launch the careers of a number of outstanding young researchers.  In 2012 the workshop will convene on Sunday, October 14 or  on Monday, October 15, with follow-up events during the VisWeek technical program.  A primary goal of the Doctoral Colloquium is to allow students to discuss their research directions in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished leaders and with their peers, who will provide helpful feedback and fresh perspectives.  The workshop supports community building, by connecting beginning and advanced researchers, one of the objectives being to build a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues across the world.  Student research will be disseminated via posters during the VisWeek technical program, and via publication in the VisWeek Extended Abstracts.  Feedback about the Doctoral Colloquium will be provided to future conference committees.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The VisWeek Doctoral Colloquium brings together the best of the next generation of visualization researchers and allows them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers, which plays a major role in their enculturation into the profession.  Since the students and faculty are a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, scientific discipline, research specialization), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.  The PI has affirmed that in managing this event the organizers, while trying to identify and include the broadest possible group of highly qualified participants, will also make an effort to encourage participation by women, racial/ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities. They will furthermore ensure that NSF funds are used chiefly to support participation by students enrolled in graduate programs in the United States.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project provided support for a doctoral colloquium (DC) of promising PhD students and distinguished faculty held in conjunction with the 2012 IEEE VisWeek Conference (VisWeek 2012). Visualization is the use of interactive graphical representations of data to help cognition.  VisWeek is the premier forum for visualization advances in science and engineering for academia, government, and industry, bringing together researchers and practitioners with an interest in techniques, tools, and technology for data analysis. VisWeek 2012 was held in Seattle, Washington, at the Sheraton during October 14-19, 2012.  The DC itself took place on Sunday, October 14, and involved 12 student participants selected from a submission pool of 30, and 6 distinguished faculty from across the world.\n\nThe goal of the VisWeek DC is to help newcomers to the visualization field build connections to other researchers and receive external feedback on their work.  Given the distributed nature of the scientific community, performing visualization research can be a solitary and isolated endeavor for many young researchers.  The VisWeek Doctoral Colloquium allows students to discuss their research directions in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished leaders beyond their doctoral advisor, as well as with their peers.  More specifically, the objectives of the event are the following:\n\nBuild a cohort group of new researchers who will then have      a network of colleagues across the world.\nGuide the work of the new researchers by having senior experts      in the research field coach them and give advice on future directions. \nProvide encouragement and support for the selection of      visualization research topics and research methods.\nMake attending their research conference more accessible      to new entrants into the field so that they may become more integrated      into the scientific community.\nIllustrate the interrelationship and diversity of      visualization research.\nMake the new entrants\u00c6 experience at VisWeek an enjoyable      and rewarding experience, encouraging them to return and submit work to      the conference in future years.\n\n\nThe intellectual merits of this project include the existing and future potential for the doctoral research performed by its participants.  Since the students were selected chiefly on grounds of research excellence, this research represents the state-of-the-art in the field of visualization.  The DC provided an opportunity both for these projects to be shaped and improved through intellectual exchange as well as for the students to present and communicate the character of their work to a key group of their peer professionals.\n\nIn terms of the broader impact, the DC brought together the next generation of visualization researchers.  This allows them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers, which plays a major role in their enculturation into the profession.  Since the students and faculty are a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, scientific discipline, and research specialization), the students\u00c6 horizons were broadened at a critical stage in their professional development. \n\nThe 2012 edition of the IEEE VisWeek doctoral colloquium involved 12 student participants and 6 invited faculty members.  The students were carefully selected from an initial pool of 30 submissions using three reviews performed by the co-chairs of the event.  During the closed, full-day event, student participants were given the opportunity to present their doctoral research in 20-minute talks, and then receive lengthy feedback from faculty panelists as well as other participants on the status, direction, and goals for their research.  In addition to individual presentations, the event also included a common lunch for all participants that gave additional opportunities for one-on-one interactions between students and faculty participants, as well as a common roundtable discussi..."
