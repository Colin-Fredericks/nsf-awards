 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology (WFVZ) is a non-profit museum in Ventura Co., California. It houses collections of more than 200,000 cataloged sets of birds' eggs and 18,000 nests -- the largest of such collections in North America.  Data for 40% of the WFVZ's egg sets of perching birds of the world have not yet been digitized, although the greatest numbers of electronic information requests the Foundation receives deal with these birds (the Passerines).  Through this grant, the WFVZ will hire undergraduate biology assistants to fully computerize, georeference, and scan the records for 75,000 egg sets, and photograph them.  The data and photos will be shared with researchers and the public through several media and Internet sources, including ORNIS/VerteNet, iDigBio, and the WFVZ's website (http://www.wfvz.org).   \r\n\r\nBird eggshells are extremely useful and important for understanding environmental impacts and other important issues such as the impacts of global climate change and pollution; species relationships; egg coloration; and historic and current distributions, breeding dates, clutch sizes, egg sizes, and eggshell thicknesses.  This project will train young scientists about museum science, bioinformatics, and ornithology, and will engage the general public as well because of the WFVZ's strong connections with its local community.  The project will enhance the public?s involvement in science and its understanding of scientific research.",

Both the egg and nest collections are the largest in North America and probably the world, and the majority of the eggs and nests date back to the 1800s and early 1900s. \n\nBack in 2011, volunteers and staff of the WFVZ had already computerized approximately 80,000 records connected to the egg sets.  However, the remaining records were not computerized, although the WFVZ receives requests every year for thousands of records for research projects.  Without NSF help, we estimated that it would take us more than 10 years to finish entering all of the WFVZ\u00c6s remaining egg set data.  Thus, the current NSF project, which ran from June 2012 to May 2015, was designed to increase the accessibility of the data connected to 75,000 perching bird (Passerine) egg sets by computerizing the original record cards, photographing the egg sets, and determining the location points for where the sets were first collected (a process called \"georeferencing\").  Eggs in the WFVZ\u00c6s collections have information associated with them such as the date, location, nest description, and conditions under which they were collected.  These data are useful for studies on factors including historic and current bird distributions, breeding dates, clutch sizes, egg sizes, and eggshell thicknesses, and in studies of climate change, environmental contamination, and basic research.  An additional goal of this project was to share all of the computerized data through open-access search portals on the Internet.  Having these records fully digitized and available can support many different projects related to bird ecology, so the sharing of the data -- including through a searchable database on the WFVZ\u00c6s own website &ndash; extends their use by researchers, members of the regulatory and management community, and the general public.\n\nAs of May 2015, data entry assistants entered and scanned an additional 100,000 Passerine egg records, photographed 83,000 egg sets, and georeferenced 82,500 records (10,500 records of which were georeferenced by colleagues in Mexico).  As planned, the data were made accessible on-line via 4 \"portals\" (ORNIS/ORNIS2, VertNet, GBIF, and iDigBio).  The creation of a searchable database on the WFVZ's own website will also \"go live\" with all of the data, plus scanned cards and photos, in October 2016. \n\nTo enter all the data we hired undergraduate students from local universities, not only to provide them with jobs, but also to expose them to the world of professional museums, informatics, and biodiversity research, and to foster interactions with skilled scientific staff and research scientists from all over the world.  We also shared with our local community the progress that the students made over the 3 years of the project, to enhance the public's own understanding of, and connection to, science.\n\nA total of 24 part- and full-time undergraduate students worked on the project from 2012 to 2015.

Along with learning data entry, photography, and georeferencing skills, the students also learned the importance of the data they were entering, because we strived to place the data entry in the broader context of avian biology, ecology, and conservation.
