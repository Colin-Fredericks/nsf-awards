  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project advanced our understanding of physical conditions in the atmospheres of Hot Jupiter exoplanets.  These planets are interesting because they are the best characterized of the exoplanets, expand the range of planetary atmospheres open to our study, and are subject to intense stellar radiation far beyond that incident upon solar system atmospheres.  This latter point is important because the study of these strongly irradiated atmospheres may help us understand conditions in the early solar system and the associated evolution of solar system atmospheres.  We found several noteworthy results.  By studying the physics and chemistry of heavy atoms (oxygen, carbon, etc.) in these mostly hydrogen atmospheres we demonstrated that the heavier elements escape the atmosphere at a rapid rate, as do the lighter elements.  This is important for the evolution of these bodies but also for the detectability and study of these atmospheres because it means that there is a greater variety of spectral features to be examined in transit measurements.  We also found that the ionospheres of strongly irradiated planets differ fundamentally from ionospheres in solar system atmospheres.  This is due to the presence of metal atoms in the atmosphere which have low ionization thresholds and are therefore easily photoionized.  This creates and enormous ionosphere that is capable of significantly modifying the neutral atmosphere.  This is another example of the physical process that might have been important early in the history of the solar system and can be studied on extrasolar planets but not current solar system atmosperes.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roger V Yelle"
