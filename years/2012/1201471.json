Uhlmann's work has had significant impacts on the theory of partial differential equations and in applied science and engineering, including applications to stabilization, identification and design of physical systems (e.g., quantum control), image processing, mathematical finance, astronomy, geosciences, medical imaging and nondestructive evaluation of materials, among others. Speakers have been selected so as to address this diversity of topics. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
