 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the investigator will build upon current modeling efforts to explore the influence of river plumes at the estuary mouth and implications for ocean/estuary connectivity in the Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\nEstuarine systems and their connectivity to the ocean influence important biological and biogeochemical processes such as nutrient exchange, productivity, larval recruitment, and acidification. Residual circulation governs the exchange between the ocean and the estuary and thus plays a large role in influencing these important processes within estuaries and along the coast. Many remote forcing mechanisms alter conditions at the estuary mouth and thus alter estuarine exchange. The purpose of this study is to investigate a less studied remote forcing mechanism: the influence of a plume at the estuary mouth and the implications for ocean/estuary connectivity. The investigator will test the following hypotheses: \r\n1. The presence of a river plume at the estuary mouth during wind-driven downwelling and relaxation events strengthens the decrease and/or reversal of exchange flow due to downwelling alone \r\n2. Interannual variability in estuarine exchange flow in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) are governed by variations in river plume location and volume \r\n3. Plume presence decreases ocean/estuarine connectivity while enhancing along-coast connectivity \r\n\r\nTo address these hypotheses, the investigator will build upon current modeling efforts to understand ocean-estuary interactions in the PNW estuaries of the Salish Sea (the inland Washington and Canadian waters including Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia), Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, Tillamook Bay and Coos Bay. The research will take advantage of an already developed regional modeling system and extensive observational datasets. Further model development will incorporate additional runoff sources from a hydrologic model and nested sub-grids to resolve smaller estuaries. Model runs over a decade both with and without the Columbia River inflow will be used to address the above hypotheses. Although there is a particular interest in understanding PNW estuaries, this work relates more broadly to better understanding of estuaries along upwelling coasts as well as estuaries influenced by offshore river plumes. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include educational opportunities for the public and students through established outreach mechanisms. The investigator will build upon existing visualization tools to develop an interactive museum exhibit and classroom tool that uses the model output to visualize circulation and water properties within the Salish Sea emphasizing the connectivity with the ocean. The exhibit will use a touchscreen interface to run an interactive program with directed learning objectives and contain an exploratory mode. \r\n\r\nCenters for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE) and Ocean Inquiry Project (OIP) have offered to act as host organizations. COSEE will help establish connections with other outreach programs and informal science learning centers to determine the best location for testing initial exhibits and visualization tools as well as provide guidance on setting learning objectives appropriate for the broad audience expected to interact with the exhibit. OIP will also provide guidance on learning objectives and help evaluate the tools by providing access to their boat-based outreach program and in teacher training activities as test venues.   \r\n\r\nThis project is supported under the NSF Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (OCE PRF) program, with goals to support novel research by early career scientists and increase the diversity of the U.S. ocean sciences workforce and research community. With OCE-PRF support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to ocean sciences and broaden participation of under-represented groups in the ocean sciences.",

However, estuaries are susceptible to change and most estuaries have been significantly impacted, threatening their important functionality. Understanding estuarine dynamics is critical to understanding estuarine ecosystems. Hydrodynamic connectivity between estuaries and the coastal ocean is a key dynamical driver impacting critical biological and biogeochemical processes such as ocean/estuarine nutrient and phytoplankton exchange and regulation of estuarine residence time, dissolved oxygen, and acidification levels. Typically estuarine-ocean exchange brings oceanic water into the estuary at depth, mixes it upwards within the estuary, and returns an outflowing mixture of oceanic and riverine water at the surface to the ocean.</p>\n<p>This project utilized regional numerical ocean simulations to study the interaction between estuaries and the coastal ocean and amongst adjacent estuaries. The numerical simulations completed were realistic simulations of the oceanic conditions (currents, temperatures, salinity, etc.) in the eastern Pacific Ocean stretching along the coastlines of Oregon and Washington, US, and part of British Columbia, Canada. The simulations included the deep ocean over the shelf break and shelf and into the inland waters of the Salish Sea and Columbia River estuaries (see Figure 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Results from this project document seasonal reversals to the typical estuarine circulation pattern and the hydrodynamic drivers of the reversals (see Figure 2). Importantly, the results highlight the importance of offshore winds and connectivity with neighboring estuaries (see Figures 1 and 2). Inclusion of a biogeochemical model with the physical circulation indicates that these dynamics play a prominent role impacting the delivery of nutrients, oxygen, and other constituents to estuaries. Thus the results from this project have broad implications across the estuary-ocean interface, and across disciplines from physics to biology and geochemistry. The mechanisms studied in this project are particularly important for understanding the impact of a changing climate on estuarine dynamics as changes in the oceanic conditions as well as river flow from adjacent estuaries will have compounding influences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of the broader impacts of this research, an outreach tool to aid visualization of ocean dynamics was expanded. The tool allows a non-scientist user to directly interact with the model output and visualize the results including maps of salinity, temperature, and currents (similar to a weather model), and to release virtual particles in the water to track where they go over time (see Figure 3). Thus the tool can be used to study/demonstrate a variety of important coastal processes ranging from coastal dynamics (e.g., how estuaries exchange water with the ocean, how seasons impact the water we see at our coasts, etc.) to more applied processes (e.g., tracking phytoplankton blooms, marine debris, or oil spills). We plan to release the tool at the end of this quarter on GitHub at which point it will become a tool that other coastal oceanographers can apply to their own numerical models, thus drastically expanding its impact across multiple researchers and geographic regions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/28/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sarah&nbsp;N&nbsp;Giddings</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1226406/1226406_10209857_1493403739629_T40newRivers_D8andSalinity-02--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1226406/1226406_10209857_1493403739629_T40newRivers_D8andSalinity-02--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Coastal/estuarine connectivity snapshot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1226406/1226406_10209857_1493403739629_T40newRivers_D8andSalinity-02--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Coastal/estuarine connectivity snapshot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">left) 2005 mean surface salinity (darker blue = fresher). right) Passive dye tracer concentration for each river source split among the two major rivers and remaining grouped by coast.
