 "awd_abstract_narration": "IDBR: Development of cathodoluminescent near-field energy transfer microscopy for high frame-rate, nanoscale, non-invasive observation of aqueous biodynamics\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop a high-brightness, rapidly scannable, nanoscale light source appropriate for studying aqueous biological samples at the nanoscale under physiological conditions. Anticipated applications will investigate the dynamics of complexing soluble biomolecules and of heterogeneous lipid membranes. To realize these efforts requires a way to combine the most redeeming elements of electron and light optics: Inside a scanning electron microscope, a focused electron beam will be used to make a nano-optical spot in a thin film scintillator (a material that produces light when struck by electrons). This spot will in turn excite adjacent fluorophores in an encapsulated aqueous sample via highly localized near-field resonant energy transfer. By leveraging the nanoscale resolution and fast scanning of electron microscopy while enabling spectrally selective bio-compatible measurements of aqueous dynamics, this innovation will provide an entirely new way to perform near-field scanning optical microscopy, uninhibited by traditionally cited challenges such as low optical throughput, unwanted tip interactions, and active mechanical stabilization.\r\n\r\nAchieving tighter focal spots on the order of 10 nm both laterally and axially will revolutionize a host of biophysical fluorescence techniques. The ability to measure single-molecule fluorescence fluctuations at physiological concentrations up to a million times greater than traditional fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) will yield a much needed way to study binding and enzyme catalysis in the regime where complexes are stable. This has important implications in the understanding of diseases such as Alzheimer's and in the formation of molecular machinery such as the ribosome. The enabling of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) diffusion measurements on membranes that are themselves smaller than the diffraction limit, as is the case for example in the impressively crowded grana of plant chloroplasts, will reveal organizational heterogeneity and local variations in mobility that have yet to be uncovered, as other super-resolution microscopies are not compatible with FRAP. These spectrally selective studies at the nanoscale will literally provide a window into the inner workings of biomolecular interactions and will connect the high-level function of complex biomaterials with their nanoscopic origins.\r\n\r\nThe developed platform will comprise optical detection in a standard scanning electron microscope (SEM), and a nanofabricated liquid cell that will both safely house the aqueous sample in vacuum and include a thin film scintillating window to convert an electron beam into a highly-localized optical field for sample illumination. The work will be performed at two different SEMs, both residing in shared facilities. In one case, the PI's group will train all new SEM users, and will offer assistance in teaching them to use the developed nano-optical capabilities. The PI's group will mentor the facility's volunteer undergraduates in the development of different nano-scintillators for use in the microscopy. The second SEM is in a national facility that has no associated user fees, and is positioned to provide a broad user base with exposure to the developed technology. Beyond these facilities, the technology will become easily reproducible as an accessible extension that others institutions will wish to incorporate into their pre-existing SEM facilities, broadening their user base to include more users in the life sciences. In undergraduate course material, the PI will use examples from this research project to highlight how physical principles are incorporated into real world biological research. The PI also promotes the participation of women and other minorities in science, as a frequent guest speaker for women's students groups in the natural sciences, and the PI's research group members participate in classroom visits to neighboring elementary schools through the Community Resources for Science Community in the Classroom program.",

Though scanning electron microscopy (SEM) offers nanoscale resolution at high frame rates, it damages soft materials, and it distinguishes topography and composition but offers no molecular selectivity. On the other hand, fluorescence microscopy is non-invasive and spectrally-selective but obtaining exquisite resolution as routinely as in SEM is still a significant challenge. To address the problem of resolving dynamic processes on molecular scales this award enabled us to develop cathodoluminescence (CL)-activated imaging by resonant energy transfer (CLAIRE), which combines the best attributes of both optical and electron microscopy. CLAIRE employs a thin-film scintillator&mdash;a material capable of intense CL, luminescence upon electron beam excitation&mdash;to transduce the tight focus of a rapidly scanning electron beam into a non-invasive nano-optical point source (Fig. 1a). Through near-field resonant energy transfer this 18-nm point source couples to fluorophores in an underlying sample inside a nanofabricated imaging chip so that sample luminescence is recorded locally and correlated to the electron beam position to form an image.</p>\n<p>To achieve CLAIRE imaging we first developed an unprecedented 20-nm-thin, bright, scintillating film and then integrated it into a microfabricated imaging device (Fig. 2). We initially validated our approach using two different contrast mechanisms that rely on resonant near-field interactions between the scintillator and sample. In the first, we spatially resolved the scintillator&rsquo;s CL enhancement due to the fields induced with a sample of plasmonic metal nanostructures (Fig. 1b). In this very first work, we formed high contrast images with feature edges as sharp as 46 nm, which we verified by finite difference time domain simulations. To demonstrate the non-invasiveness of CLAIRE on a sample that would be damaged by direct electron beam exposure, we used a second imaging contrast mechanism in which F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), from the scintillator to an adjacent conducting polymer sample, quenches the scintillator CL. Here, a ~2 keV electron beam is low enough to deposit its energy in the thin scintillator without penetrating into the sample yet high enough to excite the scintillator near the sample surface. We imaged conducting polymer blends by detecting luminescence from the scintillator and from one of the polymers in separate spectral channels (Fig. 1c), confirming the FRET mechanism through their anti-correlated image intensity maps. Our studies demonstrate non-invasive, near-field optical excitation of samples and that our resolution is well below the diffraction limit. Further, the imaging can be performed over 1000x more rapidly than traditional near-field scanning optical microscopies.</p>\n<p>By furthermore fabricating &lsquo;free-standing&rsquo; scintillating films, we have demonstrated CLAIRE in liquid environments. Excitingly, with the free-standing films, we recently used CL-activated imaging on algal membrane patches both <em>in vacuo</em> (Fig. 1d) and suspended in low vapor pressure liquid (Fig. 3). To initiate dynamical liquid-phase studies, we developed the capability to capture movies at arbitrarily high frame rates, which enabled us to observe the motion of luminescent polymer particles in oil droplets (Fig. 1e) and metal nanoparticles in ionic liquid droplets suspended on the underside of our scintillating films (Fig. 4).</p>\n<p>With the proof-of-concept that we achieved during this award period our approach will now enable the combination of ultrahigh-resolution and ultralow-background visualization of how molecules dynamically organize at liquid-solid interfaces, in solution-phase reactions, and in 2D fluid structures such as lipid membranes.</p>\n<p>The project was accomplished by a team of graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral scholars. The students and postdocs on the project have been exposed to an extremely wide variety of experimental techniques for film fabrication and characterization, including pulsed laser deposition, x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, steady-state and time-resolved fluorimetry, electron microscopy, cathodoluminescence, ion beam milling, and optical microscopy. They have also learned about patterning and lithography, electronics, and machine drawings. The students and postdocs have also had exceptional opportunities to interact with scientists outside of the immediate research group who are well-versed in each of these experimental techniques. In addition to this exposure, the work allows the students to attend conferences such as the Materials Research Society meeting, the American Chemical Society meeting, the American Physical Society March meeting, and the Biophysical Society meeting.
