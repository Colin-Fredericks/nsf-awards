 "awd_abstract_narration": "Opportunities for time-sharing spectrum use could allow for significant improvements in spectrum efficiency. Two large users of spectrum bandwidth -- radar and remote sensing -- are also two applications that might best be able to allow time sharing. For example, radar usually sweeps in direction, which may allow use of the radar frequency in directions not being scanned at any one instant. Remote sensing applications, which often use Dicke switching to switch between the observed source and an internal calibration source, could also allow time sharing during the calibration cycle. The research will investigate the incorporation of a time dimension to spectral allocations, and will also investigate relevant market assessments of the value of spectrum made available through temporal sharing.",
