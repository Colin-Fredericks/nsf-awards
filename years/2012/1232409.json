This work includes two\r\nimportant aspects.  The first is to develop schemes to treat\r\nhighly nonuniform arrangements of data (with approximation rates\r\ncontrolled by a parameter reflecting the local density of the\r\ndata).  The second is to devise nonlinear schemes that\r\napproximate using linear combinations of very few kernels. \r\nSchemes developed abide by two features of mainstream\r\napproximation theory (features that have generally been elusive\r\nfor kernel-based approximation schemes):  they provide\r\napproximation that is precise, by providing convergence rates\r\ndictated by the smoothness of the approximand, and they are\r\nuniversal, by treating approximands at all levels of smoothness. \r\n\r\n     The use of kernels to treat scattered, high-dimensional data\r\nis, by now, an established methodology in approximation theory. \r\nKernels are especially prized for their ability to approximate in\r\nthe absence of underlying geometrical structures, like meshes or\r\ntriangulations.  At this point there exist several algorithms\r\nemploying kernels to treat large datasets that have been sampled\r\nalmost uniformly.  However, the approximation power of such\r\nalgorithms -- judged in terms of the fidelity of the approximant\r\nto the approximand -- is rarely completely understood. \r\nFurthermore, the question of how to treat highly nonuniform data\r\n(data with large gaps, or with points that coalesce) using\r\nkernels is only beginning to be addressed.  An important goal of\r\nthis project is to develop kernel-based approximation methods\r\nthat approximate from highly unstructured datasets and that\r\napproximate high-dimensional datasets with little computational\r\noverhead.  Another goal is to acquire a precise understanding of\r\nthe approximation power of such methods.  Of particular interest\r\nare problems where there is some underlying geometric or\r\nalgebraic structure to be exploited, as, for example, is the case\r\nin problems in geodesy, crystallography, and molecular biology.",
