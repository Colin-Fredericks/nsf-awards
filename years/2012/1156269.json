 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research examines how individuals make choices involving tradeoffs between health risk and product quality. In cheesemaking, pasteurization of milk can eradicate pathogenic bacteria that can cause illness as well as beneficial bacteria, which contribute to ripening and flavor development in aged cheese. This research studies consumers' attitudes toward bacteria and associated risk and how consumers respond to different types of information about food safety and quality through a combination of methods including analyzing individual hedonic preference rating of product attributes, experimental auctions, and hedonic price analysis of retail data in the market for artisan cheese in the US. The unique product context provides an opportunity to study a more continuous tradeoff between the variables of health risk and production quality than prior contexts have allowed.  \r\n\r\nThis research generates information useful for food and agriculture policymakers. There are proposals to require cheesemakers to reduce bacteria in their products in order to reduce health risks, but these new requirements might also reduce the quality of the products in the minds of consumers. Producers of artisenal cheeses come from a wide diversity of backgrounds and are part of a fast growing sector of the agricultural economy focusing on local production, value addition and farmers markets.",

There is tension between consumer demand for the heterogeneity of artisan products and food safety as standardization, as it is often defined at the industrial level.

Many cheese makers and consumers believe the policy is not consistent with recent scientific evidence about raw milk and that the policy precludes small-scale cheese makers from producing the most lucrative types of cheese.\nIn this project we examined the tradeoffs consumers make between the safety and quality of artisan cheese and consumer behavioral responses to information about the science behind this policy. We combined hedonic analysis of retail prices of artisan cheese with analysis of consumer willingness-to-pay in experimental auctions to answer two key research questions: how do artisan cheese consumers perceive tradeoffs between safety and quality? To what extent do they perceive pasteurization and aging to be food safety attributes? Consumers at farmers markets in Michigan, New York, and Vermont participated in an interactive survey on computer tablets that involved experimental auctions and sensory analysis of pasteurized and unpasteurized cheese. The experimental auctions were designed to elicit consumers\u00c6 willingness to pay for pasteurized versus unpasteurized cheese, aged versus unaged cheese, and to monetary value on their response to information about this policy. Participants received pre-auction questions about demographics and post-auction questions about risk preferences and food safety attitudes. Retail data were also used to estimate the marginal value of pasteurization and age as they are currently distinguished in the marketplace.\nIn the retail data we found that consumers pay on average $2 more per pound for unpasteurized cheese than pasteurized cheese. If you only look at cheese aged more than 60 days you see that unpasteurized cheese sells for more than $6 per pound on average. The marginal value of the age of retail cheese is positive and significantly large but it is unclear whether this is attributed to age as safety or age as quality, which we then explored in the experimental auctions. Similarly in the experimental data we found that consumers were willing to pay more for unpasteurized and aged cheese and that pasteurization was a food safety attribute to only a small portion of consumers and age was not considered a safety attribute. Participants appeared to make some tradeoff between safety and quality and this tradeoff can be largely explained by ideological differences among consumers.\nWe also looked at how participants in the auctions reacted to positive and negative information about the science behind pasteurization and aging cheese. Participants were provided with either information advocating pasteurization of milk used in cheesemaking, information about the benefits of raw milk cheese, or both of these information treatments together. We examined the differences in participants\u00c6 willingness to pay for pasteurized and unpasteurized cheese before and after receiving the information treatment and did not find evidence of information asymmetry in this market. On average participants were indifferent between the pasteurized and unpasteurized cheeses and were not willing to pay more once they received an information treatment. We did find s..."
