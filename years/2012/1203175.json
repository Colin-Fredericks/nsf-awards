TAGS 2012 will take place on April 27 - 29, at Texas A&M University, in College Station, TX. TAGS provides an opportunity for local researchers to meet and interact, as well as learn the latest advances in Algebraic Geometry, interpreted in its broadest sense. There will be a Special Lecture aimed at graduate students. In addition, young mathematicians (graduate students and postdocs) will have the opportunity to present their work in a Poster Session. More information about this meeting is available at: http://www.math.tamu.edu/~laura/TAGS2012/\r\n\r\nMany phenomena in Nature can be modeled using systems of polynomial equations. The study of such systems is an important area of Mathematics, called Algebraic Geometry. This grant will fund a conference in this area, where investigators from Texas and the neighboring states may learn the newest developments in this field from distinguished invited speakers. This conference is also an important opportunity for local researchers, especially graduate students and postdocs, to meet and interact, gaining exposure for their work and potentially establishing new collaborations.",
