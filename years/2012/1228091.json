Despite its well-demonstrated value in preclinical studies and clinical diagnostics, PET imaging still faces two major challenges, the inherently noisy data and limited spatial resolution. These problems especially limit the accuracy and reliability of the dynamic parameter estimation due to subdivision of data into shorter frames. The arrival of integrated whole-body PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides new opportunities to fully take advantage of the simultaneously acquired high resolution anatomical information. The research objective of this BRIGE proposal is to investigate noise control and resolution recovery simultaneously in dynamic PET imaging using MRI measured anatomical information. The proposed research focuses on investigating novel 3D and 4D spatial-temporal PET image reconstruction methods to improve estimating myocardial blood flow parametric images. The research on anatomy guided 3D functional image reconstruction will improve the noise versus bias tradeoff especially for functional regions with no anatomical correspondence. The study on anatomy guided 4D direct parametric image reconstruction will significantly improve the capability of dynamic PET imaging to estimate cardiac kinetic parameters. When successfully completed, the proposal leads the way on integrating anatomical information in functional image formation of whole-body PET/MRI. Meanwhile, it will achieve a breakthrough on non-invasively quantifying myocardial blood flow, especially on detecting reduced regional tracer transport, contributing to the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Hybrid PET/MRI represents the frontier challenge for molecular imaging technology. Given the increasing popularity of multimodality imaging, it is worth noting that no anatomy-assisted functional image formation framework is provided by any major player in the molecular imaging market. The project will be an important further incentive beyond the primary motivation to facilitate anatomical localization of functional abnormalities, improving the clinical relevance of multimodality imaging. The proposed broadening participation activities are expected to recruit and retain underrepresented groups in the engineering discipline. The 'I See You' workshop on Biomedical Imaging for high school students from the Detroit area will increase the number of historically under-represented minority students to pursue careers in engineering. The new Biomedical Engineering curriculum and Biomedical Imaging course will meet the growing demand of students from the southeastern Michigan area and attract more female students to engineering. Through this project, the PI will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students recruited following procedures that have successfully attracted talented female and minority students.",
