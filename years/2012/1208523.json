 "awd_abstract_narration": "Darwin's theory of evolution explained that millions of species are related, and dealt biologists and paleontologists the enormous challenge of discovering the branching pattern of the Tree of Life. Work on this great challenge is producing a map of species-relatedness through Earth history, and answering questions such as \"what is the closest relative of a species?\" and \"what species make important products?\" To do this scientists draw on all heritable features, including genotypes (e.g., DNA) and phenotypes (e.g., anatomy). Studying phenotypes, however, has remained complicated and slow, because it has not been revolutionized by computer science and engineering innovations.\r\n\r\n     A team of biologists, computer scientists, and paleontologists will extend and adapt methods from computer vision, machine learning, crowd-sourcing and natural language processing to enable rapid and automated study of phenotypes for the Tree of Life on a vast scale. The three-year goal is to release large phenomic datasets built using new methods, and to provide the public and scientific community with tools for future work. Planned is the training of teachers and students (kindergarten - postdoctoral levels) and the engagement of \"citizen scien-tists.\" Enormous phenomic datasets, many with images, will fill an important public interest in biodiversity and the fossil record.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEvolution the organizing principle for modern biology:  through understanding how organisms are related to one another, biologists  can make comparisons about function, anatomy, and ecology.  Innovations in gene sequencing has it relatively easy to reconstruct the relationships among organisms, but, in contrast to the explosive growth in methods for generating and analyzing DNA data, studying the morphology of organisms has remained complex and slow. Thus, the attributes of organisms that scientists often want to interpret with evolutionary trees are much more difficult to evaluate and collect than the DNA data used to build the trees.  \n\n This project aimed to improve the speed at which information about anatomy and morphology are gathered and organized.  We focused on three ways of achieving greater speed and efficiency of data collection: automating tasks through computers; parsing and then distributing tasks to many participants; and capturing and organizing information generated by earlier generations of scientists. \n\nAlthough the complexity and intricacy of  images of organisms proved difficult for computers to interpret, the  use of computers to interpret pictures of organisms and their parts proved successful for some kinds of images and the attempt to use computers this way for more complex images highlighted interesting areas of research for computer science.  Crowd sourcing--having hundreds of novice  interpret images-- was much more successful, with novices being almost as capable as experts in the tasks defined for them.  The challenge in crowd sourcing was designing the task to support the novices by providing explanations, orienting and cropping images, and otherwise standardizing the information to make the tasks more straightforward.  Computer-aided capture of legacy information was both efficient and straightforward, allowing the translation of \"old\" data into more meaningful and comparable formats.\n\nIn addition to the scientific gains in capturing and generating information about the anatomy and morphology of organism, this project supported the training of graduate and undergraduate students and the training of colleagues who want to use the methods developed by this team to speed their own research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marymegan Daly"
