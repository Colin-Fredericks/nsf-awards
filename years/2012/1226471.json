 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Ms. Rhonda McClain will collect data for her doctoral dissertation under the direction of Dr. Judith Kroll and Dr. Eleonora Rossi. Speaking fluently in a second language is a notoriously difficult skill to develop as a late learner, presumably because the second language competes for selection with the native language. Current research demonstrates that bilinguals experience persistent activation of both languages even when speaking one language alone. A critical question is how bilinguals prevent speaking the more dominant or native language when trying to speak the second language. Recent studies have reported that the native language becomes inhibited, or suppressed, in order to speak in the second language. However, little is known about what type of information becomes inhibited in the native language. One possibility is that all of the words in one language are suppressed. Alternatively, a network of words that bear resemblance in meaning to each other become active or inhibited together. Another possibility is that specific words that had been spoken in the other language are inhibited. It is also unclear whether inhibition is momentary or long lasting. The planned experiments will test the scope of inhibition (what is inhibited) its time course (the duration of inhibition) by using electrophysiological measures that may provide a more sensitive index of the earliest moments of speech planning. A comparison of bilinguals and monolinguals will also determine whether the repeated requirement for bilinguals to inhibit their native or more dominant language confers expertise in the realm of inhibitory control relative to monolingual speakers.\r\n\r\nThe funded research has a number of broader implications. It will contribute important foundational knowledge about multilingualism that will inform educational issues in a society in which many learners are faced with the task of acquiring a second language past the earliest stages of childhood and at risk for academic failure unless they acquire the second language rapidly. The inhibitory processes that are the target of the planned investigation hold implications for better understanding the ability of bilinguals to maintain the two languages under conditions that may support the use of only one language. The research will also contribute to the training of an increasingly diverse group of language scientists by including undergraduate research students who are themselves bilingual.",

A chief reason for these limitations is that whenever learners attempt to speak their second language, their more dominant native language is activated in parallel. Although there is virtually no research evidence on the speech processes of adult second language learners, evidence suggests that proficient bilinguals experience parallel activation of words in their dominant and second language during speech planning. However, despite parallel activation of two languages and potential competition between them, proficient bilinguals rarely produce errors or cross-language confusions during speech production. This suggest that bilinguals develop a means for negotiating the presence of the dominant language during second language production. Not only does this expertise in negotiating competition benefit speech production, but recent research discoveries suggest that this expertise generalizes beyond language to impact general cognitive efficiency. This project was designed to examine how learners negotiate the activation of the more dominant native language when they must produce their second language. &nbsp;A second question investigated in this project was whether second language learners demonstrate advantages in cognitive efficiency that generalize beyond language when their performance is compared to monolinguals who do not speak more than one language.</p>\n<p>The first experiment was designed to examine whether second language learners exploit inhibition during speech production as a means of regulating their dominant language.
