 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work investigates which atoms, ions, small and large molecules cause certain interstellar absorption features known as \"Diffuse Interstellar Bands\" (DIBs). About 600 absorption lines associated with these families of interstellar bands are known since the 1920s but their association which specific molecules is still unknown. Here researchers with different expertise in atomic and molecular spectroscopy, interstellar gas and dust, and laboratory chemistry, come together to tackle this long-standing open question. \r\n\r\nThe approach is to compile and organize existing observations in databases and to add new measurements of DIBs seen toward about 220 stars to assess and to search for empirical relations between the different DIB absorption features as well as other interstellar parameters such as density and ionization state. The existing list of DIBs of all spectral widths to uniform limit is expanded with new observations to include broad and narrow lines that only appear under certain physical conditions. For this purpose, a new atlas of stars illuminating such interstellar regions will be assembled. Another goal is to observe certain diffuse interstellar clouds to obtain the types and absorption strengths of DIBs as a function of increasing density and ionization state, which relates to the spatial distribution of particular compounds and on-going reactions within the cloud. The team members have guaranteed access to observing facilities (e.g., Apache Point Observatory) to do this part of work.\r\n\r\nAs long as the types of compounds (molecules with more than 15 atoms are suspected) responsible for the DIB absorptions remain elusive, it is not possible to fully account for the chemical inventory and processes of the interstellar medium. The identification of the carriers of the DIBs will be a major step forward in understanding the chemical inventory in molecular clouds from which stars and planets form.\r\n\r\nThe interdisciplinary nature of this collaborative project is very strong. It provides undergraduate- and graduate students with opportunities to work on problems related to more than one discipline.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere is a set of enigmatic interstellar absorption features, commonly found in optical and near-IR spectra of distant stars, called \"diffuse interstellar bands\" (DIBs; Fig.1)).  Since their discovery in 1919, the number of known DIBs has grown to over 550.  While they are likely due to extra-terrestrial molecules, none has yet been identified with a specific chemical species.  This is the longest standing mystery in interstellar and (probably) physical spectroscopy of gases.  To address this problem, an extensive database of DIB measurements and other interstellar parameters (e.g., abundances of known atomic and molecular species) has been assembled for sight lines probing diverse environments -- enabling comprehensive studies of the relations between the DIBs and those other parameters.  While the ultimate objective is to suggest specific candidate DIB carrier molecules for laboratory investigation, understanding the environmental dependence of the DIBs will also allow them to be used as diagnostics of the physical conditions (e.g., densities, ambient radiation fields) in interstellar media -- both in our Galaxy and beyond.\n\nThis project was part of a larger collaborative investigation of the DIBs.  The following items describe several of the significant activities and results from this part of that larger effort:\n\n1) A program was constructed to enable relatively fast, semi-automated measurement of the strengths of all the DIBs in our high-quality optical spectra.  Measurement of the DIBs is non-trivial, as the DIB profiles can be complex (Fig.3), can be blended with other DIBs or with stellar absorption lines, and can exhibit subtle variations in different sight lines.  For each of the ~550 DIBs, the user can either accept the program's automated measurement or make any necessary adjustments interactively.  Use of this program has reduced the time needed to measure the DIBs in a given sight line from a few days to a few hours -- making our large survey (more than 250 sight lines) feasible -- and also enables easy uploading of the measured values to our database.\n\n2) Spectra of the hot, heavily reddened star Herschel 36 (located behind a dark dust lane in the Lagoon Nebula) revealed several unique features: strong, extended redward wings on some DIBs (Fig.4) and absorption from excited levels of the molecules CH and CH+.  Because those features are not seen toward several other near-neighbor stars, they must arise in a small region close to Herschel 36.  The CH, CH+, and DIB carrier molecules all appear to be excited by strong near-infrared radiation from a nearby hot, dust-enshrouded star. If so, the carrier molecules for the DIBs exhibiting the strong redward wings must be fairly small (4-6 heavy atoms) and have particular structural properties.  Those requirements rule out a number of proposed candidates for the carriers of those DIBs.\n\n3) Examination of relationships between DIBs and other constituents of the interstellar medium (Fig.2) can reveal information about the DIBs, the characteristics of the gas in which they arise, and the physical and chemical processes affecting their abundances.  We have noted systematic trends in the slopes of relationships between some DIBs and several tracers of neutral interstellar material.  By analogy with similar trends seen for various molecular species versus molecular hydrogen, the narrower DIBs may trace denser, more restricted regions than the broader DIBs -- perhaps reflecting relationships between DIB width and carrier size, weight, and/or ionization behavior.  Sight lines with weaker than \"expected\" DIBs often contain significant fractions of molecular gas.\n\n4) The discovery of the bright, relatively nearby, heavily reddened Type Ia supernova 2014J (in the galaxy M82), provided a rare opportunity to obtain high-quality optical spectra probing a significant amount of interstellar material in another galaxy.
