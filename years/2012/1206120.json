 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intertropical convergence zones (ITCZs) are narrow, zonally elongated regions of enhanced precipitation which can be identified near the equator over all ocean basins in time-averaged plots of precipitation, cloudiness, and surface wind convergence.  In addition, an elongated region of enhanced mean precipitation known as the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) extends across the Western Pacific to the south of the equator, with a somewhat southeastward orientation.  This project examines the variability in the aereal coverage and location of these features using a novel spatial-temporal statistical model that will be applied to various datasets including a recently available high-resolution 30-year satellite dataset. The statistical method is a Markov random field (MRF) model, which identifies pixels contained in an ITCZ based on the clustering of ITCZ pixels in space and time.  The MRF model is used to examine the variability of ITCZs caused by transient phenomena including easterly waves, extratropical disturbances, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).  Research on the impact of extratropical disturbances focuses in particular on the role of these disturbances in creating the conditions for intense moisture transport in \"atmospheric rivers\". Research on easterly waves seeks to determine the proportions of such waves which propagate through an ITCZ without interaction, become immersed in the ITCZ, or result in the breakup of a well-formed ITCZ. Other issues of interest include the formation of double-ITCZs, parallel to each other on either side of the equator, which occur in nature but are greatly exaggerated in many climate models, and the relationship between ITCZs and underlying sea surface temperatures.  In addition to the MRF model and other observational diagnostic tools, the project uses a regional climate model (RCM) to simulate ITCZ behavior.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of ITCZs is of practical importance as well as theoretical interest, as ITCZ variability is associated with El Nino events, the MJO, and atmospheric rivers, all of which have implications for severe weather in the United States.  In addition, the work provides education and training for two graduate students, who will be trained in both atmospheric science and statistical modeling, thereby contributing to the development of an interdisciplinary science workforce.  The two students also participate in an outreach and education program for elementary and middle school children, known as the Climate Literacy Empowerment and iNquiry program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project include developing a dynamical understanding of variability of rather narrow tropical convergence zones in the Pacific on time scales ranging from daily to decadal, to develop a dynamical understanding of their interaction with the extratropics and other basins as well as to develop a dynamical understanding of Atmospheric Rivers over the north Pacific.  In this last year of the project we have made significant progress in addressing these topics. \n\n \n\nWe found that the variability in the \"states\" of the east Pacific Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in boreal spring is dominated by interannual variability that is associated with ENSO.  Much interest is in the branch of the ITCZ that has a presence in the Southern Hemisphere (both sITCZ (for south) and dITCZ (for double), which as the name implies has convection zones simultaneously on both sides of the equator) as most global climate models suffer from too much presence of convection south of the equator even in seasons when none is detected in observations.  We found that those two states (sITCZ and dITCZ) are promoted when ENSO is in the Central Pacific La Nina (cold) mode.  This supplements our previous findings regarding the large-scale circulation regimes associated with each state of the ITCZ as well as the role of the ocean in controlling the location of the convection zone (as seen in the surface heat flux).  Even though there is a stochastic component to the presence of the convection zones the ocean dynamics plays an important role in where they are located.\n\n \n\nWe uncovered an interesting connection between convective activity in the South Pacific Convergence Zone and lack of activity in the east Pacific ITCZ in boreal spring (and vice versa). During austral summer we quantified how teleconnections from the tropical Atlantic ITCZ region get modified by Pacific variability so that the combined teleconnection to the Southern Hemisphere high-latitudes has a signature of a forced Rossby wave train from the Atlantic as well as a signature of a forced Rossby wave from the Pacific that has been forced by a Walker-circulation type perturbation.  The entire teleconnection arises because of the combination of both wave trains arising from very different mechanisms.\n\n \n\nWe have found clear connections between Rossby wave dynamics that reach its greatest amplitude at tropopause level and the low-level organization and intensity (in terms of integrated moisture transport) of atmospheric rivers (ARs).  By definition ARs refer to extreme events. We have examined their forcing mechanisms and climatology in reanalysis data over more than three decades.  We examined the Global Climate Models taking part in CMIP5 and evaluated their performance in terms of simulating ARs over the historical period compared to reanalysis data.  Thereby we selected a few CMIP5 models that were determined to be capable of representing ARs and examined end of the century behavior of ARs in those models under RCP8.5.  We find that in a warmer climate there is considerable increase in moisture transport (so that the mean shifts) however the AR events are not more extreme.  The occurrence of years with many AR dates is greater at the end of the century than during the historical period.  The response in moisture flux to warming is mostly thermodynamic, but in southern California it is dominated by a dynamic response.   The ARs that are of most interest for impact studies along the US west coast are those that are persistent in terms of staying in place for an extended time period so that the accumulated precipitation reaches substantial levels.  We have focused on this subset of extreme events in the historical period (in reanalysis data) and have a paper in preparation on a modeling study where we use a regional cloud resolving model to simulate one case study of such an event, where we look into the role of various feedbacks in organizing the moisture transport and quantify their relative importance for development.  The most persistent ARs are also the ones that are associated with the most tropical moisture, often times being quite similar to the classic Pineapple express scenario of pumping tropical moisture into mid-latitudes even though this is a very simplistic scenario since it is well known that there is significant overturning of moisture associated with precipitation and re-evaporation over the Pacific.\n\nThe project supported two female PhD students who defended their PhDs during the period of this grant.  Both women are employed in careers that they actively sought to get into after extensive career counseling from the PI and other professionals.  Additionally, four postdocs made contributions to this project as well as one undergraduate student, also female who is applying to graduate school.  All members of the team had the opportunity to present their results at national meetings or in seminar presentations.  Several publications from this research appeared in high-impact journals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gudrun Magnusdottir"
