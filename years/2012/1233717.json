 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to analyze data collected on a cruise of exploration to Rota 1, an erupting undersea volcano in the western Pacific ocean. The work was not funded in the previous award and represents new data collected by a newly installed, more capable, multibeam sonar tool that can image bubble trains in with water column. Analysis of the data will include extracting eruption plume information and how it changes with time in terms of height, intensity, and direction. It will also compare the mid-water plume results to ROV visual observations. A major part of the study will be devoted to gauging the usefulness of mid-water multibeam bubble train datasets and finding out what can be learned from them in terms of gauging an undesea volcano's activity. Broader impacts of the work include graduate student training and development of a new UNOLS instrument capability.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNW Rota-1 is a submarine volcano in the Mariana region, located north of Guam.  Underwater explosive eruptions driven by magmatic gases were first witnessed there in 2004 and continued until at least 2010. CO2 is one of the main volcanic gases emitted during this eruptive activity.  In March 2010, submersible observations documented continuous but variable eruptive activity at multiple vents at ~560 m depth.  Some vents released CO2 bubbles passively and continuously, while others released CO2 during stronger but intermittent explosive bursts.  Plumes of CO2 bubbles in the water column over the volcano were imaged with the ship\u00c6s multibeam sonar system.  Throughout the 2010 expedition, numerous passes were made over the eruptive vents with the ship to document the temporal variability of the bubble plumes and relate them to the eruptive activity on the seafloor, as recorded by an in situ hydrophone and visual observations.  Analysis of the multibeam sonar dataset shows: (1) bubble plumes were present on every pass over the summit and they rose 200-400 m above the vents but dissolved before they reached the ocean surface, (2) bubble plume deflection direction and distance correlate well with ocean current direction and velocity determined from the ship\u00c6s acoustic doppler current profiler, (3) bubble plume heights and volumes were variable over time and correlate with eruptive intensity as measured by the in situ hydrophone. This study shows that mid-water multibeam-sonar data can be used to characterize the level of eruptive activity and its temporal variability at a shallow submarine volcano with robust CO2 output.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William W Chadwick"
