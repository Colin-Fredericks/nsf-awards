 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean acidification and increased temperatures are projected to be the primary impacts of global climate change on polar marine ecosystems over the next century. While recent research has focused on the effects of these drivers on calcifying organisms, less is known about how these changes may affect vertebrates. This research will focus on two Antarctic fishes, Trematomus bernacchii and Pagothenia borchgrevinki. Fish eggs and larvae will be collected in McMurdo Sound and reared under different temperature and pH regimes. Modern techniques will be used to examine subsequent changes in physiology, growth, development and gene expression over both short and long timescales. The results will fill a missing gap in our knowledge about the response of non-calcifying organisms to projected changes in pH and temperature. Results will be widely disseminated through publications as well as through presentations at national and international meetings; raw data will also be made available through open-access, web-based databases. This project will support the research and training of three graduate and three undergraduate students. As well, this project will foster the development of two modules on climate change and ocean acidification for an Introduction to Biology course.",

High latitude seas are predicted to experience substantial impacts of CO<sub>2</sub>-acidification within the next 40 years. Accompanied by increases in seawater temperatures, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels has the potential to disrupt ecosystems of organisms that have evolved under stable environmental conditions for the last several millions of years. Despite this urgency, we still have limited information on the biochemical and physiological capacity of polar organisms to buffer the complex, multi-stressor effects associated with ocean change. This project investigated the impacts of elevated ocean temperatures and CO<sub>2</sub>-acidification of seawater on young stages of Antarctic fishes. Early life stages are of particular interest as they are thought to be more sensitive to changes in climate-related variables than adults. Our research investigated the combined impacts of warming and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels on naked dragonfish (<em>Gymnodraco acuticeps</em>) embryos (Image 1) and emerald rockcod (<em>Trematomus bernacchii</em>) juveniles (Image 2 and 3). Our research has provided some of the first data on how young Antarctic fishes would cope with future ocean conditions, especially when there are multiple stressors that are changing at once. One of the greatest impacts of the project has been that the effect of ocean acidification on dragonfish embryos depends on ocean temperature. Elevated temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> levels profoundly impacted both survival and rate of development of fish eggs, suggesting negative impacts to hatching success and a potential mismatch between when fish will hatch and the availability of food (there is very low food in dark winter months in the ocean) under future ocean conditions. In contrast, we found that juvenile emerald rockcod are able to cope with elevations in CO<sub>2</sub> levels predicted by ocean acidification scenarios but that when faced with both elevations in temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> levels, fish are unable to cope with both stressors together. Research generated from this grant also was the first to document trade-offs in behavior to accommodate increases in energy demand associated with physiological response mechanisms. These trade-offs suggest that juvenile rockcod may be reducing their activity levels to have enough energy to cope with stress but this could result in them having a lower ability to avoid predators. Taken together, our work provides strong evidence that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels interfere with energy metabolism (i.e. balancing energy supply and demand) of these fishes and their capacity to cope with ocean warming. Given that warming will not be independent of seawater CO<sub>2</sub>-acidification, if we are to project vulnerability to ocean change, research should be aimed at understanding how multiple stressors interact to affect physiological performance. This project trained two graduate students, one postdoctoral scholar and five undergraduate students at both San Francisco State University and the University of California Davis. In addition to conducting the research, this project engaged the K-12 students and the public through different venues on issues related to global climate change and threats to polar ecosystems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/14/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nathan&nbsp;A&nbsp;Miller</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142122/1142122_10209818_1513281463259_McMJetty13.10.19.009--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142122/1142122_10209818_1513281463259_McMJetty13.10.19.009--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142122/1142122_10209818_1513281463259_McMJetty13.10.19.009--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dragonfish guarding eggs</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rob Robbins</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;A&nbsp;Miller</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142122/1142122_10209818_1513281536761_McMJetty.2014.11.13.026-large--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142122/1142122_10209818_1513281536761_McMJetty.2014.11.13.026-large--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142122/1142122_10209818_1513281536761_McMJetty.2014.11.13.026-large--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Adult emerald rockcod</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rob Robbins</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;A&nbsp;Miller</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142122/1142122_10209818_1513281601823_Jetty11.9.4.015--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142122/1142122_10209818_1513281601823_Jetty11.9.4.015--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142122/1142122_10209818_1513281601823_Jetty11.9.4.015--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Juvenile emerald rockcod</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rob Robbins</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;A&nbsp;Miller</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
