This will be accomplished by convening a Steering Committee composed of experts from various social and behavioral science disciplines and specialty areas, who will identify key topical areas of evaluation and commission scholarly papers on each topical area.\u00a0 The papers will be presented and discussed at a commissioned workshop.\u00a0 A final document will be produced by the Steering Committee, summarizing themes and lessons from the workshop and, if deemed appropriate, proposing major design features and content areas of a new nationally representative household longitudinal study.\u00a0 A by-product of the project that will be important for moving forward will be the development of a community of scholars interested in, and willing to devote effort to, a new data collection effort of this type.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this activity is to identify the information content and data collection methodologies that are needed to understand the dynamic nature of the economic and social lives of American families.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project brought together a group of expert scholars from a range of social and behavioral science disciplines to consider whether a new nationally representative household panel survey is needed.  It addressed that question by first identifying the important  research and policy questions emerging over the next few decades, then by studying existing household panels for their adequacy to address those questions, and, finally, by considering whether a new panel might consequently be needed.\n\nBased on the findings of the project, the Steering Committee identified three broad options for NSF to consider:\n\n1)      A new omnibus household panel with a broad multidisciplinary design aiming to address several if not all of the major domains in the field;\n\n2)      A new household panel that would focus on one or more specific domains while representing the other relevant domains to the greatest degree possible, with health and child development as two specific domains that are worth considering for such a specific focus; and\n\n3)      Enhancements, improvements, and extensions of existing panels.\n\nThe Committee concluded that the first two options offer the greatest potential for new scientific discovery and for innovation in survey methodology.  They could build on all we have learned about how to ask questions and what questions to ask. New studies might be able to more easily incorporate linkages to administrative data and collect biomarker data from the beginning.   New designs could include sample sizes that are sufficiently large to examine important subgroups, and, for some topics, interview multiple respondents within the household.  However, both a new omnibus household panel and a targeted panel would require major investments at a time of shrinking funding for research and would face many design challenges that would have to be thought out carefully.  The third option has the attractive feature that significant  improvements could be made in existing panels to address their major limitations.   This option would require substantial resources if many of the enhancements we propose were implemented, but much less than that of a new panel.  In an era of limited resources, the Steering Committee concluded that this option deserves especially high priority.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert F Schoeni"
