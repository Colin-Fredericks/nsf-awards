 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two leading theories of how the white/gray/black shade of a surface is computed in your brain will be tested against each other in a series of 10 experiments. Human observers will be presented with three-dimensional displays carefully constructed so that, under controlled viewing conditions, the two theories make different predictions regarding the gray shade that will be perceived for a test surface embedded within the display. All of the displays will incorporate a serious challenge for vision, namely, multiple areas of light and shadow. These displays will vary in terms of (a) whether the change of illumination is projected onto a surface or occurs at a corner (or bend) in the surface, (b) the number of different gray shades on each surface, and (c) the range of gray shades on a given surface. The observers will be asked to match critical parts of each display for gray level and level of illumination. The strengths and weaknesses of each of the theories will be evaluated based on the observer matches. Ideally these results will suggest how the respective strengths of the two theories might be integrated.\r\n\r\nHow humans see the white, gray, and black shade of objects has not yet been explained scientifically. The basic problem is that the light that an object reflects to the eye does not reveal the shade of the object because it depends so heavily on the intensity of illumination on the object. Thus any intensity of light can be reflected from any shade of gray. The problem can only be solved by analyzing the surrounding context. Advances in our understanding of the nature of this analysis are absolutely necessary for guiding brain research in this area. The work will impact computer vision as well. At the moment, no robot can simply look at an object and report its shade of gray. Work with human vision provides the best hope for making better computer programs. Ironically, the proposed work will be conducted, not using computer images, as is almost universally done in human vision research, but with actual three-dimensional displays that are far more realistic.",

Gamut Compression. </strong>&nbsp;We study how the visual system in the brain determines the white, black, or gray shade of an object or surface. This is called lightness perception. Errors in perceived lightness are important because they reveal clues concerning how the brain is programmed to compute the gray shades of objects. The range of gray shades seen by the human eye within a shadow or within a spotlight is compressed relative to the actual range of grays. In a series of experiments we have found that the degree of compression directly correlates with the ratio between the highest luminance (highest intensity) within the shadow or spotlight and the highest luminance in the general illumination. This finding has allowed us to reject certain theories of how gray shades are computed, while supporting and/or modifying other theories. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Test of highest luminance rule under extreme illumination levels. </strong>The lightness of objects is determined by the relative intensity of light reflected by adjacent surfaces. Previous work has shown that these relative intensities are anchored by the assumption that the highest intensity is white. We tested this anchoring rule by exposing human observers to a display of gray patches under an extreme range (six million to one) of illumination levels. Across the whole range of illumination levels, the highest luminance was seen as white. At the extreme lowest level it was seen as a little darker but still a poor white. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. Veiling Luminance.</strong> We know that the brain relies heavily on the contrast at borders between adjacent surfaces. However under many conditions, such as in a fog, or when looking through a reflection in a window, the scene is covered with an added layer of light, called a veiling luminance. This veil of light dramatically reduces the contrast at borders, but with three-dimensional scenes, the eye can still see objects in their correct shades of gray. No robot can yet achieve this. In a series of experiments we have discovered information in the pattern of light reaching the eye that reveals when a veil is present and how much of the light in that pattern should be attributed to the veil and how much to the surfaces behind the veil. Specifically, when a veil is present, the contrast at the border of a shadow correlates with the overall intensity of the surface on which it falls. A shadow falling on a white surface, for example, will have a stronger border contrast than one falling on a black surface. In the absence of a veiling luminance all shadow borders have the same contrast, regardless of their gray shade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4. Illumination Matching.</strong> In experiments conducted to determine how the visual system determines the brightness of a region of illumination, we projected two round spotlights on a large pattern of rectangles of random gray shades. One spotlight fell on a full range of grays from white to black while the other fell on a group of only dark grays rectangles. Subjects were asked to adjust the brightness of one spotlight so as to make it equal in brightness with the other one. This experiment revealed that the two spotlights appear equal in brightness, not when they actually are, but rather when the brightest rectangles in each of the two spotlights are equal in intensity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>5. The Nature of Contrast Effects.</strong> Simultaneous contrast is the name of a familiar illusion in which two identical gray target squares appear different because one is on a black background while the other is on a white background. We have conducted experiments that show that this illusion occurs, not because each square is surrounded by a black or white region, but rather because each square appears to belong to the black or white region. We used a test display called reverse contrast, in which the gray bar on a white background is part of a row of black bars that are also on the white background. Likewise a gray bar on the black background is surrounded by a row of white bars. Subjects see the first bar as lighter (because they see it in relation to the row of black bars), even though it is on a white background. In our experiment we added a color tint to each of the elements, the gray, black, and white bars, and the two backgrounds. Overall, subjects saw the target bars relative to the row when the row had the same color as the target bar, but relative to the background when the background had the same color as the target bar. These results cannot be explained simply by the brightness of the region adjacent to the target, as has traditionally been assumed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/02/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Gilchrist</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1230793/1230793_10216387_1475422462607_ReverseContrast--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1230793/1230793_10216387_1475422462607_ReverseContrast--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Reverse contrast\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1230793/1230793_10216387_1475422462607_ReverseContrast--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Reverse contrast\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The gray bar on the right appears darker than the identical gray bar on the left because it is compared with the set of flanking white bars.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alan Gilchrist</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Gilchrist</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Reverse contrast</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
