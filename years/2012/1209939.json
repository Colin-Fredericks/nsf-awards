The host scientist is Dr. Wei Dong.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in morphological analyses of the jaws and teeth of early Pleistocene Old World Monkey fossils from the Tuozidong site in China in order to gain new insights into adaptive radiation of the genus Macaca and evolution of Old World monkeys in general. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific",

Primates have long been a major focus in the field of evolutionary biology, but progress has been hindered by gaps in the fossil record. Even the fossils that are available are often fragmentary because of the fragile nature of the skeleton in small- to medium-sized mammals. So the discovery and analysis of new primate fossils is essential for a better understanding of the origins of modern primates. For this study, I focused on an Old World monkey (family Cercopithecidae) fossil from the early Pleistocene because it will enlighten us about the phylogeny of this group. \n\nRelatively recently, a rich assemblage of mammal fossils has been discovered at the Tuozidong site in eastern China, notably including carnivores and artiodactyls8,9. This site is significant because it constitutes a biostratigraphic sequence with the presence of an array of fossil taxa. In particular, fossil Old World monkeys have been recovered at the site dating to around two million years ago, including a right upper jaw of Macaca.\n Research Methods/Results.

In addition, I was able to visit two paleontological sites near Nanjing along with the Nanjing Provincial Museum in order to better understand Old World monkey evolution through the analysis of fossils. The first site was at Tuozidong, which is located at Tangshan about 30 km east of downtown Nanjing. The second site was where Nanjing Man was discovered, at Yuanrendong. What surprised me was the state of Yuanrendong. I was expecting it to be another som..."
