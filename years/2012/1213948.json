 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jean Chmielewski of Purdue University conducts research to gain a clear understanding of the assembly mechanisms of collagen-peptides into microstructures and the features necessary for inclusion of functionality within these microstructures.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop novel approaches to the rational control of hierarchical assembly of collagen peptides into microstructures with desired functionality.  The size and shape of the supramolecular assemblies will be manipulated with assembly signals appropriately positioned within collagen triple helices and through ligand control to generate novel materials with improved properties for biotechnology applications.  The residual ligands and interior cavities within the supramolecular assemblies will be harnessed to add imaging functionality to the microstructures.   \r\n\r\nThe use of collagen triple helical peptides as building blocks for microscale materials is highly evocative and has broad implications for society and many areas of science. In the long term the materials developed may be useful for in vivo drug delivery and imaging, or have applications in tissue engineering. These studies will also have a broad impact on graduate student and undergraduate training, and the proposed K-4 interactions will help to inspire the next generation of students in their appreciation of science and math. The emphasis on discovery and education in this work is essential to reap the full benefits of research in this field.",
