The objectives are: to develop gaming instructional modules; to enhance the Computer Science course curriculum with problem-solving activities based on gaming instructional educational modules to improve students' understanding of the theoretical concepts; to prepare competitive engineers and computer scientists at Bowie State University, a Historically Black University; to assess and evaluate student understanding; and to disseminate the project findings through journal articles, conferences and colloquia presentations.\r\n\r\nThe deliverables of this project will be a repository of gaming instructional modules that could be integrated in any computer science curriculum with minimal modifications to existing courses. Outreach activities include the use of networking sites such as Facebook and YouTube, which will lead to increased public interest in the field of Computer Science and help to recruit students from underrepresented groups to pursue STEM careers. The students trained and educated will be better positioned for admittance to graduate school and employment in a constantly evolving interdisciplinary workforce.",

The work enhanced the Computer Science course curriculum with more problem-solving abilities based on gaming instructional educational modules for curriculum enhancement to improve students understanding of the theoretical concepts by providing an opportunity for hand-on experience. The grant also helped in acquiring equipment to further enhance the state-of-the-art teaching and research infrastructure for Gaming/Virtual Reality Research and Education in the Computer Science Department at Bowie State University (BSU). The Virtual Reality (VR) Laboratory at BSU consists of both hardware and software laboratories. The hardware lab is equipped with current state of art equipment such as Corner Cave, 3D Wall, Head Mounted Displays (nVisor SX111, Z800 Dual Pro Ruggedized, Oculus rift, HTC vive), 3D projectors, and Cyber Glove III. The software lab is equipped with 18 Dell Alienware (3D) Gaming desktops. The grant has prepared computer science majors at BSU to be competitive to enter graduate programs and the workforce by enhancement of the Gaming and Virtual Reality (VR) course curriculum with more inquiry based problem-solving activities and hands-on experiences with gaming instructional modules.</p>\n<p>The grant has resulted in publication of 5 journal papers and 29 peer reviewed conference proceedings in national and international conferences (from 2013 -2017). Additionally, the students have presented their research work in 36 posters and oral presentations at conferences and research expos (2013-2017). The grant has funded more than 20 students in 5 years at BSU to work as research assistants and gain research experience by working with hands-on real world projects in the VR Lab. The grant has provided undergraduate students and graduate students at BSU with the facility to use realistic immersive learning environments by using the VR/gaming equipment in several undergraduate and graduate classes.</p>\n<p>Its outreach activities included the use of networking sites such as Facebook and YouTube to publicize African American achievement in gaming/VR and it will lead to increased public interest in VR, gaming, and software development fields and help recruit students from underrepresented groups to pursue STEM careers. &nbsp;Multiple talks were organized at BSU to create interest in STEM fields and to increase the number African American in the VR workforce and graduate programs. Outreach activities also included organizing Virtual Reality booths at events such as International Festivals and USA Science &amp; Engineering Festival Expo for STEM in Washington Convention Center, Washington D.C in 2012, 2014, and 2016.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sharad&nbsp;Sharma</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1238784/1238784_10218290_1511835901458_ScienceFair2016-5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1238784/1238784_10218290_1511835901458_ScienceFair2016-5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Outreach Activity-Science Fair\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1238784/1238784_10218290_1511835901458_ScienceFair2016-5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Outreach Activity-Science Fair\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">VR Lab Booth at USA Science Festival for STEM at Walter E.
