Within the state and beyond, the proposed instrument is expected to break barriers to research in the areas of computational materials science and chemistry, computational mechanics and biomechanics, data informatics, and data-aware scalable computational sciences where ?big-data? increasingly complicates traditional computational workflows and paradigms.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nDue to a convincing educational and outreach plans, as well as expected scientific discoveries in the areas of science proposed, the proposal showcases strong broader impacts. The programs to enrich broader impact aspects will not only be felt locally, but will also help ensure that the nation maintains leadership and innovation within the addressed research domains.",
