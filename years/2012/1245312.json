 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CC-NIE Network Infrastructure project at San Diego State University\r\n(SDSU) is constructing and deploying a Science DMZ to support data\r\nintensive science and accommodate specific end-to-end dataflow scenarios\r\nbetween SDSU and other universities and national laboratories.  The\r\ndesign of the Science DMZ follows the vision and architecture laid out\r\nby the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet).  Cisco Nexus 7000 and 2000\r\nseries switches are deployed, along with a 10Gbps connection to the\r\nCalREN-HP network with exclusive use by the Science DMZ.  Researchers at\r\nSDSU are hosting delay-sensitive applications and datasets on Lustre\r\nparallel file systems directly attached to the Nexus switches.  These\r\napplications and datasets support research projects in the numerical\r\nsimulation of earthquake rupture and wave propagation, coastal ocean\r\nmodeling, pulse detonation engines, vortex rings in Bose-Einstein\r\ncondensates, and large-scale data for proteomics, gene promoter\r\nbioinformatics, and microbial metagenomics.  The project will directly\r\nimpact the faculty and students who encompass the Computational Science\r\nResearch Center which draws participation from all science and\r\nengineering departments at SDSU.  The Science DMZ provides researchers\r\nwith the capability to rapidly exchange large datasets and deploy\r\nWeb-based science applications that are accessible through a dedicated\r\nnetwork that is separate from, and therefore not impacted by, general\r\nInternet traffic generated by the campus population.  The DMZ will\r\npromote remote usage of computing resources at SDSU, cultivate\r\ndevelopment of collaborative tools for sharing data with the broader\r\nscientific community, establish new research partnerships, and foster\r\nnew mentorship opportunities between faculty and students engaged in\r\ncomputational science.",
