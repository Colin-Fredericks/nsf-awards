 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a theoretical project to model neutron star structure and to explore the consequences for observations of such objects.  Neutron stars are the dead remnants of moderately massive stars, and have extremely high densities.  The main goal of the work is to develop realistic models of the rotational and crust dynamics of neutron stars, and to explore (1) the observable effects of superfluid turbulence, (2) the coupling of the crust to the interior of the neutron star, and (3) how the deep crust responds to shear stresses.\r\n\r\nDr. Link will also continue his longstanding efforts to enhance in teaching and training, improve infrastructure for education and research, and undertake outreach and engagement activities with the local community.  The project is also expected to have an impact in the theoretical understanding of matter at high density and of nuclear interactions in conditions not achievable in terrestrial laboratories.",
