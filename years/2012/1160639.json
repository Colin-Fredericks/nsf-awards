But for endangered languages without a significant culture of literacy, diverse text collections on this scale seem out of reach. \r\n\r\nGiven typical speaking rates of about 10,000 word-equivalents per hour, a hundred hours of recorded speech -- conversations, narratives, or oral histories -- would give us the equivalent of a million words of text.  With community involvement, hundreds of hours of such recordings are easily within reach.\r\n\r\nHowever, transcribing such large audio collections is a daunting task, given the small number of literate native speakers and the time-consuming nature of such transcription, which can take 200 hours of work for every hour of audio. We propose to solve this problem by substituting re-speaking and verbal translation: one or more native speakers repeats each phrase of a recording, speaking slowly and carefully, and then translates it into a better-documented language.\r\n\r\nThe utility of translated passages as a way to analyze otherwise-unknown languages has been demonstrated many times, starting with the Rosetta Stone.  This aspect of our task is easier, since at least a grammatical sketch will in general be available.  \r\n\r\nOur goal in this project is to demonstrate the utility of re-speaking. We believe that  linguists, starting out with relatively little knowledge of a language, can produce phonetic transcriptions that will be good enough to support subsequent analysis resulting in coherent texts, in a process analogous to (but easier than) the process that allowed previous generations of scholars to learn to read ancient Egyptian or Sumerian.",
