 "awd_abstract_narration": "Idealized eddy resolving numerical ocean models will be combined with analytic theory to better understand how the low-frequency ocean thermohaline circulation responds to changes in atmospheric forcing. It is hypothesized that the generation and influences of anomalies in the thermohaline circulation are controlled by the propagation of information along and across geostrophic contours, and that eddy fluxes of heat and salt play a central role in the communication between regions of open and closed contours. The general approach is to use the theory to define the relevant non-dimensional numbers and provide a dynamical framework with which to guide and interpret the numerical model calculations. The numerical model will be used to test the basic predictions from the theory and to incorporate the high latitude convection regions into the large-scale ocean circulation. Quantities of interest include the properties of convective water masses, the meridional (poleward) heat transport, the meridional overturning circulation and ocean circulation anomalies.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe combination of analytic models and eddy resolving numerical models will provide a useful complement to more traditional large-scale climate models and very idealized box models that do not resolve essential physical processes. The theoretical underpinning of information propagation along and across geostrophic contours will provide both dynamical understanding of the dominant physical processes and an explicit theoretical estimate of the relevant time scales for the propagation of information and the transition between flow regimes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nUnderstanding the low-frequency variability of the thermohaline circulation is a central problem in climate science that has direct influence over a wide range of disciplines, including: atmospheric science, biogeochemistry, ecosystems, and carbon uptake. The research results from this project will contribute to both undergraduate and graduate education programs at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Undergraduate students will be recruited to work on aspects of the analytic model through the Summer Student Fellowship Program, while the Principal Investigator will incorporate results from this program into graduate level classes and lectures at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Summer School. Results from this work will also be made broadly available through the peer reviewed literature, national and international meetings and the Principal Investigator's web page.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project were to gain a better understanding of how the large scale, high latitude oceans respond to changes in atmospheric forcing in the form of heat flux, precipitation, or winds.  The main time scales of interest span annual to decadal periods.  The primary region of interest corresponds to the high latitude North Atlantic Ocean, the Nordic Seas, and the Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe first part of this study focused on the ocean response to changes in precipitation or atmospheric temperature at high latitudes. The specific quantities of interest include the oceanic poleward heat transport, the amount of sinking that results from heat loss to the atmosphere, and the temperature and salinity and large-scale currents in the ocean.  A theoretical model of the ocean was developed and tested that allows for a clear understanding of the controlling physics and a prediction of how the ocean and related quantities such as the heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere depend on several nondimensional numbers.  This nondimensional framework aids in the understanding of the controlling physics, allows different regions of the ocean to be compared, and facillitates predictions of how the ocean would responds in a changing climate.  The primary prediction of the theories, that mescale eddies play a central role in both the mean and low-frequency variability of the oceanic thermohaline circulation, was confirmed through direct comparison with high resolution computer models.\n\nA second scenario was considered for the western Arctic Ocean, the Beaufort Sea.  The ocean here is primarily forced by atmospheric winds from above and near surface fresh waters from the Arctic shelves.  Theoretical models were developed to understand what determines the mean strength of the Beaufort Gyre and how this relates to the amount of freshwater stored in the basin interior.  This is a very important quantity for the global climate system because of the influence of freshwater on ocean density and its impact on deep convection and heat exchange with the atmosphere (the paragraph above).  It was found that the mean state is a balance between wind forcing from above and horizontal transports by mesoscale eddies in the ocean, pointing to the importance of explicitly resolving these eddies in climate models.  The theory also predicts how the gyre and freshwater storage depends on time-dependent winds on annual to decadal time scales.  Once again the eddies are key as they modulate the ocean response.\n\nA theory for the offshore decay scale of cold sea surface temperature, the air-sea heat flux, the atmospheric boundary layer temperature, and winds adjacent to mid-latitude upwelling eastern boundaries was developed.  It was shown that this is a coupled system that balances ocean heat advection, atmospheric heat advection, and radiative heating of the atmosphere.  Higher order processes, such as nonlinear air-sea coupling and mixed layer instabilities, were found to be less important.  These upwelling eastern boundary regions are important for fisheries because of their large productivity and for climate because of the large air-sea heat flux and cloud formations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/06/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael A Spall"
