 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ubiquitous collection and analysis of data through the IT infrastructure creates a burgeoning privacy problem. Indeed, special care must be taken to ensure that privacy is not breached from misuse of data flowing through our systems. This project enables the formal study of privacy at the undergraduate level. Currently, privacy is only informally studied, perhaps as a small part of a general information security course, or even ignored when cybersecurity cannot find a place in the curriculum, as happens with many regional colleges and universities. The project examines how privacy can be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum at the appropriate level by identifying and developing a comprehensive set of portable course modules and lab extensions that would appropriately cover the key concepts and introduce privacy tools, techniques, and methodologies. By developing course outlines at different levels of granularity and corresponding instructional materials, retention and learning of the important concepts at different scopes and levels of the undergraduate curriculum can be ensured. The modular approach ensures that the developed curricular materials are useful for a variety of undergraduate institutions. An integral aim of the project is to find the right applications to introduce the key concepts of privacy to undergraduates along with the state of the art technological, sociological, and legal solutions, enabling integration of the difficult concepts and their retention. The project results are broadly disseminated through various channels, including institutional websites and focused workshops.",
