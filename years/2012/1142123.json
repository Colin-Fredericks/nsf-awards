 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to develop, test and deploy a miniaturized submersible for investigating subglacial lakes and other remote and hazardous aquatic environments. The Micro-Submersible Lake Exploration Device (MSLED) will expand the range of accessible environments by integrating a variety of hydrological and vision sensors into a compact and modular robotic platform. The MSLED is designed to minimally disturb the environment during in-situ measurements, and will be equipped with appropriate in-situ chemical sensors and a high resolution imaging system to determine the geological, hydrological and chemical characteristics of its surroundings. The MSLED will accomplish the following objectives: (1) Measure horizontal and vertical chemical, temperature and pressure gradients to determine sources and sinks of subglacial water, and describe biological habitability; (2) Provide the first visual characterization of the nature of such sites and the novel ecosystems they might host; (3) Acquire images and basic hydrographical and compositional data to aid in understanding ice sheet interactions with water. After thorough testing in a test site near McMurdo Station in Antarctica, the first field deployment for the MSLED will be in Whillans Ice Stream located in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This field campaign will be conducted in collaboration with the WISSARD project during the upcoming Austral summer. \r\n\r\nThe proposed development and deployment of the MSLED will build on previous efforts by the PI during an EaGER project, and is based on a currently existing version of the Jet Propulsion Lab Antarctic borehole camera. The MSLED will be a remotely operated vehicle during its initial deployment, but will be further developed into an autonomous platform for use in future subglacial lake deployments. This research platform will extend the previous observational capabilities by including additional sensors and extending observable spatial range in subglacial water bodies. This will enhance the scientific value of MSLED as compared to a simple borehole probe. For simplicity and risk reduction, the MSLED will be coupled to the Antarctic Ice Borehole Probe (AIBP). This probe will serve as the host vehicle to the MSLED. The MSLED and AIBP will then descend through the borehole to access the subglacial lakes. Once there, the MSLED will separate from its host and autonomously navigate, collecting chemical and physical signatures while recording and transmitting digital video images to the control station through a fiber optic cable",
