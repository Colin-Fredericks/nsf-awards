He will make use of the Zeeman Effect as seen in high-resolution optical spectra of young stars obtained with the NASA?s IRTF CSHELL and McDonald Observatory IGRINS spectrometers. The Zeeman Effect refers to the splitting of spectral lines that is observed in the presence of a magnetic field. The goal of this work is to test dynamo models of young stars, which has broader impacts to understanding the solar dynamo, extrasolar planet-star interactions. This project will also train a graduate student in research techniques.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            The primary goals for NSF AST grant 1212122 were to understand the evolution of stellar magnetism during the early stages of a star?s life in order to gain a better understanding of the role of the stellar magnetic field during this stage, to better understand the role of stellar magnetic fields in the process of planet formation, and to constrain the origin of the strong magnetic fields that are commonly observed on very young stars.  The general focus of the research conducted under this grant was observational in nature, and was centered on lower mass stars like the Sun and stars that are even cooler than the Sun.  During this project we used spectropolarimetry to study the stellar magnetic field geometry and its interaction with the surrounding proto-planetary accretion disk for several newly formed stars.   The simplest magnetic field geometry is a dipole characterized by a single north magnetic pole paired with a single south magnetic pole, as is seen on the Earth.  The magnetic fields of higher mass young stars are generally observed to be dipolar in geometry, and theoretical studies of the low mass stars we are studying often assume they too are dipolar in nature.  We were able to show that the magnetic fields on these young stars are not primarily dipolar, but that the large scale field that controls how the star interacts with its surrounding proto-planetary disk is primarily dipolar. \n\n            We also made observations of several older, juvenile stars that have lost the surrounding proto-planetary accretion disks that the youngest stars have.  At even older ages, we also observed a number of stars in the Pleiades star cluster.  These stars are old enough that they have settled down onto what astronomers call the main sequence.  This means that the stars have finished their early evolution and have settled down to very stably fuse hydrogen into helium for the bulk of their lives, which is the case of the Sun will take 10 billion years.  Lastly, we observed several RS CVn stars, which are much older stars that happen to be rapidly rotating because they are members of close binary star systems.  These old stars share many characteristics of the newly born stars that we have studied, and offer a nice test for some of the theories that have been proposed for the origin of the very strong fields observed in the very young stars.  Analysis of all this data is currently underway; however, it appears that the magnetic fields of the stars gradually weaken as the stars age, and that while they get somewhat stronger in the RS CVn stars, likely due to their rapid rotation, that they do not become as strong as they are in the youngest stars.  Most workers in the area believe that the stars entirely generate their magnetic fields inside the star through a dynamo process, while our observations suggest that a substantial component of the fields on the youngest stars are fossil fields left over from the star formation process.\n\n            Lastly, the observations we make to study the structure of the magnetic fields on the young stars requires that we make repeated observations of many of them.  During this process, we noted that one of the young stars showed periodic variations in its radial velocity.  This is a hallmark of the existence of a planet orbiting the star.  We conducted several follow-up observations which showed that indeed this star is orbited by a several Jupiter mass planet and that the star?s magnetic field may be critical in determining where this planet has settled into its orbit since it is very close to its parent star.  Finally, we observed another young star which reveals evidence that it too is orbited by a Jupiter mass planet.  Our observations show that this planet, called PTFO8-8695b, is probably evaporating due to its proximity to its star and that the material flowing off the planet if filling the magnetosphere of the star and causing additional material to accrete onto the star?s surface.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher M Johns-Krull"
