 "awd_abstract_narration": "Very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics has been transformed by a number of stunning discoveries made by the current-generation, ground-based gamma-ray observatories operating in the 100 GeV - 10 TeV energy range. These observatories are arrays of 2-4 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) that detect VHE gamma-rays via Cherenkov light from secondary electrons in electromagnetic cascades initiated by gamma-rays in the atmosphere. Developing new instruments with significantly better sensitivity is not possible by a simple replication or upgrade of existing devices. \r\n\r\nWith this award, the proponents will build a novel gamma-ray telescope that has the potential to transform the field, based on work by Schwarzschild and Couder. It incorporates original ideas for the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve substantial gains in angular resolution and field of view at costs comparable to existing instruments. The international Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium is preparing for a future IACT array with ten times better sensitivity and broader energy coverage to exploit the evident scientific potential of VHE gamma-ray observations. Some examples of new types of gamma-ray discoveries are searching extremely deeply for dark matter in the Galactic center and halo, testing cosmology with extragalactic background light measurements, resolving the details of shock acceleration in supernova remnants and pulsar winds, and advancing the physics of extragalactic jets by population studies and observations of short-term variability.\r\n\r\nThis new telescope overcomes the fundamental limitations in angular resolution and field of view of current prime-focus IACTs. At the same time, it allows the application of new, lower-cost technologies for the camera focal plane sensors. This work will demonstrate the enhanced performance and improved reliability of the SCT design, and the location adjacent to VERITAS will allow the performance to be evaluated against an instrument of known sensitivity. The results from this effort will enable informed choices to be made for the construction of CTA or other future instruments. It will also enhance the capabilities of the VERITAS Observatory.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Working with industry, this work will foster emerging technologies for the mass production of relatively inexpensive, light, aspheric mirror segments that will both enable future instruments to deliver unique science capabilities and encourage use of the design in the other fields of astronomy. This project will provide a unique opportunity for integrated research and education for a substantial number of young scientists.",

Several classes of astrophysical objects which accelerate particles to tens or hundreds of TeV have been identified so far. What drives these cosmic accelerators is a major question in astrophysics. VHE gamma rays are also indirect probes for studying astrophysical sites where ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are accelerated. Charged cosmic rays are deflected by interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields and cannot be traced back to their source (except at the very highest energies). Photons (and neutrinos) point directly back to their production site, providing a powerful way of identifying and characterizing cosmic particle accelerators. &nbsp;Our goal is to use the highest energy photons to resolve the mysteries of nature?s accelerators. When a very-high-energy gamma ray photon reaches the Earth, it interacts with the Earth?s atmosphere and produces a shower leading to the emission of short pulses of Cherenkov light. Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) use large mirrors, sensitive photodetectors, and fast electronics to image the Cherenkov radiation and infer the energy and direction of the incident gamma-ray. Currently operating IACTs such as VERITAS have proved to be highly successful, detecting TeV gamma ray emission from a large number of Galactic and extragalactic sources, and have demonstrated the potential for carrying out detailed studies in particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics. Research is now underway to develop the next-generation instruments that will offer improved sensitivity to gamma-ray emission from astrophysical sources.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />A major outcome of this grant is that we have completed the construction of the prototype of the ?Schwarzschild-Couder? telescope (SCT), an innovative and novel gamma-?ray instrument designed by the CTA-US Collaboration, based on optics studies by Schwarzschild and Couder. The idea behind the SCT is a dual mirror system that allows for the construction of a high resolution camera having a factor of ten more imaging pixels&nbsp;than in a Davies-Cotton single-mirror design, while keeping the camera diameter at 1m, about a factor of three smaller than in traditional telescopes. This telescope promises substantial gains in angular resolution and field of view at costs comparable to existing instruments, and has the potential to transform the field of VHE astronomy. The construction of the prototype SCT (pSCT) was funded by the grant.
