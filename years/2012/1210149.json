 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Melissa Nicole Thaw of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to conduct a research project, entitled \"Mechanisms of nutrient transport to Lake Taihu,\" during the summer of 2012 at Hohai University in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.  The host scientist is Dr. Zhongbo Yu.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the research project comes from understanding how nitrogen and phosphorous are transported to Lake Taihu through groundwater, the air and by attaching to fine sediment. High levels of nitrogen and phosphorous have led a poisonous form of algae to bloom and pollute Lake Taihu.  In the past, Lake Taihu has provided water to as many as 30 million people.  It is important to understand how nutrients are transported to lakes because the occurrence and severity of these types of algae blooms are increasing around the world. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
