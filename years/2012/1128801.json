 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate and reliable, high-resolution seafloor bathymetry is essential to many aspects of oceanographic research. Global bathymetry is also used in many areas outside of the scientific community including: K-1 teaching of earth science and seafloor geography; undergraduate-level earth science and plate tectonics; law of the sea; US Naval operations; mineral exploration&#894; planning of fiber-optic cable routing and general interest by the public. The global bathymetry map derived from satellite gravity by Sandwell?s group is now so widely used that it has become the public ?face of the deep? displayed by Google Earth. Over the next 3 to 5 years, a wealth of new marine gravity data will be provided by three currently operating satellite altimeters CryoSat, Jason-1, and Envisat. This project has the aim of using the new data to improve the accuracy of the global marine gravity field by at least a factor of two and in some areas a factor of four. Given the very wide use of satellite-derived bathymetry, the broader impacts of this work are both evident and profound.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe deep ocean basins are the last frontiers in the inner solar system. We have better maps of Mars, Venus, and now Mercury than we have for most of the Southern Ocean (Figure 1).  Our investigation was focused on using radar altimeter measurements of the ocean surface topography to infer the topography and structure of the seafloor. The principal satellites that we used, CryoSat-2 to and Jason-1, were launched to measure the changing ice sheets and ocean currents, respectively. We use the same data over the open ocean to map tiny variations in sea surface topography (1 cm ~ 1/2 inch) that can be processed into variations of the pull of gravity and ultimately the seafloor structure. Most of our effort was to develop new computer processing algorithms to extract the signals of interest.  The 4-year investigation was jointly funded by the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, and ConocoPhillips Corporation because the results are used for basic science, military operations, and petroleum exploration.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe global ocean floor maps you see in Google Earth (Figure 2) and Google Maps were derived from this research project; the update was published in January 2016 (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/around-pier-new-global-seafloor-map-incorporated-google-ocean  ). Besides providing a visually pleasing map of the seafloor the gravity maps are used for a wide variety of applications including:\n\ninertial guidance of ships, submarines, aircraft,      and missiles;\nplanning shipboard surveys;\nmapping seafloor spreading ridges and      microplates; and\ncontinental margin structure. \n\n\n \n\nThe bathymetry maps, derived from a combination of the gravity maps and shipboard soundings, are used for the following applications:\n\nidentification of navigational hazards;\ntsunami propagation and inundation models; \ntide models and tidal friction; \ncoastal tide model improvements; \nocean circulation models; \ntidal role in ocean mixing; \nunderstanding seafloor spreading ridges; \nidentification of linear volcanic chains; \neducation and outreach (i.e. geography of the      ocean basins); and\nlaw of the sea. \n\n\nSignificant results and findings\n\nA brief summary of the findings include:\n\n1)    Developed a new analytic model for a SAR altimeter waveform.\n\n2)    Developed and refined software for retracking all waveforms from Geosat, ERS-1, Envisat, CryoSat and Jason-1. \n\n3)    Developed a new global gravity model with an accuracy of 1.60 mGal in the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 3).\n\n4)    Developed of a slope correction to improve gravity accuracy over the flanks of large seamounts. \n\n5)    Developed of gravity model (V23) to detect buried tectonic structures.\n\n6)    Developed of a method for modeling the nonlinear flexural response of the lithosphere due to realistic subduction zone loading.  \n\n7)    Discovered a previously uncharted Microplate in the Indian Ocean the size of West Virginia\n\n8)    Investigated the relationship between the co-seismic slip distribution of the M9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake and the structure of the overriding plate.\n\nThese results are described in 7 journal articles as well as our web site http://topex.ucsd.edu.  The global data sets are freely available to anyone.\n\nFuture Research\n\n We hope to continue this research using new data being provided by CryoSat-2 as well as higher precision data being collected by an advanced altimeter AltiKa aboard the SARAL spacecraft.  In 2020 NASA will launch a new swath altimeter (SWOT) that could provide another factor of 5 improvement in the gravity maps and seafloor topography.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/03/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David T Sandwell"
