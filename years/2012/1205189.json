 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Enabling New Technologies Through Catalysis, or CENTC, brings together a group of 18 investigators and their students in chemistry and chemical engineering at 14 different institutions across North America.  The focus of this team is to develop fundamental science needed for the sustainable production of chemicals and fuels. CENTC scientists will create and investigate new reactions and catalyst systems for the selective cleavage and formation of C-H, C-C, C-O, O-O and O-H bonds. The information gained will be exploited to devise new methodologies for the chemical industry that are efficient, inexpensive and environmentally benign. A broad scope of projects is being pursued in CENTC including direct alkane functionalization, selective defunctionalization of biomass, utilization of carbon dioxide as a feedstock chemical, and the oxidation of water.\r\n\r\nCENTC offers a collaborative training environment for students and postdoctoral researchers, and includes education in innovation integrated throughout many activities. The center has an industrial affiliates program that allows for direct communication of CENTC research results to industry where they can be developed for commercial use. Center research is focused on the basic science that will underpin a range of new technologies for sustainable production of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and fuels and thus have significant potential to increase US competitiveness and to enhance our national security through an increase in energy independence.\r\n\r\nThe Center for Enabling New Technologies Through Catalysis is led by the University of Washington and is funded as part of the Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) program.",
