St. Catherine University and the National Center for STEM Elementary Education are hosts of the meeting.  The theme of this year's GLOBE Annual Conference is: \"GLOBE and STEM: Building a Global Community of Citizen Scientists\".  It is anticipated that approximately 150 attendees from across the 113 U.S. Partners and 111 Partner Countries will attend the 2012 meeting.  Specific activities to be undertaken at the meeting include: training in the use of selected GLOBE protocols; training in the use of the new GLOBE community web site for data entry and analysis (scheduled for release in June, 2012); discussing major themes related to GLOBE activities and STEM education, both locally and globally; exploring the interface of GLOBE and American Sign Language; and GLOBE community networking and sharing of resources.",

During the training, participants learned about the different kinds of clouds and how they interact with the environment.\n\n\nProtocol training continued on Friday morning at St. Catherine University followed by a luncheon and international panel discussion concerning the landscape of educational standards and GLOBE.  All 6 regions within GLOBE were represented on the panel.  They were:  North America, Africa, Asia &amp; Pacific, Europe &amp; Eurasia, Latin America &amp; Caribbean, and Near East &amp; North Africa. Participants indicated making five or more contacts during the conference, thus making the GLOBE conference a truly global affair.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yvonne S Ng"
