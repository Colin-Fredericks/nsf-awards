 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project will investigate the types of experiences that undergraduate engineering students have to develop global competencies.  Since globalization and technology have \"flattened\" the world there is an increasing need for engineering students to be able to work in an environment that is increasingly international.  A variety of means, including surveys and interviews, will help the research team understand the range of experiences available to students, as well as what types of experiences best foster global competencies.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to inform engineering degree programs and university administrators about the range of options available to develop international competencies.  Since such experiences are increasingly important yet potentially expensive, such insights have the potential to inform program development and evolution.  The results of this study, while focusing on engineering, can be generalized to other STEM fields.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.",

Further, to identify those students who come from more rural or small-town backgrounds, and those whose parents? education is at the high school or associate degree level, and who have yet to have an international experience, as prime targets to encourage participating in an international opportunity, possibly motivated with the use of some scholarship funds.
