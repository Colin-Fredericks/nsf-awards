 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Karl A. Scheidt,  Chemistry Department of Northwestern University, will investigate the synthesis and study of new Lewis bases as catalysts for chemical reactions.  A primary focus will be on N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). These Lewis bases have been developed as metal-free catalysts as well as being employed as ligands to generate chiral metal complexes. However, there is a dearth of new, chiral NHCs and there have been few mechanistic investigations of NHC-catalyzed processes. This project will focus on the development of new families of chiral NHCs as ligands and catalysts. The different phases of the investigation include a) synthesis and characterization of new classes of chiral N-heterocyclic carbenes and the evaluation/benchmarking of these NHCs in established catalytic processes, b) exploring/validating carbene catalysis mechanisms, and c) studies geared towards understanding the structure reactivity relationships of new catalysts for the purpose of predicting and controlling the outcome of Lewis base processes. These advances will ultimately expedite the ability to synthesize natural products, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals with maximum efficiency and minimal impact on the environment.  \r\n\r\nThe development of new catalysts that promote high value reactions is a crucial enterprise that impacts a wide range of scientific endeavors with biological and pharmacological endpoints. The investigations to be carried out on this project will advance our knowledge of Lewis base and metal catalysis, as well as structure reactivity relationships that are the foundation of modern chemical science.  These studies provide training for s diverse set of students and postdoctoral fellows. The expected skills acquired by graduate and undergraduate students driving these projects include advanced problem solving, chemical synthesis, and mechanistic organic chemistry/catalysis.",
