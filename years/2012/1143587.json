 "awd_abstract_narration": "The novel infrared Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM), operated at the South Pole Station over last few years, has opened the door to major advancements in the scientific exploration capabilities by enabling scientists to measure gravity waves in the high-latitude Antarctic Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT, ~80-100 km altitude) region in a new spectral range that is not dominated by aurora, and with a much higher temporal resolution than was previously possible. The proposed research will continue contributing to (1) a far greater understanding of the diversity and variability of gravity waves over the Antarctic continent and their associated momentum transport in the MLT region, and (2) acquired new knowledge of the gravity waves most copious sources at the high-latitudes. Both of these areas are significant unknowns within the aeronomy community, yet they are critical to improving the understanding of gravity wave impacts on larger-scale atmospheric motions, and MLT variability. The proposed new observations will build on the AMTM initial program and will take full advantage of available wind and temperature data from other co-located instruments to quantify the wave-driven dynamics over South Pole in exceptional detail. These data will contribute significantly to the recently funded ANtarctic Gravity Wave Imaging Network (ANGWIN) program that will bring together multi-instrument measurements from eight key sites around the Antarctic continent, including South Pole, to investigate the large-field dynamics inter-annual variability of the Antarctic mesosphere and lower thermosphere at the regional and continental scales. New measurements using the AMTM that has been recently deployed at the ALOMAR Arctic Observatory in Norway will further enable scientists to compare and contrast the wave-driven dynamics of the Arctic and Antarctica MLT regions. This research also contributes to the training and education of both the young scientists and undergraduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research grant supported unique optical measurements from Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica, using an infrared imaging system called an \"Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM)\" that records high-resolution temperature images of a broad-spectrum of atmospheric waves, colloquially termed \"gravity waves\".  These waves are imaged continuously during the winter season by the AMTM as they propagate through the upper levels of the Earth\u00c6s atmosphere (called the \"mesosphere\" at an altitude of about 87 km, or 50 miles).  Gravity waves are a naturally occurring atmospheric phenomenon generated by large weather disturbances, such as fronts, storms and strong winds blowing over high mountain ranges.  They are important as they transfer large amounts of energy into the upper atmosphere and ionosphere, where they break like waves on a beach, depositing this energy.  Remote-sensing wave measurements during the long Antarctic winter night at South Pole (where total darkness lasts for ~4.5 months) provide a very important way to study their major influences on the upper atmospheric dynamics over Antarctica for the first time.\n \n\nOur studies have achieved the primary goals of quantifying gravity wave occurrence, signatures and amplitudes deep inside the Antarctic continent, with the following results: (a) first continuous (24-hour \"non-stop\") measurements of gravity waves anywhere on earth, (b) identification and measurement of a rich spectrum of gravity waves even at the South Pole, helping determine their global presence, (c) year-to-year comparative measurements of wave propagation establishing their wintertime climatology and temperature amplitudes, and (d) discovery of a strong ~27-day planetary-scale temperature wave, that varies significantly from year-to-year with coincident detection by satellites. This program has also contributed significantly to the training of Mr. Jonathan Pugmire (a graduate student in Physics at Utah State University), in novel image data analysis techniques, as well as providing him with valuable \"hands on\" field experience during an instrument service visit to Antarctica in January 2013.    Further measurements at South Pole are planned as part of an international coordinated ANGWIN (Antarctic Gravity wave Instrument Network) program.  These new measurements together with future modelling studies will lead to a better understanding of the coupling of wave energy into the Earth\u00c6s near space environment on a continental-wide scale over Antarctica, where observations are currently sparse.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Taylor"
