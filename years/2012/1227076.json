 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temperature is a central aspect of climate, yet reconstructing the temperature history at Earth's surface over geological timescales has remained a challenging goal.  Much progress has been made using the oxygen isotopic compositions of fossil carbonates such as shells, but these compositions depend both on the temperature during growth of the carbonate mineral, and on the oxygen isotopic composition of the water in which the mineral grew.  Thus the oxygen isotope paleothermometer requires estimates of the oxygen isotopic composition of ancient waters, and the reconstructed temperatures will be in error if these estimates are incorrect.  Carbonate \"clumped isotope\" thermometry is a new method that has generated wide interest within the geoscience community because it does not require assumptions about past water isotopic compositions, and moreover the method is capable of reconstructing both past temperatures and past water isotopic compositions.  The temperature information is contained not in the overall isotopic composition of the mineral, but in the preferential \"clumping\" of the heavy isotopes carbon-13 and oxygen-18 into bonds with each other.  However, while this feature lends the method great promise for solving long-standing questions in paleoclimate, geobiology, tectonics, and petrology, the same feature also leads to an inconvenient truth about preservation of the original isotopic signal:  It is far easier, chemically and kinetically, for the abundances of carbon-13 \u00ac oxygen-18 bonds to be altered during burial than it is for the bulk carbon- or oxygen-isotopic composition to be altered.  The abundances of carbon-13 \u00ac oxygen-18 bonds can be altered by simple burial heating of the mineral that causes carbon and oxygen atoms migrate through the mineral lattice through a process called solid-state diffusion.\r\n\t\r\nThis research investigates the kinetics of such C-O bond reordering using a combination laboratory and natural experiments focusing on brachiopod shells.  The laboratory experiments will use methods borrowed from experimental petrology to determine Arrhenius parameters allowing prediction of the temperature-dependent rates of solid state C-O bond reordering.  The natural experiments will help to evaluate the laboratory experimental results, and will focus on 300 million-year-old brachiopod fossils from North America.  Brachiopods are an ideal material for such a study because they are widely used in paleoclimate studies, they have approximately-known initial temperatures and times of formation, they are resistant to recrystallization, and because contrasting burial histories can be compared.  A major goal of the laboratory and natural experiments is to define the temperature-time domain in which original clumped isotope compositions can be preserved.  Stated differently, investigators seek to answer questions such as \"at what burial temperature does a fossil shell begin to loose its original clumped isotope composition due to solid state reordering.\"\r\n\r\n\tThe proposed work will result in the scientific training of at least two graduate students and two undergraduate students.  The Texas A&M University (TAMU) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) graduate students will each visit Perez-Huerta's lab at the University of Alabama to conduct electron backscatter diffraction analysis, and the students will visit the collaborating institution (TAMU or JHU) to learn clumped isotope, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, cathodoluminsecence, and other techniques utilized in the study.   The students will present findings at international meetings and prepare results for publication.  The work is quantitative in nature and will provide training relevant both to academic and applied aspects of geoscience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit and Broader Impacts  Our research into the \"clumped isotope\" geothermometer can be viewed as an example of the spin-off benefits of basic research to society at large.  Our initial goals were related to the study of past climate, goals motivated by curiosity and by the need to understand the full range of climates that can exist on Earth, given the likelihood of future global climate change related to human and nonhuman activities.  However, a spin-off of this research is a new method to reconstruct the temperature histories of sedimentary rock layers as they are buried deeply inside of the Earth, including layers that are source and reservoir rocks of petroleum, gas, and coal. \n\n \n\nThe Basic Research  The premise of the carbonate clumped isotope geothermometer&mdash;our tool of interest&mdash;is that the frequency of rare carbon-13 (13C) and rare oxygen-18 (18O) co-occurring within calcium carbonate molecules relates to the temperature of formation of those molecules.  This is significant because carbonate molecules make up the mineral calcite that is common in fossil shells and limestone rocks.  Thus the method can be used to tell the temperature of seawater in which those fossils and rocks initially formed, and the seawater temperature in turn informs us about the prevailing climate long ago. The problem&mdash;and this is where our work comes in&mdash;is that when these rocks and fossils are buried and heated deep inside of the Earth, the 13C and 18O can begin to wander around (technically, diffuse) within the calcite mineral grains, effectively \"resetting\" the clumped isotope geothermometer and recording a new temperature related to the heating of the sedimentary rocks.  The most basic goal of our research was to determine the rate at which this process happens at a given temperature.\n\n \n\nTo do so, we heated calcite samples in the laboratory at different temperatures (350 to 500&deg;C) for different lengths of time (30 minutes to several days), and observed the resulting change in clumped isotope distributions using mass spectrometry.  We then analyzed these data using methods that are standard in the field of chemical reaction rates (so-called first-order reaction kinetics), as well as using novel formulations that more accurately described our results.  With both approaches, the rate information is then used to develop a powerful equation called the Arrhenius Equation which allows for extension of the rate predictions to temperatures and timescales that are outside of those that can be simulated in the laboratory (in our case, much lower temperatures and far, far longer timescales&mdash;hundreds, thousands, millions, and even hundreds of millions of years).\n\n \n\nPaleoclimate Outcomes  Our results are relevant to the study of paleoclimate because they provide a basis for determining which rock layers are likely \"overprinted\" by this process (i.e., because they were heated sufficiently during geological burial), and which rock layers are likely uninfluenced by this process.  By building our clumped isotope geothermometry-based climate records from fossil shell samples from only these uninfluenced rock layers, we can be confident that the resulting records reflect paleoclimate, and not burial heating processes.  We have applied this approach to marine rock layers (and the fossils they yield) spanning from the recent past to more than 450 million years ago.  The results indicate that tropical seawater temperatures at times may have reached 35&deg;C, or about 5&deg;C warmer than the warmest open-ocean conditions on Earth today.  On one hand, these temperatures are not \"extreme\", and suggest a fairly robust natural thermostat-like behavior of the global climate system that acts to oppose major temperature excursions.  On the other hand, such temperatures, if they existed today, would make living in many coastal tropical regions extremely uncomfortable, if not deadly.\n\n \n\nIndustry-relevant Outcomes  To be con..."
