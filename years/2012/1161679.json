 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the PIs propose just the first-year study of a program of research for \"Hybrid Aerial Vehicles\" that routinely execute dynamic maneuvers to land on, move along, and take off from sites such as walls, roofs, trees and power lines. These platforms combine the best attributes of unmanned aircraft and climbing robots. They can reach remote sites rapidly, flying directly to them. After landing, they can move along surfaces to strategic locations and provide stable inspection platforms while consuming little power for hours or days. If they cling tenaciously, they can also ride out weather that is too rough for flight. When conditions improve, or the mission changes, they can jump off and become airborne, flying to a new site.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Although this is only an initial investigation, the PIs suggest, in addition to the usual publication and web-based dissemination, the long-term impact of the larger project will be enhanced with workshops organized to bring together academic and industry experts in the emerging topic of perching aircraft. The proposal also includes a new course to be offered during MIT?s Independent Activities Period that will introduce undergraduates to interesting problems that arise at the intersection of aerodyamics, robotics and bio-inspired mechanisms. The course takes advantage of the low cost of small RC planes to provide hands-on testing and prototyping. Based on the experience gained in running the course, the same material will be adapted to a short course for high school students, organized in collaboration with the Stanford School of Education. Both laboratories have a strong track record of involving undergraduates and under-represented minorities in research and in outreach to local high schools. To help disseminate the educational material, all software and hardware will be open source.",
