 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the REU Site at UNC Charlotte is to implement effective practices to engage a diverse\r\ngroup of undergraduate students in computing research. Undergraduate students will actively pursue\r\nresearch that applies human-computer interaction (HCI) concepts to advance the state of the art in a\r\nparticular field, including pervasive computing, computer vision, data visualization, social networks, and\r\nserious games. Each research project has a socially relevant theme, providing students with the\r\nopportunity to apply and extend their computing knowledge to address problems that have a real-world\r\nimpact. The site emphasizes participation of promising students from underrepresented groups in\r\ncomputing and from institutions that have limited research programs. To help students become rapidly\r\nimmersed in the culture of research and to prepare them for meaningful research experiences, the site\r\ncultivates an authentic community of practice that values the contributions of REU students as\r\nresearchers, and provides REU participants with explicit, just-in-time training in research skills at a\r\nweekly workshop.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the REU students? contributions to the discovery and\r\nevaluation of innovative, interactive computing solutions to address problems of interest in society;\r\nspecific projects may address open problems in the fields of computer vision, pervasive computing, data\r\nvisualization, social networks, and serious games. The broader impact of this project lies in the\r\nopportunity to introduce talented students from underrepresented populations to computing research and\r\nin the potential to increase the enrollment of domestic students in doctoral computing programs.",
