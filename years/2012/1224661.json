 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science education reforms are focusing on active learning strategies that engage students in the process of science. Science (the journal) is offering a unique approach to transforming the undergraduate STEM learning environment, one that introduces undergraduates to important elements of science: reading primary research articles, communicating science, and engaging in a peer review system. Through reading and deconstructing carefully selected scientific papers, students gain an understanding of how scientists design their experiments and present their results, allowing students to actively experience the logic of getting from a set of data to a new conclusion. In addition, in their publications scientists discuss how they have incorporated and confirmed the results of other scientists, as well as where they disagree with prior conclusions. They also mention what steps might be taken next, showing students that there are still many unanswered questions. The PIs are working with a team of expert scientists and educational researchers to develop these resources, with the goal of providing students a deep understanding of how scientists design experiments, gather and analyze data, and present their conclusions. Science is thereby translating scientific papers into tools for learning, essentially helping students assume the persona of the scientist. The goal is to enable students to truly understand the scientific enterprise: science as a  powerful \"way of knowing\" about the world. The PI team is accomplishing this goal through the use of online annotations, detailed explanations of scientific figures and methods, and additional activities allowing students to work with actual scientific data.",

With less than an 8 percent acceptance rate, <em>Science</em> publications present the most exciting findings of scientists and, as such, summaries of these findings are frequently highlighted in the news. Ideally, when used in an educational setting, <em>Science</em> articles can provide an understanding of how scientists design their experiments, present their results, and discuss what steps to take next. How do we make these complex research articles more accessible to a general audience?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Science</em> in the Classroom&rdquo; (SitC) is an educational resource designed to make selected <em>Science</em> content more accessible. SitC does not simply re-write primary research literature. Instead, we choose our papers carefully and build a web-based educational scaffold, designed to provide students tools to use for interpretation, around the original text of each paper. In essence, SitC is a collection of annotated research papers and accompanying teaching materials designed to help students at the advanced high school, community college, and undergraduate level understand the structure and workings of professional scientific research.</p>\n<p>Each annotated <em>Science</em> paper contains a &ldquo;Learning Lens,&rdquo; which is used to selectively highlight and explain original text of the research article. An interactive glossary and an expanded explanation of the figures, often with a close-up of the relevant section of the figure itself, have been built into each annotated paper. Also accompanying the papers are a further explanation of the background materials, the author&rsquo;s experiments, the conclusions, and the references.</p>\n<p>During the funding period of this grant, the SitC team posted 65 annotated research papers that are freely available to the education community and the public.&nbsp; However, we believe that the most important outcome of this project lies in the way these resources are developed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We collaborate with graduate students and postdocs who volunteer as SitC Contributors and write the annotations for us.&nbsp; The Contributors then participate in a Skype call with the authors where they are able to meet the scientists behind the research and ask any follow up questions they have on the annotations.&nbsp; The authors then review and edit the annotations for scientific accuracy.&nbsp; We believe that this has built a new Community of Practice, where students and authors, who would not usually connect with each other, now work together to make <em>Science</em> content more accessible.&nbsp; In return, the Contributors gain valuable training in both writing for a general audience and developing educational resources (Figure 1), and the authors are able to expand the Broader Impacts of their research (Figure 2).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em>To further our collaboration with graduate student and postdoc communities, we partnered with the CIRTL network (<a href=\"http://www.cirtl.net/\">http://www.cirtl.net</a>) &nbsp;and offered an online course detailing the annotation process and providing a background on what we know about primary literature as an educational tool, how it has been used in different classrooms, and how it has been assessed.&nbsp; Twelve students completed this course and there were several students left on the waiting list (Figure 3).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As SitC continued to evolve, so did the annotation process.&nbsp; To our surprise, the annotation process itself became a learning activity.&nbsp; Four sets of classes (one high school, two undergrad, and one masters-level) worked together as a class assignment to develop annotations for a paper (including the Skype call with the authors).&nbsp; This shows that our student users are now acting as content <em>developers</em> and not just as content consumers (Figure 4). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have also greatly expanded our collaborations.&nbsp; Most notably, we began to partner with HHMI Biointeractive.&nbsp; HHMI has significant experience in developing a wide variety of educational media, including activities that use real data sets (such as those published in <em>Science</em>) and teacher guides. Therefore, this partnership combines the strengths of both AAAS (high quality annotated papers) and HHMI (the ability to show scientific results through multimedia products), making each collaborative resource more comprehensive and engaging (Figure 5).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In summary, SitC resources are designed for the science education community, by the science education community (Figure 6).&nbsp; It is not simply a process of AAAS developing annotated papers and making them available.&nbsp; Instead, members of the science community are involved at all levels, making SitC a truly collaborative and sustainable resource.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/11/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Melissa&nbsp;Mccartney</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928047712_figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928047712_figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928047712_figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">E-mail from a Contributor who used his experience with SitC to leverage a job opportunity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Melissa McCartney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Melissa&nbsp;Mccartney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928149397_figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928149397_figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928149397_figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sample e-mail messages from authors of annotated Science papers highlighting how they enjoyed being part of the process, how they learned something from the ?next steps? that the Contributors proposed, and how they appreciate the opportunity to share their science with a wider audience.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Melissa McCartney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Melissa&nbsp;Mccartney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928274639_figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928274639_figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928274639_figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduate students and postdocs who participated in the AAAS/CITRL online course focused on writing annotations, learning how to design an educational resource, and how to communicate science to a general audience.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Melissa McCartney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Melissa&nbsp;Mccartney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928422387_figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928422387_figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1224661/1224661_10203163_1470928422387_figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students in a master-level science course work together to write annotations as a class assignment.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScience is a leading journal of original scientific research, global news, and commentary. With less than an 8 percent acceptance rate, Science publications present the most exciting findings of scientists and, as such, summaries of these findings are frequently highlighted in the news. Ideally, when used in an educational setting, Science articles can provide an understanding of how scientists design their experiments, present their results, and discuss what steps to take next. How do we make these complex research articles more accessible to a general audience?\n\n\"Science in the Classroom\" (SitC) is an educational resource designed to make selected Science content more accessible. SitC does not simply re-write primary research literature. Instead, we choose our papers carefully and build a web-based educational scaffold, designed to provide students tools to use for interpretation, around the original text of each paper. In essence, SitC is a collection of annotated research papers and accompanying teaching materials designed to help students at the advanced high school, community college, and undergraduate level understand the structure and workings of professional scientific research.\n\nEach annotated Science paper contains a \"Learning Lens,\" which is used to selectively highlight and explain original text of the research article. An interactive glossary and an expanded explanation of the figures, often with a close-up of the relevant section of the figure itself, have been built into each annotated paper. Also accompanying the papers are a further explanation of the background materials, the author?s experiments, the conclusions, and the references.\n\nDuring the funding period of this grant, the SitC team posted 65 annotated research papers that are freely available to the education community and the public.  However, we believe that the most important outcome of this project lies in the way these resources are developed. \n\nWe collaborate with graduate students and postdocs who volunteer as SitC Contributors and write the annotations for us.  The Contributors then participate in a Skype call with the authors where they are able to meet the scientists behind the research and ask any follow up questions they have on the annotations.  The authors then review and edit the annotations for scientific accuracy.  We believe that this has built a new Community of Practice, where students and authors, who would not usually connect with each other, now work together to make Science content more accessible.  In return, the Contributors gain valuable training in both writing for a general audience and developing educational resources (Figure 1), and the authors are able to expand the Broader Impacts of their research (Figure 2). \n\n To further our collaboration with graduate student and postdoc communities, we partnered with the CIRTL network (http://www.cirtl.net)  and offered an online course detailing the annotation process and providing a background on what we know about primary literature as an educational tool, how it has been used in different classrooms, and how it has been assessed.  Twelve students completed this course and there were several students left on the waiting list (Figure 3). \n\n As SitC continued to evolve, so did the annotation process.  To our surprise, the annotation process itself became a learning activity.  Four sets of classes (one high school, two undergrad, and one masters-level) worked together as a class assignment to develop annotations for a paper (including the Skype call with the authors).  This shows that our student users are now acting as content developers and not just as content consumers (Figure 4).  \n\nWe have also greatly expanded our collaborations.  Most notably, we began to partner with HHMI Biointeractive.  HHMI has significant experience in developing a wide variety of educational media, including activities that use real data sets (such as those published in Science) and teacher guides. Therefore, this partnership combines the strengths of both AAAS (high quality annotated papers) and HHMI (the ability to show scientific results through multimedia products), making each collaborative resource more comprehensive and engaging (Figure 5). \n\n In summary, SitC resources are designed for the science education community, by the science education community (Figure 6).  It is not simply a process of AAAS developing annotated papers and making them available.  Instead, members of the science community are involved at all levels, making SitC a truly collaborative and sustainable resource.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/11/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Melissa Mccartney"
