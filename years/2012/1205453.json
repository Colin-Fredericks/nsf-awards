 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the developments that are pushing the boundary of computer science and engineering research, these stand out: the emergence of Big Data as a reality, pushing the need for scalable data analytics (e.g., data mining), the proliferation of wireless and cellular networks, and the deployment of large scale cyber-physical systems.   Every year, petabytes of new data are collected and stored by companies and organizations, prompting the need for scalable data mining to make sense of the data that has been collected. Further, the proliferation of wireless and cellular networks has enabled the advent of mobile and nomadic computing. This proliferation has also given rise to many new challenges. \r\n\r\nThis new computing research infrastructure enables research into cross-layer protocols for cognitive radio networks, wireless security energy management techniques for mobile devices, designing security for cyber-physical systems, malware detection and prevention for mobile devices, design of deeply embedded systems for monitoring water distribution infrastructure, new tools to perform scalable Time Series analysis, tools to perform Bayesian inference in critical data mining problems, and to perform Metagenome annotation and comparison.  It supports undergraduate and graduate courses on these topics. Software developed under this program and supporting data will be made available to the research community, strengthening efforts for technology transfer.",
