The\r\nConference is the premier worldwide forum for the presentation of innovations in optical\r\nsensing, showing both cutting-edge integration concepts and key emerging trends in a highly\r\nmulti-disciplinary atmosphere. This biannual Conference presents an exceptional opportunity,\r\nof interest to both academic and industrial researchers, to discuss and exchange the latest\r\ndevelopments in this extremely challenging field. There is no other Conference specifically\r\ndevoted to optical (bio)sensing, thus making this meeting unique at the international level.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe Europt(r)ode conference series has become a major scientific meeting on optical chemical\r\nsensors and biosensors attracting scientists and educators from across the globe. Because of the\r\nmultidisciplinary nature of the field, Europt(r)ode has always brought together a diverse\r\naudience including scientists and engineers in physics, chemistry and biology all over the world.\r\nTheir engaging discussions have stimulated interdisciplinary and international collaborations\r\nand helped shape scientific and academic institutions from which several generations of PhD\r\nstudents have graduated. The Conference has also fostered increasing collaborations between\r\nacademia and industry and stimulated countless new commercial spin-offs in the field.\r\nCompanies participate regularly not only at the level of exhibitors but though invited and oral or\r\nposter presentations. The Conference in 2012 will have, as a main novelty, an exclusive\r\nIndustrial Session by invitation, where the main industrial players in the field will highlight\r\nscientific innovations and technological transfer in the optical sensing field.",
