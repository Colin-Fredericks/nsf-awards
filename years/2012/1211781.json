 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative program will conduct a multi-year project to make precise measurements of the large scale structure of the universe using recently developed 21 cm intensity mapping techniques. The program will create spectral maps of 500 square degrees, spanning the frequency range 700 to 900 MHz (0.58 < z < 1). The principal goal is to measure the baryon acoustic oscillation feature at these redshifts in an innovative program which is complementary to, and competitive with, optical galaxy surveys. The acoustic scale provides a standard ruler which measures the Universe's expansion, providing an observational handle on Dark Energy.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of graduate student, and outreach to the public via a planetarium show called \"The Hydrogen Sky\" produced in English, French and Chinese, and distributed worldwide.  Additional outreach activities include tours of the night sky through the Universe in the Park program in Wisconsin and teaching electronics to under-represented groups through CMU's Summer Academy for Math and Science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe are developed a new, inexpensive technique for mapping the large-scale structure of the universe.  Ultimately, these maps could be used to test a variety of cosmological models.  In particular, they could be used  to understand the phenomenon of \u00e6dark energy,\u00c6 the mysterious antigravity component of the universe that causes the cosmic expansion to accelerate.  The technique, called neutral hydrogen intensity mapping, could allow rapid 3D surveys of the Universe without laboriously measuring the position and redshift of hundreds of millions of individual galaxies.  It exploits the unique radio signature of neutral hydrogen gas - the `21-cm line\u00c6 at 1420 MHz - to determine the redshift of large clumps of matter, on scales much larger than individual galaxies.  It also takes advantage of the rapid development of inexpensive digital processing for recording the data and for analyzing it.\n\nWe have constructed 3D sky maps from 1000 hours of observations with the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia and the 64-meter Parkes radio telescope in Australia. \nThe most significant challenge in this process is separating the relatively weak hydrogen signal from foreground radio emission from the Milky Way Galaxy, which is about 1000 times brighter. To do this we use the fact that the hydrogen signals produce a `spikey\u00c6 frequency spectrum while the foregrounds spectra are fairly smooth.  At this early stage in the program we cross-correlate the hydrogen maps with existing galaxy redshift surveys to test the fidelity of the technique.  As we improve the foreground removal algorithm and model for systematic effects from the telescopes we hope to be able to make these maps independently of the galaxy surveys.\n\nIn the process of our observations we made a serendipitous discovery of a fast radio burst (FRB).   This is the first detection of such a source with the Green Bank Telescope and confirms the observations of about a dozen similar sources made by the Parkes and Arecibo radio telescopes.\nWe confirm that approximately 10,000 of these bursts are occurring across the sky each day.  Our data show that this FRB most likely is located in a dense region of another galaxy.\n\nLooking toward the future, we are developing a 7-pixel \u00e6camera\u00c6 for the GBT to replace the existing single-pixel camera for 800 MHz observations.    In order to squeeze these extra pixels into the focal plane we have designed receiver elements based on a compact feed antenna, called a short backfire antenna, with very low sidelobes.  The new multi beam  receiver will be available for all users of the GBT for applications such as mapping even larger volumes of the cosmos and for searching for FRBs and pulsars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter T Timbie"
