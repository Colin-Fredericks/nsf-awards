Specifically, the project  provides funds to defray the cost of  travel for students enrolled in doctoral programs at US institutions  who might not otherwise be able to attend the conference or the summer school because of financial reasons. The recipients of student travel fellowships will  attend and the Reasoning Web Summer School designed to introduce graduate students to current research topics and recent advances in web reasoning followed by the RR 2012 conference which includes a scientific program of talks and  a doctoral consortium that provides a venue for the students to have one-on-one discussions and receive mentoring from some of the leading researchers in semantic web and semantic technologies. The project offers natural integration of research and education and contributes to the training of a new generation of researchers in semantic technologies, an area of growing importance and impact in not only Computer Science but also many application domains that rely on advances in knowledge representation and reasoning on the web e.g., information retrieval, e-science, e-commerce, e-government, e-health,  among others. Additional information about the RR 2012 conference and the Reasoning Web Summer School can be found at: http://www.rr-conference.org/RR2012/.",
