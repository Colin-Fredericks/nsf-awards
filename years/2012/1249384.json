 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant concerns several projects motivated by p-adic aspects of L-functions, a central object of study in number theory.  The first part of the project involves the development of certain p-adic differential operators and p-adic measures (Eisenstein\r\nmeasures), technical tools that the PI will use to construct p-adic L-functions.  These p-adic differential operators and p-adic measures build on the PI's prior results on these topics. These Eisenstein measures are also conjectured to give a homotopy-theoretic invariant of certain manifolds that generalizes the Witten genus.  The second part of the project concerns applications of the tools developed in the first part of the proposal. The main application is the construction of p-adic L-functions that p-adically interpolate the special values of L-functions attached to families of automorphic forms. One portion of this application is joint with Michael Harris, Jian-Shu Li, and Christopher Skinner. This part of the project also has applications to Iwasawa theory, a p-adic theory for studying certain arithmetic data, which in turn is expected to relate to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture.\r\n \r\nL-functions are certain complex-valued functions that play an important role in number theory.  Their values at certain points satisfy striking congruence conditions and relate to many open problems.  One approach to studying L-functions uses p-adic numbers (depending on a prime number p), an extension of the rational numbers analogous to but different from the real numbers.  This proposal involves further developing techniques for studying p-adic aspects of L-functions.  The proposed research has expected consequences in algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, and algebraic topology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project concerns research in number theory, one of the oldest areas of mathematics.  Number theory focuses on questions about whole numbers, prime numbers, factorization, and solutions to polynomial equations.  Although this particular funded research concerns an area of pure mathematics, applications of number theory play a key role in the lives of virtually all people in the modern world; more specifically, sophisticated results in number theory allow secure transmission of data when a person uses an ATM card with a chip in it and when a person makes a purchase over the internet.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n \n\nWithin the field of number theory, the funded research focused primarily on developments in p-adic methods, especially in the context of L-functions and automorphic forms:\n\n \n\nThe p-adic absolute value, an analogue of the usual absolute value that retains certain key properties of it, measures divisibility of a whole number m by a fixed prime number p.  For number theorists, who are concerned with questions about factoring and prime numbers, the p-adic absolute value is immensely useful.  Analogous to the usual notion of distance, the p-adic distance between whole numbers m and n is the p-adic absolute value |m-n|p, defined by |m-n|p = p-k with pk the largest power of p that divides m-n.  For example, |2|2 = 1/2, |3|2 = 1, |4|2= 1/4, |5|2 = 1, and |6|2 = 1/2.    Just like the usual absolute value, the p-adic absolute value can be extended to all rational numbers (fractions).  Just like the rational numbers sit inside of the real numbers (which has the usual absolute value), the rational numbers sit inside of the set of p-adic numbers (which has an extension of the p-adic absolute value).  Also, just like one studies geometry in higher dimensions with the usual absolute value, one studies p-adic geometry with the p-adic absolute value.\n\n \n\nAutomorphic forms are certain functions that encode number-theoretic information (conjecturally, in some cases). They have played a major role in most recent breakthroughs in number theory. For instance, consider Andrew Wiles\u00c6s celebrated proof of Fermat\u00c6s Last Theorem (1995). The ancient Babylonians (circa 1800 BC) recorded their work to classify triples of positive whole numbers (a, b, c) such that a2 +b2 = c2 (i.e. \"Pythagorean triples\"). What happens if we change the exponent from 2 to a larger whole number? Fermat\u00c6s Last Theorem, a conjecture that remained unsolved for over 300 years, asserts that if n is a whole number greater than 2, then there are no positive whole numbers a, b, and c such that an + bn = cn. The only known proof of Fermat\u00c6s Last Theorem uses automorphic forms and p-adic methods.\n\n \n\nL-functions comprise a wide class of functions that include the famous Riemann zeta function. As evidence of the importance and challenge of studying L-functions, the Clay Mathematics Institute includes two problems about L-functions on its list of Millennium Million Dollar problems, making number theory the only subject to have two problems on the list. The p-adic theory of L-functions remains a fruitful area of study.
