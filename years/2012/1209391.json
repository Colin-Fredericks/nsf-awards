The host scientist is Professor Ning Hu.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is the development and experimental verification of accurate numerical models of carbon nanoparticle enhanced polymers, an emerging class of multifunction materials which can be used for sensing applications.  This research contributes to basic understanding of the sensing mechanism working principles and in the design of such materials for the development of highly sensitive, robust, structurally integrated carbon based sensors.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs a scientific research venture, this project has resulted in uncovering an interesting shift the electrical resistance vs. temperature behavior due to the contribution of thermal expansion on plastics filled with carbon nanoparticles.  A connection was made between Prof. Hu Ning's group's work on the plastic's thermal expansion and new experimental results of the effect of temperature on the plastic's electrical behaviors.  With this experimental finding, there is an affirmation on the major mechanisms to be studied and included in the computation simulation model of these kinds of conducting network physical systems.  As a direct result, the samples fabricated will be used to produce more experimental results to verify a simulation model developed as part of the fellow's doctoral dissertation work.\n\nFurthermore, there was a two-way exchange of culture as a result of the fellow's stay at Chiba University.  In addition to the fellow's experience of Japanese culture, the Japanese students in her lab also learned about American culture and what it's like to be American AND Chinese (or a Chinese-American, if you prefer).  In her time in Japan, the fellow was able to experience traditional Japanese culture through their festivals, architecture, and dance, as well as modern Japanese culture through music festivals and interaction with Japanese graduate students. \n\nProfessionally, the fellow has gained a much stronger understanding of the world of academic research and what it takes to become an educator at the university level.  Learning from her host researcher and his research experiences across the globe, his insights into work culture differences and the approach to engineering education in different countries has given the fellow new perspectives on how to approach her own potential career as an educator and how to prepare future students for the global world they will encounter. \n\nAdditionally, as a result of this research exchange, a long term research collaboration relationship between her Japanese host lab and her US home lab has begun, with preliminary agreements between professors made about potential collaborative research projects and  further research exchange visits to be made in the future.  By identifying common research interests and the strength and needs of each group, the two groups hope to further research and application of multifunctional structural materials into intelligent. self-sensing structural systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christiana Chang"
