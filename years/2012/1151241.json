 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea level lies at the intersection of Earth's solid, liquid, and gaseous components, and thus forms a fundamental boundary on our planet that affects both biology and geology. Human society must adjust to changes in this boundary, which is currently thought to be rising at 2-3 mm per year. Although it is known that climatological factors such as seawater warming and glacial melting are major contributors to sea level rise, deformation of the solid Earth also affects sea level in ways that are poorly constrained. This project uses numerical models of solid Earth deformation to understand the mechanisms by which the solid Earth influences sea level change over timescales ranging from decades to billions of years. By comparing predicted patterns of sea level change with observations, we will place new constraints on the solid Earth's effect on sea level. The scientific results from this effort will be translated directly into an educational program designed to teach undergraduate students about the interactions between the solid earth and sea level.\r\nThis project will focus on three timescales relevant to modes of solid earth deformation. For timescales of decades to centuries, we will compute spatial variations in rates of sea level rise associated with Earth's elastic response to regional melting of glacial ice. For timescales of millennia and longer, we will compute the Earth's time-dependent viscous response to deglaciation. For timescales of millions of years and longer, we will use numerical models of mantle convection to determine how exchange of water between the oceans and Earth's interior affects sea level both directly and indirectly by changing ocean basin properties such as mid-ocean ridge volume, ocean area, and average seafloor depth. For each timescale, we will calibrate the sea level response to specific imposed forcing. By comparing these predicted patterns of sea level change with observations (obtained from satellite, tide gauge, sedimentary, and geologic constraints), we will place constraints on the historical and geologic causes of sea level change. This understanding will be incorporated into education modules that will be used by undergraduate students (first at the University of Hawaii and later everywhere via a publicly-available website) to probe the interaction between the solid earth and sea level in an interactive way. This research will help quantify the causes of sea level change and its spatial variations during the past decade and century, and thus will help inform coastal planning for future sea level rise. It will also help us understand the solid Earth's influence on sea level change over thousands and millions of years, which will help scientists understand the geologic record of sea level change and its coupling to the dynamics of Earth's interior.",

Sea level today is thought to be about 20 cm higher today than it was 100 years ago, and more than 100 m higher than it was 20000 years ago. By contrast, sea level is thought to be about 200 m lower today than it was 100 million years ago. The rise and fall of sea level over these different timescales is caused by a variety of factors that can be divided into two categories: First, the volume of seawater in the oceans can change with time as water is exchanged with continental reservoirs such as glaciers, ice sheets, and groundwater. Second, tectonic processes, sedimentation, and volcanism can change the shape of the ocean basins, displacing water and changing sea level. The dynamics of solid earth deformation are important for both components of sea level rise, and exert an influence on all timescales (decades to millions of years). This project aims to understand the mechanisms by which the solid earth influences sea level (see Figure 1).</p>\n<p>As groundwater or ice is lost from continental storage locations, the ground surface uplifts because it is no longer loaded by the weight of that water. In addition, the ocean surface descends in the vicinity of the continental mass loss because of decreased gravitational attraction of seawater to the area. As a result, the rate sea level rise can vary from place to place depending on proximity to sources of continental mass loss. As part of this project, we have computed spatial variations in sea level change caused by groundwater depletion during the past century. We have found that sea level rise was slower in the vicinity of the western United States and India during the past century, compared to other parts of the world, because of intense groundwater depletion in these regions (see Figure 2). Such constraints on the spatial variations in sea level help us to understand differences between observed rates of sea level rise recorded in different parts of the world during the past century.</p>\n<p>On longer time scales, solid earth deformations play a dominant role. As part of this project, we have constrained several of them for the past 140 million years. The most important of these deformations involves reconfigurations of the tectonic plates over time: During the past 140 million years, the opening of the Atlantic basin has led to on-average slower plate motions. This slowdown has causes the seafloor to become older, on average, and deeper as a result. We estimate that this process caused a drop in sea level of about 250 m during the past 100 million years. As the seafloor aged, it accumulated an increasingly larger volume of sediment and volcanic debris &ndash; we estimate that these accumulations led to sea level rise of about 50 and 20 m, respectively, since about 100 million years ago. The collision of India with Eurasia increased the volume of the ocean basins slightly &ndash; this lowered sea level by about 20 m. Together with sea level drop of ~50 m associated with the growth of the present-day ice sheets, these factors explain much of the ~200 m of observed sea level drop since about 80 million years ago (see Figure 3).</p>\n<p>The internal dynamics of the Earth&rsquo;s mantle, which moves slowly beneath the tectonic plates, also affects sea level by causing broad-scale uplift or subsidence across entire ocean basins. Changes to this &ldquo;dynamic topography&rdquo; can displace seawater, changing sea level. The time dependence of this component of sea level change is difficult to estimate because we don&rsquo;t know the patterns of mantle flow for past times. As part of this project, we have developed a method for constraining the large-scale patterns of past mantle flow using reconstructions of past plate tectonic motions, which represent the surface expression of this flow. We estimate that motion of the continents over this changing long-wavelength topography may have caused about 50 m of sea level rise in the past ~140 million years. These reconstructions of mantle flow also provide information about a variety of geochemical, orogenic, and volcanic episodes that can be discerned from the geologic record &ndash; and thus these reconstructions provide a key building block for our understanding of Earth history.</p>\n<p>The results of this project have been communicated in a variety of scientific publications and public outreach articles. We have also developed classroom exercises for undergraduate and graduate students, and for elementary school students. Throughout these exercises, we have stressed the importance of solid earth deformation for our understanding of the history and future of sea level change. We also stress the importance of the sea level problem for coastal communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/03/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Clinton&nbsp;P&nbsp;Conrad</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1151241/1151241_10181287_1475498206549_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1151241/1151241_10181287_1475498206549_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
