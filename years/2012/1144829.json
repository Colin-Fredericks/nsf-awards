 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rocks beneath the coastal plain of Georgia were at the center of the most fundamental tectonic events to shape eastern North America: continental collision around 290 million years ago to form the super continent of Pangea; continental breakup leading to the formation of the Atlantic Ocean beginning around 230 million years ago; and one of the biggest magmatic events in Earth's history around 200 million years ago, the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province.  A record of these events and possible relationships between them is preserved by structures in the crust of southern Georgia, including a suture between two different types of continent, the largest failed rift basin along the east coast of North America and igneous rocks from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province.  These investigators and a large team of graduate and undergraduate students are collecting seismic data that can be used to image structures in the crust to understand these tectonic events.  Hundreds of geophones are being deployed along two ~300-km-long profiles across the suture and the basin, which record sound waves generated by a series of explosive charges spaced ~20 km apart. Geophones are also being deployed in a box focused on the basin to record explosive charges arranged in a grid.  The speed that sound waves travel through rocks varies with composition, porosity, and other rock characteristics. The investigators are using travel-time tomography to create velocity models that reveal the distribution of igneous rocks, variations in the thickness of the crust and variations in crustal composition. Besides a better understanding of fundamental tectonic processes, other benefits of this program include training and education of students, and characterization of basins and igneous rocks that might be good targets for carbon sequestration.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goals of this project are:  (1) to image the crustal structure across the Mesozoic South Georgia Basin and the Brunswick magnetic anomaly (BMA), which is thought to mark the Paleozoic Alleghanian suture.  The Alleghanian Suture is the boundary that connects the portions of North America that existed before ~300 m.y. ago and those parts that were added (or ?sutured on?) when North America collided with Gondwana, which was the supercontinent of Africa and South America combined.  Surprisingly, the location of the Alleghanian suture remains uncertain, and the coincidence of the BMA and the Alleghanian suture remains a matter of debate; and (2) use the resulting image to help understand (a) the role of major lithospheric fabric (i.e. a suture) on rift evolution and (b) how other factors, such as magmatism, control the evolution of rift localization to successful lithospheric rupture.\n\nThis grant provided support to conduct a large seismic experiment, the SUGAR experiment, in southern Georgia.  The experiment consisted of three seismic transects, each crossing Mesozoic rift basins and the BMA.  The two longest lines Lines 1 and 2 also crossed a distinct boundary that separates known peri-Gondwanan terranes from the Piedmont terranes on the Laurentian margin.  This experiment was the first large-scale crustal-imaging refraction experiment conducted in the southeastern U.S.  The key results from this experiment relate to rifting, magmatism, and the Alleghanian suture, and the results are all somewhat surprising.  Mesozoic rift basins are distributed over a broad region of the southeastern U.S.  Our results show that these basins are associate with only very small amounts of crustal extension.  Magmatic additions to the crust are also small, which is consistent with the small amount of extension but suprising given the mapped extent of so-called CAMP (Central Atlantic Magmatic Province) magmatism.  Regarding the suture, our results suggest that it lies very close to the Laurentian margin and is not associated in any obvious way with the BMA.  In fact, there is no discernable crustal velocity signature of the BMA on any of the three SUGAR lines.  This suggest that the BMA may be an ancient suture and that present-day Florida and much of Georgia docked as a large unit onto North America.  This interpretation is at odds with an interpretation of receiver-function images from the SESAME project, which is also an NSF-EAR/Earthscope funded project with similar goas as the SUGAR experiment.  Researchers of the SESAME project interpret a shallow-crustal velocity anomaly that is observed continuously across southern Georgia as a ramp upon which allocthonous Gondwana terranes were accreted to North America, with presumably North American terranes beneath.  There is no evidence in the SUGAR data to support the receiver function observation, and so uncertainty still remains about the formation of the southeastern U.S. continental lithosphere.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Lizarralde"
