 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through gifts, the Community Environmental Scholars Program was launched in 2010 in the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the university. This need-based scholarship program is for undergraduates either from an underrepresented ethnic group or who are first-generation college, veterans, disabled, or returning adults. In its inaugural year, the program served a cohort of 28 students who were dedicated to working with real people on real environmental problems.\r\n\r\nThis project builds on the Scholars Program and adds new features. Over a 5-year period and using similar selection criteria plus an additional one of academic excellence, the university is awarding 35 or more scholarships averaging $8000 to undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors pursing an environmental studies certificate or major, or pursuing an environmental science major. These scholarships support a cohort of students in STEM fields, primarily science and engineering. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The program models a real-world setting in which people trained in STEM work with people from other backgrounds to accomplish a common goal. Linking learning in STEM with real-world environmental issues has been shown to be effective for all students, but especially for women and underrepresented minorities.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The current generation of undergraduate students faces unprecedented environmental challenges in their future lives as professionals and citizens. This project supports students as they train to meet these challenges. Campus networks are being used to recruit and retain a wide diversity of students for the scholarships. For all students who participate, this project represents a triple win: for the students themselves, for those in the STEM disciplines in which they enroll, and for the environmental health and well-being of the communities in which they one day will live and work.",

As of January 2018, 39 had graduated and 5 were on track to graduate on time.\n\nBackground\nWhen we wrote our S-STEM proposal, we recognized that the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies could offer a unique home and support structure for STEM students. Why?  In the Nelson Institute, all environmental studies majors are required to have another major. The same is true for students completing a certificate in environmental studies; that is, they must have a major in another field.  Currently, about 30% of our environmental studies undergraduate majors have STEM disciplines as their primary major. For students who receive a certificate in environmental studies, the percentage is even higher.  Thus, the Nelson Institute offered a large pool of students from which to draw, one that guaranteed both a diverse set of STEM majors and a common interest in the environment.\n\n\nOur university has over 40,000 students. While programs exist to provide assistance to freshmen, fewer opportunities are available for students to build a close community when they become juniors and seniors.
