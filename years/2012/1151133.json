Motility is a critical factor in the formation of surface-associated bacterial biofilms.  Once biofilms form, they are notoriously difficult to remove, resulting in billions of dollars of damage to oil and water pipelines, biomedical implants, and food.  Reducing these costs requires new strategies to prevent bacteria from forming biofilms.  In the initial stage of biofilm formation, bacteria modify their motility mechanisms to enable irreversible attachment to nearby surfaces.  To test the hypothesis that motility characteristics and rates of bacterial attachment and detachment are affected by the interactions between bacteria and surfaces, the specific aims are: (1) To elucidate the effects of surface chemistry and elasticity on dispersal by measuring velocity and persistence of motion on surfaces.  Single-bacterium tracking algorithms will be used to track thousands of bacteria moving on surfaces with controlled surface charge and elastic modulus engineered using layer-by-layer deposition, yielding optimized surface properties to minimize dispersal.  (2) To quantify directional persistence in response to surface patterns.  The mean-square displacement, mean speed, persistence time, and angle of motion of bacteria on gradient surfaces with feature sizes of 1-100 microns will be analyzed using models for chemotaxis, yielding fundamental data on how surface patterns direct motion in bacteria.  (3) To develop assays to evaluate antifouling surfaces by measuring attachment and detachment rates of individual bacteria.  These rates will be correlated to the structure of the resultant biofilms on two types of surfaces with demonstrated antifouling efficacy, amphiphilic polymer films and hierarchically wrinkled surfaces.  By generating new fundamental understanding of the effects of surface properties on motility, adhesion, and biofilm formation, this project aims to enable the rational design of coatings that inhibit colonization by bacteria and thereby impede biofilm formation.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  Optimized antifouling coatings will help to reduce the billions of dollars in biocorrosion damage in water and resource pipelines each year and in costs related to hospital-acquired infections.  More broadly, detailed microscopic investigations of near-surface motility will yield new insights on the interactions between bacteria and the surfaces on which they move, enabling qualitatively new studies of infection and pathology as well as antifouling surface properties.  The information-rich data generated by this work will improve existing models for directed motility and for bacterial adhesion.  Finally, these techniques can be applied to correlate bacterial attachment and fouling to surface properties across a wide range of species and surfaces.  The proposed research will be integrated with educational and outreach efforts aimed at increasing the participation of underserved populations in engineering in Houston.  First, training and learning activities on biofouling that inspire students to study engineering will be developed in collaboration with two minority-serving local high schools (KIPP-Houston and DeBakey), leveraging the PI's ongoing work with NSF-RET and the UH GRADE Camp program for introducing precollege women to engineering.  Second, the PI will continue to mentor undergraduate students in research through UH and NSF-REU.  Finally, two graduate students will be mentored in research on antifouling surfaces, and interdisciplinary workshops on engineering for biology will be initiated by the PI.  The proposed teaching and outreach efforts will broaden participation in engineering throughout the diverse population of Houston, reflected by the high proportions of African American and Latino (95% and 56%) and low income (80% and 49%) students at KIPP-Houston and DeBakey, respectively.  Likewise, the PI will pursue these activities at the University of Houston (13% African American and 21% Latino), the second most diverse research university in the US.  The results from this study will be widely disseminated by the PI and her students in both the scientific literature and to the petroleum and biomedical industries, leveraging the PI's experience as an industrially sponsored postdoctoral researcher and her ongoing collaborations at the Texas Medical Center.",

Biofilms are surface-living communities of bacteria, surrounded by a polymeric matrix that protects them from a wide range of environmental stresses. Biofilms can foul nearly any surface, including pipelines, food processing equipment, and medical implants, and are difficult to remove or efface. Reducing the billions of dollars in costs each year associated with biofilm formation requires strategies to control biofilm formation. This project focused on understanding how surface properties altered bacterial adhesion, the initial stage in the formation of biofilms, by exploring its effect on near-surface motility. Insights gained from the motility studies were used to design responsive surfaces that removed attached bacteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>The outcomes from our project were focused on two main areas. First, we showed that bacterial motility near a surface could be used to predict its adhesion. (1) We used novel algorithms to track bacteria as they deposited on and moved near surfaces. Using these algorithms, we showed that the extent of bacterial motion was inversely related to how readily they adhered to chemically-modified surfaces. Thus we could develop a simple and high-throughput screening assay to predict how well a given surface chemistry would prevent bacterial adhesion. (2) We engineered bacteria that had high numbers of a filamentous appendage, type 1 fimbriae, known to aid surface adhesion. Using this strain and others, we showed that bacteria lacking type 1 fimbriae were able to slide along surfaces without sticking. We also showed that the number of fimbriae affected how much bacteria adhered to solid substrates, to the surfaces of cells, and to liquid-liquid interfaces.</p>\n<p>Second, we engineered polymer surfaces that would promote motility and, hence, reduce adhesion. (3) We developed routes to synthesize polymers (both in bulk solutions and grafted to surfaces) with controlled length distributions (both the mean and the width). We focused on the synthesis of a smart polymer, poly(acrylic acid), that changed its conformation in response to changes in solution pH, but also showed that this route could be used to synthesize a commodity polymer, polystyrene. (4) We showed that the molecular weight distribution of PAA grafted to surfaces affected the extent of the conformational changes and hence the properties of the brush-coated surface. (5) Finally, we used smart polymer brush surfaces as a novel route to selectively and orthogonally control the attachment and detachment of bacteria. The average brush length alone controlled attachment, whereas both the average and width of the brush length distribution controlled detachment. Surprisingly, changes in PAA configuration removed bacteria even though PAA itself is not a low-fouling polymer. Beyond the specific application in biofouling explored here, surfaces with tunable attachment and detachment offer new opportunities in sensing, controlled release, and separations.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>The scientific results on bacterial motility suggest simple, high-throughput assays for rapidly screening the antifouling efficacy of a wide range of chemical compounds. Likewise, the scientific results on responsive brushes suggest new routes to control the attachment of bacteria and other microscale particles. These results therefore have strong practical import in antifouling, in drug delivery, and in separations, among other applications.</p>\n<p>This proposal supported the training of four graduate students (2 PhD, 2 MS) and three undergraduate researchers in experimental and analytical methods in microbiology, interfacial science, and/or materials science. The PI and her students participated annually in three outreach events for K-12 students hosted through the University of Houston (STEP Forward, aimed at rising 12<sup>th</sup> grade students; GRADE Camp, for women in grades 8 &ndash; 12 interested in engineering; and Mars Rover, at which K &ndash; 6 grade students construct a model of a rover for planetary exploration). The PI founded a vibrant and thriving local meeting, the Texas Soft Matter Meeting, which annually brings together academic and industrial scientists in central and southeastern Texas. The PI presented these results at seminars at local companies, with medical researchers at UT Health Sciences, and with academic scientists at universities across the country.
