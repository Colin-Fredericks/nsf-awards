 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project comprises a systematic study of the Jovian Trojan Asteroids, which lead and trail Jupiter at its stable Lagrange points. The study will test or constrain models suggesting that the Trojans formed in situ and others suggesting they were scattered from greater heliocentric distances. The proposing team will use 4-color (BVRI) optical photometry to distinguish the major compositional groups known among the Trojans from each other, and from compositional groups in the main asteroid belt. They will obtain BVRI colors of up to 200 Trojans and time-resolved light curves of up to 75, bringing the number of well-determined Trojan light curves close to 200, and will test whether different compositional groups have different rotation parameters, indicating either differences in material strength or collisional history. The team plans to compare the properties of the Trojans with main belt asteroids, Cybeles and Hildas (neighboring groups on the outer edge of the main belt), Kuiper Belt objects, and cometary nuclei. This Research in Undergraduate Institutions project will directly involve undergraduate students in the research as well as support the dissertation of a graduate student at a collaborating institution. Some of these students will be women and/or members of underrepresented groups. The methods and results will be incorporated into undergraduate classes reaching up to 300 students per year taught by the Principal Investigator and collaborators, who are frequent speakers in public outreach forums.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Jovian Trojan asteroids revolve around the Sun at the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points, 60 degrees ahead of and behind Jupiter.  Because of their greater distance from the Sun (5.2 A.U. on average, beyond the main asteroid belt) and their low reflectance, the Trojans have been studied less than main belt asteroids.  We have no meteorite analogs that appear to have originated among the Trojans, so their composition is largely unknown.\n\n \n\nIn this project we have surveyed the rotation properties of the Trojans, particularly those less than 30 km in diameter.  We have also studied the colors of the surfaces, information that can be used to infer composition. \n\n \n\nSmall main belt asteroids show a \"spin barrier;\" very few have rotation periods less than about 2.2 hours.  The ones spinning faster are thought to be intact objects, and the slower ones \"rubble piles\" that have broken apart and re-accumulated.  If they were to spin faster, they would fly apart due to centripetal \"force.\"  It is possible to estimate the density of objects in this regime, since more dense objects are held together more strongly.  In our study of Trojans, we have detected none with a rotation period of less than about 5 hours.  This period would imply a density similar to that of comets. \n\n \n\nWe have also discovered that a significant population of Trojans (30-40%) have rotation periods greater than 24 hours, and several have periods into the hundreds of hours.  The only well-studied long-period Trojan, 617 Patroclus, is a tidally-locked binary system.  The possibilities that Trojans are binaries should be investigated further in the future.  Other possibilities are comet-like outgassing and, for smaller objects, the YORP (Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievski-Paddack) effect.  Our most recent work on this project has been published in French et al. 2015.\n\n \n\nThe colors of the 100 brightest Trojans have been determined and put on the same scale.  All seem to be of two spectral types known as D and Xe.  Chatelain et al. 2016 developed a new color index that shows promise for more quickly identifying objects with compositions similar to the Trojans.\n\n \n\nThe grant funded the Ph.D. work of one student.  Four undergraduates, all now pursuing graduate work in STEM fields, participated in summer work and observing trips to Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Linda M French"
