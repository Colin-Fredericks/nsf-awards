The project will extend the Fellow's research on how Dogrib and Chipewayan experienced a major prosodic shift (language tones) in their language. The Fellow proposes to do this through a detailed phonological study of northern Athabaskan languages including the collection of verb paradigms, elders' stories, and experiments aimed to assess consonant length and germination, and correlates of stress.  An important part of the project is the documentation of these languages and the creation of language teaching and learning materials for use by heritage speaker communities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis fellowship involved research on two First Nations languages spoken in and around Yellowknife, Northwest Territories:  Wiiliideh, also known as Dogrib or Tlicho, and Tetsot'ine, also known as Dene Suline or Chipewyan.  These languages are members of the Dene (Athabaskan) language family, one of the largest indigenous language families in North America.  Dene languages are spoken in Alaska, Northern Canada, the Pacific Northwest, and the American Southwest.  The PI spent about half of his time doing fieldwork in Yellowknife, and half of his time at the Alaska Native Language Center in Fairbanks, Alaska.\n\nDene (Athabaskan) languages have long been believed to have some of the most complex and irregular verb morphology of any language on earth:  they are considered difficult to learn, and have also baffled linguists in many ways.  The goals of this project, broadly speaking, were to increase our understanding, from a linguistic point of view, of why Dene verbs are the way they are, and also help with the documentation and revitalization of Dene languages, which are all to some degree endangered (that is, they are being acquired by fewer and fewer children).\n\nThe main linguistic hypothesis which this project sought to investigate was the idea that the complex alternations found in Dene verbs are conditioned by prosody, which means stress, vowel length, and tone--specificially, how has prosody shaped Dene verbs historically, and what role does it still play in the present-day languages?  The PI elicited verb paradigms from speakers of both languages, and also conducted phonetic measurements of verbs, to investigate these issues.  The PI found that nearly all of the present-day verb morphology which appears irregular, was, at least historically, the result of very regular sound changes conditioned by prosody.  For example, unstressed vowels deleted, stressed vowels lengthened, and both High toned and nasalized vowels become long and therefore stressed.  In other words, Dene verbs turn out to be much more regular than previously thought, once we understand them from a prosodic perspective.\n\nHowever, there still are very many verb forms that need to be memorized by language learners.  The PI also assisted in creating two verb dictionaries, similar to the popular 501 Verbs series, with verb forms in both the Wiiliideh and Tetsot'ine languages fully conjugated in all 27 forms for each verb.  These can serve as a useful reference work for language teachers and learners wanting to understand more about verbs.  The PI also produced two intermediate-level readers, with elders' stories, a running glossary at the bottom of each page, vocabulary review, comprehension questions in the language, and an English free translation at the back, for each language.  These resources are already being used by local language educators to help revitalize their native languages.\n\nIn future work, the PI hopes to produce a complete grammar of both languages, and continue to produce more language learning materials informed by the grammar.  All of this work was only made possible through the NSF Polar Postdoc Fellowship, as this kind of work is not typically supported directly by universities or by local and provincial governments, in Canada or elsewhere.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/08/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alessandro M Jaker"
