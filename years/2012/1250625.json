 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-1250625\r\nCole\r\n\r\nIn the area of heat conduction and diffusion, many analytical solutions are available already in classic books on the subject. The authors of such books have assumed that the mathematical expression is all the reader needs, when in fact for engineering applications, considerable additional work can be required in order to obtain numerical values. Practically speaking, such analytical solutions, like imported furniture packed flat in a box, should come with instructions and tools needed to assemble them into a usable form.\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with repackaging analytical solutions, by adding information and tools, to make them better suited for engineering applications, and to make these widely available. We propose to develop the EXact Analytical Conduction Toolbox, or EXACT. This project will draw upon the experience of senior researchers in the area of heat conduction and diffusion, to capture their perishable knowledge.\tBecause the field of heat conduction is mature, and attracting fewer new researchers, it is important to act now, to harvest and store the knowledge of experienced researchers, before this knowledge passes away. Although research on heat conduction solutions may be going out of style, analytical solutions themselves will never go out of style, because of the ongoing need for verification of fully-numeric solutions, and, as direct solvers in support of experimental measurement of thermal properties and heat flux. This project will take advantage of the vast digital storage capacity in the ?cloud?, combined with instantaneous world-wide communication, and combined with cross-platform data-and-software compatibility, to disseminate the results in ways impossible only a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe information to be assembled for each exact solution will draw upon several areas of intellectual merit. Some analytical solutions have the form of infinite series, and regarding the number of series terms required, it is possible just to take a large number and see if it is sufficient. This common procedure may be satisfactory for 1D problems, but not for 2D or 3D problems, so specific methods to address convergence will be included. Efficient computation of eigenvalues will be addressed, with algorithms and computer programs supplied. Tied in with the evaluation of infinite series is the concept of time partitioning which is not well-known. A further related concept is ?intrinsic verification?, in which the solution itself contains the means for checking that the numerical results are accurate and precise. A numbering system for heat conduction will be applied to both new and existing solutions to make them easy to identify, store, and retrieve. The number system is transformative, because it provides a new way of viewing the entire body of solutions in heat conduction and diffusion.\r\n\r\nThe results of this project will serve a wide community, including researchers, working engineers, educators, and students, through improved access to precise numerical values, from verified algorithms, for a variety of applications. For example, experimentalists, including biologists, could utilize the solutions in many ways to determine thermal and mass transfer properties. Because computations based on analytic solutions are very accurate, sensitivities to boundary conditions, thermal properties, and so on can be investigated with precision, something that cannot be done with finite element, finite difference, and other fully-numeric methods. Success in this project will serve as a model for harvesting and storing knowledge in other mature fields of science and engineering. In particular the numbering system, presently applied to heat conduction and diffusion, could be extended to any field for which analytical solutions have impact, for example in electromagnetics, acoustics, and fluid flow. This project will have an impact on traditional publishing, as the project results will provide a paradigm for moving from the publishing present -- where books and databases are perhaps of equal importance -- to the publishing future, where computer databases will be ascendant.\r\n\r\nThis project provides opportunity for many younger researchers to work closely with a few senior researchers who are at or past retirement age. This affords a significant opportunity to directly transfer expertise and sustain the flow of knowledge across generations in the field of heat transfer.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project facilitated the collaboration of ten international researchers in the field of heat conduction.  These individuals are at varying stages in their careers and notably several are more senior and have significant knowledge in this field which has been sustained through this research by interactions with the more junior team members.\nSpecific deliverables that have been developed through this research collaboration include development and evolution of a concise numbering system which can be used to catalog solutions to heat conduction problems and creation of an online database with exact analytical solutions for over 130 solutions to heat conduction problems.  Additionally, the concept of \"intrinsic verification\", which exercises features of the solution to test and verify the correctness of it, has been utilized extensively and refined. Finally, the concept of generalized solutions, whereby solutions to a family of related problems can be expressed compactly in a single solution, has grown out of this research.\nIntellectual Merit.  Collaboration between senior and more junior researchers in the field of analytical heat conduction has strengthened the base of knowledge in this important field.  In the digital age, so much emphasis is placed on numerical simulation and computation that the art and practice of solutions through analysis are fading.  Analytical solutions remain important for extremely accurate computations which can be used, for example, to benchmark numerical solutions. This research has resulted specifically in the development and archiving of over 130 solutions to the heat conduction equation.  Beyond simply recording the solutions in symbolic notation, each solution is archived in an electronic document containing:  a demonstration of validity using intrinsic verification principles, a computer code which can be used to efficiently evaluate the solution, and a series of sample calculations. \nTwo important concepts which are advanced under this work are the solution numbering system and intrinsic verification.  Heat conduction problems can be described in several standard geometries and with an array of possible boundary and initial conditions, in addition to possible internal heating (such as electric current heating a wire) or external cooling (such as a rod exposed to a breeze).  The geometry and various conditions are encapsulated in the solution numbering system which facilitates cataloguing solutions, much as books are cataloged in a library using the Dewey decimal system.  (This numbering system is outlined in the Wikipedia articlehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green's_function_number ).  The concept of intrinsic verification is an extension and generalization of the \"check your own work\" mantra.  The idea is that the solution itself contains features which can be used to verify its correctness.  For example, the units of measure of all the terms in an equation must be the same.  Another algebraic check is that any term involving a logarithm of a variable (ln(x), for example) must have a matching term in the same units (perhaps ln(L)).  A final example pertaining to transient problems is that, for very small values of time, the transient portion of the solution must be approximately equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to the steady-state portion.\nA final significant contribution created through this research is the concept of generalized solutions to the heat conduction problem.  It is possible to represent the solutions of nine or twelve related mathematical problems in a single expression.  This convenience comes at the cost of a more complex form for the resulting expression, but offers the possibility of having a single computational routine to accurately evaluate solutions for a family of problems.\nBroader Impacts.  The most significant broad impact from the project is the creation of the database of solutions (http://exact.unl.edu ).  This repository presently contains over 130 cat..."
