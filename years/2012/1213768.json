 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work will develop new observations and data from historical ground\r\nrupturing earthquakes to improve understanding of the earthquake rupture process. Prior\r\nobservations have worked to define the role of fault geometry in rupture propagation, addressed\r\nand discounted self-similarity in the description of surface rupture slip distributions, shown\r\nclearly that fault rupture is not consistently uni- or bi-lateral, that earthquakes do not consistently\r\ninitiate on the section of fault ultimately recording maximum slip, and thatthe relationship\r\nbetween average coseismic slip and rupture length for large strike-slip earthquakes appears to\r\nrequire coseismic slip at progressively greater depths below the seismogenic layer as a function\r\nof rupture length. Previous work was been limited by time and funding to a set of about three\r\ndozen large continental earthquakes which shared the characteristics that there existed (1) maps\r\nof the surface rupture trace, (2) maps of the nearby active faults that did not rupture, and (3)\r\nmeasurements of coseismic offset at many points along the strike of the rupture to define the\r\nsurface slip distribution. The resulting compilation has already become a heavily cited and\r\nwidely used resource for the larger earthquake physics community. This work will extend\r\nprevious analyses to a list of more than twice as many earthquakes that have produced surface\r\nruptures but for which documentation may not simultaneously satisfy all three criteria. The\r\npremise of this proposal is that many observations and insights are yet to be gained in following\r\na similar approach and extending the analysis to these additional surface rupturing earthquakes.\r\n\r\nBroader Significance:\r\nPlacing observational bounds on our efforts to understand the physics of the earthquake\r\nprocess is at the heart of quantifying earthquake hazard imposed by mapped active faults; this is\r\nthe broadest and most practical impact of the proposed research. Other researchers have\r\ndeveloped numerical models of earthquake rupture behavior, but knowing how well they predict\r\nreal earth behavior depends on observational data from real ground ruptures. Research questions\r\ninclude how far a rupture can jump from one fault to another, how angle deviations in a fault\r\ntrace affect rupture, how deep into the crust rupture extends, and how surface rupture correlates\r\nwith expected ground motions. As a practical example, the empirical observations will improve\r\ntools to define the expected endpoints and thus rupture lengths of earthquakes in California.\r\nFunding will also contribute to the training of a graduate-level geoscience student.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe studied historical earthquakes that broke the ground surface in order to understand how steps in the surface trace of faults affect rupture propagation.  If steps often stop earthquake ruptures, geologists can use a map of the surface trace of a fault to better estimate likely earthquake sizes and locations.  These estimates in turn help engineers, emergency responders, insurers, and the public make more informed decisions about potential consequences of seismic events. \n\nIn detail, we analyzed a set of 76 mapped surface ruptures for relationships between geometrical discontinuities in fault traces and earthquake rupture extent. In all we include 46 strike-slip, 16 normal, and 14 reverse mechanism events.  Our survey shows that ~85% of ruptures have at least one end at a mappable discontinuity, either a fault end or a step of 1 km or greater. Dip-slip ruptures can jump across larger steps than strike-slip earthquakes, with maxima of ~12 vs. ~6 km, respectively.  By far most strike-slip steps are 4 km or smaller. Modeling predicts that steps of 1 km or greater will be effective in stopping rupture about 45% of the time.  This rate is similar between strike-slip and dip-slip subsets.

Gap data will be useful for interpreting remote sensing images of ruptures where site access cannot be arranged.\n\nBroader impacts include scientific and social elements.  Scientifically, results from this study will be used by others to calibrate dynamic models of earthquake rupture, and especially to better understand how faults connect at depth.  This will improve our understanding of fault mechanics, and more broadly, our understanding of how faults work to release tectonic stresses.   Synthesized rupture maps will be a resource for study by others.  Socially, our results will be used to improve estimates of seismic hazard interpreted from fault maps and slip rate.  This project supported the education primarily of one graduate student, and technical presentations at several meetings with international attendance.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Glenn P Biasi"
