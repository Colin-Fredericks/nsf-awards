The data will be used to map large scale structure and constrain neutrino masses and early dark energy models.  The award will fund both operation of the telescope and production of the scientific results.     \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and a postdoc, collaboration with Chilean and Japanese scientists, and outreach to low-income and under-represented high school students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe POLARBEAR experiment made pioneering measurements of swirling patterns of polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) known as B-modes generated by gravitational lensing of large-scale structure in the universe.  It measured both the distortion of the primary CMB E-mode polarization into a combination of E- and B-modes (4-point statistics) and also the direct appearance of lensed B-modes (autospectrum or 2-point statistics).\n\nThese measurements measure the structure in the universe over practically all redshifts, and so gives a consensus on matter for all of cosmological history.  Although these measurements were the beginning of detecting such signals, the POLARBEAR observations point the way to making precise measurements of large-scale structure that will characterize Dark Energy and measure the sum of neutrino masses.\n\nPOLARBEAR is also searching for the signature of inflation at the time of the Big Bang.   Inflation is an exponential expansion of all of space, following Einstein's idea that space itself is malleable.  We have scanned a 600 square degree region of the sky, and we will produce constraints on inflation using this data set.  We are using a polarization modulator consisting of a continuously rotating half-wave plate.  \n\nPOLARBEAR has also set stringent upper limits on cosmic birefringence - the idea that the universe acts to rotate polarization due to exotic fundamental physics such as parity breaking - or the existence of primordial magnetic fields.  \n\nPOLARBEAR is paving the way to the next stage of the experiment named POLARBEAR/Simons Array.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adrian T Lee"
