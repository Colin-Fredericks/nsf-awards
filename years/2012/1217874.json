 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project takes a novel look at Complex Networks and related problems in data mining and signal processing. Issues arising in Complex Networks are formulated as intrinsically topological problems which, when studied using algebraic topological tools, affords highly efficient and effective solutions. The algebraic approach yields distributed computations, and naturally unveils topological information about the underlying network for strategic planning of mitigation. In particular, this unified view allows tackling problems of dynamics and evolution of networks, where time-varying properties may in turn be used for network healing. \r\n\r\nThe efficient developed solutions will have an impact on data mining analysis, and provide more insight into the associated strengths and limitations, as well as other network related applications in a broad variety of networks.",
