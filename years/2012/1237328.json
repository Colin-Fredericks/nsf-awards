The workshop participants include researchers both within and outside education who have developed theoretical perspectives that can inform frameworks of STEM education implementation in the context of systemic change. Products of the workshop will include: (1) a long-term research agenda with prioritized grand challenges related to the implementation of STEM innovations; (2) a research network for sharing instruments, methods, and data; (3) an edited volume on improving implementation of STEM innovations in education systems.",
