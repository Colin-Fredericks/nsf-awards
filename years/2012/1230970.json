 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nField emission and field evaporation behavior provides the underpinning physics of several technically relevant applications and characterization techniques.  Field evaporation or emission nominally requires a sharp point, typically of the diameter of a tens of nanometers, where a few thousand volts is sufficient for the tip to either emit electrons or evaporate ions, depending on the potential.  Many applications and developments in modern microscopy and materials characterization techniques depend upon these phenomena.  To stimulate technical discussions on these and other relevant topics, The University of Alabama will host The 53rd International Field Emission Society (IFES) Conference and Pre-meeting Tutorial.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe University of Alabama will host The 53rd International Field Emission Society (IFES) Conference and Pre-meeting Tutorial to address training and knowledge dissemination in the theory and practical use of field emission and field evaporation for advanced materials research.",
