The investigators plan to do ab initio calculations of the tidal dissipation rate as a function of orbital period, mass and spin.  Results of this work will be applicable to astrophysics, planetary science and fluid dynamics.  In addition to publishing in refereed journals, the PI will make numerical results publicly available, and train a grad student and postdoctoral researcher, and carry out ?Math/Science Days? at a local middle school.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "In the last few years, the PI, with graduate students, have carried\nout a series of theoretical studies on dynamical tides in compact\nwhite dwarf (WD) binaries and exoplanetary systems containing hot\nJupiters.  Although the properties of these two types of systems and\nthe related applications are quite different, they can be studied with\nsimilar theoretical and numerical tools. The accomplished research\nconsists of two parts:\n(1) We have systematically studied dynamical tidal excitation and\ndissipation of low-frequency internal waves in compact WD binaries\nusing realistic WD models. We have calculated ab initio\nthe tidal dissipation rate as a function of the orbital period, the WD\nmass and spin, and therefore determined the spin-orbit synchronization\nrate and the tidal luminosity prior to binary merger. The results of\nthis research are useful for understanding the observability of\npre-merger WDs and the outcome of final mergers.\n(2) We have studied dynamical tides in various types of host stars of\nhot Jupiters on an inclined orbit to understand how tidal dissipation\nmay affect the spin-orbit misalignment angle and orbital decay. We have\nalso study dynamical tides (including thermal tides) in hot\nJupiters and explore how they may contribute to the observed planetary\nradius ``anomaly''.\n\n \nBroader impacts: Our research is multidisciplinary in nature,\ninvolving astrophysics, planetary sciences and fluid dynamics, and\nthus is of interest to a broad scientific community.  We have\npublished our research results in refereed journals and presented in\nappropriate scientific meetings. We have also incoporated our results\ninto classroom teaching as well as lectures to the general public and\nhigh school students. The main funding for this proposal has been used\nto provide GRA support for several graduate students, who have\nreceived training in many of the multidisciplinary areas, as well as\nin scientific computing. We have also engaged several undergraduate\nstudents in our research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dong Lai"
