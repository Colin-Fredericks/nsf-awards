 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seasonal weather changes determine the timing of many life-history events, including bird migration, plant flowering, and frog breeding.  However, the specific set of weather cues that signal these events differs among species; some species may respond to temperature, others to rainfall.  Therefore, year-to-year differences in weather can result in different responses among species, which can alter the timing of when species arrive or become active in a given area and which other species they may encounter.  This could affect the outcome of species interactions, such competition or predation.  The investigators of this project will experimentally manipulate colonization patterns of newly-hatched insects and amphibians in ponds.  Specifically, they will vary arrival synchrony of individuals within a species as well as arrival time of species relative to one another.  The goal is to determine how differences in arrival time and synchrony affect growth rates and survival of interacting species.  \r\n\r\nUnderstanding how seasonal variation impacts species interactions is crucial because global climate change is altering the annual activities of species throughout the world.  Although many studies have documented such \"phenological shifts,\" the consequences for species interactions -- and ultimately the biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems -- remain poorly known.  To help complete this project, the investigators will hire and mentor an undergraduate student, who will be recruited from the Rice NSF AGEP program (a program that seeks to increase underrepresented groups in science).  Also, the investigators are organizing a citizen scientist project to monitor the phenologies of local plants and animals, with the goal of training community members to generate data for a National Phenology Network program, called Nature's Notebook.  Data contributed to this program are used by scientists, educators, policy-makers, and resource managers to understand the effects of climate change and other environmental changes.",
