  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDespite the rapid development of nanotechnologies over the past decade, our\ncurrent understanding of nanomaterial fate and transport in the environment\nremains quite limited.  For example, it is not known how most engineered nanomaterials will interact with soil matrices, whether or not their transport can be modeled as colloidal particles using classic particle filtration theory, or how unsaturated conditions impact nanoparticle transport, retention and persistence in natural soils.  Although some effort has been devoted to investigate the behavior of carbonaceous nanomaterials in the environment, a very limited number of studies have focused on the transport of metal-based nanoparticles, a particularly important class of nanomaterials because of their potential toxicity and widespread use in personal care products.  For this reason, the proposed research will focus on three representative metal-based nanomaterials; nano-silver (Ag), nano-titanium dioxide (TiO2), and nano-manganese oxide(s) (MnOx). \n\nThe research program is designed to couple detailed laboratory\nexperimentation with mathematical modeling to elucidate mechanisms  governing the fate and transport of metal-based nanoparticles in quartz sands and natural soils.  To achieve this goal, the research is structured around four specific tasks, (1) characterization of metal-based nanoparticle suspensions and soil properties, (2) measure the transport and retention of metal-based nanoparticle under water saturated conditions, (3) measure the transport of metal-based nanoparticle under unsaturated conditions, and (4) develop and validate mathematical models for the prediction of metal-based nanoparticle transport and persistence in subsurface systems.  Particularly novel aspects of the research plan include the consideration of surface coatings and\nemulsifying agents commonly used in sunscreens and cosmetic products containing TiO2 and the use of force-volume microscopy to image nanoparticles deposited on sand grain surfaces.  Information gathered from each task will be integrated to advance our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing metal-based nanoparticle transport in porous media, with the ultimate goal of developing a numerical simulator that can be used to predict the transport behavior of engineered nanoparticles in the subsurface based on known input parameters.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/09/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kurt Davis Pennell"
