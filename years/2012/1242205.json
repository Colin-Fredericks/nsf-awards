This culture can have substantive impacts on how and why research is conducted.  The purpose of the workshop is to bring together key players in this ongoing discussion within the CISE community for a discussion and deliberation, with the aim of analyzing the issues and developing guidelines for the way forward. The participants will represent all stakeholders, from academic researchers to for-profit publishers. A specific focus of the workshop would be to develop consensus around a set of guiding principles. The workshop will make significant progress in exploring the current and alternative publication models for computing research.",
