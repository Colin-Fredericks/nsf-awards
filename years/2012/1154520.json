 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Quantitative Excellence in Science and Technology (QuEST) Scholars program is facilitating the academic success of transfer students who enter the college intending to major in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). It is designed to (1) create and nurture cohorts of STEM transfer students through specifically designed and carefully monitored academic and social-support activities; and (2) create the College Student Tutors and Resources for Science (C-STARS) peer tutoring program to help students struggling with quantitative subjects presented in STEM courses. \r\n\r\nScholarships of up to $8,000 are being offered to transfer students from their initial matriculation as sophomores or juniors through graduation in one of the STEM majors at the college: Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geosciences, Marine Science, Mathematics, or Physics. STEM faculty help select QuEST Scholars based on financial need, academic potential, and demonstrated dedication to a STEM subject. Seven new QuEST Scholars are being chosen in three consecutive academic years; continued funding for each selected Scholar is based on continued financial need, positive academic performance, and progress towards completing a STEM major. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Four STEM faculty members are teamed with the Associate Dean for Institutional Effectiveness to implement the QuEST and C-STARS programs to improve STEM student learning and retention at the college. In their first year, STEM transfer students participate in a new QuEST Seminar course, which focuses on the roll that quantitative materials play in all STEM majors, thereby creating a true cohort over diverse disciplines. In addition, the seminar explores STEM learning strategies, science ethics, interdisciplinary research, and career development. To improve academic success in STEM courses, the project is also creating the C-STARS program, in which carefully screened and continually trained upper level STEM majors assist students who are experiencing difficulty with quantitative elements of STEM courses. C-STARS peer tutors participate in weekly instructional sessions on successful pedagogical approaches. The faculty team is developing the seminar course, increasing QuEST Scholar learning through new support services including study groups, peer mentors, and an intervention network to respond to transfer student needs, and transforming the STEM learning environment for all students by creating the C-STARS peer tutoring program. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The research-based initiatives, directed by experienced and informed faculty, are helping to improve the retention of transfer students intending to major in STEM areas at the college. The project is broadly disseminating findings from the QuEST Scholars, Seminar, and C-STARS programs to help other institutions enhance STEM student retention at the undergraduate level.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Quantitative Excellence in Science and Technology (QuEST) Scholarship Program was designed to improve STEM transfer student success at Eckerd College.  Funded by a grant from the NSF S-STEM program, our QuEST initiative focused on two elements:  (1)  Create and nurture cohorts of STEM transfer students through specifically designed and carefully monitored academic and social-support activities; and (2) Create the College Student Tutors and Resources for Science (C-STARS) to help students struggling with quantitative subjects presented in science and math courses.\n\nQuEST Scholarships were awarded to 34 STEM transfer students from fall of 2012 through spring of 2018.  Individual scholarships were typically $8,000 per year and were renewable from a student?s initial matriculation as a sophomore or junior at Eckerd College through graduation, provided they remained in a STEM major.  Scholarship selection was based on cumulative GPA, classes completed in science and math, and an essay describing career plans in a STEM field.  Furthermore, the NSF S-STEM program required scholarship recipients to have unmet financial need and to fulfill US citizen or residency requirements. \n\nTwenty-two of the QuEST Scholars (65%) graduated from Eckerd in a STEM field.  Eight students (36%) completed majors in the physical or computational sciences (Chemistry, Computer Science, Computer Studies, Mathematics, Geosciences, and the Geophysics Track in Marine Science) while 14 students (64%) completed biology-related majors (Biomedical Sciences, Biology, and the Biology Track in Marine Science).  Of the 12 students that left the program, four remained to pursue Environmental Studies majors while eight withdrew from Eckerd.  As a result of this grant, the college learned a lot about improving the support mechanisms for transfer students, and is exploring ways to institutionalize changes to orientation sessions, course recommendations, and facilitate communication between advisors, faculty, and students.\n\nThe grant also motivated us to create the College Student Tutors and Resources for Science (C-STARS), a unified peer-tutoring program for computer science, physics, marine science, mathematics, chemistry, and biology.  This peer-learning program for STEM students built on and expanded existing tutoring support programs in the sciences.  Eckerd continued funding the computer science, physics, and math tutors while S-STEM funding went towards expanding tutoring to general and organic chemistry as well as marine science and biology.  Tutoring was free and open for all. \n\nOver the grant period, there was a substantial increase in the number of student visits for peer tutoring in computer science, physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, and marine science.  In one year, the number of documented visits for tutoring in all STEM disciplines rose from 2,200 to 3,664.  This is an increase of almost 70% from the academic years 2016-2017 to 2017-2018.  Our NSF S-STEM grant supported all tutors for chemistry, biology, and marine science, which accounted for 2,376 (65%) of the total number of visits in AY2017-2018.  Realizing the benefits of aiding students in the additional STEM areas, Eckerd will continue to fund the peer-tutoring program in STEM fields, picking up the cost of expansion to cover chemistry, biology, and marine science into the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura R Wetzel"
