 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the PI will combine techniques and expertise from physics and the life sciences to advance fundamental knowledge and providing a new technique for gene and drug delivery. The proposed approach is based on plasmon-mediated cell transfection. Cell transfection by femtosecond laser is an attractive alternative; however, this technique is currently limited to single-cell transfection. The PI will address the important goal of high-throughput, low-toxicity, and high-efficiency DNA delivery to cells by using plasmon devices that possess micrometer-sized points of extreme local field enhancements to porate cell membranes when irradiated by an ultrafast laser. By running parallel theoretical modeling of the field enhancement, fabrication of the substrates, and experimental analysis of the light-plasmon-cell interaction and DNA diffusion, the project will provide a powerful tool with broad applicability to transfection of numerous cell lines. The method proposed in this project will address challenging genetics questions and has the potential for transformative impact in the field of genetics and, more broadly, any biomedical research involving transfection. It will enable efficient, safe, and high-throughput introduction of genetic vectors into mammalian cells. This is the first step toward studying and optimizing the modification of genetic expression. Simultaneously, it will provide further insight in the light mediated transfection mechanisms. This work will also contribute to the education and the training of future multidisciplinary scientists through research-based education of undergraduate and graduate students. The work will be broadly disseminated to the general public.",
