The workshop is being driven by the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident that was caused by the massive earthquake and subsequent Tsunami.  The primary focus of the workshop is to bring together researchers in both the U.S. and Japan to define the research needed to better understand how to ascertain the quantity of released radioactive material.  This is a problem that requires fundamental scientific understanding of a variety of physical processes and it also has substantial practical value for not only the Fukushima incident, but for any that may occur in the future.",

Assessments of the remaining nuclear fuel following the incident have allowed the scientific community to approach a consensus on the total amount of radioactive material released from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant (FD-NPP). What is still unclear, however, is the timing of the releases and how much of the radioactive material was released into the atmosphere versus directly into the nearby ocean. \n\nTo address these ongoing challenges with this problem, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently sponsored a workshop held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) that brought together an international group of researchers from academia, government labs, government agencies, private industry and included representatives from the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), Japan Nuclear Safety Research Association (NSRA), and the Kansai Electric Power Company.
