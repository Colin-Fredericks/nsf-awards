 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to measure speciated volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds during the Fourth Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME-IV), to be held in Missoula, Montana from October 15 to November 16, 2012. Aspects of the investigation include: (1) the fast changes in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and other species within the first few hours after emission; (2) emissions of as-yet unidentified higher molecular weight VOCs, which contribute to the formation of secondary products such as ozone, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and organic acids; and (3) the interaction between emitted trace gases and particles with clouds. The University of California, Irvine group will collect whole air samples in the biomass burning emissions of globally important fuels using stainless steel canisters followed by analysis using multi-column gas chromatography. The University of Miami group will measure a selection of the whole air samples, extending the measurements into the semi-volatile range, using a high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer and solid adsorbent traps. Together these measurements will yield important new information about the chemical and physical properties of smoke, its evolution, and its interactions with clouds.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is a multi-investigator project focusing on the combustion of globally important fuels in a controlled environment, it will be possible to examine processes that will eventually allow better parameterization of biomass emission impacts in predictive chemistry/climate models. The project will also help to develop next-generation instrumentation via trace gas analysis using a new instrumental capability at the University of Miami, a high resolution time of flight mass spectrometer. It is expected that the high resolution spectra obtained from the different samples will provide a unique characterization of the complex composition of smoke and its variations during aging. The results from this project will help in the development of a graduate course in Advanced Environmental Mass Spectrometry at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). The results from this study will be published in the peer-reviewed literature and will be presented at international, interdisciplinary conferences. The project will include members from underrepresented groups as participants in this study, in both the sampling and analytical measurements.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiomass burning emits a large range of trace gases and particles into the atmosphere.  These emissions can have large impacts on air quality, even well beyond the local areas where the burning occurs.  The emissions of a large variety of chemical compounds and aerosols from the burning can contribute to reactions in the atmosphere that produce ozone and other harmful oxidants, the emissions or their transformation products may be toxic, or the emissions can degrade visibility and impact human health.  Studies have shown that biomass burning emissions have a very complex and variable chemical composition that depends on the details of the combustion process (e.g., flaming vs. smoldering combustion) as well as the composition and type of fuel that is burned.  Much of the biomass burning that occurs is related to not only forest fires, but agricultural fires, cooking fuels, garbage burning, and biofuel combustion.  Thus, the chemical composition and ultimate impacts of the emissions on atmospheric chemistry, cloud and aerosol processes, and human impacts will also depend on the nature of the combustion.\n\nThe FLAME-4 study was conducted to examine the emissions and impacts of a range of common combustible fuels under controlled laboratory conditions.   The fuels that were examined in this study included a range of grasses (wiregrass, sawgrass, wheatgrass), woods (Pine, Spruce), agricultural products (rice straw, alfalfa, millet, wheat), common biofuel (peat from different sources), and garbage type (tires, trash).  A number of different instruments were employed to characterize the chemical composition and reactions of the burning emissions.  \n\nOur research in the study was to examine the trace gas composition of the different experimental burns.  To accomplish this research, air samples were collected in stainless steel flasks during approximately 60 burns.   Along with the canisters, we also sampled air through solid adsorbent cartridges to examine a lower volatility range of chemical compounds, i.e., semi-volatile compounds, which are not typically recoverable from the stainless flasks.   In the laboratory, the samples were analyzed on several different instruments and complementary detectors (mass spectrometry, flame ionization, electron capture) to better characterize the complex composition of the emissions.   In most samples, hundreds of compounds could be identified, and a subset of those is being evaluated for quantitative estimates of chemical composition.   The NSF support for this project basically covered the travel costs for the field experiment, and the initial laboratory analysis.   Detailed analysis of the individual samples is still on-going.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/06/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elliot Atlas"
