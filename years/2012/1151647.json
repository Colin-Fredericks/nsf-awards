Prof. Landes and her research group will develop and apply state of the art single molecule spectroscopic techniques for understanding and controlling transport in charged polymer membranes. The research is thus focused on the water/membrane interface, and will address questions such as how molecules move in charged and crowded environments. The ultimate goal is to be able to predict and control heterogeneous processes in interfacial materials at the molecular scale.  \r\n\r\nThe chemical systems to be studied have direct relevance to the heterogeneous phenomena that occur at the environmental water/soil interface. The project will increase our understanding of how molecular-scale dynamics relate to macro-scale interfacial properties. These topics relate to general large-scale issues such as a future shortage of clean energy and water, and more directly to separations and water purification applications.  Students working on this project will receive an excellent educational opportunity because it represents an interdisciplinary research project that relates chemistry, physics, materials science and environmental science.",
