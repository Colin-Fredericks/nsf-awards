 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collisionless plasma is a fully ionized gas in which electromagnetic forces are \r\nstrong enough to dominate collisional effects. The motion of a high temperature, \r\nlow density collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a \r\nnonlinear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this setting \r\ncollisions are neglected while the charge and current densities, which drive the \r\nMaxwell system, are determined in a self-consistent manner from velocity \r\nmoments of solutions to the Vlasov equation. The major question to be studied is \r\nthis: are there shocks in a collisionless plasma? That is, could a singularity develop \r\nfrom smoothly prescribed initial values as time progresses? In some cases, such as \r\nin lower dimensional, relativistic formulations (e.g., one space and two velocity \r\nvariables), smooth global solutions are known to exist.  Another problem to be \r\ninvestigated concerns the long-time behavior of the charge and current densities \r\nand electromagnetic fields in the system.  More specifically, do dispersive effects \r\nin the equations cause these quantities to decay over time, or is there sufficient \r\ninteraction so as to sustain their strength even as time tends to infinity?\r\n\r\nKinetic Theory includes the study of the motion and properties of plasma. Plasmas \r\nare often referred to as the fourth state of matter (after solids, liquids and gases) \r\nand account for 99.99% of all material in the universe. They are of great practical \r\ninterest because they are charged gases, and thus serve as excellent conductors of \r\nelectricity. As an example, plasma engines have been developed by a number of \r\nspace agencies and recently used to power some NASA spacecraft. Additionally, \r\nthe use of plasmas through nuclear fusion as a source of clean energy is currently \r\nof immense scientific interest.  Notable examples of collisionless plasmas include \r\nthe solar wind, the Earth's ionosphere, galactic nebulae, low-density fusion \r\nreactors, and comet tails. A complete understanding of the solar wind would also \r\nbe extremely useful, as this natural phenomenon dictates the intensity of \"space \r\nweather\", which is often responsible for expensive damage to satellites orbiting \r\nthe Earth. The motion of a plasma is described by a number of complicated \r\ndifferential equations dictated by physics. Among the goals of the current project \r\nare to show that these equations possess solutions (under appropriate conditions), \r\ndetermine their qualitative behavior, and approximate them computationally so \r\nthat one can predict behavior in future situations with certainty.",
