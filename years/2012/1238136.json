 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving student performance in science through adoption of a \"citizen science\" model supported by teacher professional development, which also cultivates \"action research\" skills. The lead partner is Bowling Green State University with additional core partners being the Perkins Local Schools and the Sandusky City Schools. Supporting partners are The Ohio State University Stone Lab, University of Toledo, Owens Community College, Lourdes University, The Toledo Zoo, Metroparks of the Toledo Area, and the Erie County Soil and Water Conservation District. \r\n\r\nKey innovations are: 1) students and teachers in grades 3 through 8 participate in science research projects led by professional scientists in association with a variety of community and higher education partners; 2) teachers learn how to lead students in science research by participating in a rigorous 3-year program of professional development as members of Professional Learning Communities; 3) teachers and students learn to lead through publication of their findings to their peers, to their local communities, and to the professional science community; and 4) teachers adopt efficient strategies for differentiating instruction to maximize learning for all students. The primary research questions focus on how student engagement and motivation relate to achievement of rigorous learning outcomes and to what degree classroom participation in citizen science research improves motivation, engagement, and achievement. The instructional innovations directly impact learning for more than 6,000 students in grades 3 through 8.\r\n\r\nThe findings of iEvolve with STEM are being broadly disseminated as Bowling Green State University is the administrative home for the Northwest Ohio Center for Excellence (NWO), a coalition of five institutions of higher education, a large number of school districts, and a variety of non-profit organizations and businesses devoted to or involved in STEM in diverse ways. The project vision is part of a larger, more comprehensive vision for the entire 29 county region of northwest Ohio.",

Data collection sites should be chosen that are easily accessible given the resources available to the class.\n\n3. CS projects should be planned and implemented in collaboration with professional scientists and other key stakeholders (e.g., teachers, school administrators, community members).\n\nThe professional scientists who guided and supported teacher and student participation in CS provided these recommendations.\n\n1)    Stakeholders (e.g., teachers, scientists, administrators) should facilitate consideration of academic standards, district- and school-based curricular priorities, and existing instructional materials in CS when designing and implementing CS.\n\n2)    CS work should have relevance to the local community to inspire student interest and commitment as well as community support.\n\n3)    CS work should be connected to broader science research initiatives (e.g., GLOBE, Monarch Watch), which play meaningful and interactive roles with CS project participants.\n\n4)    Professional lead scientists should be highly engaged with project work, providing guidance to teachers and students, and adjusting their emphases as teacher and student capabilities develop.\n\n5)    Teachers should be highly motivated to integrate CS into their science instruction and routinely relate CS work to diverse topics across the established curriculum. \n\n6)    CS work should be meaningful (not just procedural) to teachers and students.  In particular, teachers and students should understand how the data they collect are relevant in their investigations and therefore why the data collection methods are important.\n\n7)    CS should be a part of the culture of participating schools and appreciated and supported at the district level.\n\n8)    The CSR program should be designed to improve student understanding of science content and practices.\n\nMultiple articles have been and are being prepared for publication about these findings to inform the adoption of this promising mode of science learning in schools. The long term goal is to enliven science learning, make it relevant to students, inspire them with its promise, equip them with powerful tools for its practice, and thereby to achieve widespread improvement in the understanding and appreciation of the power of scientific inquiry for developing human knowledge and informing decision making.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/23/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William R Midden"
