  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCombinatorial representation theory is an exciting area of mathematics that has intersections with many other subfields (for example, number theory and physics).  The goal is to understand abstract algebraic objects through concrete combinatorial entities, which may be easier to model or enumerate.\n\nThe objectives of this project were to (1) conduct mathematical research in the area of combinatorial representation theory, (2) teach courses at a variety of different levels, (3) mentor students interested in mathematics, and (4) disseminate research through papers and talks.  While an NSF postdoctoral fellow at MIT, the PI single-authored several research papers in different topics in combinatorial representation theory.  She met regularly with her mentor to discuss ongoing research projects and received a lot of useful advice about career development.  At MIT, she taught introductory undergraduate courses such as calculus and differential equations, as well as more advanced courses such as combinatorial analysis and a topics class.  She also served as a co-organizer of MIT's combinatorics seminar.  This involved recruiting speakers from all over the country to give talks on active and exciting areas of research.  She mentored younger women interested in mathematics through a local area program.  Finally, she gave several seminar and conference talks on the research mentioned above.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/07/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vidya Venkateswaran"
