Collaborating with industry will allow large area prototype to be fabricated and evaluted for display applications. \r\nThe intellectual merit is to exploit resonance effect of nanophotonic elements for energy efficiency spectrum filtering, and can be made compatible with LCD operation. Non-transmitted light can be recycled. An energy harvesting scheme is also proposed by integrating photovoltaic function into the display color filters that can harvest the ambient light and/or the backlight energy. The metal wire grid acting as transparent electrode provide multiple functions in such photovoltaic-integrated display system. \r\nThe broader impacts are to develop transformative new technology and education program that will benefit the flat panel display and photovoltaics fields. Technologies that can provide significantly improved energy efficiency are in high demand in our world today. The proposed research provides  a paradigm change to the spectrum filters used in display and imaging systems, and points to a new direction to harvest energy for mobile computing applications. The research component of this research will be enhanced by the integration of the education and outreach components.",
