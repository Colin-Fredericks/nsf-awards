 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description: This computational and experimental research project aims to answer several fundamental questions in the Au-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid growth of Ge and Si nanowires. In particular, what mechanisms control kinking of nanowires and how does metastable hexagonal-close packed Au form when growth terminates? A three-dimensional continuum phase field model connects atomistic simulations and experimental observations, which use both ex-situ and in-situ characterization methods, and a rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition system. The project also investigates methods of controlling growth to avoid defects and to facilitate synthesis of abrupt doped junctions and axial Si-Ge heterostructures.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: This project has a broader impact on a wide range of materials research problems in which a close connection between atomistic modeling and experiments is desirable. Results of this project provide lecture materials on atomistic simulations, thermodynamics and kinetic processes in materials synthesis. The project engages undergraduates through summer research. The science education outreach activity introduces San Jose-area high-school students to crystal growth concepts through interactive Android Apps based on a two-dimensional phase field model.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\nSemiconductor nanowires are key building blocks of future electronic devices.  This project has focused on understanding defects that can occur during growth of these nanowires.  In particular, we have studied how nanowires of the semiconductor germanium kink &ndash; suddenly change their growth direction.  \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the closely coupled computational and experimental approaches to elucidate the fundamental processes responsible for structural transitions during nanowire growth.   We developed a novel 3D phase field model for simulating shape changes during nanowire growth.  The simulation successfully captured two types of kinking observed in our experiments, and helped clarify their formation mechanisms.  Type I kinking occurs predominantly around 20 nm due to equal preference of &lt;111&gt; and &lt;110&gt; growth.  Type II occurs in thicker nanowires due to shrinking top surface area of nanowires due to incorrect side wall facet formation.   This shows kinking can be avoided by controlling the diameter and initial side wall facets of nanowire as it grows upward from its substrate. \n\n\nThis project has a broader impact in the field of multi-scale modeling by showing how experiments and modeling complement each other to make scientific discoveries. It also impacts the worldwide efforts among academic and industrial research to synthesize semiconductor nanowires controllably and the development of emergying nanowire-based technologies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wei Cai"
