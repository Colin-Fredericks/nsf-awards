 "awd_abstract_narration": "Furman University is directing a science-based scholarship program through the NSF S-STEM funding mechanism providing 15-21 financial aid awards of up to $40,000/student over a period of five years. The need for such a science-focused initiative targeting South Carolina students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups is acute, as enrollment of African-American students in public K-12 schools approaches 40%, but the annual number of Ph.D. awards in STEM fields within this group is historically less than 5%. In this context, Furman has an outstanding record of matriculating undergraduates from all backgrounds into STEM-based graduate programs, and the SOAR (Science Opportunities, Activities and Resources) Scholars initiative provides critical support for students for whom the cost of attendance would be a hardship. A primary goal of this award is thus establishing Furman as a financially accessible option to a larger fraction of talented students, particularly those from regional underserved and/or URM populations. Furman's S-STEM SOAR Scholars are students expressing intent to major in Chemistry or Biology, recruited and selected based on financial need, demonstrated academic merit, and outcomes from on-campus interviews.  SOAR Scholars are benefitting from a host of program activities including a mandatory pre-college bridge experience offered immediately prior to the freshman year, weekly interdisciplinary seminars, opportunities for science-based community outreach through established programs directed at disadvantaged populations, and guaranteed placement into (optional) on-campus paid summer research experiences. Additional supporting mechanisms aimed at sustaining high rates of retention and graduation among SOAR Scholars include peer mentoring programs, regular meetings with permanently assigned secondary advisors, free on-campus tutoring and the active participation of Furman's Office of Multicultural Affairs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe SOAR (Science Opportunities, Activities and Resources) Program successfully recruited 28 financially challenged, academically talented students at Furman University; a research-active liberal arts college.  Through a novel multi-year, multi-faceted program (including a pre-college experience and guaranteed opportunity to participate in undergraduate research), 20 students have matriculated with STEM degrees, 4 have matriculated in allied fields (Psychology, Health Sciences and Education), one has graduated with a degree in music and the remaining three are on track to graduate (on-time) with STEM degrees in 2019/2020 (100% graduation rate). \n\nBeginning with our 5-day pre-college bridge program SAFE (Starting an Amazing Furman Experience) Passage, SOAR Scholars experienced a preview of college expectations and rigor through curricular introduction to five courses and broad exposure to research within the chemistry and biology departments.  Sharing academic, social and team-building activities provided a \"head-start\" for our scholars (as self-reported through external evaluation).  Secondary advising, provided for every SOAR Scholar, as well as ongoing social activities throughout the freshman year, enabled these students to endure the challenges inherent in the transition to college often magnified for those pursuing a STEM degree. \n\nFurman University prides itself on being one of the most research-intensive undergraduate institutions in the nation.  While not requiring research experiences for our Scholars (per NSF guidelines) these opportunities were shared broadly, and of the twenty matriculated S-STEM Scholars with STEM degrees, 18 completed one or more ten week summer research experiences.  Of these 18, fourteen completed multiple summers of research, with 6 completing three summer of research.  Two of these 6 early-and-often research students were awarded prestigious NSF graduate fellowships during their senior year at Furman.\n\nIntellectual Merit   Furman?s first S-STEM award merged an exemplary research culture with a holistic model of engagement (including a pre-college experience) for financially challenged students from the southeast, supported through to matriculation of 20 STEM graduates, (19 from Furman University), with a total of 22 STEM graduates by 2020.  Over 35 student presentations were delivered at regional and national meetings; two presentation were delivered at international scientifc meetings and two students received the prestigious NSF Graduate fellowship award.  These STEM graduates are pursuing graduate school (9), professional school (4), STEM careers (4), National Lab Positions (2) and HS STEM teaching (Peace Corp; Liberia).  Sharing the results of this novel holistic model will occur at national meetings (including 2018 BCCE).\n\nBroader Impacts   Beyond the overall success of our program, nearly one-third of our SOAR Scholars are from minority groups underrepresented in the sciences at an institution with an overall URM demographic &lt; 10%.  The Furman program has been equally successful in supporting all students (including URM) to matriculation, with 7 URM scholars out of the 22 STEM graduates including one awarded a prestigious NSF graduate fellowship. \n\nIn 2017, Furman University unveiled The Furman Advantage which guarantees every student an unparalleled education combining classroom learning with real-world experiences and self-discovery. This integrated four-year pathway, guided by a diverse community of mentors, prepares students for lives of purpose and accelerated career and community impact.  Elements of our SOAR Scholars program (specifically the pre-college experience and our early-and-often approach to research) are informing the broader Furman initiatives housed within The Furman Advantage.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John G Kaup"
