 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Lauren Neala Holder of Texas A&M University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Arsenic availability in Taiwan soils as a function of the underlying changes in geology,\" during the summer of 2012 at National Taiwan University in Taipai.  The host scientist is Dr. Dar-Yan Lee.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to determine the impact of weathering upon arsenic speciation in soil. Arsenic concentrations are expected to change as a function of the underlying geology and the soils should reflect the mineralogy of geologic units to produce varying arsenic speciation. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
