 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to commercialize an engineered peptide, ADP5, that rapidly catalyzes remineralization of the teeth. This peptide and its derivatives are envisioned to be the active ingredients in a broad-range of dental products that will drastically improve dental care. ADP5 was derived through biocombinatorial selection using peptide libraries and then tailored via bioinformatic design using naturally occurring biomineralization proteins in mineralized dental tissues. Existing products in dental care are either inadequate in restoring the mineral loss, the basis of major dental health problems, or only mask the side effects caused by the loss of mineral, such as hypersensitivity. Based on the I-Corps' team's previous interdisciplinary research, involving molecular biology, periodontics, bioinformatics, and materials science, designing a peptide that is capable of reversing and repairing demineralized tooth surfaces has now been proven possible. \r\n\r\nIn spite of widespread use of fluoride in public water supplies, dental caries and hypersensitive teeth remain a prevalent health care problem in both the aging population as well as in children exposed to high sugar diets. If successful, the widespread use of biomineralization peptides could prevent and treat early stage dental caries and, in addition, can be used on hypersensitive teeth to promote remineralization, thus repairing areas where the nerves are exposed via open dental tubules. The team's ultimate goal, through this I-Corps program, is to develop a commercialization plan for a viable start-up company for dental health products.  Through the I-Cops curriculum, the team aims first to identify commercially-viable product lines in dental care, develop a network of commercial partners (in product development as well as licensing), and get trained on the commercialization concepts (e.g., identifying potential customers such as dental clinics and consumer product companies; establishing a network of interactions; and developing a business plan canvas for the formation of a startup company.",
