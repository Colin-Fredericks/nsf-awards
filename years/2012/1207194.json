 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will use gauged Floer theory to study non-displaceability of\r\nLagrangian tori in possibly open symplectic manifolds via\r\ncompactifications such as symplectic toric orbifolds, and compare with\r\nresults of McDuff on displaceability.  With F. Ziltener, his former\r\npostdoctoral advisee E. Gonzalez, and his current student Sushmita\r\nVenugopalan the PI will study the quantum cohomology of quotients and\r\nrelationships with gauged Gromov-Witten theory.  In particular he will\r\n(a) prove a quantum version of Kalkman's wall-crossing formula which\r\ngoverns the behavior of Gromov-Witten invariants under variation of\r\nsymplectic quotient and proves birational equivalence under crepant\r\nflops in many cases, as conjectured by Ruan (b) find presentations of\r\nquantum cohomology rings of symplectic quotients such as toric\r\norbifolds and quiver varieties.  With K. Wehrheim and his former\r\nstudent S. Ma'u the PI will continue to study holomorphic quilts,\r\nfunctoriality of Lagrangian correspondences in Floer-Fukaya theory,\r\nand relationship with low-dimensional topology.  In particular, the PI\r\nwill prove the A-infinity version and the exact triangle for fibered\r\nDehn twists.\r\n\r\nThese research projects will improve our understanding of symplectic\r\ngeometry, which is a mathematical framework for understanding\r\nclassical mechanics, particularly for time-dependent energy functions.\r\nMany of these projects are related to the behavior of\r\nsymplectic invariants under the operation of symplectic reduction in\r\nwhich the number of degrees of freedom of a system is reduced by using\r\nsymmetry.  These invariants also appear in the study of\r\nquantum-mechanical ``sigma models'' by physicists, who\r\nhave made a number or predictions about their behavior under\r\nsymplectic reduction, some of which will be verified and generalized\r\nas part of the project.  The project on holomorphic quilts will have\r\napplications to our understanding of three- and four-dimensional\r\nspaces, especially invariants constructed using gauge theories which\r\nare conjectured (and in some cases known) to have symplectic\r\ninterpretations.  The PI will also continue his involvement with middle\r\nschool mathematics teachers.",
