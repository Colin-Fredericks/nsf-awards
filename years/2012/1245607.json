 "awd_abstract_narration": "This fifth annual \"2013 Graduate Student mini-Conference in Computational Mathematics\" will be held at Clemson University on February 8 and 9, 2013. Topics covered in the conference consist of recent advances in the theory and implementation of numerical methods for partial differential equations, including multiphase flow in porous media, numerical methods for stochastic PDEs, turbulence fluid dynamics, climate simulation and PDE constrained optimization. Aside from one plenary speaker, all talks will be given by graduate students.\r\n\r\nApproximately twenty graduate students from Clemson, Virginia Tech, the University of Pittsburgh, Auburn University, the University of Tennessee, Florida State University and Emory University will present scientific research talks involving mathematical modeling in science and engineering, and rigorous analysis and efficient implementation of numerical methods for the modeling equations. The goals of the conference are to give graduate students an opportunity to give a professional scientific talk, and to bring graduate students and researchers together to discuss collaborative research projects and to exchange new ideas in many challenging research areas.  The conference organizers strongly encourage participation of under-represented groups.",
