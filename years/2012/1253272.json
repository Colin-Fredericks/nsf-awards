These peptide tags, when incorporated into engineered antibodies, will permit the development of integrated, miniaturized electrochemical sensors that can be multiplexed with minimal sample pretreatment. Such electrochemical sensors, which will ultimately be miniaturized for rapid, on-site analysis, would have the capacity for rapid, simultaneous detection of multiple environmental contaminants, serum biomarkers, or analytes of concern for homeland security.\r\n",
