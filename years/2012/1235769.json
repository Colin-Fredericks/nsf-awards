 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-1235769\r\nPI: Fleischer\r\n\r\nMany sustainable or alternative energy systems such as large scale solar energy plants provide a surplus of energy at certain times (when the sun is shining) but much less at other times (such as at night). If the plants can be designed to store the surplus energy for use during times of decreased supply, the plant will operate more economically and efficiently.  This will be even more beneficial if the plants can respond to rapid changes in energy requirements by using stored energy to meet this demand.  This research project focuses on the use of phase change materials for large scale energy storage.  Phase change materials store energy inside the material itself as it melts.  As the material melts, energy is needed to release the bonds as the material transitions from solid to liquid.  This energy is absorbed from the surroundings and is stored.  When the material later solidifies, this stored energy is released from the material and can be used. The only down side to phase change material energy storage is that most existing phase change materials have characteristics that prevent a quick energy transfer response.  Thus this project is focused on designing and creating improved phase change energy storage materials by improving the characteristics of the material to allow rapid storage of energy, and rapid release again upon demand. This will be done by embedding graphite nanofibers in the material and then controlling the motion of the nanofibers to provide a continuous path for the energy to penetrate into the material. The first layer of nanoparticles will be anchored at the surface and the remaining nanofibers will create a matrix of energy paths connected to these initial anchor points. The researchers will then extend this development such that the materials can be tailored for specific applications by creating controlled nanofibers networks with electrical and magnetic field control.  The ability to control and manipulate nanofiber motion to tailor thermal properties has the potential to be truly transformational in the field. \r\n\r\nEnergy storage though solid-liquid phase change is a wide-reaching technology that can be utilized in many applications.  These applications include a wide range of sustainable technologies not just including solar energy systems, but also high efficiency heating and air conditioning systems, domestic hot water, and advanced building materials. Phase change materials can also be used to absorb heat and provide thermal control for portable electronics and communication systems.  This study addresses a key weakness in phase change material technologies, and the successful execution of this project will enable greater implementation of sustainable technologies. The research undertaken in this project will provide educational opportunities for several graduate students and the researchers will use the solar energy system designs to enhance an existing engineering outreach project used to introduce middle school girls, particularly those from underrepresented minorities to engineering. This outreach project is executed through a partnership with Girl Scouts of Eastern Pennsylvania.",

These findings are summarized here:\n\nNanoparticle enhanced PCMs were known to exhibit increased thermal conductivity, but previous work showed that they have decreased energy storage. This project showed that while the thermal energy storage decreases in some nanoparticle composites, in others, particularly graphene based composites, thermal energy storage increases. This may be due to alignment of paraffin molecules in close proximity to graphene nanoparticles, resulting in a more crystalline paraffin structure at the graphene-paraffin interface. \nThe increase in thermal conductivity of graphene nanocomposite PCMs was found to be independent of the thermal conductivity of the graphene nanoparticle, but dependent on the mechanical compliance. Thinner graphene nanoparticles exhibited a high number of interfaces due to folding, adversely affecting the overall thermal performance.\nNanoparticles with smaller diameters were found to produce PCMs with lower thermal conductivities than nanoparticles with larger diameters even though the smaller diameters have higher intrinsic thermal conductivities. This is due to the increase in phonon scattering at the interface as the contact area between nanoparticles decreases.  \n\nAgglomeration of nanoparticles in spherical clusters was found to be detrimental to the bulk thermal conductivity of nano-enhanced PCM.  Agglomeration in linear chains, however, was found to increase bulk conductivity in certain cases including small aspect ratios and  high nanoparticle thermal conductivity values.\nThe structure of the nanoparticle was found to have a major impact on bulk thermal conductivity, and agglomeration effects.  Ribbon GNFs offer a significantly higher nano-enhancement than platelet or herringbone GNFs, with more additional enhancement potential from linear chain agglomeration.\nThe controlled application of an electric fields can influence the orientation and motion of nano-particles in liquid PCM.  Under an electric field of &gt;100V/mm, CNTs form well-aligned linearly agglomerated percolation networks, which are the most beneficial for thermal transport.\nMultiphysics modeling show that nanoparticle settling is due to the presence of convection patterns during the freezing portion of the melt/freeze cycle.  \nNanoparticle networks (graphene aerogels) treated with atomic layer depositions (ALD) showed a significant strength increase leading to an effective nanostructured material. ALD-treated NAs can be stiffened by a factor of 30 and hardened by a factor of 150.
