 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stressors to native species under global change:  Invasive species as vectors of infectious disease\r\n\r\nAs climate change progresses, invasive species will play an increasingly prominent role in mediating the spread of infectious diseases around the world.  This research will investigate the role of invasive bullfrogs in spreading chytridiomycosis via the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) to native amphibian populations.  Invasive bullfrog populations now occur in numerous countries, and they compete with or prey on native frog species.  In addition, bullfrogs are resistant to Bd and act as vectors in spreading Bd to native populations.  This research will combine observational field studies with controlled laboratory experiments to disentangle the effects of invasive bullfrogs and Bd infection on native frogs, providing a framework for evaluating the potential for invasive species to serve as disease vectors.  Moreover, the approach taken here is broadly applicable to other combinations of stressors, species pairs, and regions of the world, and will be particularly relevant as climate change broadly affects native-invasive and host-pathogen interactions in systems around the world.\r\n\r\nApproaches to broadening participation in ecological research will include an educational outreach program for high-school students and a training workshop for their teachers.  These programs will give students and teachers the opportunity to form their own hypotheses, design a study to test those hypotheses, collect field data, analyze results, and present their studies to peers.  The course for high school students will provide a valuable opportunity for students to conduct their own ecological research in the unique Sierra Nevada ecosystem, and the teacher workshop will build the content knowledge necessary to incorporate ecological research into high school learning objectives.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) causes chytridiomycosis, a skin disease that is fatal in frogs and which has been implicated in the decline of amphibian populations worldwide.  Strains of Bd differ in virulence and their effect on frogs, but the underlying cause of virulence differences are unknown.  We used next-generation sequencing to sequence the genomes of pairs of Bd strains that are closely related but differ in virulence.  We found that more virulent Bd strains tend to have more copies of their chromosomes than less virulent strains.  Conversely, copies of chromosomes can also be lost over short time-scales when Bd is maintained in the lab, and this loss of chromosome copies corresponds with a loss of virulence in laboratory cultures of Bd.  Understanding the mechanisms driving pathogenicity in Bd is critical for targeting conservation resources at the most vulnerable frog populations.\n\nThe outreach component of this award took place at the White Earth Indian Reservation\u00c6s Summer Math and Science Academy, which is designed to supplement math, science, and technology education for American Indian primary students.  By bringing together professional scientists, Reservation teachers, and tribal elders as instructors, and leading hands-on science and math activities designed within the context of traditional knowledge, we expose students to STEM career options and encourage them to pursue a college education.  Importantly, the classes we lead are all culturally relevant, which shows students that they can make a meaningful contribution to their community by earning a college degree in math or science and subsequently have a career working within the reservation community.  Therefore, the outreach component of my research helps to develop the confidence and math and science competency of American Indian students to enable them to perform well in high school and college STEM courses.  This is a key step in developing human resources in science, math, and technology of American Indian communities.  During my time at White Earth, I led classes on climate change, invasive species, migration ecology, and local herpetology.\n\nI have also initiated a new research program focusing on lizard communities along elevational gradients to understand the capacity of behavior, evolution, and geographic range shifts to compensate for climate change.  Lizards living at different elevations experience different climates, and are locally adapted to those climates.  The traits that differ between elevations, and maintain local adaptation to different climates, are also the traits most likely to allow lizards to adapt over time to a warming climate.  Understanding how lizards are spatially adapted to different climates at present will provide insight into how lizards are likely to respond to climate change over time.  I am also developing a method to continuously record basking behavior in wild populations of lizards.  Accurate, small-scale data on thermoregulatory behavior are lacking in the literature, but are essential for predicting the ability of lizards to respond to climate change.  In the future, I plan to expand this research by including small mammals, insects, and cacti and thereby study the capacity of an entire community to respond to climate change.  Finally, for traits found to be important in responding to climate change, I will investigate whether those traits are conserved across other taxa and communities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeanine M Refsnider"
