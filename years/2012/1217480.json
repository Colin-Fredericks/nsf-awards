 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using archaeological evidence that includes stone tools, animal and plant remains, and household architecture, Lisa Michelle Smith will examine cultural impacts of European colonization on indigenous peoples of the Middle Fraser Canyon in British Columbia during the period of ca. 150-500 before present. This work will be conducted under the direction of Dr. Anna Prentiss as part of Ms. Smith's dissertation research. Middle Fraser Canyon villages peaked in size and social complexity by ca. 1100-1200 before present, after which time they were abandoned for 500-600 years and then reoccupied in the centuries just prior to the coming of Europeans to the region.  Ethnographers of the early 20th century working in the Middle Fraser area describe a complex hunting and gathering society with social class distinctions, private ownership of property and resources, and extensive trade networks controlled by elites.  However it is not clear whether these cultural characteristics developed uniquely during the early contact period or if they are a holdover from the time pre-dating 1000 years ago.  This proposed research seeks to address this problem by conducting archaeological investigations of households at the S7i7stkn (Little Pit House) and Bridge River sites, two housepit villages located within close proximity of each other, situated on narrow terraces in the Bridge River valley.  A single house from each site will be excavated, each with prehistoric and historic occupations.  Ms. Smith's research will address in particular the role European contact may have played in the development of complex socioeconomic and political structures of indigenous households during the critical, yet under researched, early colonial period. \r\n\r\nAlthough the effects of colonialism on Mid-Fraser households are widely unknown, archaeological research of social complexity during the late prehistoric period, prior to 1200 years before present, continues to be informed by ethnographic data.  This proposed research will provide opportunity to reconstruct characteristics of the political and socioeconomic structures associated with population influx and development of the fur trade economy, allowing for more fine-grained understanding of social complexity during the late prehistoric and historic periods. More broadly this work will enhance understanding of hunter-gatherer households and evolutionary processes associated with emergent social complexity.  It will investigate the role of individual decision making and the effects it had on creating social ranking, regional trade networks, and the development of privately owned property.  This work will also add to discussions of the viability of using ethnographic literature as a tool for directly interpreting archaeological data from the deeper prehistoric past.\r\n\r\nDr. Prentiss has had a twenty-year collaborative relationship with local Mid-Fraser communities.  This project will be a continuation of that program, offering educational benefits to First Nations students through training in archaeological excavation techniques.  This will allow them to directly engage with their heritage and contribute to creating narratives of their past.  University of Montana students will also take part in this research allowing them to engage in the local community, participating in activities such as a Lillooet language program, educational talks, and award winning Xwisten heritage tours. This will inform discussions on how to build strong relationships between archaeologists and native people and help create a new generation of archaeologists that understand the value of collaborative research. Additionally, this work will add to the body of literature regarding complex hunter-gatherer and colonial studies and educate the general public about First Nations history and culture.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award permitted Anna Prentiss and Lisa Smith to conduct archaeological research at the S7i7stkn site, a late prehistoric pithouse village located in the Middle Fraser region of British Columbia.  All excavations took place in Housepit 1 (HP1), the largest house in the village.  Radiocarbon dates obtained through this award confirmed that HP 1 had two occupations, both of which occurred just prior to the fur trade, during ca. 1610 and 1650 CE, respectively.   During both occupations families participated in hunting-fishing-and-gathering activities, utilizing local varieties of berries, seeds, shellfish, birds, and mammals; but their main subsistence resources were salmon and deer.  Day-to-day activities were conducted in communal, rather than, private spaces; and food remains were distributed evenly across the house floors and in the storage caches, suggesting that occupants had equal access to food resources.    \n\nData from Housepit 54 (HP 54) of the neighboring Bridge River village were also used for this research.  HP 54 was a long lived house with occupations spanning the late prehistoric and contact periods.  For this investigation we focused on the contact period occupation, which dates to the fur trade, ca. 1850 to 1858 CE.  Domestic patterns of HP 54 were similar to HP 1.  Daily activities were performed in communal spaces and subsistence was focused mainly on salmon and deer resources, which appear to have been accessible to all families.  The occupants used some European items such as glass trade beads and buttons, but for the most part, adaptation of Western goods and technologies was minimal. \n\n Preliminary assessments of these data suggest that households in the Mid-Fraser were egalitarian just before and after the onset of the fur trade. These patterns contrast sharply with ethnographic literature from the region, which state that the societies were stratified and marked by private ownership of fishing rocks and deer fences.  We do not see evience for internal ranking within HPs 1 or 54 and it raises the possibility that ranking was not strongly manifested until later, perhaps during the gold rush of the 1860s. \n\nSocial ranking did occur in earlier prehistory in the Mid-Fraser around 700-950 CE; and archaeologists frequently use ethnographic literature as a way to interpret data from this period.  Our findings suggest the society was not continuously ranked from 700 CE until contact.  Each period may have been qualitatively different from the other, implying it may not be suitable to use ethnographic descriptions as direct analogies for the deeper past.  It is possible that social patterns of the more ancient past were deeply rooted in public memory even after they ceased to exist on a material level but were rematerialized in a similar fashion later during the gold rush.    \n\n Intellectual Merit:\n\nThis research offers provocative results regarding the evolution of social organization within complex fisher-forager societies.  It is clear that social organization changed over time in the Middle Fraser and not necessarily in a linear developmental pattern. This suggests that archaeologists studying emergent inequality elsewhere around the world should still look for directional change, but also extinctions, reversals, and independent inventions.   Further, they should be very cautious with the use of ethnographic analogies.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nDuring the field season University of Montana students had the unique opportunity to work collaboratively with the Stl\u00c6atl\u00c6imx community. This project also gave Stl\u00c6atl\u00c6imx students and volunteers the opportunity to directly engage with their heritage through archaeological research.\n\nExcavations of HP 1 were led by Ms. Smith with fulltime assistance of two University of Montana students.  Through this research many others had the chance to learn archaeological field methods, including 8 University of Montana students and 5 students from the Stl\u00c6atl\u00c6imx community who are ..."
