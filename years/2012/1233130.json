We plan to \r\ndevelop a broad array of tools  (invariant manifolds, \r\nvariational methods, numerical analysis) in such a way that they \r\ncan work together. We are particularly interested in applications \r\nto instability in dynamical systems and to global behavior in elliptic\r\npartial differential equations and in coupled networks. \r\n\r\nMany of the laws of nature are formulated as local interactions. \r\nOne point in space and time affects only its close neighborhood. \r\nIt can happen that these local interactions cancel each other \r\nout so that the global \r\neffect is small and that the systems remain kind of unaffected or it can \r\nhappen that the local interactions reinforce each other and\r\nlead to large scale effects. The two alternatives do \r\nhappen and they depend on very subtle effects (e.g. rather\r\ndeep and abstract number theory is the key to very measurable effects). \r\nEven if the importance of the \r\nhas been recognized by applied mathematicians for centuries, it is \r\nonly very recently that a rich enough toolkit has been developed  by many \r\nstart tackling it. Different people, \r\nhave been making different techniques to \r\nwork together, and they have started producing results. \r\nAs a witness to the interest, the PI of this \r\nproposal  has\r\nbeen co-organizer of special semesters in CRM (Barcelona) Fall 2008 \r\nand Fields institute (Spring 2011). \r\n",
