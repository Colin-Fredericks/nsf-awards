As a land-grant institution, Texas A&M University is committed to the preservation and enhancement of its existing herbaria as an integral component of the university's core mission.  This project will consolidate three existing botany-based research collections on the College Station Campus of Texas A&M University.  Each of these collections are committed to transferring research products to the general public through active service and extension programs, promoting collections based research in their respective fields, and preserving extant collections for future generations.  The consolidation of these collections will assemble and preserve a diverse and comprehensive botanical collection of approximately 320,000 specimens and thereby facilitate improvements in education, outreach, and research efforts at multiple scales.  \r\n\r\nThis consolidation project will provide numerous opportunities to recruit, educate, and employ graduate and undergraduate students from differing under-represented groups.  Diverse user groups: student workers, adult learners, and disadvantaged students, will benefit from direct exposure to these unique resources and the knowledge base possessed by researchers working in these collections.  Reaching beyond the local utilization of these collections, updated and expanded web content will provide a comprehensive and easily accessible resource for educators, researchers, law enforcement interests, and others worldwide.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFrom a practical perspective, the primary objective of this project was to ensure preservation of an otherwise orphaned herbarium collection of approximately 45,000 specimens.  Secondarily, the project sought to mobilize a large number of specimen records, and in addition, capture and mobilize digital images of pollen samples from an associated collection on the Texas A&amp;M University Campus in College Station, Texas.  This project was successful in fulfilling these basic goals, in addition to implementing significant upgrades to the extant collection infrastructure and storage capacity.  The substantial funding provided by the grant facilitated the purchase of additional herbarium cabinets, and associated storage materials, which ensured the consolidation of the two herbaria.  Additional effort was directed at reducing the number of specimens per folder, bin, and cabinet to 50% capacity.  This reduction in capacity will safeguard the long-term preservation of specimens, and provide adequate space for collection expansion over the next quarter century. \n\nThis project combined and refined two existing databases from the S. M. Tracy Herbarium (TAES) and the Department of Biology Herbarium (TAMU).  Specimen records have been consolidated, and subsequently edited, resulting in a cumulative database containing ca. 234,000 unique specimen records.  Although individual records vary, most records contain full label data.  The acquisition of a large number of pollen images provides an invaluable reference resource for utilization by wide range of academic and law enforcement entities.  This image database is unique and one of very few of its kind in the world.  Effective identification of species using pollen grains varies according to individual groups.  However, in most cases both polar and equatorial views are required.  The images, obtained using a light microscope, include full color views of pollen grains from differing viewpoints and at differing magnification levels. \n\nThroughout the life of the project, numerous opportunities for outreach and education were available to a wide range of individuals.  These opportunities, both paid and volunteer, involved high school students, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as volunteers from the local community.  A significant emphasis was placed on recruiting, engaging, and retaining individuals from traditionally under-represented groups in the sciences.  Project participants were incorporated into all aspects of the process from basic sorting, organizing, and filing of herbarium sheets, to database editing tasks.  A small percentage of participants possessed adequate plant identification skills and were invaluable in spotting and correcting errors within the collection.  Over the duration of the project, approximately 28 students were employed (undergraduate and graduate) and eight undergraduate students associated with the project continued their education in graduate programs both at Texas A&amp;M University and beyond.  Community volunteers were an important component of the project.  Largely from the local Texas Master Naturalist, Native Plant Society of Texas, and Texas Master Gardener Chapters.  In total, ca. 24 individuals logged over 3500 hours of time on the project.  Two of these volunteers remain active members of the herbarium community at the S. M. Tracy Herbarium.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/16/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dale Kruse"
