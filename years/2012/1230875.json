 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research targets improving the computing environment for important scientific problems without requiring large expensive systems. The objective of this new fundamental research is to perform science domain exploration to broaden the applicability of scalable RC systems and GPUs across other domains and industry sectors that have great computational\r\nneeds; and research methods and develop an infrastructure to enable domain computational scientists (not expert users of accelerators) to use accelerator technologies (based on FPGAs and GPUs) in a productive manner.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of the proposed work have the potential to greatly expand the use of reconfigurable computing for solution of critical [problems in science and engineering. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the centers portfolio through collaboration of two of its sites as well as extend the scope and horizon of the CHREC center research projects and direction, benefiting current industry members while attracting potential new ones. The PIs research will likely impact diverse undergraduate and graduate students at each institution. \r\n",
