 "awd_abstract_narration": "While many view carbon dioxide (CO2) as a waste gas, there exist efforts in many laboratories to use CO2 as a building block and C1 synthon to produce more complex organic molecules.  Most of these ongoing studies utilize rare and expensive late-transition metal complexes as catalysts.  In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) section of NSF's Division of Chemistry, Professor Richard Kemp of the University of New Mexico and his students are examining the fundamental reactions of earth-abundant main group and transition metals to reduce CO2 to more valuable, small organic molecules via electrocatalysis.  The long-term goal is to eventually use a renewable source of electrons (such as wind or solar derived) to re-energize CO2 back into transportation fuel precursors.  If successful, the funded efforts will help lead to a closed carbon loop that allows recycle of CO2 back into transportation fuels for re-use.\r\n\r\nWhile the primary work outputs of this grant will be the trained students and postdoctoral fellows and the published scientific results they generate, the broader impacts of this project extend into environmental chemistry, public policy debate, and the greenhouse gas reduction issue, with long-term implications in the transportation sector as fossil fuels continue to be depleted.  UNM is a minority/Hispanic-serving university, and the PI's group has a long-standing history of educating students from under-represented groups, and aiding their entry into STEM careers.  This tradition is expected to continue during this current funding period, and the interactions between UNM and overseas partners in third world countries will be further expanded.",

Our major focus has been on the main group metals that involve s and p orbitals in their binding to CO2, with limited efforts directed toward the more commonly-used, inexpensive d-block transition metals, primarily first row and similar metals.  During this grant period we have shown the formation of a novel interaction between CO2 and these main group precursor complexes that we have termed \"adducts\".  These adducts bind CO2 in a cooperative fashion in that the precursor metal/ligand complex has both Lewis acid/Lewis base sites to coordinate to the amphoteric CO2 molecule.  While this concept is not entirely novel as it builds upon the \"frustrated Lewis pair\" concept described by Stephan/Erker, we have shown that, importantly and surprisingly, in our work the Lewis acids do not have to be highly acidic nor do the Lewis bases have to extremely bulky.  Accordingly, our complexes are not \"frustrated\" as seen by others; yet, these complexes are still capable of activating small molecules.  Our working hypothesis is that these adducts now contain bent CO2 &ndash; in X-ray crystallography studies we see that the CO2 fragment itself is no longer linear but bent to approximately 130 degrees.  It is our belief that this conversion to a bent structure upon coordination is a key structural feature that allows the CO2 to be reduced to other organic molecules via a facilitated, lower-energy pathway.  The energy needed to overcome bending CO2 from linear to 130 degrees, which is required for producing other organic molecules from CO2, has now been provided by the dual acid/base nature of our adducts.  Interestingly, our CO2 adducts can be bound extremely tightly, extremely transiently and loosely, or most ideally for us &ndash; strong enough to bind CO2 and to characterize the adduct, but not so strongly that the metal complex will not release the products.
