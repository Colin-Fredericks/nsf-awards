Rokicki of University of Florida to conduct a research project, entitled \"Practical implications of the regeneration of ion exchange resins for water treatment\" during the summer of 2012 at the Australian Water Quality Centre in Adelaide, Australia.  The host scientist is Dr. Mary Drikas.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is an investigation of how ion exchange resins from full scale treatment processes are regenerated into the bicarbonate form. Additionally chloride-form and bicarbonate-form resins are being investigated to explain how they preferentially remove certain organic matter fractions. This research provides further insights into the chemistry of ion exchange processes and how they differ with the reuse of resins when in the chloride- or bicarbonate-form.  \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
