 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This symposium will convene researchers in education and the social sciences with practicing STEM professionals to review, explore, and respond to research on identity factors linked to minority male success in science and mathematics. The following topics will be addressed: (1) the impact of minority male gender identity on interest and engagement in science and mathematics, with particular interest in how conceptions of manhood and masculinity are relevant; (2) gender role socialization and implications for teaching and learning of science and mathematics content for minority men and boys; (3) institutional and organizational models and programs (e.g., school design, same-sex classroom) and pathways that influence minority men and boys' interest and entry into science and math majors and careers; and (4) shared interests and goals (e.g., evidence-based initiatives), and collaboration opportunities for researchers and STEM practitioners.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This symposium will serve as a catalyst for focusing on and developing a knowledge base around the educational opportunities and challenges of many minority men and boys. Manuscripts from the symposium will be distributed in a special issue of a major journal focusing on minority men and boys in math and science, as well as through an edited book with national distribution. The symposium will be a significant forum to inspire collaborations and networks among similarly interested researchers and STEM practitioners to potentially development future NSF research grant proposals.",

Elon Dancy\n\nIntellectual Merit:  \n\nThis symposium successfully convened together a group of 30 social science researchers, practicing STEM professionals, and graduate students who are uniquely committed to advancing males of color within the STEM disciplines.   The objectives of this project were to generate, review, and respond to research on identity factors linked to minority males\u00c6 success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  These goals were accomplished by soliciting six commissioned papers that focused on current knowledge as well as emerging empirical and theoretical research in the field. These papers were presented at the symposium followed by peer-reviewed commentary and critique from respected researchers and STEM practitioners.  Respondents\u00c6 comments preceded discussion by the collective of symposium participants. \n\nThe following themes were captured, compiled, and reflect the core findings of the symposium.  First, the impact of minority male gender identity on interest and engagement in STEM was addressed by Dr. Ebony McGee\u00c6s paper entitled Risk and Protective Trajectories in Mathematically Talented Black Male Students:  Snapshots from K through Eighth Grade and Dr. Lloyd Lee\u00c6s paper Din&eacute; Nish (I am Din&eacute;):  Native American Cultural Identity, Masculinities, and Maturation.  McGee\u00c6s qualitative study revealed internal and external protective factors that contribute significantly to Black males\u00c6 success in mathematics.  Based on these findings, she recommended creating accelerated compensatory summer schools programs, interdisciplinary STEM curricula in early school years, and the implementation of student-led STEM campaigns within their communities.  Lee reviewed how the history of colonization and the impact of economic disadvantage continue to influence Native American males\u00c6 masculinities and maturation by casting them into an undervalued social and political role thus disrupting their educational access and identity formation. \n\nSecond, gender role socialization and implications for teaching and learning STEM content to minority males was explored by Dr. Terrell Strayhorn in his paper Factors Influencing Black Males\u00c6 Preparation for College and Success in STEM Majors:  A Mixed Methods Study and by Dr. Odis Johnson is his manuscript Race-Gender Inequality Across Residential and School Contexts:  Implications for Mathematics, Science, and Reading Performance of Black and Latino Males.  Strayhorn identified that sense of belonging was among the most significant factor influencing Black males\u00c6 academic success in STEM fields as well as their college preparation.

Fergus investigated the structure, processes, and practices of single-sex schools serving Black and Latino males and revealed that behavioral, relational, and cognitive engagement were the largest contributors to academic achievement.  Teranishi revealed that Asian American and Pacific Islander students, one the most heterogeneous ethnic groups with profound disparities between degree attainment, participating in the Asian STEM Achievement Project were  to earning more credits, had higher GPAs, and were more likely to ear..."
