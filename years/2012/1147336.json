 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in DNA sequencing have revolutionized the study of microorganisms such as bacteria, revealing their genetic identity and ecological potential. Microbial communities carry out critical processes that regulate the amounts and forms of important nutrients and carbon, which are essential for all ecosystem services on Earth. Results from the first five years of this research program demonstrated that the biodiversity and activity of these communities varies tremendously among environments and over time. Microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functions are controlled (1) by local environmental conditions that affect growth, and (2) by dispersal via wind and water.  However, the relative importance of these factors is still unknown. This research project will characterize these two fundamental controls on the distribution and activity of microbes in Arctic lakes, streams, and soils, and will reveal how seasonal, annual, and long-term shifts in microbial species are affected by climate change. This research will use the data archive of environmental measurements produced by the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER), and will use next-generation DNA sequencing technology to assess microbial community composition and function.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to measure shifts in microbial biodiversity, bacterial respiration, and ecosystem function associated with the current and dramatic environmental changes in the Arctic.  Bacteria and other microbes ultimately control the production and consumption of the heat-trapping gases carbon dioxide and methane. In the Arctic, warming temperatures are thawing permafrost and exposing a vast store of previously-frozen organic carbon in soils. If this carbon is released to the atmosphere as heat-trapping gases the rate of climate warming will increase, further thawing the soils and exposing more carbon to microbial attack. The strength of this positive feedback loop is controlled by bacteria, because their respiration converts the soil carbon to carbon dioxide and methane which is then released to the atmosphere. In addition, this project will contribute to teaching and outreach through the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates and Research Experience for Teachers programs, graduate student and postdoctoral scientist training, and collaboration with the Earth Microbiome Project (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScientific Merit.  Microbial communities are essential contributors to all ecosystem services on Earth, carrying out critical processes that regulate the amounts and forms of important nutrients and carbon.  Advances in technology and DNA sequencing have revolutionized the study of bacteria and other microbes, revealing their genetic identity and ecological potential, and leading to new concepts in microbial biodiversity.  Early studies using these methods suggested that microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functions are controlled by local environmental conditions that affect growth, and by dispersal via wind and water.  What was not clear from these studies was the relative importance of these two factors on different temporal and spatial scales.\n\nThis research project answered the question of how the dynamics of dispersal interact with physiological adaptations of microbes to their environment in interconnected terrestrial and aquatic habitats.  A multi-year study of microbial community composition and growth rate in arctic lakes, streams, and soils on the North Slope of Alaska used a sampling program designed to identify ecological mechanisms driving short-term, long-term, and spatial variability in microbial communities.  This research made use of the environmental data archive produced by the NSF Arctic Long Term Ecological Research program (ARC-LTER) and used next-generation DNA sequencing to assess microbial community composition and function.\n\nThe findings confirmed the original hypothesis that dispersal of microbes from many different habitats on a landscape (the ?landscape metacommunity?) controls the species that inhabit local lakes and streams.  The main findings of this project are: (1) freshwater microbial communities are dominated by taxa that are present but rare in upslope terrestrial environments, suggesting that land acts as a seedbank for freshwater microbial communities; (2) most microbial taxa in streams can be traced to their sources in soils, sediments under streams, and biofilms on stream rocks; (3) microbial communities in arctic lakes followed a repeating, annual cycle of species dominance over fifteen years that tracked seasonal changes in the environment; (4) once microbes have dispersed, organic matter composition, temperature, and nutrient concentrations interact to influence the activity and diversity of microbial communities over time; (5) when exposed to sunlight the organic matter from thawed, permafrost soils becomes more available to microbial degradation.\n\nThe greater use of organic matter in permafrost soils after exposure to sunlight was studied in detail because as the Arctic warms and frozen soils thaw, microbes will convert this organic matter into the greenhouse gas CO2.  This degradation of organic matter depends on (a) the initial response of microbes to organic matter chemistry, (b) how sunlight alters this chemistry, (c) short-term physiological adjustment of microbes to the changes in organic matter, followed by (d) long-term shifts in growth to dominance of the best adapted microbial populations that leads to changes in community composition.  Over these longer time scales microbial communities themselves can alter the chemical composition of organic matter through selective uptake of compounds or the production of enzymes to degrade organic matter.  Thus, this very dynamic ?loop? of controls and interactions involving the original chemistry of organic matter and its alteration by sunlight and microbes operates continuously, and is responsive to changes in the environment or disturbances (e.g., floods) that can reset the system and restart the loop of interactions.\n\nBroader Impacts:  This Arctic LTREB project produced a large, publicly-available dataset of DNA sequences from a broad range of environments including lakes, streams, rivers, sediments, and soils. This project trained three PhD students, two masters students, six undergraduate fellows, four teachers, one Postdoctoral scientist, and six technicians whose professional development is strongly linked to this project, its objectives, and its publications.  These young scientists learned to conduct their own research as part of a larger collaborative effort and were expected to author and co-author publications.\n\nThis work has implications for understanding controls on microbial biodiversity and its relationship with the functioning of microbial communities.  The complex nature of how biodiversity interacts with temperature to control bacterial respiration needs to be examined in our warming world.  The current global carbon budget could be balanced if global bacterial respiration changed by only ~2%.  Understanding how diversity interacts with environmental controls such as temperature and water flow is particularly important in the Arctic, where there are currently low but increasing temperatures, thawing permafrost that affects hydrology, and much accumulated organic matter in permafrost soils ? all creating a situation ripe for increased bacterial respiration that could alter regional carbon budgets and modify global change.  This ?arctic amplification? of climate warming, where increased temperatures thaw more permafrost and expose more soil carbon to be respired to CO2 by microbes, is of great concern and considerable scientific interest.  Our most recent results that exposure to sunlight increases bacterial use of permafrost carbon by 40% has implications for the debate on how much positive feedback we may expect on global warming as the Arctic itself warms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George W Kling"
