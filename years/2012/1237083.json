 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nThe fourth biennial Protein Transport Across Cell Membranes Gordon Research Conference (GRC) will be held March 11-16 and will be preceded by the first Gordon Research Seminar for this meeting on March 10-11. Together these conferences will focus on mechanisms involved in translocating proteins across or into biological membranes. Elucidation of protein transport mechanisms remains a fundamental objective of modern cell biology as ~30% of all proteins are either transported across or integrated into cellular membranes. Moreover, defects in protein transport result in several human genetic diseases, and infectious microbes use protein transport systems to deliver virulence factors to plants and animals. Protein translocation machineries (translocases) are highly sophisticated nanomachines, comprising multiple receptors, motors, checkpoints, channels and complex regulatory circuits. As such, progress in this field requires an integrated approach that combines diverse methodologies including biochemistry, genetics, x-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and fluorescence single molecule imaging. This conference is the only regularly scheduled meeting in the US devoted to an in-depth coverage of the protein transport field. It assembles specialists in these varied methodologies to report unpublished data, to evaluate\r\nhypotheses, and to generate new theories and approaches. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of 2012 Protein Transport across Cell Membranes GRC is to stimulate the exchange and vigorous discussion of the frontiers of knowledge and methodology in the protein transport field. This will be accomplished in large part by the judicious selection and recruitment of speakers and discussion leaders, and also by the intense but informal GRC format of the conference. The 2012 conference will begin with an overview session that will inform participants on the range of experimental systems, approaches, and concepts of this field. Other sessions will cover mechanistic aspects of major transport systems (15 to 20 in some eukaryotes; up to 10 in prokaryotes), as well as novel transport systems. This conference will advance knowledge into the workings of these essential and varied protein transport nanomachines. Thirty-five invited speakers and discussion leaders have already accepted, indicating a high level of enthusiasm for this meeting.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThe mission of these associated meetings is to provide a forum that both educates experienced researchers and introduces new investigators into the field. The GRC format, which encourages extensive and spirited discussions of unpublished data and ideas, is perfect for these goals. The associated GRS is a rich training environment that will provide postdocs and students the confidence to engage in such discussions. First, GRS participants will receive basic background in the concepts, principles, and mechanisms involved in protein translocation. Second, they will receive feedback on their research, network with their peers and senior investigators, and sharpen their skills in presentation and discussion in a non-intimidating environment. Other mechanisms to integrate young investigators will include selection for GRC short talks and partial support for GRC registration. Female participants made up 38% of the participants at the 2010 conference. The 2012 GRC and GRS will obtain a gender- (and other minority-) balanced program of speakers with preference for speakers and discussion leaders that will include registration support. Together with an international distribution of attendees, the GRC and GRS will provide a rich educational experience that will mentor a diverse new generation of scientists into this and related fields.",
