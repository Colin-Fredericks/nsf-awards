 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves development of a theoretical model to calculate pressure-broadened half-widths and pressure-induced line shifts and their temperature dependences for gases in the terrestrial and planetary atmospheres that meets the needs of the remote sensing community. The half-width remains the major source of error in the spectral parameters used for reducing remote sensing data and in line-by-line models used to calculate radiative forcing from greenhouse gases. Because data are needed for many thousands of ro-vibrational transitions of many different gases a computationally efficient theoretical model, based on physics, is desired that can correctly determine the line shape parameters. The semi-classical Complex Robert-Bonamy formalism is the basis of the theoretical approach. For results to be good for all transitions, not only strong lines, the intermolecular potentials must be expanded to very high order and the molecular dynamics must use Hamilton's equations. For transitions in the near infrared and visible spectral regions better wavefunctions and energies are needed, since the classic effective Hamiltonian determination breaks down. The use of ab initio energies and wavefunctions in the determination of the reduced matrix elements is being explored as a means to remedy the problem. The vibrational state, rotational state, and temperature dependence of the collision-induced parameters are being investigated. Because of the improvement in space borne spectrometers, line shape models need to be improved. While the Voigt model forms the basis for line shape, corrections for Dicke narrowing and speed dependence, and their correlation, must be and are being considered in this work.\r\n\r\nThe resulting data will provide greatly improved line shape parameters and their temperature dependence, aiding researchers doing concentration and temperature profile retrievals and radiative transfer studies of the heat balance of Earth and other planets by reducing the uncertainty of the half-widths and other line shape parameters used in their models. This work will improve confidence in spectroscopic remote sensing results and allow a better determination of the radiative forcing of greenhouse gases. The improvement in understanding the energy balance of the Earth will help make more informed policy decisions. The data will be distributed via the HITRAN, HITEMP, GEISA, and IUPAC (for water vapor) databases and the principal investigator's web site. A postdoctoral scholar and several undergraduate students will work on this project, learning skills that they would not get in a classroom setting. An ongoing collaboration with a local high school allows undergraduate students to routinely visit the school to talk about their work with the aim of creating interest in science among the high schoolers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe study of the structure, composition, chemistry, dynamics, and evolution of an atmosphere, whether Earth?s or the atmospheres of other planets, is generally done by remote sensing techniques due to the sheer size of an atmosphere.  This is especially true for other planets where in situ measurements are rarely done due to the expense.  A method that yields high quality data is spectroscopic measurement of the atmosphere.  Figure 1 shows solar irradiance as a function of increasing air mass (0 to 10).  The grey curve is at the top of the atmosphere.  Notice that as the radiating travels through the atmosphere it is reduced: e.g. blue (m=1), brown (m=1.5), green (m=2), purple (m=5), magenta (m=10).  The composition, structure, and some clues to the evolution of the atmosphere can be determined by reducing the measured spectrum, a process called radiative transfer.  It is essentially tracking the radiation (light) as it passes through the atmosphere.  At each layer the spectrum must be modeled.  Figure 2 shows a transmittance spectrum at the surface of Earth from 1280-1405 cm-1.  To model Fig. 2 one must have the parameters that describe the spectral lines: the position, intensity, half-width, line shift, and their temperature dependence, and the lower state energy.  The half-width and line shift are called the line shape parameters (LSP).  For the majority of gases in the Earth?s or planetary atmospheres, the line positions and intensities are very well known.  The half-widths are the weak link in the retrievals with the resulting uncertainty in the retrieved concentrations (mixing ratios) often having a 1:1 relationship with the uncertainty of the half-width.  The half-widths on the molecular spectroscopic databases are often only known to 30-50%.  Line shifts are also not well known but have a smaller, but sometimes important, influence on the reductions.  The work done here was the development of a theoretical method, complex Robert-Bonamy formalism (CRB), to calculate the line shape parameters and their temperature dependence.  The CRB model is a semi-classical method, meaning the dynamics are solved by classical physics (Hamilton?s equations) and the internal structure is solved using quantum mechanics.  The calculations give the Lorentz line shape half-width and line shift as a function of temperature.  The formalism was used to calculate LSP for thousands of lines for the main IR absorbing gases in the atmosphere: H2O and CO2.  The results of these calculations give the half-width with average uncertainty of ~0.2% and a standard deviation of ~5% for H2O and average uncertainty of ~0.2% and a standard deviation of ~2% for CO2 when compared with measurement. These data greatly improve the LSP on the available spectroscopic databases.  From this work we were able to create a LSP prediction routine for CO2 with uncertainty similar to the calculations.  This routine allowed us to provide line shape information for 0.65 billion transitions of CO2.\n\nOn Earth it is now possible to make higher resolution measurements that require line shape models beyond the Lorentz model.  In collaboration with French researchers, we were able to determine an extremely accurate line shape, using the Kielson-Storer (KS) kernel, for a number of water vapor transitions with nitrogen or water vapor as the colliding partner.  The KS method takes into account the collision-induced velocity changes, the speed dependences of the broadening and shifting coefficients as well as the partial correlation between velocity and rotational-state changes.  While computationally intensive, the results give a standard to which other line shape models can compare. \n\nFrom this grant, my lab also worked on other molecular parameters important for understanding molecular spectra and remote sensing.  We have had a series of papers producing the best available energy levels for 9 isotopologues of water vapor determined from measurement.  We calculated total internal partition sums (TIPS) for 166 isotopologues of 51 molecules important in planetary atmospheres.  The TIPS are determined by various methods from 1 K to a Tmax that ensures the TIPS reported have converged. \n\nAll of the data we generated during this NSF grant are available at the website http://faculty.uml.edu/Robert_Gamache and often through the supplementary information of the journals where the work has been published.  The line shape parameters of our research have been added to the HITRAN, GEISA, Ames, and CDSD spectroscopic databases.  The TIPS data are provided with HITRAN2016 and a new version of the TIPS code is available in both FORTRAN and python languages at my website and the HITRAN website.  Also available at my website are many of the analysis plots used to produce the data in the published journal articles.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Gamache"
