 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to create DNA single molecule junction devices and measure their electromechanical properties under precise controls of a number of variables applying the recent developed single molecule molecular transport junction (MTJ) system.  In combination of theory computation and modeling, this project will elucidate the intrinsic transport mechanisms of molecular structure-dependent conductance behaviors and gleaning important conclusions regarding the enhancement and tuning of charge transport in single DNA junction devices.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is to develop a comprehensive approach that utilizes electrical engineering, chemistry and physics in the development of DNA single molecule junction devices and control and measure the variables, including DNA-electrode contact and a rich variety of structures of DNA caused by bending, orientations and water and counterions conditions, at the single molecular level. AFM nanolithography and modified SPM-based MTJ technique will enable a new measurement approach. The proposed work is expected to gain a detailed and in-depth understanding of electronic transport in DNA single molecule junctions and provide a major step towards the incorporation of DNA molecules as functional elements in electronic devices.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are the participation of undergraduate, minority, and high school students to research opportunities in the emerging interdisciplinary fields through various recruiting programs to train the next generation scientists and engineers. The measurement and understanding of electronic transport through single DNA molecular devices under the native physiological conditions relevant to the damage and mutation in DNA will have applications ranging from electronic, biomedical, environmental to human health.",
