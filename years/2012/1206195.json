 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, there has been growing interest in using tools from probability theory to solve biological problems.  Probability theory has contributed substantially to the field of population genetics because many of the factors that are responsible for the evolution of populations are best modeled as random events.  The aim of this project is to make further contributions in this area by undertaking a detailed mathematical study of some natural models of randomly evolving populations.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the project focuses on branching Brownian motion with absorption.  Particles move according to Brownian motion with drift, divide into two at a constant rate, and are absorbed upon hitting the origin.  This process can be viewed as modeling a population undergoing selection.  The particle positions represent fitnesses of individuals, the branching events represent births, and absorption at the origin models the death of unfit individuals.  The goal will be to provide sharp estimates for the probability that the process survives for a long time and for the position of the right-most particle.  The second part of the project involves studying a model of a population of fixed size in which individuals acquire beneficial mutations.  The goal will be to prove results concerning the speed of evolution, the distribution of the fitnesses of individuals in the population, and the genealogy of the population.  The third part of the project involves further study of the beta coalescent, a process which can be used to describe the genealogy of populations with large family sizes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn important problem in Biology is to understand how natural selection affects the evolution of a population.  One approach to this problem is to develop a mathematical model of a population that is evolving under the influence of selective forces.  In such a model, each individual in the population has a certain fitness level, and individuals with greater fitness are more likely to produce offspring.\n\nSchweinsberg studied in depth a mathematical model of this type, in which individuals acquire beneficial mutations at a constant rate and the size of the population is fixed.  All individuals were assumed to die at the same rate, but the rate at which individuals produce offspring was assumed to depend on the number of beneficial mutations the individual has.  For this model, Schweinsberg calculated the rate at which beneficial mutations take hold in the population, and the distribution of the fitness levels of individuals in the population at a given time.  He also showed how to describe the genealogical structure of the sample from a population at a given time.  These results confirmed previous conjectures of Biologists.\n\nAs part of this project, Schweinsberg also established some new results in the theory of coalescent processes.  Coalescent processes can be used to describe the genealogy of a population because when one traces back the ancestral lines of a sample of individuals from a population, the ancestral lines will eventually merge as individuals in the population get traced back to common ancestors.  For populations undergoing selection, the ancestral tree often has the property that many branches merge at approximately the same time because many ancestral lines are traced back to the same individual that acquired a beneficial mutation.  Indeed, for the population model mentioned above, Schweinsberg showed that the genealogy of the population can be described by the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent, a stochastic process which was originally introduced because of its applications in statistical physics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason R Schweinsberg"
