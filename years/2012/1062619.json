 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Keweenaw Research Center (KRC) of Michigan Tech University (MTU) has hosted and will continue to host the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Clean Snowmobile Challenge (CSC) event for the next three years at its 500-acre test track near Houghton, Michigan. \r\n\r\nUniversity Teams from across the US and Canada compete for the title of cleanest and quietest snowmobile. \r\n\r\nThis project sought NSF funding to encourage University teams to participate in the challenge by reimbursing travel expenses and other participant costs associated with the competition?s Zero Emissions category.\r\n\r\nCSC's are consistent with those of the National Science Foundation Arctic Research and Education Program in terms of developing vehicles that have a reduced impact on the environment. Conventional snowmobiles are suitable as transportation in extreme polar locations, however due to their higher carbon emissions may not be used in areas where their output would skew the research results. \r\n\r\nThe Zero Emission category of CSC challenges undergraduate students to look for solutions to this problem. In doing so they learn the needs of the Polar Program research engineers and they also learn about electrification of transportation vehicles, a timely topic as we search for alternatives to the use of fossil fuels for energy. \r\n\r\nThe SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge provides a venue for students to search for solutions to the needs of the Arctic Research and Education Program and at the same time provides a conduit for public dissemination of the work of the Polar Program. Continued support of this competition will lead to further improvements in Arctic zero emissions transportation needs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Clean Snowmobile Challenge Zero Emissions category was created to encourage research in a long sought after mobility need in the Polar regions. Research engineers need to travel to their site without creating contaminants that would skew their results. This grant provided some travel funding for University teams to bring their sleds and teams to the event.  In some cases, travel is a significant portion of a team's budget.\n\nSeveral University teams took on the Challenge to design and build an electric snowmobile.  During the life of this grant, 2013 through 2015, three competitions were held and a total of nine Universities competed.  Teams from McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, South Dakota, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan, Clarkson University, Potsdam, New York, Lapland University of Applied Science, Rovaniemi, Finland, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Alaska, Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis, Indiana, and The University of Alaska, Bristol Bay, Alaska. Each year the competition was held in Houghton, Michigan at the Keweenaw Research Center (KRC), a research arm of Michigan Technological University.  KRC has over 500 acres of winter test course facilites offering winter test resources to automotive, off-highway, and military customers.  KRC is also adjacent to public snowmobile trails of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan where some of the competition is held.\n\nTwo University teams completed designs that consistently met the rules and the competition objectives.  The first was McGill University.  Their design traveled 10.8 miles in the 2014 competition.  Lapland University of Applied Science completed designs in 2015 and 2016 which were quite impressive.  In 2015 they passed technical inspection on the first day and traveled 18.2 miles in the range event.  In 2016, they brought an entirely new sled which again passed inspection on the first day and traveled 19.1 miles in the range event.  They arrived well prepared, traveled from the furthest distance, and won the competition two years in a row.\n\nPerhaps the most significant result of hosting the Zero Emissions (Electric) category of the Clean Snowmobile Challenge is that the design and build of an electric vehicle is huge challenge for undergraduate students.  Some of the teams had graduate students on their team and they seem to do a little better.  The team from Finland has a company sponsor that works closely with the team and that appears to be directly related to their success.  In future competitions, we will insist that ZE teams have a professional with power systems knowledge as one of the advisors to the team.\n\nThe high cost of new technology batteries and the relatively low energy compared to gasoline powered snowmobiles will limit the development of electric sleds for years to come.  Nevertheless, for short run scientific related duty cycles in arctic climates, this is a tool that can help advance the acquisition of valuable data.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jay Meldrum"
