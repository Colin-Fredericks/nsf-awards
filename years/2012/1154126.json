Through early career mentoring and peer support structures the program is building STEM workforce capacity in the local community. The project serves an underrepresented population in STEM, those in the Appalachian regions of Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The work can become a national model for institutions serving other underrepresented groups. Investigators are disseminating results nationally so other institutions can benefit from their lessons learned.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Appalachian Cohort for Engineering (ACE) program was a cohort based program that provided scholarships and academic support services to students from the Appalachian region of Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia from 2012 to 2017.   The stated goal of the program was to encourage successful completion of engineering and computer science degrees by students who were academically capable and had demonstrated financial needs.  The ACE program provided two years of scholarship and academic / professional support to 4 cohorts of students who entered Ohio University in Fall 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, and one year of support for a final cohort entering in Fall 2016.  With additional funding from the Russ College endowment at Ohio University, students who maintained academic eligibility received a total of four years of scholarships. The program supported a total of 41 students who majored Computer Science, Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Industrial and Systems, or Mechanical Engineering.  Project successes include (i) 100% of the students from the first cohort completed an engineering degree within five years, and (ii) 75% of the students admitted to the program were still participating and on track for engineering / computer science degrees, or had graduated, when the program ended in 2017.  \n\nThe program had four required components that provided social, academic, and professional support for the students: (i) weekly meetings with peer mentors, (ii) cohort-based weekly community building meetings (so-called \"All ACE\" meetings), (iii) monthly university-wide meetings for students on selected scholarships (LINKS Meetings), and (iv) two additional faculty advising sessions per semester.   Scholarship recipients also had access to tutoring and other academic support services.  \n\nThe program was evaluated via both quantitative and qualitative methods via online surveys, interviews with students and advisors and focus groups.  In particular, interview and focus group responses were transcribed and the transcripts were verified for accuracy.   The principles of content analysis were used to (i) code transcripts and (ii) to identify, refine and categorize themes and patterns based on the guiding research questions of the interviews.   The overall results of these evaluations were documented in a series of 11 reports.  The reports provided the faculty who were involved with the program with guidance on how to make appropriate changes to the program during the early years of the project. The evaluation highlighted the importance of support structures such as regular meetings with peer and faculty mentors and small-group cohort building to the first-year experience. For the Russ College of Engineering at Ohio University, this has translated to an increased emphasis on the Freshman Learning Community (a small-cohort experience with a faculty and a peer mentor) as a component of engineering students? first-year experience.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David W Juedes"
