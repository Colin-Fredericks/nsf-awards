 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a computer-aided mosaic\r\ndesign and robotic assembly system for automation of a centuries-old manual process. Despite their\r\nprominence in art and architecture, mosaics are arduous to design and assemble. Labor-intensive\r\nmethods have stubbornly resisted automation, adding considerable cost and delay to projects. Artaic's\r\nPhase I research proved feasibility of computer-aided design software to create renderings and digital\r\nblueprints of artisanal mosaics by introducing a streamlined, procedural workflow for tile layout that\r\nclosely mimicked the workflow of mosaic artists, and did so over 10x faster than manual methods. The\r\ngoal of the Phase II research is to demonstrate the speed, effectiveness, utility, and artistic quality of this mosaic design and robotic assembly system. The key Phase II objectives are to: (1) demonstrate a\r\nprototype artisanal mosaic design system and; (2) demonstrate a robotic mosaic production system, that\r\nwill be: (3) validated for accuracy, speed, and quality through user assessment, and; (4) evaluated for\r\neconomic and commercial potential. Anticipated technical results will enable a revolutionary\r\nadvancement from manual to automated processes in mosaic design and production, comparable to the\r\ndisplacement of film by digital camera technology.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in art, design, construction, and\r\narchitecture. Software and robotic automation will lower the cost of mosaics and increase its traditional\r\nsocietal impact of adorning public, commercial, and residential spaces. Artists, designers, and builders\r\nwill have a significantly faster method to produce artisanal mosaics without the high cost and\r\ntime associated with manual design and production. The efficiencies made possible by this proposed\r\ncomputer-aided mosaic design and manufacturing system will enable Artaic to expand into the global\r\nmulti-billion dollar tile market and develop a domestic workforce to compete against global\r\nmanufacturers of handcrafted mosaic artwork. Additionally, the computational demands of the rendering\r\nalgorithms developed during Phase II will give impetus to further development of advanced GPUs and\r\nCPUs -- with companies such as Intel, Nvidia, and AMD providing solutions for increasingly more\r\nadvanced rendering algorithms. Perhaps the most significant societal benefit from the development of\r\nthis technology is its potential to make artisanal mosaic design and production accessible and affordable\r\nto the general public, and because this research enables any Photoshop artist to become a mosaic artist, it\r\nalso hold significant promise as an educational tool in our nation's schools.",
