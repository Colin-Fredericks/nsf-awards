 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mendelian traits are governed by single genes, and methods to identify\r\nthese genes have been remarkably successful.  In stark contrast,\r\ncomplex traits result from multiple genetic variants that are\r\nindividually neither necessary nor sufficient, often interacting with\r\neach other and the environment.  Indeed, collectively, genetic\r\nvariants identified to date for complex traits typically explain less\r\nthan 10% of the phenotype variance.  No unified computational and\r\nstatistical framework has been advanced for organizing the discovery\r\nprocess.  To date, a single strategy has dominated: static\r\nvariant-by-variant analysis.  In contrast, the investigators propose a\r\nnew coarse-to-fine statistical framework motivated by the biomedical\r\nhypothesis that mutations contributing to a specific disease cluster\r\nin specific pathways, and in genes within these pathways.  Simulations\r\ndemonstrate that multi-scale, hierarchical coarse-to-fine sequential\r\ntests have greater power than conventional methods under this\r\nhypothesis.  The researchers convert these heuristics into mathematics\r\nand provide a comprehensive analysis, both empirical and theoretical,\r\nof the trade-offs resulting from the introduction of carefully chosen\r\nbiases about the distribution of active variants within genes and\r\npathways.  The new methods are applied to data from real genome-wide\r\nassociation studies (GWAS) with large cohorts to validate their\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nKnowing the genetic variants that contribute to cardiovascular\r\ndisease, diabetes, autism, and other prevalent disorders would have\r\ngreat value in identifying drug targets, predicting people at risk,\r\nand suggesting personalized therapies.  These diseases are not caused\r\nby mutations in single genes, however, but by multiple mutations that\r\ncombine to disrupt multi-gene biological pathways.  The investigators\r\ntherefore develop a new statistical framework that begins the search\r\nfor disease-risk genes at the pathway level, then sequentially narrows\r\nthe search to genes within pathways and alleles within genes.\r\nSuccessful applications to ongoing human genetic studies involving\r\ntens to hundreds of thousands of people identify genes contributing to\r\ncardiovascular disease.  More generally, the coarse-to-fine\r\nstatistical framework has great value in the current era of \"big\r\ndata\", with increasingly large data volumes calling for innovative\r\nstatistical methods.",
