 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objective of this program is to develop scalable nanomanufacturing technologies for the production of high-energy density electrochemical capacitors, consisting of nanostructured electrodes with controllable charged defect density and redox polymers. This aspect of nanoscale engineering is transformative in that the constituent electrodes have a unique combination of both double-layer and redox capacitance, with very large area leading to higher energy density and low electrical resistance for enhanced power density.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The intellectual merit is defined through the scope of the work, which aims to integrate from the bottom up, all the necessary processes for a carbon based high energy storage density device. This includes nanostructure synthesis through a roll-to-roll process, plasma processing for electrical charge introduction, in-line metrology to provide real-time monitoring of the structural properties, for the ultimate purpose of deploying fully functional capacitors. Fundamental insights into electrochemical mechanisms and material interactions will be obtained and applied to the development of proof-of-concept devices and prototype systems.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The broader impacts are the development of high-energy density carbon nanomaterials compatible with large-scale device fabrication technologies, and extending the reach of nanotechnology to budding scientists and the wider community. The potential applications for high-energy electrochemical capacitors range from small-scale portable electronics (requiring high power density and large cycle life) to large-format energy management. In addition to promoting graduate and undergraduate education and training on nanotechnology and process integration, outreach activities will promote novel energy technologies.",
