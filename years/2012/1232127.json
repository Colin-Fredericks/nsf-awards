 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The research objective of this proposal is to investigate control algorithms for resource constrained trajectory tracking in nonlinear systems. Tracking controllers are widely utilized in several applications, for example in robotic systems for manufacturing applications. However, the implementation of these controllers is subjected to several practical constraints that limit overall system performance. In applications, such as robotic systems for industrial automation, these problems have prevented the realization of high precision tracking, thereby stymieing the potential impact of robotic systems.  In contrast to time-triggered periodic sampling, in this proposal a Lyapunov function based event-triggered approach is utilized for addressing resource constrained tracking in nonlinear systems.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The research deals with design of tracking controllers for nonlinear systems under sensor, computational, and communication constraints. The approach is based on event-triggered controllers for trajectory tracking in nonlinear systems and by co-designing event- triggers and quantizers for nonlinear systems.  The research will lead to the development of a hybrid control framework where various resource constraints can be treated in a unified manner. The proposed approach will provide a rigorous solution to the important problem of tracking in robotic systems under sensor constraints, thereby significantly impacting industrial automation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The understanding of resource constrained trajectory tracking using an event-triggered controller will provide a useful alternative to the classical time-triggered control framework. The proposed research is anticipated to significantly enhance the tracking performance of robotic systems under sensor constraints and render them viable for several emerging manufacturing applications.  Graduate students will directly benefit from the proposed research, and it is expected that several undergraduate and graduate students will benefit from the enriched curricula and project work at University of Maryland. High school students from underrepresented groups will be included in the research effort through the University of Maryland?s ESTEEM program.",
