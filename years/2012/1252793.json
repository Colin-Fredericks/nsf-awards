 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support 18 community college oceanography faculty to attend a workshop and the 2013 national conference of the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography. This assembly will be an important first step in building a community of Ocean 2YC faculty, a group with no previous assemblage or identity. A session on ?Opportunities and challenges of teaching introductory oceanography to undergraduates? will be co-chaired by Jan Hodder (COSSEE-Pacific) and PI Beauregard. It will focus on effective ways to teach and assess student learning in these classes. The session is not geared specifically for two-year college faculty but would also be of interest to four-year college faculty. This may provide a nice mechanism for interaction between these groups. Additionally, Jan Hodder, Heather Macdonald, Eric Baer (Highline Community College), and Bob Blodgett (Austin Community College) will host a workshop on successful ways to prepare community college students for geoscience careers as part of their NSF-funded ?Supporting and Advancing Geoscience Education (SAGE) at Community Colleges (2YC)? project. Finally, COSEE Pacific will support an evening reception for Ocean 2YC participants. The reception could include a discussion of opportunities and resources for 2YC geoscientist faculty, as well as challenges and needs specific to the Ocean 2YC community. \r\n\r\nTravel assistance will be limited to faculty who either present at the meeting or who attend the SAGE-2YC workshop. Participants in this project will receive airfare, subsistence, and registration to attend the ASLO meeting in February 2013 in New Orleans, LA.\r\n\r\nCommunity colleges are a critical part of our educational system, and serve almost half (or approximately 7 million) of all U.S. undergraduate students, 32% whom are under-represented minorities (National Science Foundation, 2008). Yet, community college faculties rarely have access to professional development funds that allow for national conference attendance and the critical interactions that lead to higher quality instruction (Geo2YC Workshop, 2010). Community college oceanography faculty face some startling challenges in their classrooms, including lack of access to current scientific research, lack of expensive equipment, and an extremely large range in student interest and abilities in one course section. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit: This project is a crucial first step, toward building an Ocean2YC community. Such a community will provide a forum for sharing ideas and strategies for teaching oceanography at two year colleges, such as innovative ideas for incorporating research into two year classrooms, teaching non-majors, and transfer issues with four year colleges.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Half of all students receiving baccalaureate degrees in the U.S. attend a community college at some point in their educational career (AACC, 2012). A strong community of community college oceanography instructors to share effective teaching strategies will lead to better instruction and increased participation in the ocean sciences. Because these institutions serve a disproportionate number of minority and first generation college students, effective teaching at community colleges will have the additional benefit of increasing diversity in the ocean sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBuilding a Community of Oceanography Community College Faculty\n\nTwenty-four oceanography community college faculty from around the country convened in New Orleans in February 2013.  This assembly was an important first step in building a community of Ocean 2YC faculty, a group with no previous assemblage or identity.  While in New Orleans, members of the Ocean2YC community participated in a workshop on Best Practices for Preparing Workforce and Transfer Students in Two-Year Colleges for Ocean Science Careers and attended the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) annual conference.\n\nDuring the workshop, 2YC faculty listened to presentations on careers in ocean sciences and resources available for faculty and students on\nocean careers.  Faculty also participated in discussions and interactive gallery walks to share their own ideas on challenges specific to 2YCs and ideas for overcoming them.  Several participants also presented their own\nsuccessful projects and strategies for promoting ocean careers at their\ninstitutions.  \n\nDuring the ASLO conference, 17 2YC faculty made presentations\nduring a special session on Opportunities and Challenges of Teaching Introductory Oceanography to Undergraduates.  2YC faculty took full advantage of the ASLO conference, attending daily plenary sessions, Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence lunch sessions, sessions on effectively communicating science, and special sessions on a range of ocean research and education topics.  \n\nParticipants of the workshop and ASLO conference found the experience to be very beneficial.  In a post-meeting evaluation and survey, several participants expressed that the most valuable aspect of this initial meeting was the collaboration and networking that it afforded as well as the sharing of ideas and strategies with more similar colleagues than they had been able to identify in other meetings.  Several participants expressed that they felt re-energized about teaching at the 2YC level and excited to try some new ideas with their students. \n\nThis assembly was an important first step in building a new community of Ocean2YC faculty. The new community has provided a forum for sharing ideas and strategies for teaching oceanography at two year colleges, such as innovative ideas for incorporating research into two year classrooms, teaching non-majors, and transfer issues with four year colleges.  Because of the isolation and lack of support that Ocean2YC faculty face, continuing to build this community will be an important milestone in enhancing oceanography instruction at two year colleges.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/03/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Allison Beauregard Schwartz"
