 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a joint research effort between Health Services Researchers and Operations Researchers. The aim of this project is to study the use of hospital Transitional Care Units (TCUs) and fuse evidence-based medicine with the mathematical rigor of operations research in developing guidelines on patient care in the TCU. Utilizing datasets from 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals, the study will involve a combination of empirical and analytical modeling and analysis. Quantitative models and dynamic optimization algorithms will be developed to identify when a patient should be cared for in the TCU and when he should not be. High fidelity, yet parsimonious, models will be developed based on empirical analysis. Exact analysis of the complex hospital network is likely intractable; hence, dynamic programming tools and approximation techniques will be utilized to develop simple, effective policies. Deliverables include the development of modeling and analytical tools, demonstration and validation via simulation and theoretical analysis, documentation of research results, practitioner education, and research experiences for graduate students. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide a framework to analyze and identify best practices for the use of partially flexible resources, hospital Transitional Care Units. This research is of direct interest to healthcare management and physicians. This work will provide insight into the use of TCUs, which is currently very limited. As a joint research agenda between Operations Researchers and Health Services Researchers, this project enables a path from mathematical modeling and analysis to the deployment of the proposed policies and the improvement in medical care. By developing an understanding of how to use a TCU, the care pathways of the hospitals most critical patients can be tailored and optimized. This has important implications for improvement of healthcare provision and is of direct impact to patient themselves and the wider community. Additionally, via seminar outreach and participation in the continuing education programs of physicians and nurses, the medical community will be educated to the benefits of utilizing operations research tools to improve patient care.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn practice, there is high variation across hospitals as to whether it has an SDU and if so, how large the unit is in comparison to the ICU.  On the surface, this variation could be attributed to the fact there is limited consensus in the medical community as to the management of SDUs.  However, our analysis provides justification for this variation.  The optimal size of an SDU is highly dependent on patient mix (including differences in service times and the likelihood of becoming a Semi-critical patient following ICU care), staffing requirements in the ICU versus SDU, as well as the relative cost of Critical patient abandonment versus bumping a Semi-critical patient to an even lower level of care, such as the general ward.  Because these factors are likely to vary substantially across different hospitals and geographic areas, it is reasonable--and highly desirable--that hospitals utilize and size SDUs in a heterogeneous manner. One size does not fit all.  The paper, \"Critical care in hospitals: When to introduce a Step Down Unit?\" allows us to understand better when and SDU should be used and if so, how large it should be.\n\n \n\nIn the second piece of work, currently being drafted, we find that even when there is ample ICU capacity (e.g. 95% of patients are admitted to the ICU within 6 hours), the size of the TCU plays a significant role in patient outcomes.  Outcomes degrade if the TCU is too small.  Additionally, many patients will be \"reverse access blocked\" and remain in the ICU even if they do not need the high level of care. This is undesirable because it can be very costly, with little, if any benefit, to the patient. \n\n \n\nPrior to the opening of the new SDU at Montefiore Medical Center, I worked with an MBA student and physician to conduct a survey on the perceptions of the new unit.  The results of this survey were disseminated to all members of the critical care team.  Overwhelmingly, the views of the SDU are positive.  A few highlights from the survey results include:\n\n- 99% of respondents \"completely support\" or \"somewhat support\" the implementation of an SDU\n\n- 97% of respondents believe that the new SDU will \"decrease\" or \"somewhat decrease\" patient wait times in the ED\n\n- 96% of respondents believe that the new SDU will \"positively\" or \"somewhat positively\" impact patient and family satisfaction\n\n- 96% of respondents think that patients who are treated in the new SDU will receive \"better\" or \"somewhat better\" care than they would have received if the SDU did not exist or could not accommodate them\n\n- 88% of respondents report that the new SDU will \"positively\" or \"somewhat positively\" impact their working conditions\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/21/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gabriel J Escobar"
