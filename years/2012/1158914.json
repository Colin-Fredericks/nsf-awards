 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. \r\n\r\nThis award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Jerry Chen to work with Dr. Fritjof Helmchen at the University of Zurich, Brain Research Institute in Zurich, Switzerland. \r\n\r\nA key feature underlying the computational power of the mammalian brain is the processing of neuronal activity occurring simultaneously on multiple levels: from the integration of thousands of synaptic inputs in an individual neuron, to the computations occurring within local circuits, to the feedforward and feedback transmission of disparate streams of information across distant cortical regions.  Long-range communication between cortical brain areas is essential for a variety of higher cognitive functions.  However, the exact information encoded in these long-range circuits and its relationship to the computation occurring in local neuronal circuits is largely unknown.  \r\n\r\nThis project determines how neuronal activity is transmitted and coordinated across distant cortical regions and how this activity influences the processing of information in local circuits.  The mouse tactile whisker sensorimotor system is used as a reduced and tractable model to study these cortico-cortical interactions during behavior. Using in vivo imaging technology in combination with molecular and genetic tools, the activity of optically identified long-range range projection neurons are measured and manipulated as mice engage in a trained sensorimotor task. Utilitzing the expertise of the host institute, a novel in vivo imaging system is also being developed that will enable the simultaneous measurement of neuronal activity across cortical areas with single cell resolution.   This enabling technology allows neuroscientists to study global brain activity in a manner previously unachievable.    \r\n\r\nThe dissection of long-range cortical networks with cellular resolution contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the central nervous system across multiple levels and bridges knowledge gaps between brain region function and cellular physiology.  Studying the function of these networks also aids in the understanding of pathologies underlying various cognitive disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Alzheimer?s Disease where disruptions in anatomical and functional cortico-cortical connectivity are widely recognized hallmarks.  Further, this work serves to strengthen and expand already existing, internationally-funded projects in the lab, consisting of collaborations with researchers throughout Europe: the BrainScaleS Project (EU FET-Proactive FP7), the NeuroChoice Project (a Swiss Systems Biology Initiative), and Barrel Cortex Function Project (a joint SNF-DFG grant).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA longstanding goal in neuroscience is to achieve a complete understanding of the central nervous system, from individual genes up to the brain as a whole. A fundamental challenge in achieving this goal is bridging knowledge gaps impeded by the difficulty in integrating experimental measurements across different scales, for example between computations in local circuits and communication across brain areas. In the mammalian neocortex, cortico-cortical connections formed by long-range projection neurons across different areas are essential for higher cognitive function.  The aim of my fellowship period was to dissect the role of long-range networks in the neocortex during sensory-guided decision making by combining in vivo imaging technology with molecular and genetic tools in the awake-behaving animal.  My goal was to use the mouse tactile whisker sensorimotor system as a model to study how long-range projection neurons function in lower- and higher-level cortical areas during tactile perception\n\n                In primary somatosensory whisker cortex (S1), long-range projection neurons send divergent connections to secondary somatosensory (S2) or primary motor (M1) cortex.  A fundamental question is whether during behavior, information from S1 is generally broadcasted or selectively transmitted to these two areas.  If transmission is selective, under what context would information flow to these two areas differ? To address this, I developed a protocol combining retrograde tracers with genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) to monitor neuronal activity in identified S1 neurons projecting either to secondary somatosensory (S2P) or primary motor cortex (M1P).  Through in vivo two-photon calcium imaging on head-fixed mice performing either a texture discrimination or an object localization task, I found that the patterns of activity between these non-overlapping populations of S2P and M1P neurons differed depending on the task performed and were absent in na&iuml;ve, untrained animals.  This suggests that information can be selectively routed from one brain area to another depending on behavioral conditions.  \n\n                One possible mechanism for the differential recruitment of long-range M1P and S2P projection neurons during behaviour is that training induces plasticity of local and long-range circuits during task learning so as to modify certain pathways from their na&iuml;ve state.  To address this, I have used GECIs to chronically monitor the activity of M1P and S2P neurons in S1 during texture discrimination task learning. I have found that over the course of training, M1P neurons becoming increasingly sensitive to touch while reliably encoding basic whisker kinematics.  S2P neurons, on the other hand, undergo larger degrees of reorganization and acquire contextual representations of the presented textures that correspond to the animal\u00c6s decision.  While these changes emerge across learning, most do not persist across behavioral states, suggesting that the resulting differences between M1P and S2P neurons are not likely due to local modifications in S1 but due to modulation by long-range inputs in a more acute manner.\n\n                In order to determine the influence of long-range inputs onto S2P and M1P neurons, it is beneficial to simultaneously measure feedforward activity from S1 to M1 and S2 at the same time as the feedback activity arriving back from these reciprocally connected areas. To this end, I have helped to develop a novel \"multi-area\" two-photon microscope that enables the simultaneous imaging of two populations of neurons located across distant cortical areas with subcellular spatial resolution, temporal resolution of up to 15 Hz, and independent positioning of the two imaging regions along all 3 axes.  In parallel, I have developed a viral-mediated, genetically-based method to simultaneously and exclusively label feedforward and feedback neurons between two cortical areas.\n\n               ..."
