 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for the development, implementation, and evaluation of a comprehensive methodology for steady-state simulation output analysis in a framework called Effective Sequential Procedures for Risk and Error Estimation in Steady-state Simulation (ESPRESS). Specifically, sequential methods for computing point estimators and confidence intervals for the steady-state mean and selected steady-state quantiles of an output process generated by a probabilistic simulation model will be developed. The confidence intervals will meet prespecified accuracy criteria and achieve a user-specified level of reliability in large samples. The steady-state mean describes long-run average performance, e.g., the average number of vehicles produced per month by an automotive assembly plant operating under a fixed capacity. Steady-state quantiles are used to measure the responsiveness of many service facilities and to characterize the risk associated with financial assets,e.g., the 90th percentile of call-waiting time is often used to evaluate the performance of a call center and the 5th percentile of the Value at Risk for a portfolio of financial assets is frequently used to describe the risk of loss on that portfolio. The implementation phase of ESPRESS will lead to computationally efficient statistical-estimation procedures that users can access and apply easily and quickly, which will be tested in the evaluation phase. The ultimate objective of this work is to provide practitioners and researchers with new techniques and public-domain software for the analysis of steady-state simulations that are completely automated, robust, and reliable as well as computationally and statistically efficient.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the research will lead to fully automated sequential steady-state mean- and quantile-estimation procedures which are lacking in virtually all widely used commercial simulation packages. ESPRESS will be directly applicable to large-scale simulation studies in the governmental and military sectors as well as in a variety of industries, including aerospace, distribution, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, telecommunications, and transportation. Educational outreach will be a key component of this project, because all three investigators share a deep commitment to engineering education at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Results of this project will be used in developing instructional modules for Project MINDSET (www.mindsetproject.org) and for new courses on Monte Carlo methods and their applications that will be developed at both the master's and doctoral levels at the two participating institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this project is the development of algorithms and public-domain software for efficient and reliable analysis of the outputs of large-scale computer simulation models that arise in many industries, including aerospace, distribution, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, telecommunications, and transportation. \n\nWe have developed new simulation analysis procedures to measure the long-run average performance of these systems and the risks of extreme variations in that performance.  For example, the throughput of an automobile manufacturing plant might be measured by the average number of vehicles produced per month.  On the other hand, the 99% value at risk of a financial portfolio is the upper limit on the potential loss in value of that portfolio over a time interval of fixed length (say, a single trading day) so that the long-run probability is 99% that the loss in value of the portfolio will not exceed that upper limit in a single time period. \n\nExtremely large, computationally expensive simulation experiments can be required to estimate such quantities with enough accuracy to enable simulation analysts to optimize or at least significantly improve the performance of the system under study.  Compared with existing state-of-the-art simulation analysis procedures, the procedures developed in this project can estimate such performance measures with substantially smaller, more economical simulation experiments that are also more reliable.  We have also implemented robust, public-domain software for executing these procedures, and we are working with our industrial collaborators to incorporate these procedures in their commercial simulation platforms.\n\nThe value of the methods developed in this project is not limited to the industrial applications of those methods.  We have also constructed a sound theoretical foundation underlying these methods that will allow  simulation researchers and practitioners to formulate even more effective and efficient simulation analysis procedures in the future.  These contributions have been documented in three archival journal articles, four conference proceedings papers, and the doctoral research of two graduate students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James R Wilson"
