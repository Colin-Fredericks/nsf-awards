His objective is to gain better\r\nunderstanding of complicated phenomena, such as defects in liquid\r\ncrystals and shocks in fluid flows, that show themselves as\r\nsingularities or shocks in the solutions of the equations.  The\r\nmethods include hard, soft, and asymptotic analysis, numerical\r\ncomputation, and techniques of mathematical modeling.  In the\r\nfluids topic the investigator explores the role of symmetry in\r\ndescribing the structure of solutions to shock reflection\r\nproblems for the multi-dimensional Euler equations.  This bears\r\non the von Neumann paradox.  The issue in the nematic liquid\r\ncrystals topic is to provide a quantitative as well as\r\nqualitative foundation for manipulating the effect of defects in\r\nelectronic devices.  The investigation of these mathematical\r\nissues (1) yields new understanding regarding fluids  and liquid\r\ncrystals, which are critical for the advancement of many\r\nengineering sciences such as aerospace engineering, robot\r\ndesigning, and energy efficient devices; (2) provides advanced\r\ntraining for graduate students or postdoctoral researchers; (3)\r\nenhances collaboration and cross training of faculties between\r\nmathematics, materials science, and physics, thereby establishing\r\na foundation for training students in these broad areas.\r\n\r\n     The investigator studies some applied mathematical problems\r\nin fluid dynamics (which includes the motion of air and water)\r\nand in liquid crystal physics in materials science.  Scientists\r\nand engineers have used certain mathematical equations, called\r\npartial differential equations, to model motion or change in a\r\nsystem.  Turbulence in fluids and defects in materials show up in\r\nthe form of singularities and instabilities in the solutions of\r\nthe equations that model the behavior of the systems.  Even in\r\ncases where the equations are quite simple, it is these\r\nsingularities and instabilities that often spoil accurate\r\nnumerical computations of the solutions.  The investigator uses\r\nstate of the art analytical tools to study the structures of the\r\nsolutions.  In the case of a compressible gas such as air, for\r\nexample, he isolates typical singularities (hurricanes,\r\ntornadoes, shocks, etc.) and investigates their individual\r\nstructures.  The result of the investigation is a clearer\r\nunderstanding of the worst possible solutions, or of the\r\nstructure of solutions.  Such results quantify our knowledge of\r\nthe physics and offer guidance in high-performance numerical\r\ncomputations of general solutions.  Results here influence\r\nscientific areas such as weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, and\r\nmaterials science, and provide critical knowledge for the\r\nadvancement of many application areas such as aerospace\r\nengineering, robot design, and energy efficient devices.  In\r\naddition, the project provides advanced training for graduate\r\nstudents and postdoctoral researchers and enhances collaboration\r\nand cross training of faculties between mathematics, materials\r\nscience, and physics.\r\n",
