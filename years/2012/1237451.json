Use of engineered NM for medical devices is rapidly growing. Currently, silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NP) are used for medical device applications(i.e., in wound dressings and catheter coatings) to prevent infections. FDA is also faced with metal oxide NP derived as wear debris from orthopedic implants. Metal-on-metal hip replacement devices made from surgical cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy, have been shown to release Co and Cr NP by wear mechanisms into the body. Despite clinical assumptions that after the removal of worn hip replacements level of metal ions in the tissue/blood decrease, uncertainty remains about long-term health consequences of these metal particles.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn an effort to extend the life of and decrease the likelihood of infection caused by medical devices antimicrobial agents are being added.  Among the agents being used is silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs).  Nanoparticles are any substance that is produced that has at least one dimension measuring 100 nanometers (1x10-7 m) or less.  Often, when materials are made in this size, many of their characteristics change including how they interact with other substances or cells compared to when they are made up of larger molecules.  Silver compounds (silver chloride, colloidal silver, etc.) were used historically to prevent various infections so it is not surprising that the use of silver in this way is making a comeback. \n\nFor these studies, mice were injected into the tail vein with varying amounts of two differently sized Ag NPs, 20 or 110 nm, after which time their spleens were isolated and immune cells from the spleen were examined.  Examination of these cells showed that the smaller NPs caused increased T-lymphocytes (T-helper-2 cells; responsible for fighting infections) while at the same time decreased memory T-cells (responsible for fighting off pathogens during future exposures) while the larger NPs did not affect these endpoints.  Increasing the levels of Ag NPs injected resulted in decreased numbers of na&iuml;ve CD4+ T-cells and CD3+CD4- cells, but caused an increase in the number of memory T-cells and natural killer cells.  At the higher dose of the larger-sized NPs, the spleens had increased numbers of CD11c+ cells (macrophages).  These findings indicate that Ag NPs, depending on size and exposure level, can cause changes in the immune status of patients if their medical devices incorporate nanosilver and suggests that further studies are warranted to determine serious the interaction is with the immune system.  Besides determining their effects on the immune system, the levels of silver was determined in other tissues around and it was found that the spleen is a place where silver is preferentially stored, at least temporarily in the body. \n\nResults of this study were presented by the research fellow to other experts in the areas of immunotoxicology at the American Association of Immunologists annual meeting in 2013 and to the Society of Toxicology in 2014.  The results are currently being prepared for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/04/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Judith Zelikoff"
