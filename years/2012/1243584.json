 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predictive ice-sheet models are our best tools for understanding the cumulative effects of forcings and feedbacks upon the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). However, these models lack detail concerning the GIS basal boundary condition, which is a critical control upon ice flow. They also do not take advantage of the wealth of information contained in its internal radiostratigraphy, but that could become a key component of their validation and application as predictive tools.\r\n\r\nTo address this need for new constraints on ice-sheet models, funds are provided to develop, validate, and analyze a new radiostratigraphic database of the GIS. The database will be derived from past (e.g., PARCA, CReSIS) and ongoing (e.g., IceBridge) airborne radar-sounding campaigns. The research objectives are three-fold:\r\n1. Development of novel automated layer-picking techniques. Picking widespread layers in radar data is often a time-intensive process. Recent advances permit dramatic improvements in automated layer picking, which will yield both insights into the nature of ice-sheet radiostratigraphy and accelerate a more precise study of ice-flow history from it.\r\n2. Holocene surface and basal mass balance of the GIS. The picked radiostratigraphy will be combined with strain-rate modeling to map both Holocene surface-accumulation and basal melt rates across the GIS. This proven method will be extended beyond its previous application to northern Greenland, with uncertainties quantified using their knowledge of past ice-flow conditions. This study will both inform understanding of Greenland?s subglacial geology and provide key boundary conditions for ice-flow models of the GIS.\r\n3. LAYERMAP: A dated radiostratigraphic model of the GIS. The radiostratigraphic database will be gridded in a manner similar to that for bed elevation underneath ice sheets. LAYERMAP will contribute to the advancement of IPCC-level ice-sheet models of the GIS, whose projections of its future evolution will hinge on data validation of its modern state. In addition, LAYERMAP will provide a means of mapping basal conditions and englacial drainage features across the GIS.\r\n\r\nObservations suggest a recent acceleration of the contribution of a degrading Greenland Ice Sheet to global sea level rise.  Present projections of the rate of sea level rise are bounded by broad error bars, preventing accurate assessment of the response necessary to mitigate the impact of sea level rise.  This project will develop data sets needed to validate and constrain models of the Greenland Ice Sheets contribution to future sea level.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis collaborative project with MacGregor and Catania at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) has mapped the internal structure of the Greenland Ice Sheet for the first time.  Utilizing ice penetrating radar records produced by radars fro the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CRESIS) at the University of Kansas that were flown on NASA and NSF funded aircraft, the investigators at UTIG and UAF developed tools to track the internal layering in the ice sheet over more than one hundred thousand line kilometers of data.  This layering is produced at the surface of the ice sheet by deposition from the atmosphere, and leaves an age surface that is buried by subsequent snow and deforms as the ice flows under its own weight.  Using new techniques that track the changing range of individual layers from the aircraft, combined with techniques developed by investigators at the British Antarctic Survey, we built a set of software tools that allow semi-automated tracking of layers.  We determined ages for these layers using the age-depth scaled determined by deep ice core projects, and developed methods to interpolate the ages of additional layers from the ice-core dated layering.  The end result is a 3d view of the age structure, or stratigraphy, of the ice sheet.  This work carries intellectual merit for many subdisciplines of glaciology: it provides a direct observational constraint on efforts to model the flow and evolution of the ice sheet over time; it provides an estimate of the rate of input of snow to the ice sheet over long time periods, which is essential to these modelling efforts; it provides a picture of where ice from different climate periods can be found today, knowledge that will be useful for efforts at sampling that ice for paleoclimate studies.  The broader impacts of this work include the direct observational constraints on how ice in the ice sheet has responded in the transition into and then out of the last glacial period - any improved knowledge of the ice sheet\u00c6s responses to these climate shifts will help in efforts to understand what sort of responses one might expect in the future.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark Fahnestock"
