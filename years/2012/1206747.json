 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial support for the International Conference on Science and Technology of Synthetic Metals in Atlanta, Georgia, in July 2012. The conference is on the physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering, and technological applications of polymers and conducting organic molecular crystals. It is designed to provide the US organic semiconductors community with an international forum to discuss the state-of-the-art regarding not only the fundamental aspects, but also, significantly, the technology drivers. In addition, by holding the conference in the Southeast region of the US and with the support of the Georgia Institute of Technology, there will be a remarkable opportunity to broaden participation in the topical areas, through a concerted effort to attract both women and under-represented minorities to the Conference. All NSF funding will be used to support the registration of women and under-represented minority researchers or faculty members who are professors at a minority serving institution and who will bring minority students with them to the conference.",
