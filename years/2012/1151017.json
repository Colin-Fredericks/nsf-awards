 "awd_abstract_narration": "1151017 - Lee\r\n\r\nMercury is a toxic and persistent pollutant that bio-accumulates in the food chain. Human exposure to mercury occurs primarily by consumption of contaminated fish. Mercury in the environment is transformed into more toxic methylmercury; consumption of methylmercury may cause neurotoxic effects. Children and particularly developing fetuses are especially susceptible to methylmercury effects. A USEPA proposed rule, Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, requires coal- and oil-fired power plants to use maximum available control technology to reduce the emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants as of 2016. Among elemental, oxidized, and particulate-bound mercury species present in flue gas, elemental mercury (Hg(0)) is most difficult to control because of its low concentrations, low reactivity with other flue gas components via homogenous oxidation, and low solubility in water. This CAREER research plan will significantly advance the knowledge and fundamental mechanistic understanding of heterogeneous catalytic oxidation and adsorption using the reactions between Hg(0) vapor and transition metal chlorides. A detailed mechanistic study will be conducted to investigate the cyclic Deacon reaction involving transition metal chlorides for Hg(0) oxidation. Transition metal chlorides are proposed to be more effective in Hg(0) oxidation than metal oxides since they can readily eliminate the rate-limiting competitive HCl adsorption step. The reaction of Hg(0) with transition metal chlorides is a catalytic reaction such that chloride is consumed to form readily soluble and adsorbable HgCl2. The metal lowers the activation energy barrier for the oxidation reaction. This will lead to the further development of metal chloride-based modified selective catalytic reduction materials for simultaneous NOx reduction and Hg(0) oxidation, Hg(0)-specific catalysts, and sorbents. \r\n\r\nThis proposed research will enhance the capability to predict Hg(0) removal based on a fundamental understanding of physical and chemical principles. It will ultimately lead to advanced scientific knowledge and enhanced mercury control options needed for proposed mercury emission control regulations. It will also lead to various environmental remediation and separation technologies based on heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption, and absorption. The educational plan will provide co-benefits for chemical and environmental engineering faculty, students, and professionals in the areas of environmental catalysis, separation, and air quality/air pollution control. All of these efforts will ultimately increase awareness of mercury as a global pollutant and of best management practices for its control in flue gas emissions.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit Project Outcomes:\n\nMercury is a toxic and persistent pollutant that bio-accumulates in the food chain.  The uptake of methylmercury via contaminated fish is known to cause neurotoxic effects, particularly to children and developing fetuses.  It took longer than 20 years for the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule started to stringently regulate mercury emissions from electric utility steam generating units since the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments had passed.  Among elemental (Hg(0)), oxidized (Hg(2+)), and particulate-bound (Hg(p)) mercury species present in flue gas, it is crucial to oxidize elemental mercury to oxidized mercury to meet the stringent MATS rule requiring the use of maximum available control technology.\n\n \n\nThis project, CAREER: Heterogeneous Catalytic Oxidation and Adsorption of Mercury Vapor: Integrated Research and Education in Air Pollution Control, resulted in a fundamental understating of reaction mechanisms responsible for heterogeneous Hg(0) oxidation using the Deacon reaction.  Based on the reaction mechanistic studies, the project also demonstrated how the reaction kinetics can be used for the design and operation of catalytic reactors.  These mechanistic and kinetic studies exemplified the role and challenges of the heterogeneous oxidation of Hg(0) vapor with very low concentrations in typical coal combustion flue gases.  Sorbent injection is another option that can simultaneously control both of Hg(0) and Hg(2+) species.  The project also investigated the adsorption equilibrium and kinetics for mercury removal and resulted in a rigorous model that can be used to predict mercury separation by sorbent injection.  Overall, the project addressed scientific questions and technical challenges for catalytic Hg(0) oxidation and mercury adsorption, both of which are the key control options for mercury emissions.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts Project Outcomes:\n\nThe combustion of fossil fuels is likely to stay as a mainstream source of electricity generation for the next generation.  This project illustrated the practical and concurrent environmental issues associated with electricity generation and potential engineering options that our society can have.  The project not only performed fundamental scientific and engineering studies but also demonstrated what science and technology can do for the core economic driver of our society.  During the entire project period, opportunities were provided to many science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students.  Many undergraduate STEM students participated in the project as research co-op students and learn the technical challenges for electricity generation.  This project was also introduced to high school students who are interested in pursuing STEM disciplines for their future careers to emphasize the awareness of the Energy and Environment area as a crucial professional area for our society.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joo-Youp Lee"
