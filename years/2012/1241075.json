 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amazonia is Earth's most iconic center of biological diversity and endemism and is among the most important terrestrial biomes due to its contributions to global systems ecology. This project seeks to answer an overarching question in biodiversity science: How was the modern Amazonian biota and its environment assembled across space and time?  The research is designed to understand the evolutionary and environmental-ecological history of late Neogene-Recent Amazonia through a comparative approach that integrates across the disciplines of systematics, population biology, ecosystem structure and function, geology, Earth systems modeling and remote sensing, and environmental history. The project also investigates how biotic and environmental change over this time-period influenced Amazonian functional diversity in biogeochemical flows, and how these, in turn, shaped the dimensions of biodiversity seen today as well as the history of global-scale changes in biogeochemical cycling. \r\n\r\nThe project, which is a collaboration with Brazilian scientists and funding agencies, represents the most integrative examination of Amazonian biodiversity and its history to date.  The approaches taken describe a methodological template for analyzing information about the history of biotic and environmental change across large, ecologically complex landscapes that can be generalized to other systems.  The project creates a large framework for formal and informal education including the training of students, development of a major museum exhibit on Amazonia, workshops for K-12 STEM teachers, publications in professional educational journals, and a web portal, The Evolutionary Encyclopedia of Amazonian Biodiversity, that will make all results available to the public, as well as serve as an informational platform about Amazonian biodiversity and its global importance. This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.",

This is what we did on this grant.&nbsp; Corralling such dispersed and independent sets of researchers is not easy, nor is working with multiple funding agencies, but PIs Joel Cracraft of the American Museum of Natural History and Lucia Lohmann of the Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo did that partly a series of grant meetings throughout the course of the grant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our effort at the Field Museum has been focused on gathering more and better genetic data on the relationships in different groups of birds occurring across the basin.&nbsp; This work was done largely by Brazilian graduate students working in the museum&rsquo;s Pritzker Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Evolution.&nbsp; These interactions train new generations of evolutionary biologists and build ties across continents that will last far into the future.&nbsp; As we gather data on genetic relationships of birds across this incredible region, we are documenting that not all groups of birds are responding similarly to this landscape, and we are gaining a new understanding&nbsp; about the layered landscape history of Amazonia.&nbsp; One example is a comparative study of genomic structure of white sand specialist birds which is the dissertation research of Joao Capururcho (University of Illinois, Chicago and The Field Museum).&nbsp; White sands are a distinctive patchy habitat across Amazonia.&nbsp; The birds that specialize on these habitats appear to have much less genetic structure than Amazonian upland forest birds and we are learning from our geologist colleagues these soils can form in a variety of ways suggesting a complex history of this habitat across the basin.</p>\n<p>Because birds are comparatively well studied in terms of ranges and species level relationships, we also have been able to conduct an analysis combining the ranges for over 1700 species of South American perching birds (Passeriformes) with phylogenetic data on their relationships for grid points covering the entire northern portion of the continent.&nbsp; If one just looks at range overlap, traditional patterns that emphasize the importance of the modern river system in determining species distributions are seen.&nbsp; However, when one incorporates phylogenetic diversity and maps out the points that have greater phylogenetic diversity (older lineages across the total tree) versus lower phylogenetic diversity (more young lineages across the tree).&nbsp; The geographic pattern is dramatically different.&nbsp; The Amazon basin is divided into 3 areas that have older phylogenetic diversity (termed &ldquo;over-dispersed&rdquo;) which ae the Brazilian Shield, the Guianan Shield and the forests along the base of the eastern slopes of the Andes.&nbsp; The lowlands of western Amazonia are, in contrast, comprised of more young lineages (they are &ldquo;under-dispersed&rdquo;).&nbsp; Western Amazonia appears as a large triangle that narrows going eastward, but continues between the Brazilian and Guianan Shields all the way to the mouth of the modern Amazon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This pattern highlights a generally underappreciated pattern that is related to the landscape.&nbsp; The collaborative nature of this grant allowed us to integrate this finding ongoing work ornithological colleagues at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amaz&ocirc;nia (INPA), in Manaus, Brazil with new created models made by geologists from the Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo.&nbsp;
