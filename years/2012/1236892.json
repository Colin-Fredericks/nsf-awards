 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiments will be conducted to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the burning properties of fuel-air mixtures highly diluted with excess air or exhaust gas and thereby obtain knowledge that could be applied to improve the efficiency and reduce harmful emissions from internal combustion engines and other energy conversion devices.  Both hydrocarbon-air and hydrogen-air mixtures will be tested; hydrogen is entirely different from other fuels because of its lower minimum flame temperatures supporting combustion, low ratio of mixture thermal diffusivity to fuel mass diffusivity and lower heat losses, which lead to unique flame properties that are difficult to quantify.  Three sets of experiments will be performed.  First, to study the effects of turbulence, experiments in a jet-stirred combustion chamber will be conducted.  Burning rates, conditions for flame extinguishment and emissions will be examined for varying mixtures and turbulence conditions.  Second, to assess the effects of flame stretching, the burning rates and shapes of flame edges at the boundary between burning and extinguished regions of the flames will be studied in a turbulence-free apparatus.  Third, to study the effects thermal expansion without hydrodynamic strain (other than that generated by self-induced flow), the propagation rates and stability properties of flames propagating in narrow channels (i.e. Hele-Shaw cells) will be studied.  This is considered especially relevant since most laboratory experiments are conducted in open apparatuses where thermal expansion is relaxed in the directions parallel to the flame plane, whereas combustion in most practical devices (e.g., IC engines) occurs in very confined geometries where this relaxation cannot occur.\r\n\r\nThe use of fuel-air mixtures (particularly hydrogen-air mixtures) highly diluted with excess air or exhaust gas is an environmentally friendly way of operating internal combustion engines but the ability to employ these mixtures in engines is hindered by the lack of knowledge of the rates at which these flames burn, the flame shapes they produce, and if/when these flames will extinguish.  While many hydrogen fueled vehicles use fuel cells, it is still likely that for many applications, internal combustion engines will be the best power system due to the vastly superior power to weight ratio of engines compared to fuel cells even though the engine efficiencies are slightly lower than fuel cells.  Moreover, most of harmful emissions concerns of hydrocarbon-fueled engines are practically eliminated using hydrogen fuel.  The information obtained in this work will provide a better understanding of combustion of hydrogen, hydrocarbon and hydrogen/hydrocarbon mixtures.  This data will be beneficial not only for engine design, but also in reducing fire and explosion hazards associated with fuel manufacturing, transportation and storage.  The proposed work will support a graduate student and two undergraduates, the support for one of which is reserved for a member of an under-represented group.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThere is considerable interest in using fuel-lean or highly diluted mixtures for internal combustion engines and other power generation systems for increased efficiency and reduced pollutant formation. The data obtained in this work have led to a better understanding of combustion of hydrogen, hydrocarbon and hydrogen/hydrocarbon mixtures near extinction limits in laminar and turbulent flows and the effect of confined geometries, present in all practical combustion devices, on the resulting flame propagation.\n One very noteworthy finding of this investigation is the development of a vastly improved means of generating a turbulent flow field for combustion experiments that can far more readily be compared to the predictions of computer simulations than current experimental apparatuses allow.  This means consists of a spherical chamber with multiple inlet jets and outlet ports, each inlet jet surrounding by a concentric annular outlet port.  This arrangement may prove invaluable to other types of processes involving mixing and chemical reaction, e.g. in pharmaceuticals polymer processing.\n Another significant outcome of this work is an improved understanding of flames under highly turbulent conditions.  Turbulence increases the burning rates of flames, but too much turbulence may cause flame extinction.  This is an extremely complicated topic, but by extracting a much simpler one, namely the response of a flat flame edge to changes in composition and flow environment, an improved understanding of the behavior of flames near extinction conditions in turbulent flows has been obtained.\nMoreover, an important aspect of flames in combustion engines that is generally overlooked in laboratory studies is the fact that such flames exist in a highly confined space.  This work has shown that the effect of confinement is very substantial; such flames wrinkle severely and propagate at typically 3 times the speed a flat flame would in the same mixture.  These confinement effects are likely to become important additions to existing models of combustion in engines, leading to improved predictions of engine performance in ways that engine designers can use to improve fuel efficiency and minimize pollutant formation.\nThese data are beneficial not only to internal combustion engines and other mobile power plants, but also in reducing fire and explosion hazards associated with fuel production, manufacturing, transportation and storage. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul D Ronney"
