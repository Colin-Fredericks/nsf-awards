 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technologies are emerging as a promising mitigator against spectrum congestion resulting from the explosive growth in commercial and government wireless systems and services. One remaining challenge is the ability to establish reliable access to sufficient spectrum while avoiding harmful interference to other users when operating with imperfect situational awareness (SA).  This research effort is developing the technical underpinnings and system concepts for reliable DSA operations with incomplete and inaccurate SA in programmable wireless networks (PWN). A multi-disciplinary approach is pursued, combining elements of communication theory, multiattribute decision theory, distributed systems theory, and behavioral economics theory. It specifically develops a decision-theoretic core that operates over imperfect SA information, determining what spectrum access opportunities to pursue as well as what information to gather for increased awareness. Information acquisition algorithms encompass access to dynamic and static data sources as well as distributed sensing and fusion approaches for combining data from multiple collaborative PWNs.  Representation and reasoning of uncertainty is accomplished by Bayesian decision networks and probabilistic inference technologies. System performance is evaluated and validated via newly-generated spectrum scenarios and existing data collected in previous efforts. The technological developments enable PWN behavior and performance evaluation with respect to technical, regulatory, and economic domains.  The research outcome can accelerate DSA fielding and broaden DSA operations to improve public safety and wireless broadband access. Research results will be disseminated through technical publications, conferences, and PWN community collaboration. They will also be integrated into regular classroom, workshop, and short course teaching.",

A multi-disciplinary approach is pursued, combining elements of communication theory, multi-attribute decision theory, distributed systems theory, and behavioral economics theory. Specifically, situational awareness and multi-attribute utility models are used to identify key DSA decision attributes. Using the DSA decision attributes, multi-attribute DSA utility functions were developed, and studies were conducted on analyzing trade-offs between alternative performance and cost models.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nA formal mathematical foundation based on a Functional Causal Modeling (FCM) was developed as the core inference structure while incorporating uncertainty inherent in wireless communications and DSA operations.  The DSA probabilistic FCM approach is based on a paradigm with model composability, scalability, and extension to a probabilistic ontology. Several working examples were developed and demonstrated with potential performance and flexibility gained through in situ probabilistic causal reasoning.\n\nThe current FCC policies are based upon conditions that attempt to avoid interference conditions in nearly every operating condition; the result is behavior specifications leading to a loss in spectrum access potential.  The analysis results demonstrated the potential of probabilistic reasoning for adapting the radio's behavior (e.g., reducing the transmit power) in proportion to the degree of uncertainty.  It was demonstrated that significant performance improvements (both in capacity gain and interference reduction under a realistic environment) could be achieved over a non-probabilistic reasoning approach.\n\nAnalysis also demonstrated trades among competing cost models used by secondary spectrum providers.
