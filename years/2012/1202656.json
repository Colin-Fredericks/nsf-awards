 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to synthesize the research regarding the learning and teaching of evolution, laying the empirical foundation for the development of curricular resources. A truly effective curriculum, whether delivered in formal or informal settings, should include not only appropriate content, but should also be presented in a way that is developmentally appropriate, capitalizes on effective teaching and learning strategies, takes into account learners' prior knowledge and sociocultural background, and addresses the emotional and motivational issues that may arise. The proposed synthesis project consists of three stages. First, small groups of experts from cognitive and developmental science, evolutionary biology, formal and informal science education, and the philosophy of science will be brought together in a series of regional meetings. Second, the output of these meetings, a series of publicly released meeting summaries on the current state of research and practice, will guide the design of a three-day workshop to be attended by the entire group, at which the full framework will be assessed. Finally, subgroups will then be charged with producing synthesis products for researchers and practitioners.",
