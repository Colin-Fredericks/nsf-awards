 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor James V. Coe of the Ohio State University and his graduate student and undergraduate student researchers will be supported to develop methods for the spectroscopic study of particulate matter.  The research will use metal films with arrays of subwavelength-sized holes to obtain plasmonic-enhanced infrared spectra of trapped particles. The Coe group will also work on developing, calibrating and testing a Mie-Bruggeman model for analyzing the spectra that are obtained.  The researchers will study the spectra of airborne dust particles from a variety of environments and will investigate the production of arrays modified with latex spheres and inkjet spots.  The researchers will also attempt to build an instrument capable of recording the spectra of single particles.\r\n\r\nInfrared spectroscopy is an important analytical method that gives rich, detailed information about the chemical composition of matter.  The work of Professor Coe and his student colleagues is aimed at providing scientists with information about the chemical composition of particulate matter.  This research is important in that the small particles that the groups study are comparable to the kinds of respirable particles that can lead to a variety of health impacts.  Besides the broader scientific impact of this research, the research students participating in this research will be exposed to cutting-edge research in analytical chemistry with a talented researcher and educator.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Coe Group has invented a method to record scatter-free, infrared spectra of subwavelength particles using infrared plasmonic mesh.  Figure 1 shows a scanning electron microscope image of a single 4 micron dust particle caught in the hole of a plasmonic metal mesh, i.e. thin metal film with an array of microholes.  The technique has been applied to the study of airborne particles of ~4 micron size which are among the largest inhaled into people's lungs.  Increases in particulate matter are correlated with increases in mortality, so it is important to establish the amounts and identities of the chemical actors regarding the assessment of health risks.  Dust is important in astronomical investigations, diagnostic for human effects on the environment, and different environments pose different chemical health hazards, so dust is of great interest in health, meterology, and environmental science.  A Mie-Bruggeman model has been developed as shown in Figure 2 which yields volume fractions of the components provided that single particle spectra have been recorded for the pure components.  The current model provides determinations of two carbonates, gypsum, three types of clay, quartz, and three types of organic molecules.  The goal is to build a vast and expanding dust library of single particle infrared spectra for data mining, identification and quantification of dust components, optical properties of inhalable particles, and the testing of better dust models.  Currently, our dust library consists of single particle spectra from our lab air, a home filter, the 9/11/01 World Trade Center event, the International Space Station, snow piles from High Street in Columbus Ohio, and a collection of pure calibrants that are known to be in dust.  Our research program develops expertise across disciplines such as optical physics, spectroscopic imaging in microscopes, analytics and chemometrics of data libraries, and generation of new hyperspectral imaging techniques.   In addition to training graduate students in plasmonics, big data analysis, spectroscopy, and chemometrics, we continue to include large numbers of undergraduates in our efforts.        \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James V Coe"
