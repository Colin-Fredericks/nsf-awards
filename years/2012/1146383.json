 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Phenology\", the timing of biological events such as germination and flowering, is one of the most important responses of plants to climate change, and it has been shown to influence performance and local extinctions.  Different life stages must respond appropriately to seasonal environmental cues to match their development with the corresponding season.  This project seeks to understand how the timing of two crucial phenological events, \"germination and flowering\" can adapt to seasonal variation even though they share a common genetic basis and must respond differently to similar seasonal environmental cues.\r\n\tPleiotropy occurs when one gene controls more than one trait.  Understanding how multiple traits can adapt when they are controlled by the same genes is a major challenge.  Genes in a well known flowering pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana have recently been found to also regulate germination, thereby providing a powerful research system for investigating the genetic basis and adaptive significance of pleiotropy.  The major regulator of flowering, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), operates in a pathway that is one of the best characterized molecular pathways of an adaptively significant trait in plants, and it has become a classic system in ecological genetics.  It was recently found that the immediate downstream elements in the FLC-flowering pathway also control the germination behavior of seeds, and that natural variation in FLC is associated with natural variation in temperature-dependent germination. This project aims to characterize pleiotropic effects of FLC and other elements in its pathway on both germination and flowering phenology, identify sources of natural variation in FLC-mediated pathways, and measure the fitness consequences of FLC (and FLC-pathway) variation operating through germination and flowering.\r\n\tThis research explores the genetic basis of phenology and environmental cuing.  As such, the project will provide basic information on how plants respond to environmental change. The project will also generate genomic data and genetic material that will be made available to the research community through The Arabidopsis Information Resource.  This project will provide career opportunities and training in molecular genetics and ecological genetics to a postdoc, a graduate student, a research assistant, several undergraduates, and high school students.  An educational module will be designed also so that students can explore how genetic pathways influence organismal responses to environmental change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nPlants must time developmental transitions, including the transition from seed to seedling (germination) and the transition from non-reproductive to reproductive states (flowering), so that each life stage is matched appropriately to the seasonal conditions that permit its survival and growth.  Multiple life stages are regulated by the same seasonal cues, but they must be regulated by them differently to express optimal developmental timing.  We examined whether different life stages can respond independently to similar environmental cues, and whether different life stages employ the same genetic pathways to regulate their developmental transitions.  \n\n              This project examined whether the environmental regulation of seed germination and flowering employ the same genetic pathways.  The transition to flowering is regulated by distinct genetic pathways that are integrated through the gene Flowering Locus C (FLC).  FLC represses the transition to flowering.  The vernalization pathway represses FLC in response to a cold period, allowing plants to flower after winter has passed.  The autonomous pathway represses FLC under warmer temperature, allowing plants to flower under warmer conditions.  The photoperiod pathway is integrated downstream of FLC and promotes flowering under long days. We tested whether genes in each of these pathways, and whether FLC itself, regulates seed germination.\n\n              We found that seed germination responds to seasonal cues, including winter chilling, temperature, photoperiod, and light quality/quantity.  Many of these environmental factors influence germination as strongly or more strongly when experienced by the maternal plants than when experienced by the seeds themselves.  Maternal plants that experienced winter chilling before reproduction, short days during reproduction, and a vegetative canopy during reproduction all had higher seed germination.  Moreover, seeds sometimes responded in the opposite direction to a given cue when they experienced it themselves compared to when their maternal parent experienced it.  Therefore, different life stages can respond to the same environmental factor in different ways.\n\nRegarding the shared genetic regulation of flowering and germination, we found that FLC promotes germination.  The contribution of FLC was strongest at intermediate levels of dormancy, suggesting that it regulates fine-scale differences in the probability of germination over the course of a season.  Genes in the vernalization pathway contribute to germination.  Some contributed to germination in a manner that is predicted based on their roles as repressors of FLC (as seen in flowering), but others appeared to regulate germination either independently of FLC or via different modes of FLC regulation.  Therefore, the vernalization pathway has diverged in function in its regulation of flowering and germination, permitting more independent responses of flowering and germination to chilling cues.  Genes in the autonomous pathway also contribute to germination.  Most genes influenced germination in a manner consistent with their role as repressors of FLC, and the interactions among autonomous-pathway genes were also highly concordant between the regulation of flowering and seed germination.  Therefore, the autonomous pathway appears to be largely functionally conserved between the regulation of flowering and germination. We also identified additional genes in the photoperiod pathways that repress germination under longer photoperiods.\n\n              In summary, different life stages can respond to the same seasonal environmental conditions in different ways, even though the same genes are involved in the regulation of multiple developmental transitions.  Despite the same genes being involved in the environmental regulation of multiple life stages, several of those genes have acquired divergent functions in different life stages.  This divergence permits the independent regulation of different life stages in response to shared seasonal cues.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\n              The project provides information on the genetic basis of germination responses to seasonal environmental conditions.  The research thereby has direct relevance to seed production technologies.  The research also contributes to efforts to predict how plants will respond to changes in seasonality, which has relevance for agriculture and weed management, projections of species invasions, and identifying populations at risk of extinction.  By establishing that the same genes are involved in the regulation of multiple developmental traits, the research has direct relevance to plant breeding programs: artificial selection on one trait (e.g. rapid flowering time) may have unintended consequences for other traits (seed dormancy).  Understanding how shared genetic pathways independently regulate different traits will provide valuable information that can be applied to alleviating the constraints imposed by shared pathways.\n\nWe have developed unique genetic material that will be made available to the scientific community. We have also trained young scientists from diverse backgrounds, including twelve undergraduate students, two graduate students, two research technicians, and one post-doctoral researcher.  We hosted foreign visiting researchers in the lab to foster intellectual exchange across cultures.  The lab participated in outreach activities, including training ecologists involved in the restoration of areas devastated by Hurricane Sandy, participation in local science fairs and educational events, participation in summer workshops to train primary-school girls in STEM fields, and recruitment of high-school students from under-privileged backgrounds into summer research projects.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/12/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathleen Donohue"
