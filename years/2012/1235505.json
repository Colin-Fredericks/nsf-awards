 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many scientific disciplines, computational simulations form the third pillar of research complementing theory and experiment.  With simulations increasing in complexity, resolution and duration, visualization of intermediate results has become important in rapid assessment of simulation data.  Moreover with the ubiquity of sensing devices, joint analysis of simulation and observational data is emerging within research communities. \r\n\r\nThis project capitalizes on recent video standardization strides emerging within web communities.   It explores the use,adaptation, and optimization of these video capabilities within the cyberinfrastructure required for advanced computational science.   The resulting visualization aims to promote collaboration and facile sharing of scientific results among research and non-research communities.",
