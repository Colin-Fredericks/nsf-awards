 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop integrated, low cost systems able to capture and characterize light from 3-D scenes while minimizing or eliminating the need for off-chip computation. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research is in understanding the capabilities and limitations of imaging systems using diffractive angle-sensitive pixels to analyze the light field. This includes:  1) Developing models of how scene statistics are reflected in the output statistics of angle sensitive pixel arrays, and so developing algorithms to extract useful information about the scene, such as depth, 3-D directional motion, and object recognition. 2) Understanding how to optimize arrays of angle sensitive pixels to encode scenes at various focal depths, as well as how to best deploy signal selection, conditioning and processing circuits to take advantage of these arrays? signal properties when encoding real scenes.  3) Investigating new integrated diffractive structures that enhance ASP quantum efficiency and spatial resolution, and that filter the light field in new ways. \r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of this research will include enhanced imaging systems with applications in security, automation, health care, and scientific research, from wildlife tracking to microscopy. This work will also impact the commercial sphere by providing new capabilities in consumer electronics, helping to boost economic growth. These impacts are increased because these systems use standard CMOS manufacturing, and so can be mass-produced at very low size and cost.  This research provides an easily-understood example of low-level physics driving useful high-level function, providing compelling examples for recruiting and inspiring future engineers.",

or ASP).&nbsp; &nbsp;ASPs use diffractive structures placed over each light sensor to process and filter light based on its incident angle.&nbsp; ASPs, when combined with appropriate circuits and signal processing, can be used to extract information about the 2- and 3-D structure of a scene, even without a lens.&nbsp; Specifically, in this project we worked to 1) better understand the basic properties of ASPs and their response to real scenes, 2) to enhance ASP&rsquo;s performance with respect to sensitivity, and by enabling them to detect additional properties of light, and 3) by building arrays of these enhanced ASPs to capture real scenes, and processing those scenes to perform 3D reconstructions.</p>\n<p>One important aspect of ASP behavior that we explored was how ASPs capture not only incident angle, but also polarization angle.&nbsp; Since ASPs make use of nanoscale diffraction gratings of different orientations to get at incident angle, they also inherently extract polarization angle, and do so in a way that can be isolated from incident angle.&nbsp; Incident angle information allows us to characterize where a set of light rays originate (essentially by triangulation) and so find the 3-D location of an object.&nbsp; However, if the light rays are reflecting off an object and that reflection is specular (that is, if the object is shiny), then simple triangulation algorithms can become confused.&nbsp; However, many forms of specular reflection also result in a mild polarization of the reflected light.&nbsp; Thus, by merging polarization with angular information, we are able to better estimate where an object is, even if it is shiny. &nbsp;(See figures 1+2).</p>\n<p>A second important aspect of this work involved building better ASPs by changing how we generated the diffraction patterns that ASPs analyze to extract incident angle.&nbsp; Early versions of ASPs used &ldquo;amplitude gratings&rdquo; made up of stripes of metal separated by transparent (glass) gaps each 100&rsquo;s of nanometers wide.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this kind of structure reflects quite a bit of the incoming light (at least 50%), making ASPs work less well in the dark.&nbsp; However, it is known that replacing strips of metal with strips of glass of different thicknesses can generate similar effects by slowing the light down in some places more than others: these are called &ldquo;phase gratings&rdquo;.&nbsp; Although phase- and amplitude gratings generate somewhat different diffraction patterns when their widths are much greater than the wavelength of light, we found they acted very similarly when built on the same scale as the wavelength of light.&nbsp; Although this kind of research finding is not as exciting-sounding as building new kinds of cameras, this kind of careful study of such phenomena is critical for designing and building good sensors and cameras.</p>\n<p>A third, and perhaps most exciting result came from combining ASPs with single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs).&nbsp; SPADs are a semiconductor structure that allows the absorption of single photons to be detected as discrete events, and encodes then as bits changing from a &ldquo;0&rdquo; to a &ldquo;1&rdquo; in less than 1ns.&nbsp; Combining ASPs and SPADs in a single structure (figure 3) allows us to estimate both when single photons arrive, and where they came from, although doing this accurately requires gathering statistics across many photons.&nbsp; This kind of structure is interesting in that it inherently uses both the wave- and particle aspects of light: the wave aspect to do diffraction (to find angle), the particle part to extract time information.&nbsp; This is also a useful combination of capabilities for a variety of applications.&nbsp; In this project we demonstrated that an array of such angel-sensitive SPADs (Figure 4) could be used to eliminate both the lens and filter from a fluorescent microscope.&nbsp; Angle sensitivity allows an array of ASPs to capture enough information to locate fluorescent objects in a 3-D volume adjacent to a chip (within 1-3mm) without a lens (figure 5).&nbsp; Fine-grain timing information can be used to separate the excitation of fluorescent molecules by a brief flash of blue of violet light, and the subsequent fluorescent re-emission of green or red light in the nanoseconds that follow the flash.&nbsp;
