 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to establish a micro-scale additive manufacturing process based on dynamic mask video projection for the fabrication of three-dimensional computer-aided design models with high throughput. Novel approaches by integrating optical, mechanical and software designs will be systematically studied to elucidate the mechanisms through which a projection image can be continuously moved in high speed without losing its native resolution. The related process models and dynamic mask image planning techniques will be established to achieve the desired accuracy, resolution and speed. The educational objective is to promote engineering through hands-on education and product/process innovations based on additive manufacturing technologies. Key education activities include outreach to high school and community college students, new curriculum development for university and working professional levels, and an open source project for the general public.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will contribute a novel micro-scale additive manufacturing process that may lead to newer industrial applications and device designs in a host of industries such as aerospace, automobile, defense, medical, and consumer products.  The investigation into process modeling, process planning, and capability characterization will also result in a fabrication tool with gigapixel resolution.  Such a tool, if available, will significantly contribute to the future biomedical and engineering research related to tissue engineering and engineered textures.  Through its integrated education and outreach activities, this CAREER project would provide essential infrastructure, exciting teaching materials and interesting lab projects to students at every level from K-12 to graduates.  Advanced knowledge on additive manufacturing technologies and their novel applications would increase domestic students? interest in science and engineering and promote advanced manufacturing to a broader population.",

Three research activities have been planned to achieve the research objective including: (1) to develop a moving gigapixel imaging system that can achieve a high resolution and throughput for a large area;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;to verify the developed imaging system on building small features over a large area with desired accuracy and resolution; and (3)&nbsp;to fully demonstrate the fabrication capability of the MVP-AM process by using challenging test cases in biomedical and other applications. In the past six years, the PI and his students have systematically studied multiple novel ways of controlling projection light and laser energy dynamically in the photopolymerization-based additive manufacturing process. Applications of such multi-scale fabrication capability including biomimetic hydrodynamic structures have also been demonstrated.</p>\n<p>A number of significant results were found throughout this research and have been disseminated to the additive manufacturing community. First, a linear immersed sweeping accumulation process was developed to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) objects in a large area by using a moving accumulation tool immersed in liquid resin with dynamically defined mask images. The process can achieve multi-directional accumulation to enable building around inserts (Figure 1). Based on the idea, an immersed surface accumulation process was developed that can construct microscale features on the surface of a macroscale object by combining dynamically controlled light projection with 5-axis movement of the light guide tool. Based on the study results three journal papers have been published.&nbsp;The PI and his collaborators also investigated dynamically controlling mask patterns of an input laser by using different shaped beams that can be realized by switching apertures with designed micro-patterns. The capability of the developed AM process using shaped beams has been demonstrated in fabricating multi-scale 3D objects (Figure 2). To push the limit of multi-scale fabrication, the integration of the nanoscale two-photon polymerization process with the projection-based microscale and macroscale stereolithography processes has been investigated. An optical filter with multi-scale hierarchical structures has been fabricated using the developed hybrid process (Figure 3). Finally, the PI and his students also investigated how to compute mask images for a complex 3D model. A new adaptive slicing method was presented to find an optimal trade-off between the fabrication time and the surface quality (refer to Figure 4). Through the grant, a better understanding of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the photopolymerization-based AM process has been achieved to control the layer-based accumulation process.</p>\n<p>A second set of the results was obtained after investigating novel applications of the developed multiscale fabrication capability and demonstrating its potentials in various applications including biomedical engineering and interface technology. The capability of the mask video projection based AM process in building geometries with small and complex features distributed in a large area has been verified with desired resolution and throughput (Figure 5 shows a tested human lung example). The capability of the multiscale AM process was further tested in fabricating novel biomimetic superhydrophobic and superlipophilic structures inspired by Salvinia Molesta floating leaf (Figure 6). The 3D-printed eggbeater structure could have numerous applications including water droplet manipulation and oil/water separation. Two journal papers based on the study results have been published.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this project are shown through the opportunities provided to undergraduate and graduate students (including five female students) as well as three high school students. Through the grant for this work, two graduate students completed their Ph.D. dissertations, and one of them became a faculty member in a major research university in USA. Several undergraduate students conducted research under this grant, and gained hands-on experience with additive manufacturing equipments and processes. The constructed prototype systems were also used in the demonstration to industrial visitors and K12 students in various outreach programs over the grant period.</p>\n<p>In addition, the PI and his students published two review papers to share their thoughts on multiscale AM research status and future direction with the manufacturing research community. Based on the research results, the PI has also developed a new graduate course &ldquo;Advanced Topics in 3D Printing&rdquo; that was firstly offered in Fall 2013. During the project period, The PI also helped two graduate students in our lab to successfully launch a kick-starter project. With over $400K backing from the kick-starter project, a startup company (SprintRay) was created to develop the projection-based stereolithography process for digital dentistry. Finally the developed multiscale stereolithography process was part of the current infrastructures at USC&rsquo;s Center for Advanced Manufacturing that will be explored for various applications in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Yong&nbsp;Chen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
