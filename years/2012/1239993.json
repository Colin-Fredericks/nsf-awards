 "awd_abstract_narration": "This capacity building project involves Texas A and M University-Kingsville in partnership with Del Mar and South Texas Colleges and the Kingsville, Corpus Christi, and Pharr-San-Juan Independent School Districts.  They are developing a program to increase the number of mathematics, science, and technology certified students graduating well prepared to serve students in the many high needs schools in their area.  The Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, of Teacher and Bilingual Education, of Mathematics, of Biological and Health Science, of Chemistry, and of Physics and Geosciences are all involved in this planning phase.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This project involves the cooperation of senior faculty from a variety of departments. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The broad array of partners involved in this project indicates not only the broad impact the project has within the region of south Texas, but also its potential to serve as a model for other areas throughout the country with similar resources and challenges.",
