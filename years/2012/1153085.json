 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor John Gladysz of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University will explore both the synthesis and detailed chemical and physical characterization of two types of organometallic molecular devices, wire-like and gyroscope-like complexes. The former features sp-hybridized carbon chains that span transition metal fragments. The gyroscopes feature MLn fragments encaged by two trans-phosphorus atoms that are tethered by three hydrocarbon chains. The macrocyclic dibridgehead diphosphines can be decomplexed under certain conditions, undergo a fascinating dynamic process by which they turn themselves inside-out, and synergistically constitute promising ligands for some of the wire-like compounds.\r\n\r\nThe miniaturization of macroscopic devices represents one of the greatest challenges as society continually strives for smaller and more powerful and efficient consumer products such as mobile phones, computers, and personal and commercial vehicles. Molecular wires are necessary for the realization of molecular circuits and electronics. This project will provide broad in-depth professional training for undergraduate and graduate student coworkers, as well as postdoctorals. They will acquire cutting edge laboratory skills and develop their writing and oral presentation capabilities.",
