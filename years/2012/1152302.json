 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program supports work by Professor Akos Vertes at George Washington University - endowed to develop an analytical platform for investigating metabolism changes in single cells and in subcellular regions. This project aims to extend the reach of laser-based sampling techniques to enable the mass spectrometric analysis of single animal and human cells for the investigation of a vast array of biological problems. Prerequisites for this goal include the sufficient focusing and delivery of the laser radiation to the region of interest, improving the overall sensitivity of the method, extending the coverage of metabolites and lipids present in the cell, determining the chemical integrity and quantity of the sampled ions, and enabling high throughput single cell analysis. The PI also aims to explore the in situ analysis of subcellular domains within larger cells by combining micromanipulation and microdissection with laser sampling and mass spectrometry. Successful accomplishment of these goals will bring the capabilities of single cell mass spectrometry to a new level.\r\n\r\nIn a broader sense, the PI and his group develop new single cell and subcellular analysis tools and methods that enable the study of diverse biochemical processes relevant for chemistry and the life sciences. Due to the ability of the tools they are creating to address various unresolved problems, the research itself has a significant potential to benefit society. Integration of research and education in the project is closely tied to the direct involvement of K-12, undergraduate and graduate students in the process of scientific inquiry. Based on their existing and planned collaborations with industry, the students will also have an opportunity to be immersed in the conversion of new research results into methods and devices that are applicable in various fields relevant to society, including biomedicine, energy and homeland security. To broadly disseminate his research, the PI plans to engage the media to reach the general public and explain their results in an easily digestible format.",
