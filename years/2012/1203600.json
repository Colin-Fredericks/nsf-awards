 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1997 the University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) accepted responsibility for the extensive invertebrate collection (170,000 fossils from 12,100 localities) from the United State Geological Survey (USGS), Menlo Park. Unfortunately, the comprehensive documentation stored with the fossils was not preserved as archival material and is deteriorating.  Moreover, during the move the collection was scrambled, many of the wooden cases damaged, and the doors lost.  In 1998, one third of the collection was integrated into UCMP's main collection.  This project will (1) re-house the remaining two thirds of the collection in museum-grade cabinets, (2) reorganize, re-label, and digitally capture the contents of the drawers, and (3) digitally capture and store the documentation in archival media.\r\n\r\nThis collection, largely from the West coast of North America from the last 25 million years, is unique and irreplaceable. It has generated over 1,000 publications, including systematic and biostratigraphic studies, paleoecological and paleoclimatic research, resource assessments, and geologic surveys.  This project will provide important curatorial experiences for graduate students and will also engage undergraduate students in authentic research activities. The Berkeley's Biology Scholars Program, which promotes the success of students from economic, gender, ethnic and cultural groups historically underrepresented in biology, will assist with undergraduate recruitment. The project will also provide increased science awareness to a broader public audience as we make available, both physically and digitally, this world-class paleontological collection.",

The 2012 NSF-CSBR grant to the University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) funded the purchase of sixty custom fabricated steel collections cabinets, drawers, and acid-free specimen trays were purchased to house these UCMP collections. During the past three years, UCMP staff and students transferred over 100,000 individual fossils from overcrowded trays and unsealed wooden cabinets to new acid-free paper trays in archival museum drawers and cabinets. The fossils include mollusks: bivalves, gastropods, cephalopods and scaphopods, as well as echinoids, decapods, and barnacles. The removal of fossils from wooden cabinets is an important step to counter the effects of acid leaching out of wood that could react with mollusk shells composed of calcium carbonate, causing a recrystallization of shell microstructure that irreparably damages specimens. To ensure that this does not occur, the fossil clams, snails and other shells were transferred to acid-free paper trays, accompanied by updated acid-free paper labels.
