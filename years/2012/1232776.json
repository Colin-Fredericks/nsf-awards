Bailey\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests CY 2012 operational funding support for the West Coast Van Pool which is managed by Oregon State University. The West Coast Van Pool is located at the OSU's marine facility in Newport, Oregon.  The West Coast Van Pool supports federally-funded oceanographic research by providing properly outfitted and maintained portable laboratory vans of all types to the Academic Research Vessel Fleet.  Pooling of portable capital equipment such as this (1) provides \"Centers of Expertise\" with logistical support for science and ship operators; (2) provides equipment that is \"Free at the Point of Use\" to NSF-funded users which relieves burden on science and ship operations grants; (3) provides a mechanism for non-NSF funded users to share maintenance costs by paying established daily rates; (4) reduces the need for duplication of equipment at multiple institutions which results in a long-term cost savings to the federal agencies; (5) generates improved budget transparency on actual costs to operate and properly maintain capital, shared-use equipment; (6) allows NSF to make proper equipment purchase decisions based on science needs and provide the appropriate, dedicated, long-term support budgets; and (7) improves the quality and reliability of equipment.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The research projects supported by the equipment pools have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit with all equipment deployments coordinated with University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) ship time requests.  During operations, vessels in the Academic Research Vessel Fleet routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Oregon State University participates in a large number of public outreach programs and open house events.  OSU also operates the NSF-owned R/V OCEANUS as part of the Academic Fleet now that the R/V WECOMA has been retired from service.",

The lifetime of the award was extended through June of 2020 in order to provide time for the construction of a new Cold Van for the pool.  Funding for the new cold van was provided from outside insurance revenue collected by OSU and applied to the award when one of the WCVP cold vans was damaged in a foreign port.\n\nFunds received by the West Coast Van Pool supported a variety of projects and equipment needs, including normal maintenance and repairs.
