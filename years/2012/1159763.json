Minerick\r\n\r\nThis NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations program supports the acquisition and installation of a BioForce Nano eNablerTM Instrument to facilitate bioparticle and proteomics separation research at Michigan Tech and in the Upper Peninsula region. The microprinting tool will enable work by Professors Adrienne Minerick, Caryn Heldt, David Shonnard, Wan Jin Jahng, and others. Specifically, we will explore high sensitivity, high-resolution electrokinetic protein separations, molecular recognition blood cell separations, optimizing cellulosic enzyme catalysis for separations, and isolating proteomic biomarkers of retinal degenerative disease.  The Nano eNablerTM is essential equipment infrastructure for the Biotechnology Research community (BRC) and will be utilized to make innovative contributions to chemical and biological separations. The PI's proposed projects all harness the versatile, femtoliter printing of biological materials to defined locations with nanoscale accuracy offered by the Nano eNablerTM. The potential bioparticle separations applications range from hemoglobin variant diagnosis, exploiting peptides for specialty viral/pathogen capture, optimizing cellulase activity and separations, to proteome isolations and are fully compatible with fluorescence or quantum dot-based indicators. Common advantages with each application include significantly smaller sample consumption, higher sensitivity, lower detection limits, as well as faster and higher separation efficiencies. This shared instrumentation will enable the PI's research to meet the demand in the scientific and industrial communities for smaller scale bioseparations, with concurrent simpler preparation, simpler operation, and versatility. \r\n\r\nThe Nano eNablerTM will transform research capabilities, enhance research graduate and undergraduate student education and training, and augment course instruction. The PIs have strong mentoring track records and are committed to actively recruiting undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups to participate in research activities. Minerick's surface isoelectric focusing research has the potential to impact protein separations, hemoglobinopathy diagnosis, and thus health care practices on a global scale and contributes to the philosophies of sustainability by decreasing resource utilization for chemical analysis. The PI team has a strong publication record of intellectual contributions in their respective fields and acquisition of this instrument will facilitate innovative and ongoing bioseparations research projects.",
