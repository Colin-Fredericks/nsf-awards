Due to ship problems, the first of 2 cruises scheduled as part of this project could not be completed. The RAPID funding is required to allow the PI's to be ready to deploy the HOT profiler as soon as a cruise can be fit into the ship schedule. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe HOT profiler project seeks to substantially improve our ability to observe the ocean on long time scales at locations not serviced by cabled observatories by supplying power and bandwidth to profiling vehicles. If successful, the technology will greatly benefit both of these groups. Additionally, the scientific knowledge gained will likely improve our understanding of the seasonal cycles of internal waves, which are of great import to the improvement of circulation models.",
