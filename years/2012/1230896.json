 "awd_abstract_narration": "Program Director's Recommendation \r\nCenter for Connection One (C1) \r\nProposal # 1230896 & 1231043 \r\nKiaei and Krunz \r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks funding for the Center for Connection One (C1) located at the Arizona State University (lead site) and the University of Arizona. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. \r\n\r\nCognitive radio (CR) and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technologies have received great attention in recent years. While the former is viewed as a key enabling technology to improve spectrum utilization, the latter has already proved itself as a powerful signal processing technique for increasing spectral efficiency. Through sensing and/or probing, CRs can opportunistically communicate on temporarily available spectrum bands while avoiding interference with spectrum-licensed primary users (PUs). This project is focused on developing novel techniques for optimizing network resources in a cognitive wireless network with multi-antenna capability. Both centralized and distributed solutions will be studied, in homogeneous and heterogeneous opportunistic spectrum environments. Adaptive rate and optimal antenna beam forming strategies will be developed. The proposed work also explores new ways for reconfiguring the antenna elements of a cognitive MIMO system.         \r\n\r\nThe proposed project is expected to have significant technological impact in the areas of cognitive MIMO communications and reconfigurable antenna design. Efficient solutions will be developed and validated theoretically and experimentally. These solutions will facilitate the introduction of a new generation of high data rate opportunistic services and applications, including opportunistic media delivery. Networked consumer electronics will particularly benefit for the proposed research. The PIs extensive collaboration with Raytheon on CR systems will be leveraged to enable prototyping possibilities of the proposed solutions. Graduate students involved in this project will gain valuable theoretical and practical experience on CMIMO designs.",
