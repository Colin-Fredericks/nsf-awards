 "awd_abstract_narration": "Migratory connectivity for full-cycle conservation of imperiled songbirds\r\n \r\nConnecting geographically distinct areas used by migrant songbirds is a formidable challenge.  However, migratory connectivity is a research frontier that is essential for understanding population dynamics, informing global conservation plans, and building a framework within which ecological questions about speciation, energetics, disease transmission, and much more can be addressed.  It is particularly important to identify population-specific wintering grounds for species experiencing dramatic declines despite apparently high productivity on breeding grounds.  In collaboration with researchers from many universities and government agencies, two fast-developing research tools (stable isotope analysis and light-level geolocation) will be employed to identify migration routes and wintering grounds for golden-winged warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) from ten populations across the species' breeding range.  This research will allow investigation of associations between wintering-ground anthropogenic land-use patterns and breeding population trends, and to develop a global conservation plan for this species of high conservation concern.  This study will provide a blueprint for investigating range-wide migratory connectivity and initiating global conservation efforts for other migrant songbirds, many of which of are experiencing similar long-term declines.\r\n \r\nThe Fellow will continue to work with Native American communities in Minnesota by developing a curriculum for schools and summer academies to nurture ecological and environmental interest in underserved Native American youth.  The Fellow will also conduct individual educational programs for Native American elementary schools near the study sites.",
