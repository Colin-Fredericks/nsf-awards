 "awd_abstract_narration": "This theoretical research program, to be performed by a collaboration among Dr. Mark Edwards of Georgia Southern University and researchers at the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI), an institute run jointly by the University of Maryland and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), will be devoted to the exploration of new ultra-cold atom interferometer designs, inspired by techniques developed in Quantum Information Science, for the avoidance, minimization, and correction of decoherence in quantum computers. These new designs will be targeted toward improving the sensitivity, stability, and robustness of ultra-cold atom interferometers. Applications of such interferometers include enhanced navigation sensing, precision metrology, and quantum information processing.\r\n\r\nThis program will enable two talented Georgia Southern University undergraduate physics majors to gain cutting-edge research experience in the area of ultra-cold atom theory, thus advancing discovery while promoting learning.  A Virtual Research Group will be established in which Georgia Southern students will attend the weekly Quantum Information/Bose-Einstein meetings at NIST via the internet. The project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by maintaining an established collaboration among an undergraduate institution (GA Southern), a national laboratory (NIST), and a major research university (University of Maryland). Broad dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding will be accomplished by bringing distinguished scientists to the Georgia Southern University campus to present colloquia and to hold face-to-face research meetings. Finally, development of new interferometric methods for precision sensing using ultracold-atom systems can provide the foundation for a new generation of practical devices that will find applications in navigation, metrology, geodesy, and studies of the fundamental properties of matter.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n  The major focus of the theoretical research project supported by this grant has been on ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs).  A BEC is a gas of ultra-cold atoms all of whose matter-wave shapes are the same.  In the laboratory, laser light is used to shape the gas into a flattened ring.  This is an example of an \"atomtronic\" system which is analogous to \"electronic\" systems which neutral atoms replacing flowing electrons.\n\n  The major scientific work accomplished on this project included (1) devising an approximate mean-field theory specifically for atomtronic systems, (2) modeling experimental techniques for probing the flow of atoms around the ring in a ring-shaped BEC, (3) modeling hysteretic behavior that occurs when a ring BEC is stirred with laser beams (a work that was featured on the cover of the 13 February issue of the journal Nature), (4) a theoretical analysis of resistance to flow in a ring-shaped BEC, (5) probing the behavior of a ring BEC using phase reference, and (6) gaining a theoretical understanding of shock waves in a ring BEC.  All of these projects included a strong and significant collaboration with experimental groups.  These results were reported in six published and two submitted papers in such journals as Nature, Physical Review Letters, Physical Review A, and the New Journal of Physics.\n\n  All of these research efforts added to the understanding of the emergent field that has come to be known as atomtronics.  Atomtronic systems have the potential for applications in precision navigation and in metrology.  In order to realize the applications potential of these ultra-cold systems, a fundamental understanding of their behavior is key.  The accomplishments support by this NSF grant represent a significant step toward achieving that understanding.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\n  The work performed on this grant was primarily accomplished by undergraduate students.  Nine undergraduate students from Georgia Southern University were supported by funds from this grant.  These students were Noel Murray, Hadayat Seddiqi, Micheal Krygier, Brandon Benton, and Calib Lanier, Elizabeth Ashwood, Benjamin Eller, Brennan Coheleach, and Kayla Warren.  Four of these students are still undergraduates while several others are now attending graduate school in physics at universities such as Cornell and Georgia Tech.\n\n  All of these students had their undergraduate educations enriched by their research experience.  Enriching activities included the opportuntity to interact with high-functioning research scientists from other institutions, attending and presenting talks at national meetings such as the March Meeting of the American Physical Society (APS) and the APS Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (DAMOP) meeting.  One student even had his name on a paper that was featured on the cover of the journal Nature and was co-authored by a Physics Nobel Prize winner (Bill Phillips).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/06/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark A Edwards"
