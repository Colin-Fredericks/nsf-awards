 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to improve undergraduate student education in STEM at Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). This will be accomplished by: i) identifying common issues that prevent HSIs from obtaining extramural funding which may impact student retention and graduation rate; ii) connecting STEM educators at HSIs throughout the country through the creation of a centralized faculty development network website: and iii) providing access to available resources recently supported by NSF. At the core of the project is a symposium that will be held at the University of Texas El Paso centering on the improvement of HSIs R&D funding rates. The outcome of this work will result in better trained faculty, establishment of communication network between HSIs around the country, and documented resources for faculty to use. The proposed work will contribute to the strengthening of HSIs capacity for performing high quality research in various STEM disciplines and providing research opportunities for undergraduate students. This will increase participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and contribute to the building of a competent STEM workforce.",
