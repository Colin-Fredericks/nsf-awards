LISN is a distributed observatory composed of GPS receivers, flux gate magnetometers, and Vertical Incidence Pulsed Ionospheric Radar (VIPIR) ionosondes installed principally in the western half of South America. The work carried out under this grant will collect, store, and disseminate real-time ionospheric observables - a nowcast - and to conduct dedicated campaigns and investigations leading toward developing a predictive capability - a forecast - of the electrodynamics and stability of the low- latitude ionosphere over South America.",
