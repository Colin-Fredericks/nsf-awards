The workshop is scheduled for April 12-14, 2012, in Arlington, VA. Over 150 participants are expected to attend, and a Leadership Council has been formed to assist in the planning. The goals of the workshop are to (1) enhance the opportunities presented by the BIO REU Common Assessment Tool (2) advance Ethics/Responsible Conduct of Research training at the undergraduate level, (3) share ideas for improving individual program implementation including reporting; and (4) discuss best practices in student recruitment, international and interdisciplinary research experiences, and mentor training. These goals will be accomplished through presentations and breakout groups and through opportunities for discussion and networking among participants. A final report will be submitted to NSF that will summarize the workshop findings. A website for BIO REU program directors, faculty, and students has been developed and launched (http://www.bioreu.org) and will be used to facilitate implementation of recommendations from this workshop. The PI, Alan Christian, may be contacted for more information at Alan.Christian@umb.edu.",

The workshop included training and professional development for these academic leaders in responsible conduct of research for undergraduate students, development and refinement of the Common Assessment Tool that enables REU program leaders to evaluate student learning gains and evaluate student outcomes across REU sites.  The workshop culminated in a series of recommendations to the leadership council to advance new models to strengthen the student experience including support for mentor and student teams to present reseach at scientific meetings enabling undergraduate students to experience the \"full circle\" of reseach from development to dissemination and peer-review.  The PIs also made recommendations to enable the dissemination of best practices for recruitment and application processing, broadening participation and the development of new models of undergraduate research training through international research.  Outcomes of the worksop as well as new tools and approaches developed by the community as a result of the workshop are available at http://bioreu.org.
