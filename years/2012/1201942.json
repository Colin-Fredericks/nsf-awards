 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially support a conference focused on cathodoluminescence that is scheduled for October 24 - 27, 2011, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Gaithersburg, MD, under the sponsorship of the MicroAnalysis Society (MAS) and the Australian Microbeam Analysis Society (AMAS). The conference is supported and organized by staff of NIST, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia and the University of NSW, Australia.\r\n\r\nCathodoluminescence (CL) is the non-incandescent emission of light (photons) emitted from a luminescent material excited by an electron beam. CL implemented in an electron microscope is an advanced microanalysis technique that enables high sensitivity, high spatial resolution characterization of trace elements and defect microstructure within a wide range of materials. These microstructural defects strongly influence the optical, electrical and mechanical properties of technologically important nanoscale and bulk materials including ceramics, dielectrics, semiconductor and optoelectronic device materials, etc. CL analysis of microstructural defects in minerals is also of particular importance in the geosciences providing for example, unique high sensitivity information about mineral chemistry, crystal growth, formation conditions, alteration, diagenesis, context for geochronological measurements, and provenance information of oil and mineral deposits.\r\n\r\nThe meeting in October 2011 at NIST will be first meeting of its kind on cathodoluminescence microanalysis and has stimulated national and international interest and participation. The meeting follows the proven successful MAS Topical Conference format that includes hands-on laboratory demonstrations, in addition to invited and contributed conference presentations. The laboratory demonstrations will take place in the Advanced Measurement Laboratory of NIST's Surface and Microanalysis Science Division where a range of state-of-the-art CL systems, CL analysis software and supporting instrumentation are available to participants. In addition, other CL systems and ancillary equipment not represented in the NIST laboratories will be installed for the duration of the topical conference. Poster sessions will be a highlight of this conference, allowing additional involvement, particularly by students, post-doctoral fellows, and other early career researchers. The excellent NIST venue will provide the opportunity for a maximum of 80 participants (including professionals, vendors/ sponsors and students) to attend the topical conference on CL.",
