 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energy Geotechnics is an emerging discipline in which geotechnical and geological engineers, geologists, and other scientists/engineers employ the principles of engineering physics and soil mechanics for the advancement and design of renewable energy systems, such as wind energy foundations and collector systems, geothermal heat pumps (deep exchange wells and shallow systems in unsaturated soil), and recovery of biogas in bioreactor landfills. This REU Site will engage undergraduate researchers in this nascent area of developing and important research. The University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) is at the leading edge of energy geotechnics as evidenced by our development of internationally attended, continuing education short courses in the areas of wind and geothermal energy, new courses in wind energy within the College of Engineering and, most importantly, multi-faceted research initiatives to measure the thermal gradient in deep wells in Wisconsin, wind turbine geotechnical design, biogas extraction and recovery in bioreactor landfills, and the physics of coupled moisture and thermal flow in unsaturated energy applications.\r\n\r\nThe undergraduate research projects will focus on the study of important problems related to the development of efficient energy systems as related to geotechnics. These problems include the study of the thermal-hydraulic processes in unsaturated soils, thermal resistivity of soil as correlated to physical properties (e.g., soil water characteristic curves and particle properties) for its application on energy transmission of wind energy systems, evaluation of the geothermal potential in Wisconsin, and the effects of liquid addition and leachate recirculation on waste compaction and biogas generation. All these problems relate the use of geotechnics with the more efficient development of energy systems.\r\n\r\nUndergraduate participants will be involved in outreach and discovery activities engaging other learners. The proposed outreach and teaching activities will leverage learning across multiple societal levels and education environments to engage society on the need for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics in creating an informed public. Activities are developed to engage undergraduate researchers within the following programs: Camp Badger Targeted 7th and 8th Grade Outreach, Increasing Sustainable Energy Awareness through Grade 1 to 8 Outreach, and participation in Continuing Education Courses in Energy Geotechnics\r\n\r\n\"This site is co-funded by the Department of Energy in partnership with the NSF REU program\"",
