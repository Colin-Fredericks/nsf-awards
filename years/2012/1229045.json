 "awd_abstract_narration": "As imaging technologies have developed, scientists and engineers have leveraged these advances to remotely sense the environments in which we live to complement and/or replace in situ measurements of the same.  Remote sensing has evolved to include photography, sonar, radar, radiometry and most recently LiDAR (light detection and ranging). This award will provide a ground-based LiDAR system, also known as a 3D terrestrial laser scanner, for use by researchers, research trainees and students from throughout the University of Vermont (UVM). The instrument will rapidly produce 3D digital datasets and scans over time will result in 4D data that can capture the evolution of environments over days, seasons, and/or years.  The instrument will be used to monitor natural environments such as snowpacks, streambeds, agricultural land and forests.  In addition, the instrument will be used to assess built historic, civil and transportation infrastructure. The project team comes from diverse fields as civil, electrical and environmental engineering, geography, geology, forestry and computer science.\r\n\r\nThe 3D terrestrial laser scanner will provide new and unique capabilities to the State of Vermont's only research University and will enable new interdisciplinary research at UVM and new collaborations throughout the State. The acquisition is also synergistic with existing entities at UVM working in the areas of transportation, spatial analysis and complex systems. Finally, the instrument will provide new opportunities for UVM students by enhancing the Engineering curriculum and an existing minor in Geospatial Technologies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs imaging technologies have developed, scientist and engineers have leveraged these advances to \"remotely sense\" the environments in which we live and to complement and/or replace in situ measurements of the same.  Beginning perhaps with landscape photography, remote sensing has evolved to include sonar, radar, radiometry and most recently LiDAR (light detection and ranging). LiDAR systems were initially very large and implemented for defense related purposes (e.g., airborne terrestrial mapping).  The advent of lower-cost and more compact/portable designs has enabled the recent introduction of terrestrial LiDAR systems (TLS).\n\nA NSF Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award was granted to the University of Vermont (UVM) in 2012 to purchase a TLS (image). A TLS can rapidly produce 3D digital datasets of environments, be they natural or built.   These datasets can then be integrated with other data on the environment.  For example, a LiDAR scan can be added as a GIS layer along with maps, photography, census data, etc. to better understand land use changes.\n\nAt UVM, the TLS has been utilized for a variety of research projects.  One example is capturing physical representations of historical structures, such as at UVM (image), for which architectural plans may no longer exist.  The TLS has also been used to scan natural environments over the course of a winter to better understand snowpack evolution through a season.  Such data can inform water resource managers as to spring runoff conditions.  The TLS has been employed to quantify the effects of streambank erosion to better understand sediment and pollutant transport downstream.  In one study (image), an ~6 m of streambank located near a farm sloughed off in a single storm event.  The TLS data allowed researchers to calculate that nearly 330 m^3 of material was lost over a 25 m reach.  From this information and soil samples taking at this location, it was estimated that nearly 400 kg of phosphorous was released downstream from this section alone.  Such data can be used to inform the public in regards to the propensity of algae blooms, swimming hazards, etc. that may occur in lakes downstream. \n\nThe TLS has also been used to enhance the student experiences at UVM.  Both graduate and undergraduate students have been trained to use the instrument for a variety of class and research projects.  The TLS has also allowed faculty to capture data to demonstrate concepts formally presented only theoretically.  For example, the deformation of single point load on a beam was previously presented through derivations.  Through the use of the TLS (image), experimental data can be collected that illustrates the modeling equations hold true.\n\nIn short, the TLS has enabled students and faculty from numerous disciplines at UVM to produces large 4D datasets (3D-spatial + 1D-temporal) that can be utilized to better assess/model and/or to complement existing field-based efforts on their researched environments.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeff L Frolik"
