 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harvard University has been awarded a grant to construct two walk-up canopy towers and tramways for instrumentation at Harvard Forest, a 1,600-hectare field station for education and research. The towers will: (1) allow researchers, educators, and students to access canopies of hemlock- and oak-dominated forests; (2) be equipped with permanent arrays of environmental sensors; (3) provide a hub for a wireless communications network linking Harvard Forest research data and facilities to university researchers, K-12 classrooms, and anyone else who is interested in learning more about forest ecosystems; and (4) create a \"platform-in-the-sky\" so visitors to Harvard Forest can learn about forest ecology from the ground up.\r\n\r\nResearch in forest canopies is at the frontier of ecological research, and Harvard Forest is a leader in studies of temperate-forest canopies. These two canopy towers will: create new opportunities for research and education; enable data from canopy-based experiments to be streamed onto the Internet in real time; and forge stronger linkages among existing installations, including: the 25-year-old Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research Site; a 25-year-old Summer Research Program in Ecology; a 35-hectare Smithsonian Institution Global Earth Observatory forest dynamics plot; and the core site of the Northeast Domain of the National Ecological Observatory Network. For more information about Harvard Forest, please see the website at http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu.",

Groups included high school students (e.g., UNH Project SMART), university classes (e.g., Harvard University OEB Foundations of Biological diversity), and professional groups (e.g., Northeast Area Association of State Foresters).  Groups often are accompanied by a representative of the Harvard Forest education and outreach department who discuss the instrumentation on the tower (with a focus on phenology and photosynthesis), the eddy-flux measurements being taken from the other towers visible in the distance, and land-use history and tree physiology as evidenced in the surrounding landscape.  While the tower is only one part of the tour, it has become a highlight for many of the returning classes. \n\nThe Hardwood tower has allowed for further expansion of the Harvard Forest Field Wireless network.  As a result, streaming data from the Bigelow Brook hydrology sites are updated every 15 minutes on the Harvard Forest web page and signal reliability has been improved to other sites in the area. \n\nResearch on the Hardwood tower includes phenology cameras (\"phenocams\") (Andrew Richardson, Harvard University), continuous measurement of canopy fluorescence (Jim Tang, The Ecosystem Center at MBL), and measurements of volatile organic compounds and fluxes (Karena McKinney, Harvard University).  A REU supplement supported a student to work with Karena McKinney to conduct leaf level measurements of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). \n\nThe installation of the 34-m Hemlock tower and new foundation for the existing 24-m Hemlock walk-up tower have created complimentary observation platforms that will allow us to study the decline of the hemlock forest due to the hemlock wooly adelgid, and its subsequent conversion to a black birch-dominated forest.

REU supplements supported 2 of the 5 REU students that worked on the tram.  These students have presented posters on their work at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union, the Ivy Symposium, and the Harvard Forest annual symposium.  One student continued his work with an independent study project designing the tower and structural supports to suspend the tram 14-m over the clear-cut forest.  Four electrical engineering students at University of Massachusetts Amherst used the tram project as the basis for their senior design project.  Six of the undergrads were engineering majors, allowing them to take the theory they learned in their classes and apply it to a project that is being implemented in the field..."
