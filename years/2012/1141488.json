Ford\tDepartment of Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia\r\nBrian D. Wood \tSchool of Chemical, Biological, and Environmental Engineering, Oregon State University\r\n\r\nChemotaxis is the ability of motile bacteria to sense chemical concentration gradients in their local surroundings and swim toward higher concentrations of pollutants that they degrade. In the subsurface, \r\nbioremediation is often hindered by the inability to achieve good mixing between injected substances and \r\nthe resident contaminants. In such situations, chemotaxis might be exploited to enhance the mixing of \r\nbacterial populations within contaminated zones. The goal of this study is to connect direct experimental measurement of chemotaxis in physically and chemically heterogeneous porous media with appropriate mechanistic descriptive theory. Two main hypotheses will be used to organize the research effort. They will combine both (a) multiscale experimental observations, and (b) a multiscale upscaling analysis to develop a theoretical framework that can describe chemotaxis in chemically and physically heterogenous media at microscopic and macroscopic scales. The first hypotheses is that in porous media with trapped sources of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) pollutants, chemotactic bacteria will have measurably slower transport than non-chemotactic bacteria.  In particular, chemotactic bacteria will exhibit greater retardation and tailing than will non-chemotactic mutants because of selective trapping of chemotactic bacteria at the fluid-NAPL interfaces. The second hypothesis is that transport of bacteria under chemotactic versus non-chemotactic conditions are dramatically different in the presence of large-scale heterogeneities.  Although chemotaxis is inherently a pore-scale process, the net influence of chemotactic bacteria on transport from high to low conductivity regions of a heterogeneous medium will be experimentally measurable, and will have relevance to bacterial transport in the field. This project will combine innovative experimental designs for data collection and upscaling to develop multiscale models for chemotaxis. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this research is to develop an understanding of the macroscopic scale (bulk) transport behavior of chemotaxis in porous media.  This necessarily involves linking the macroscale transport to the essential microscale features of the system that control chemotaxis. Improvements in the ability to measure phenomena at small scales has lead to experimental data sets that contain detail that was nearly unimaginable even a decade ago. The development of such extraordinary data sets has also frequently promulgated the question ?how does one make sense of these data? Is there a way to search for essential features of behavior in them?? New archetypes for data analysis (e.g., machine learning algorithms, data mining) have been employed as methods to assess such data sets. When applied to the problem of large data sets arising from physical systems, upscaling methods are among these data analysis archetypes. Outcomes from this proposal will result in more robust models for predicting microbial transport in groundwater systems, which will lead to improved design and implementation of bioremediation schemes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was collaborative research (Oregon State University and the University of Virginia) on how to improve the movement of bacteria in the subsurface.  Bacteria are sometimes used by scientists and engineers to help clean up contaminants that are in the soil or groundwater.  Bacteria are ubiquitous in nature, and often the native bacteria in the subsurface are stimulated by the addition of nutrients to conduct the contaminant-destruction process. \n\nOne of the important considerations about cleaning up contaminants is how to get the bacteria to the locations where the contaminants exist.  Some bacteria can move toward such contaminants (which they view as a food source) using a process called chemotaxis. \n\nThis research focused on developing a better understanding of the process of chemotaxis in the subsurface, with the hope of being able to develop better predictive models for the contaminant destruction process.  As part of this work, we developed theoretical models for the process of chemotaxis in the subsurface, and compared these models with observations from experimental systems.  These results are being reported in a separate Project Outcomes Report by our collaborators at the university of Virginia.\n\nAnother part of this research concerned how bacteria adhere and detach from the materials in the subsurface; this process is critical to the overall process of bacterial movement toward contaminants, but is not well understood.\n\nWe developed a new model to describe the adhesion and detachment of bacteria to solid surfaces (such as the solid grains comprising soils and other subsurface materials).  Bacteria are very small (less than 1 micrometer, or 1/100th the diameter of a human hair), but they still have very complex surfaces.  In Figure 1 we illustrate the structure of the outside of a bacterium.  One can see that, for this particular bacterial species, the surface contains a surface that looks \"furry\" and rough. This surface is made up of a mixture of complex biomolecules that include proteins and long-chain carbohydrates; in general, we simply call them polymer chains.  One of the questions that we asked was \"does the roughness of bacterial surfaces influence their ability to stick to surfaces?\". \n\nTo answer this question, we developed a new kind of mathematical model that would predict the amount of adhesion of a bacterial cell as a function of how close it was to the surface.  As bacteria approach a surface, the \"longest\" polymer chains attach to a surface first (Figure 2, part A).  Once attached however, these long polymers become compressed, and like a spring, resist the attachment process (Figure 2, part B).  Once adhered, however, the opposite process occurs during detachment.  Initially as a cell is \"pulled away\" from a surface, the polymer chains are stretched; again, like springs, the polymers tend to resist the detachment process (Figure 2, part C).  Finally, after enough force has been applied, the polymers may either release from the surface (like a \"post-it\" note does) or rupture (like the case of very sticky tape that leaves behind a residue) (Figure 2, part D). \n\nIn our research, we found that this process is very different for \"fuzzy\" surfaces as compared to smooth ones.  We found that fuzzy surfaces offered many advantages to bacterial adhesion, including the occurrence of a \"longer range\" of stretching before the bacteria were removed from the surface.  We were able to use our mathematical model to represent the kinds of details often seen in experimental measurements of bacterial adhesion and detachment.  In Figure 3, we show the results of our model predictions (left) with those of experimental measurements.  Our mathematical model well represents both the adhesion component of the process (in red) and the detachment process (in blue).  This ability is unique to our model.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian D Wood"
