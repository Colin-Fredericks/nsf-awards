 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing new techniques for manipulating sensitive data by exploring two related areas, computing on private keys and computing on authenticated data.  Currently, a private key is an inert object that gives its holder the ability to perform a cryptographic operation on all messages, as may be the case when generating a signature.  The project is exploring a new vision, in which computing on the private key itself creates new restricted private keys that can only perform restricted operations such as, for example, signing only some messages but not others.  In the case of computing on authenticated data -- data for which integrity is important but secrecy is not -- the project is developing new tools to compute on such data and obtain authenticated results.\r\n\r\nThe project is committed to the dissemination of research results, education of students, and outreach to industry.   Overall, the proposed project will produce a next generation of technology for managing authenticated and encrypted data while advancing the field of applied cryptography and educating the next generation of researchers.",

We realized new design techniques that enable these primitives to support more advanced functionalities and be proven secure under weaker number-theoretic assumptions.  One example of a complex system that can benefit from this research is the area of cryptocurrencies.  This project also supported research related to distributed anonymous payments from a practical perspective.\n\nOverall, the project resulted in nine publications in top venues plus a PhD thesis at Johns Hopkins University.   It also provided opportunities for research participation by undergraduates.\n\nWe highlight a few results.\n\nHIGHLIGHT 1\nFirst, in Ahn et al.

With such signatures, it is possible for a third party to derive a signature on the object m&prime; from a signature of m as long as P(m,m&prime;)=1 for some predicate P which captures the \"authenticatable relationship\" between m&prime; and m. Moreover, a derived signature on m&prime; reveals no extra information about the parent m.
