 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to design, code, document, test, dissememinate, and maintain Stan,an extensible\r\nopen-source software framework and compiler for efficient and scalable Bayesian statistical modeling.\r\nStan is an extensible, open-source, cross-platform software framework for developing Bayesian statistical\r\nmodels. The first step in Bayesian modeling is setting up a full probability model for all quantities of\r\ninterest. Stan facilitates this process by providing an expressive and extensible domain-specific\r\nprogramming language for specifying probabilistic models. By compiling a model specification into\r\nexecutable code, Stan fully automates the second step of Bayesian inference, calculating the probabilities\r\nof unobserved quantities, such as model parameters and future observations, conditional on observed data.\r\nThe third step involves evaluating the fit of the model to the data and its predictions for unseen data.\r\nWhen the model is easy to encode and inferences are fast and automatic to compute, it is easy to iterate\r\nthe specification, fit and evaluation steps in order to refine the scientific model.\r\nStan improves on the existing state of the art in both algorithmic and implementation details. Rather than\r\nbeing interpreted on the fly like its predecessors, Stan models are compiled to C++ code, which\r\ndramatically improves both scalability and efficiency. Stan provides a full algorithmic differentiation library for the functions required for statistical modeling. This method applies the chain rule from calculus to the program computing the probability function in order to calculate derivatives efficiently and accurately (a small multiple of the time taken to compute the\r\nfunction, independently of dimensionality). This allows Stan to fully automate the model fitting stage\r\ngiven only a specification of the probability function in Stan's modeling language.\r\nTo maximize Stan's accessibility to the scientific community, it is being coded using standards-compliant\r\nC++, so that it will run under Windows, Macintosh, and Unix/Linux. To make running Stan even easier,\r\nit is callable from R, MATLAB, and Python, the three most popular platforms for numerical analysis,\r\nincluding exploration and plotting.",
