 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Nicholas Ryan Hill of the University of Wisconsin-Madison to conduct a research project, entitled \"Improving Identification Methods of Pulsating Star Properties,\" during the summer of 2012 at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand.  The host scientist is Dr. Karen Pollard.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in using a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated spectral synthesis computer code to study non-radially pulsating stars.  To identify properties and pulsation modes of these stars, scientists must generate synthetic spectra to compare to the spectra of an observed star.  Since the synthesis is computationally expensive, only limited amounts of spectral data can currently be analyzed.  GPU acceleration of this task will thus allow scientists to study more of these stars to better understand their environments and evolution.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Additionally, the GPU spectral synthesis code developed during this research project will be made openly available for others to use in their work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAsteroseismology is the practice of measuring how stars pulsate in order to understand their stellar interiors.  Since the pulsations are not visible to the naked eye, even for the Sun,  we use telescopes to measure the light spectrum for a star.  Then, we see how the spectrum varies in time to measure how a star pulsates. To interpret what those variations say about the star's physical properties, we have to compare the spectra to those you calculate from theoretical models and determine what model best matches the spectrum.\n\nMy role in this process is to calculate the model spectra provided a star's temperature, mass, radius, rotational velocity, and pulsation properties.  I do not study stars that pulsate uniformly across the surface, ie: radially, but rather stars that pulsate non-uniformly.  We call such pulsations non-radial (see image).  Because of this, the pulsations are of a specific \"mode\" that describe where pulsations occur across the surface.  The pulsation properties I have to consider then are the star's pulsation modes as well as the pulsation frequencies.\n\nIn order to interpret what happens in actual stars, I compare those calculations to observations of these non-radial pulsators.  Since I do not observe, I traveled to the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zeland to work with Dr. Karen Pollard under this EAPSI fellowship.  Her research group observes a specific class of non-radial pulsators called &gamma; Doradus stars that exhibit short frequency pulsations.\n\nWhile visiting, I learned about how observers analyze their spectra to compare it to models like mine.  We discovered that difficulties she and her research group had interpreting their observations with model spectra may be due to exclusion of certain rotational effects in a star's pulsations, which my models account for.  I thus set about implementing the calculations necessary to compare my model spectra to her group's and am continuing that work and collaboration now that I have returned to the US.\n\nDuring my time at the University, I also delivered a physics and astronomy departmental seminar about calculating spectra for pulsating stars and attended other seminars to learn about the Maori tradition of astronomy.  I have since included some of the images and videos I created for my seminar and facts about Maori astronomy in the talks I give as a part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison's NSF program Universe in the Park. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicholas R Hill"
