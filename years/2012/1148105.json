 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmogenic Beryllium-10 (10Be) in quartz is widely used to quantify rates of erosion and weathering in landscapes.  10Be is useful in the study of surface processes because it is produced only near the ground surface, and thus provides a measure of the residence time of mineral grains in soils.  These residence times can be readily interpreted in terms of erosion rates averaged over hundreds to thousands of years, making them nearly ideal in studies of landscape evolution and soil sustainability.  There are problems with the use of quartz, however.  It is not present in all landscapes and its chemical preparation requires the use of hazardous hydrofluoric acid, limiting the number of laboratories that are able to process samples.  This project will develop 10Be in magnetite as a new tool for determining catchment-averaged rates of erosion and weathering.  For most purposes, erosion rates from magnetite would be just as useful as erosion rates from quartz.  Magnetite, however, is easier to separate from other minerals and its chemical preparation is far less hazardous and expensive.  The project's contributions will include development of rapid, cost-effective mineral separation and chemical preparation techniques.  This should open the use of 10Be to a whole new community of researchers.  The project will test the method in three landscapes where erosion and weathering rates have been intensively studied.  In addition, it will explore the coupled use of 10Be in magnetite and quartz as a new, readily measured index of the catchment-averaged degree of chemical weathering.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, it was extremely difficult to measure long-term rates of erosion and weathering, in part because the timescales of human observation are usually short compared to the timescales of landscape erosion. Over the last 20 or so years, cosmogenic nuclides such as 10Be in quartz have provided new tools for measuring rates of erosion and weathering averaged over hundreds to thousands of years. This has fueled a revolution in quantitative understanding of surface processes. Yet measurements of erosion rates in some landscapes have remained difficult because the preferred cosmogenic target mineral, quartz, is not present in all rock types. Hence cosmogenic-based erosion rates have rarely been measured in volcanic landscapes, for example. Moreover, all of the work on cosmogenic nuclides is done in just a few dozen labs around the world because quartz is not easy to prepare for analysis of 10Be, and costly, specialized equipment is needed to handle the large volumes of hazardous acids that are involved.  Usage of the mineral magnetite has the potential to overcome these difficulties.  10Be is produced within it in much the same way as it is in quartz.  It is present as a trace mineral in many rocks where quartz is absent.  Moreover, magnetite is easier to separate and dissolve than quartz.  Hence, techniques developed in this project promise to open the use of 10Be to new landscapes where quartz is absent, and also to new researchers who lack resources for the specialized equipment of quartz separation and dissolution.  Magnetite and quartz weather at different rates.  This raises the exciting possibility that 10Be in the mineral pair magnetite and quartz from the same stream will yield an index of chemical weathering in soil.  This research will focus on fieldwork at two of NSF's Critical Zone Observatories (Luquillo and Southern Sierra), thus capitalizing on existing infrastructure investment for studying weathering processes and their relationships with geology, climate, and ecology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDetermining the rates of erosion, chemical weathering, and soil formation is important for understanding how landscapes respond both to land use such as agriculture and forestry, as well as to long-term changes in tectonic uplift and climate.  One of the best ways to learn about erosion rates is to measure the accumulation of cosmogenic nuclides&mdash;rare particles that are produced in mineral grains near the ground surface by nuclear interactions with cosmic rays.  To date, nearly all erosion rates determined with cosmogenic nuclides have been based on the buildup of aluminum-26 and beryllium-10 in the mineral quartz.  This is because quartz is resistant to weathering and it is relatively easy to separate chemically pure quartz from rocks and sediment.  However, large parts of the world completely lack the mineral quartz, and have been largely inaccessible for cosmogenic nuclide methods.  This is especially true for landscapes on volcanic and ultramafic bedrock.  In this work, we developed a new tool for measuring erosion rates based on the cosmogenic nuclide chlorine-36 in the mineral magnetite.  Magnetite, like quartz, is resistant to weathering.  It is also relatively easy to separate from other minerals.  Unlike quartz, however, magnetite is common in volcanic and ultramafic rocks. \n\nWe developed and tested a robust chemistry for preparing chlorine-36 from magnetite, and tested it in two ways.  First, we determined the production rate of chlorine-36 in magnetite by measuring its concentration in glacial moraines of known age, as well as by comparing it to beryllium-10 in quartz from a rock that contained both quartz and magnetite.  Second, we compared erosion rates from quartz and magnetite in a variety of granitic watersheds that contained both minerals.  The results agree, confirming that the method works. The magnetite method is now tested and ready for expansion to other sites.\n\nIt is worth noting that this proposal was originally funded to measure beryllium-10 in magnetite, not chlorine-36.  Why the change?  Although we were able to measure beryllium-10 in unweathered magnetite, we found the method to be difficult to reproduce.  Even a small amount of contamination due to weathering products completely overwhelmed the beryllium-10 in the magnetite.  Despite repeated attempts, we were unable to develop a robust, reliably reproducible method for isolating beryllium-10 in magnetite, especially for stream sediment that is highly weathered.  The chlorine-36 method that we developed instead is much more reliable and works just as well, and with it we successfully met our research goals. \n\nThe most significant broader impact of this work is that our new methodology is far safer than that for beryllium-10 in quartz, and so we hope that it will open up state-of-the-art cosmogenic nuclide techniques to researchers at smaller institutions that lack the specialized infrastructure required to process quartz.  In particular, our new methodology avoids the use of deadly hydrofluoric acid and beryllium, so it can be done in standard wet chemistry laboratories.  In addition, this work contributed to the training of a promising graduate student, and enhanced international collaboration with researchers in Brazil.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Darryl E Granger"
