 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides support for the U. S. National Commission on Mathematics Instruction (USNC/MI), a primary means for ensuring U.S. participation in mathematics education at the international level. The project will facilitate periodic contact and interaction with mathematicians and mathematics educators from around the world as issues about instructional practices are addressed. The participation of representatives of USNC/MI on the international stage opens venues for collaborative research and opportunities to learn about successful practices from other countries. The USNC/MI regularly communicates with many professional organizations in mathematics education throughout the United States with reports and updates. \r\n\r\nA major function of ICMI is to authorize studies on issues of current international concern in mathematics education, and the next topic to be addressed will be instruction related to number in the primary grades. Another thrust of the USNC/MI is to be represented at the International Congress in Mathematics Education that is scheduled every four years. The ICME-12 meeting will be held in July 2012 in Seoul, Korea and USNC/MI will be organizing several events and hosting a major exhibit throughout the week long meeting.",

The USNC/MI serves as an indispensable\nconnector between the U.S. and the international mathematics education\ncommunities.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nUSNC/MI activities advance its core mission, which is to facilitate U.S. participation in ICMI activities and engage the U.S. community in advancing mathematics education in the U.S. and throughout the world.  This grant has\nsupported appropriate U.S. representation at ICMI, international research and\ncollaborations, and the U.S. involvement in international studies and\nworkshops.  Since the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is in a unique position between professional societies and international scientific unions and organizations, this committee took advantage of the NAS network to disseminate its activities and products.  Because it is very important to this USNC to work closely with professional societies, once a year the committee provides an update to all the related professional society leaders. \n\n \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe work of this committee is very important for the advancement of mathematics education in the U.S.  Policy makers, preK-14 mathematics educators, professional society leaders, mathematicians, researchers, and graduate students, among others, benefit from USNC/MI activities.  This commission provides a vehicle through which the NAS reaches out to and coordinates international activities with the U.S. mathematics education community. Commission members represent U.S. interests in ICMI activities and, along with the representatives of other member countries, help shape the agenda and activities of the international commission. ICMI plays a key role in international scientific collaborations and mathematics education policy, while the USNC/MI is the intermediary between ICMI and the U.S. mathematics community. The outcomes of this grant are many:\n\n\n-The NAS' USNC/MI maintained the U.S. representation in the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI) and facilitated the U.S. participation in ICMI activities while engaging the U.S. community in advancing mathematics education in the United States. \n\n\n-The USNC/MI nominated Roger Howe (Yale University, NAS member), who was re-elected to serve a second term as a member of the ICMI Executive Committee.\n\n\n-Since Sybilla Beckmann has participated in ICMI Study 23, the U.S. perspective on whole numbers has been included in this study.  The\nstudy has been completed and the proceedings are now available http://www.umac.mo/fed/ICMI23/proceedings.html.\n\n \n\n-The U.S. was well represented by two delegates (Rick Scott and Janine Remillard) at the 2012 General Assembly of the 12th International Congress on Mathematical Education in Seoul, Korea (ICME-12). \n\n\n-The United States was one of only 5 countries invited to give one of the National Presentations at ICME-12. The USMC/MI oversaw the U.S. participation in the Congress, which consisted of the following activities:\n\nNational Presentation sessions that were attended at maximum room capacity\nU.S. Exhibit, which was a great success\nCapsule Summary Fact Book, which was distributed through the flash-drive provided by the U.S.\nU.S. reception for 150 attendees, which included a \"Speed Networking\" experience.\n\n\n\n-This grant is linked with another NSF grant (DRL 1127579) that supported the travel of 50 students, teachers, researchers and math educators to attend\nICME-12.  As a result, they have shared their knowledge and experience with others across the country by hosting presentations in their institutions, national conferences, and by producing publications. \n\n\n-In collaboration with Seoul Na..."
