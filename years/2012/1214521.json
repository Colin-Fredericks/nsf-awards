 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Thomas Curtright and Luca Mezincescu at the University of Miami.  \r\n\r\nThis project concerns a number of formal (mathematical) aspects of string theory and quantum field theory. Specifically, the PI's propose to examine the symmetries, geometry, and topology of superstring theories.  Topics that will be investigated include mathematical deformations and non-commutative geometries in quantum mechanics;  scale and conformal invariance and the behavior of real systems under changes in scale (renormalization group);  and Nambu algebras and their applications to conformal field theories and the dynamics of strings and branes.  \r\n\r\nThis work is also envisioned to have a number of broader impacts.  The proposed research activities will advance discovery and understanding while simultaneously promoting learning at a major research university.  This work will also contribute to the enhancement of the human-resource infrastructure for research and education at the University of Miami.  Finally, the results of this research will be disseminated broadly in colloquia and seminars, on internet web-pages, on internet archives, and in printed journals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project were to further the understanding of several  outstanding contemporary problems in theoretical physics, hence to  elucidate the structure of the real world.  These problems have  originated in intensive, worldwide research, both experimental and  theoretical.  The intellectual merit and rewards of this project are  largely self-evident, from a historical perspective, as major advances  often emerge from the invention and study of explicit, simple models.\n \n New static solutions were found for a system where hypothetical scalar  fields (i.e. localized disturbances that do not carry intrinsic spin,  like the Higgs boson), now known in the literature as \"galileons\", were  added to Einstein's theory of gravity.  The result was that many such  solutions did not have event horizons.  That is to say, the  effect of the galileon field is to produce \"hole\" solutions which are no  longer \"black\" --- in principle, material could escape from these  configurations after penetrating arbitrarily close to the singularities  at the centers of the solutions.  These results are a first step towards  constructing \"wormhole\" solutions that might be stable due to galileon  scalar field effects.\n \n Novel models of strings were constructed to describe the physics of  particles constrained to ideal surfaces, to be used eventually as models  of real surface systems (graphene?  surfaces of topological  insulators?).  These constructions closed a gap in the literature on  string theory that had been around for about forty years.  The most  interesting examples are supersymmetric systems that include \"anyons\"  --- i.e. particles with unusual statistics that are believed to exist in  a variety of physical systems on surfaces.\n \n Other unusual quantum systems were invented for which time evolution is governed by a set of several different Hamiltonians (i.e. energy functionals).  Again, ultimately, such  systems may be found in the real world.  Or, as Feynman once said, \"It  is quite possible ... we may discover that in nature the relation of  past and future is so intimate ... that no simple representation of a  present may exist.\"\n \n Finally, explicit and previously unknown matrix polynomial  representations were obtained to describe the rotations of quantum  systems with arbitrary spin.  These representations provide the ultimate  solution to a problem posited over eighty years ago by Wigner, when the  quantum mechanics of spin were first investigated.\n \n This project had broader impact.  Teaching young scholars is an integral  part of the career responsibilities of the principal investigators, and  is fully symbiotic with the research carried out during this project.   The proposed research activity promoted learning at a major research  university, the University of Miami, by providing new paradigms for  students to consider.  The work contributed greatly to enhance the human  resource infrastructure for research and education at the University.   The project results were disseminated broadly in colloquia and seminars,  on internet web-pages, on internet archives, and in printed journals.   Society will benefit even further from the project activity in ways that  are difficult to anticipate, but which clearly exist given the  wide-ranging applications of the work done.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas L Curtright"
