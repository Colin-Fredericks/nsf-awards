 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rockhurst University (RU) and Loyola University Maryland (Loyola) are collaborating to create three multi-week upper-division active learning physics modules in fiber optics and light delivery, nuclear physics and nuclear medicine, and pressure in the human body that relate physics principles to medicine. The modules can enhance student learning through their implementation in a Physics of Medicine (POM) Program currently in place at RU and in development at Loyola. The target audience is students with one year of physics and a minimum of Calculus 1. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The goals of the three year project are the following: (1) Increase student learning in physics content areas that are chosen because there is either a lack of suitable material on the topic or because students exhibit alternate conceptions on the physics; (2) Enhance students' attitudes and beliefs about physics and learning physics and encourage increased enrollment in upper-division physics courses, especially by women; and (3) Increase student understanding of the scientific process through an engaged learning process -- asking questions, analyzing data, drawing conclusions. \r\n\r\n Broader Impacts: The project contributes to STEM education through its creation of new learning materials guided by research on teaching and learning in POM and designed to deal with areas in which students need to strengthen their physics understanding. The transformative nature of the project is inherent in the design of the POM Program with active learning and curricula related to students' interests in medicine. This approach enables students to make interdisciplinary connections, enhance conceptual understanding, and analyze quantitatively. Data from the project are contributing to the STEM body of knowledge on the performance of students (content/attitude) in upper division physics courses that apply physics principles to the medical field. This project broadens the participation of underrepresented groups by increasing the number of minors and potential majors in physics, and by increasing the underrepresented female student population in physics. Project modules are designed to be transferable to other universities with complete instructor manuals for easy implementation in different programs. Materials are being disseminated on the web and ComPADRE and through publications and presentations. By implementing well-designed, relevant, and interesting physics courses, the POM program can be sustainable. As a benefit to society, this project can lead to a better prepared generation of healthcare professionals and well-educated scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNature of Project and Intellectual Merit: \n\nRockhurst University (RU) and Loyola University Maryland (Loyola) designed this project to introduce transformative change in undergraduate physics education through the creation of new learning materials guided by research on teaching and learning in Physics of Medicine.  The main focus of the project was the creation and development of upper-division active learning physics modules that relate physics principles to medicine:  Fiber Optics and Light Delivery in Medicine, Physics of the Respiratory System; Physics of the Cardiovascular System and Physics of Nuclear Medicine &ndash; Gamma Camera.   \n\nGoals:  The goals of the project addressed the needs for a deeper understanding of physics as it relates to medicine for pre-health students, a lack of this type of curriculum in the field, an enhancement of students\u00c6 attitudes/beliefs about physics and learning physics, and a desire to increase the population (especially female) in upper division physics courses through an engaged learning process &ndash; asking questions, analyzing data, drawing conclusions. \n\nOutcomes of Project: \n\n1)      Products:  Physics of Medicine Module Development: Four Physics of Medicine Modules were developed &ndash; Fiber Optics and Light Delivery in Medicine (published in 12/15), Physics of the Respiratory System (in final revisions), Physics of the Cardiovascular System (multiple classroom testing - undergoing revision) and Physics of Nuclear Medicine &ndash; Gamma Camera (in development.)   Each module is designed to be a complete active learning curriculum, incorporating physics principles integrated with medicine scenarios to address medical imaging and the function of the human body in health and disease.  The modules are written with an inquiry-based pedagogy so that students are actively working through the module as they learn the physics in each section.  Learning objectives are included for every section, and assessments have been designed to match to each learning objective.   Activities include hands-on work with grant-developed experiments, inquiry based questioning, problem solving and homework activities.  These activities are synthesized with medical case studies, videos and questions that place learning in a context that relates the physics studied to medicine and students\u00c6 future career interests. \n\n 2)      Data:  Data from the project contributes to the STEM body of knowledge on the performance of students (content/attitude) in upper division physics courses that apply foundational physics principles to the medical field.  Data from content and attitudinal pre-posttests at Rockhurst strongly indicate that the Physics of Medicine modules have enhanced both students\u00c6 learning and attitudes toward physics.  As further evidence of success of the project, Rockhurst has seen a large increase in enrollment in its Physics of Medicine Program with 60% of the incoming students being female. \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThis project addressed a need for an incorporation of physics principles into an area of relevance for our students interested in a healthcare career.  Enormous advances rooted in basic physics principles have been made in scientific technology to improve healthcare both diagnostically and therapeutically.  Physics is needed to understand the biomechanics of the human body, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, the electrical system of the body, the functioning of the eyes and ears, the optics used in modern medicine, the vast array of medical imaging procedures, and the use of nuclear physics in imaging, therapy, and surgery.  As physics is intricately involved in medical diagnosis and treatment, an understanding of the physics involved in medicine will add to a better generation of health care professionals. \n\nThe transformative nature of this collaborative research project is inherent in the design of the project-developed hardware and experimentation integrated with medical scena..."
