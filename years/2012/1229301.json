 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor David Saiki from California State University-Bakersfield and colleagues Andreas Gebauer, Carl Kloock, Danielle Solano and Karlo Lopez will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) self-diffusion measurements of solution phase hexameric insulin; (b) synthesis of macrocyclic systems; (c) synthesis of bioactive cyclic peptide natural products and their derivatives; (d) synthesis, screning and development of small molecule inhibitors of lysyl oxidase; and (c) identification of compounds responsible for fluorescence in terrestrial arthropods.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at the California State University-Bakersfield and neighboring institutions such as such as Tuft and Bakersfield College.",
