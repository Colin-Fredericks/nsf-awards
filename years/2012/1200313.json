 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop \"Connections Between Algebra and Geometry\" will be held at the University of Regina, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, May 29 - June 1, 2012. The workshop will be held immediately before the Canadian Mathematical Society (CMS) Summer Meeting June 2 - 4, 2012, at the same site.  This workshop will introduce participants to current research topics in the intersection of Algebra and Geometry. The workshop will consist of three courses (Differential Graded Commutative Algebra; Secant Varieties; Fat Points and Symbolic Powers) for graduate students and recent Ph.D.?s that will partially prepare participants for one of the special sessions being organized at the 2012 CMS Summer Meeting and will create long-lasting collaborations.  Travel and lodging support to facilitate participation, especially for graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s, is a key element for the success of the workshop. The main goals of this workshop are to help participants in the field to: interact with leading researchers in Algebra and Geometry; learn about recent developments in these fields; exchange ideas with one another; and develop collaborations with other mathematicians in Canada and the U.S.A. for future research. In addition, we plan to share the course information and progress made during the workshop with the broader mathematical community.\r\n \r\nEach day of the workshop will consist of a lecture and related problem session for each of the three courses.  In addition, there will be plenty of time reserved outside of talks for additional interaction. The workshop will provide a focused venue for graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s, and established researchers to enrich their background on diverse aspects of the disciplines, to learn about recent developments, and to establish connections with other researchers.  In addition to the stimulation and enrichment of the research careers of the students and early career participants, participants from non-Ph.D. granting institutions will take ideas from the conference back to their colleagues and students, stimulating further research and mathematical enrichment at their home institutions.  Full details of the workshop can be found at the conference web-page:  http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~ssatherw/Regina2012/index.html.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award funded two meetings:  the workshop entitled Connections Between Algebra and Geometry which took place at the University of Regina, SK, Canada, May 29 - June 1, 2012 and a follow-up meeting entitled Further Connections Between Algebra and Geometry which took place at North Dakota State University, February 2-3, 2013.  Both activities were aimed at graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s.   The workshop (see http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~ssatherw/Regina2012/) was framed by three courses.  For each of three courses, a daily 60-minute lecture and 60-minute associated problem session was given each day for four days.  The lectures were given by established experts in the fields and the problem session assistants were young faculty who work in the areas.  The courses' instructors and assistants were:  \n\n* Fat Points and Symbolic Powers - Brian Harbourne (Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln) and Susan Cooper (Assistant Professor, Central Michigan University)\n\n* Differential Graded Commutative Algebra - Sean Sather-Wagstaff (Assistant Professor at the time and now Associate Professor, North Dakota State University) and Kristen Beck (Post-Doctoral Fellow, University of Arizona)\n\n* Secant Varieties - Enrico Carlini (Assistant Professor, Politecnico di Torino) and Luke Oeding (Post-Doctoral Fellow, University of California, Berkeley).  \n\nThe follow-up conference (see http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~ssatherw/NDSU2013/index.html) brought together participants from the original workshop and introduced new participants to the group.  The follow-up conference involved nine talks with speakers:  \n\n* Kristen Beck (Post-Doctoral Fellow, University of Arizona)\n\n* Jim Coykendall (Professor, North Dakota State University)\n\n* Chris Francisco (Associate Professor, Oklahoma State University)\n\n* Tai Huy Ha (Associate Professor, Tulane University)\n\n* Brian Harbourne (Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln)\n\n* Augustine O'Keefe (Post-Doctoral Fellow, University of Kentucky)\n\n* Jared Painter (Assistant Professor, Houtson Baptist University)\n\n* Branden Stone (Visiting Assistant Professor, Bard College/Bard Prison Initiative)\n\n* Mark Walker (Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln).  \n\nIn recent years there has been intense and ground-breaking activity in Commutative Algebra, activity which has been rapidly transforming the field.  There is also extensive interaction with researchers in areas as diverse as Algebraic Geometry, Coding Theory, Combinatorics, Homotopy Theory, K-theory, and Representation Theory.  The workshop and follow-up meeting provided an opportunity for participants to interact and establish research connections with each other while seeing recent developments in the field and its relationships with other areas.  \n\nThe primary impacts of the workshop and follow-up meeting are the dissemination of recent ideas on the interactions between two important topics&mdash;algebra and geometry, and the stimulation and enrichment of the research careers of the students and early career participants, especially those from under-represented groups.
