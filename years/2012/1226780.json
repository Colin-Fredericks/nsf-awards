 "awd_abstract_narration": "Doctoral student Clinton D. Humphrey, supervised by Dr. Paul V. Kroskrity, will undertake research on how social, political, and economic contexts affect people's understanding of their own physical and psychological experience. The project is important because it will contribute to a growing body of research in the social sciences that examines how socio-cultural processes may configure the ways in which individuals attend to, perceive, and conceptualize bodily sensations in times of illness. \r\n\r\nThe research will be conducted for 14 months with Miskitu lobster divers on the Autonomous Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua. The Miskitu divers' livelihoods depend on deep diving but it too frequently results in chronic and debilitating decompression illness, also known as the bends. The researcher will use a unique video analysis technique to delineate how discourse, patterns of embodied interaction, and cultural resources shape Miskitu encounters with this illness. His video recordings of lobster divers will allow him to conduct microanalyses of discourse, gesture, gaze, and bodily movement, to determine how these divers attune their senses and navigate their working bodies in the unique undersea environment as they simultaneously attend to signs of danger and sickness. Follow-up interviews and participant observation with targeted research participants will explore local explanations of illnesses. Collectively, these data will guide an investigation of how Miskitu lobster divers perceive, endure, and endeavor to make sense of the ailments they feel in their bodies in different social and environmental contexts.\r\n\r\nThis study advances research on sensory experience with a distinctive micro-analytical emphasis on discourse, embodied-communicative interaction, and political-economic processes.  The researcher will share research findings with local programs designed to assist these commercial divers and their families. Supporting this research also supports the education of a graduate student.",

In pursuit of this goal, I recruited twelve active and seven non-active lobster divers&ndash;along with their boat crew members&ndash;for participation in detailed interviewing and specialized ethnographic video recording methods over the course of thirteen months (eight months NSF funded). Four different types of interviews were conducted among 52 research participants to examine topics such as: (1) the types of illnesses these divers suffer from and the perceived causes; (2) the social and institutional resources available in the community and the forms of medical treatment sought by lobster divers; (3) the sociopolitical and economic environment that enables such a dangerous occupation to continue; and (4) the specific diving practices and their relationships to injury and illness. Extensive participant-observation methods entailed video recording everyday activities when accompanying divers at sea and undersea, in their homes with their families, and during casual social events. To identify the details of specific dive practices, underwater video footage&ndash; shot while divers were working&ndash;was played back to them so they could describe their actions and decision making processes. Fieldwork produced roughly ninety hours of video footage of daily social interactions and undersea work. By way of discourse analysis and the construction of detailed models of embodied interaction and sensory attunement, I document the complex ways in which these ailing men simultaneously navigate (1) racialized political-economic conditions in the Autonomous Atlantic Coast and access to medical care, (2) chronic illness and shifting social relationships, and (3) the dangerous underwater environment where they perform their work.
