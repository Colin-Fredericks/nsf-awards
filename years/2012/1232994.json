One effort taking hold to improve air quality in cities is the application of titanium dioxide to building and roadway surfaces to make these surfaces photocatalytic. Upon irradiation with sunlight, these surfaces efficiently destroy nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the precursors to ozone. While such surfaces have been shown to be effective at removing NOx, there has been no systematic study to quantify their potential to reduce human exposure to ozone and to the toxic compounds emitted in vehicle exhaust. These surfaces may in fact generate air toxics such as nitrous acid from NOx, and formaldehyde and acetaldehyde from VOCs. Preliminary studies by our group have shown that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are rapidly generated when gasoline vapor mixtures are exposed to illuminated titanium dioxide treated concrete. Photoactive roads may in fact increase ozone in urban areas by decreasing the NOx / VOC concentration ratio and increasing radical production rates via production of nitrous acid and formaldehyde.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the net effect of vehicle exhaust transformation on these surfaces is essential for determining if photoactive urban materials will in fact improve urban air quality. In this project chamber studies will be used to quantify NOx and VOCs loss to photoactive roadway materials (asphalt and concrete) as a function of light levels, temperature, humidity, and commercial titanium dioxide surface treatment products. The yields of nitrous acid and aldehydes will also be measured. Chamber tests will be conducted on prepared test mixtures that mimic vehicle exhaust including gasoline vapor and in outdoor experiments under ambient pollution conditions. The surface destruction efficiencies of NOx and VOCs and yields of nitrous acid and aldehydes will be parameterized and used in an air quality model to test the resulting impact on primary pollutant concentrations and ozone formation photochemistry. This project would provide the first systematic investigation and integrated air quality numerical modeling study of the impact of photoactive roads on urban air chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis study will provide much needed quantitative information of interest to the public and urban planners on the efficacy of photoactive roads as a solution to reduce urban air pollution. Exposure to vehicle exhaust has been shown to have a significant impact on cardiovascular health. Removing vehicle pollutants at the source with photoactive roads has the potential to improve health for millions of people living near major roadways. The results of the research will be used in undergraduate course work and disseminated in conferences and peer reviewed publications. The research will help support one graduate student and provide support for a summer research internship for an American Indian student from the Northwest Indian College.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated the use of the anatase mineral form of titanium dioxide (TiO2) in roadway materials (asphalt and concrete) to improve air quality in urban areas.  It is known that the anatase form of TiO2 becomes chemically reactive when exposed to sunlight and that it can catalytically oxidize pollutants emitted from vehicle exhaust.  By applying TiO2 as a surface coating to existing roadways, roadways could potentially be transformed into cost effective and efficient destroyers of air pollutants.  This project tested the pollutant removal efficiency of concrete and asphalt roadway samples treated with a commercial solution of anatase TiO2 (0.1 to 0.2 kg TiO2 per m2 of sample).  The ability of these samples to oxidize pollutants was tested in the lab using a special testing chamber made from transparent Teflon film.  Samples were placed in the chamber and air containing pollutants flowed through the chamber.  Chamber inlet and outlet pollutant concentrations were measured to determine pollutant removal efficiency.  We measured the removal efficiency for nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and seven hydrocarbon compounds common to gasoline.  Our results show that while the concrete roadway samples were much more effective at removing NO than the asphalt samples, the effectiveness of the concrete rapidly decreased with increasing humidity.  Interestingly, NO removal efficiency displayed a non-linear dependence on light levels; doubling the light intensity did not double the removal efficiency. Carbon monoxide was not removed by the samples.  The asphalt samples were efficient in removing hydrocarbons, with less volatile compounds removed more efficiently than volatile compounds like benzene.  An important finding  was that the removal of nitric oxide produced a significant yield of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as a by-product; approximately a 20% yield for the asphalt samples, and 3-34% for the concrete samples depending on relative humidity. Nitrogen dioxide is a regulated criteria air pollutant and is a precursor to photochemical ozone formation.  Thus the benefit of removing nitric oxide is offset somewhat by the emission of nitrogen dioxide.  Removal of hydrocarbons also generated the by-products formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.   Our work shows that photoactive roadway materials may reduce some urban air pollutants but the formation of by-products has to be taken into account quantity the overall air quality outcome and public health benefit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: B.
