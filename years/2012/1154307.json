 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research conducted by investigators in the School of Marine Science and Policy at the University of Delaware and within the Department of Environmental and Biomolecular Systems  of Oregon Health and Science University will examine the importance of soluble Mn(III) in the biogeochemical cycling of Mn. To date, most studies of Mn in marine environments have not considered Mn(III), the intermediate oxidation state between the soluble reduced state (Mn(II)) and the more insoluble oxidized state (Mn(IV)). The presence and stability of Mn(III) in marine systems, especially those where oxygen levels are reduced, changes the dynamics and stability, solubility and fate and transport of Mn in these locations, and at interfaces between oxic and low oxygen environments. This is not understood at present and the proposed research is poised to provide new information concerning the Mn cycle and is potentially transformative research. The PIs have developed new methods to examine Mn(III) levels in the environment and this capability will bolster the successful accomplishment of the project?s goals. The studies will not only focus on understanding the cycling of Mn between its various oxidation states but will determine the concentration and distribution of Mn(II) in stratified coastal ocean waters and in sediment porewaters. The study will also examine the potentially important role of Mn(III) in mediating and influencing the biogeochemical cycling of Mn with that of Fe and S, which are both important components of the major ocean chemical cycles. A better understanding of the biogeochemistry of Mn will inform not only scientists interested in metal cycling in the ocean but also those focused on studies across redox transition zones. The proposed research has an international component and the investigators have developed plans to broadly disseminate their results to students at all levels and to the community. The Principal Investigators have a strong history in education and graduate student and post-doctoral support and mentoring and this will continue under the current grant.",
