Students participating in AL@GL 2012 were diverse, rural, and traditionally underrepresented.  Groups included: students from Greenland, Denmark, and the US participating in Science and Education Week at Kangerlussuaq, Greenland and Summit Station as part of the JSEP. Students at MOSS were part of the U.S Department of Education funded TRiO Upward Bound Math Science (UBMS) project, which serves high school students who are first college generation, and from low-income families. Students involved in the Helping Orient Indian Students and Teachers (HOIST) program at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho, also participated in AL@GL 2012 activities.\n\nThrough AL@GL 2012, students were enabled to explore both new and familiar locations through physica..."
