Developing facile, inexpensive routes to precisely control crystal habit (i.e. morphology and orientation) can address design limitations that often marginalize catalyst performance and can hinder their commercial viability. Prof. Jeffrey Rimer of the University of Houston proposes in his CAREER award study to develop a rational design strategy for improving the mass transport properties of zeolite catalysts, notably a reduction in the internal pore diffusion path length and an increase in the exterior pore surface area, which are known to markedly improve activity and stability. With this award, Rimer will leverage research thrusts in crystal engineering and surface science to tailor zeolite crystallization at an interfacial level, using a bio-inspired approach to tune crystal habit and surface architecture, and ultimately to test catalyst activity as a function of these variables. This design approach mimics crystallization in nature by using modifiers with molecular recognition for binding to specific surfaces and mediating step growth on crystal faces. Initiatives will focus on reactions of model compounds with a long-term trajectory of establishing a comprehensive platform to design, model, and test zeolites for alternative energy applications.\r\n\r\nThis award will be used to strengthen outreach initiatives at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels to promote engineering education and research. Rimer has partnered with KIPP Houston High School (a minority institution ranked 16th in national college readiness) to establish a dynamic program for student and teacher (NSF-RET) research at the University of Houston, guest lectures on engineering topics to KIPP AP Chemistry students, lesson plans that integrate results of Rimer's research, and an annual seminar to promote increased interest in STEM.",
