 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will address current conceptual problems in our understanding of cooperation and conflict in animals. Aphids are among the few insect groups outside of Hymenoptera that express complex sociality, but remain poorly-understood. The central question of Abbot's research is: what is the genomic and ecological basis of defensive and social phenotypes in herbivorous insects? The research will combine genomic and ecological field experiments to test hypotheses on the roles of competition, pathogenesis, and venom use in shaping the major features of sociality in aphids. Because these are also important pests of vegetable crops in the United States, the genomic and natural history data deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) will prove valuable to farmers and agricultural researchers alike. The majority of the funds will support the training of a female graduate student, who is a member of an under-represented group in science. As part of her training, she and Abbot will: 1) Engage with high school students from both poorly-performing local schools and high school students recruited from around the country; 2) Promote the training of undergraduate and high school students by recruiting them to Abbot's lab; 3) Participate in a \"science caf\u00e9\" series at a local science center, which involves dialogues between scientists and the general public.",

The study of cooperative behavior and group-living has benefitted in recent years by the discovery of new species exhibiting complex social organization. These discoveries offer the opportunity to make broadly comparative studies of the factors favoring transitions from solitary and simple group-living to more complex societies. Ants or wolves are familiar examples of species that form complex groups. However, most species are solitary, or exhibit cooperative behaviors or form groups that lie somewhere between solitary lifestyles and complex group living. Understanding why there is such variation in group-living, and the consequences for other species that interact with group-living species, requires studies of species across the spectrum of social behaviors and complex organization. The consequences for humans are clear, not only because many social animals are economically vital (think of honey bees), but also because of the potential to discover analogies to social behaviors and group-living in ourselves. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Thus, in species like aphids, we want to know answers to such questions as: how does variation in kinship affect individuals within groups? How do interactions with predators or pathogens vary between species that are or are not social? What molecular and biochemical traits to aphids express within their cooperative groups? By comparing species that do and do not express cooperative behaviors, we have found that even closely related species can differ profoundly in their interactions with predators. Social aphids express effective defense against predators, but the aggregations of non-social aphids do not and are vulnerable to predation. Moreover, we found that the plant tissues that social and non-social aphids feed upon are characterized by different suites of fungal endophytes, potenially implying an altered microbial community associated with the differences in life histories between social and non-social species. We are still in the process of investigating the effects of variation in kinship on aphid groups.</span></p>\n<p><span>What traits do social aphids express that are novel, and underlie their success in defense? &nbsp;</span>We found that, essentially, when aphids attack other insects, they are attacking the immune response of their insect predators. Insect melanization is normally a constitutive response to injury and infection. Because of the reactive, cytotoxic intermediates that are produced during melanization, it is tightly regulated by a complicated network of enzymatic cascades and negative self-regulators. What aphid soldiers do when they swarm predators is massively disrupt this tightly regulated system. How do they do this? In hindsight, it makes sense. Aphids are masters at exploiting the defenses of their host plants. The ground plan for sociality in aphids thus derives from herbivory, and vulnerabilities inherent to animal immune systems because ripe targets for attack. Given that they have traits for exploiting host plants and that insect predators have these vulnerabilities essentially closes the gap between being solitary and social in aphids. Aphids are primed for fortress defence, and the novelty of this result is that it links traits for exploiting plant defenses to those involved in group-living and defense against predators.</p>\n<p>This research supported the training of numerous undergraduates, high school students, and has fostered the success of a PhD graduate (Sarah Lawson) of Hispanic heritage. Undergraduates (Andrew Legan, Caroline Graham, Natalie Christian) have co-authored peer-reviewed publications and are now well on their way to careers in science. Both Andrew and Natalie are now NSF Graduate Fellows at prestigious institutions, and Caroline recently completed summer work on a fellowship from NOAA.
