 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop fundamental theory, efficient algorithms, and realistic\r\nexperiments for the analysis and design of safety-critical cyber-physical transportation systems\r\nwith human operators. The research focuses on preventing crashes between automobiles at road\r\nintersections, since these account for about 40% of overall vehicle crashes. Specifically, the main\r\nobjective of this work is to design provably safe driver-assist systems that understand driver?s\r\nintentions and provide warnings/overrides to prevent collisions. In order to pursue this goal,\r\nhybrid automata models for the driver-vehicles-intersection system, incorporating driver\r\nbehavior and performance as an integral part, are derived from human-factors experiments. A\r\npartial order of these hybrid automata models is constructed, according to confidence levels on\r\nthe model parameters. The driver-assist design problem is then formulated as a set of partially\r\nordered hybrid differential games with imperfect information, in which games are ordered\r\naccording to parameter confidence levels. The resulting designs are validated experimentally in\r\na driving simulator and in large-scale computer simulations.\r\n\r\nThis research leverages the potential of embedded control and communication technologies to\r\nprevent crashes at traffic intersections, by enabling networks of smart vehicles to cooperate with\r\neach other, with the surrounding infrastructure, and with their drivers to make transportation\r\nsafer, more enjoyable, and more efficient. The work is based on a collaboration among\r\nresearchers in formal methods, autonomous control, and human factors who are studying realistic and\r\nprovably correct warning/override algorithms that can be readily transitioned to production\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\nhttp://ares.lids.mit.edu/intersections",
