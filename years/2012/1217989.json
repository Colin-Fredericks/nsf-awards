 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for resource allocation is pervasive. Often, it involves participants with conflicting interests. Markets and auctions both serve to produce desirable outcomes despite such conflicting interests, and yet other mechanisms are used when money cannot be exchanged (e.g. in kidney exchanges). An important goal is to find stable outcomes, outcomes with which individual participants are content in the sense that they cannot improve the outcome; these outcomes are called equilibria.\r\n\r\nFor existing settings, such as economic markets and widely used mechanisms (e.g. Internet routing protocols or the Generalized Second Price  auction used by major search engines), one wants to understand how well the existing mechanisms work. Specifically (i) In what settings are there equilibrium outcomes? (ii) Can they (or near-equilibria) be found? (iii) Are the equilibrium outcomes plausible, i.e. does it seem reasonable that they will be reached due to the interactions induced by the mechanism? This research will focus on matching markets and the housing market in particular.\r\n\r\nIn other settings, where there are no existing mechanisms or the costs of introducing new mechanisms are not prohibitive, one can seek to design mechanisms that produce desirable outcomes. This research will focus on the allocation of divisible goods (i.e. goods that can be split into many parts).\r\n\r\nThe standard modeling of matching markets, such as the housing market, assumes buyers have sharp budget limits. Unfortunately, when this assumption holds there may be no equilibrium solution. Instead, this research will consider a natural soft budget limit based on residual wealth, a setting where equilibria are guaranteed. The main issue is whether equilibria in this setting are predictors of outcomes. Necessary conditions, which will be investigated, are that the equilibria can be computed efficiently, that approximate equilibria are close to the actual equilibria, and that these approximate equilibria could arise as a result of the actions of buyers and sellers.\r\n\r\nWith regard to mechanism design, as is standard, this research will seek truthful mechanisms, mechanisms which give participants no incentive for strategizing. In other words, participants will achieve their best outcomes by making honest declarations (e.g. of their valuations for different possible allocations). In general, it is not possible to allocate all the resources using truthful mechanisms. Instead, this research aims to understand the quality of the solutions produced by under-allocating yet truthful mechanisms. In particular, this research intends to study the class of proportionally fair mechanisms, mechanisms which were first introduced in the context of internet routing.",

Typically, one trusts prices will balance supply and demand, at least more or less. But how are such prices discovered? A standard answer is that it occurs via the Invisible Hand of the Market, but this does not explain the process. Rather, what it suggests is that the necessary information dissemination and the resulting price adjustments occur by themselves without the need for central organization. If the market comprised a single good, finding a price that balances supply and demand would be straightforward in most situations; but with multiple goods, adjusting the price of one good typically affects the demand for other goods. The consequence is that finding equilibrium (or balancing) prices is in effect a computation. In general, it turns out that finding equilibrium prices for all goods simultaneously is computationally infeasible, which implies that it is implausible that they can be found by the Invisible Hand or any other way. One part of our work, joint with former PhD student Yun Kuen Cheung, and in part with Nikhil Devanur of Microsoft Research, has focused on identifying conditions, i.e. limitations on the settings, that ensure that a particular computationally feasible price adjustment scheme, called tatonnement, actually finds equilibrium prices, with the goal of understanding better in which circumstances one can expect supply and demand to balance, at least approximately.</p>\n<!--  /* Font Definitions */ @font-face \t{font-family:Times; \tpanose-1:2 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;} @font-face \t{font-family:Cambria; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}  /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmargin-bottom:.0001pt; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} p \t{margin:0in; \tmargin-bottom:.0001pt; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:10.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Times; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Times; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";} @page Section1 \t{size:8.5in 11.0in; \tmargin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; \tmso-header-margin:.5in; \tmso-footer-margin:.5in; \tmso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 \t{page:Section1;} --><!--  /* Font Definitions */ @font-face \t{font-family:Times; \tpanose-1:2 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;} @font-face \t{font-family:Cambria; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}  /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmargin-bottom:.0001pt; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} p \t{margin:0in; \tmargin-bottom:.0001pt; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:10.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Times; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Times; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";} @page Section1 \t{size:8.5in 11.0in; \tmargin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; \tmso-header-margin:.5in; \tmso-footer-margin:.5in; \tmso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 \t{page:Section1;} -->\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes allocation problems are money-free, e.g. dividing an estate, assigning seats in a school system or kidneys in transplant settings.
