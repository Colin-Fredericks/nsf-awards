 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the investigator will explore the cycling of phosphorus in the ocean by studying the biological mechanisms that shape the abundance, production, and utilization of marine polyphosphate.\r\n\r\nAlthough phosphorus (P) is a key nutrient that helps control marine biological productivity and microbial community composition, the origin and fate of up to 75% of marine dissolved P, collectively referred to as dissolved organic P (DOP), remains enigmatic. Research conducted by the investigator revealed that polyphosphate (poly-P) is an abundant component (~10%) of DOP throughout the world's ocean and is involved in critical global processes such as geologic P sequestration and global climate. However, as in the case for bulk DOP pools, very little is known about the biological mechanisms shaping the abundance, production, and utilization of marine poly-P. Given the profound ecosystem and climatic implications of poly-P cycling and its potential role as an abundant biological P source, understanding the microbial sources and sinks of poly-P that regulate its composition and surprisingly consistent global abundance remains a fundamental challenge in oceanography. \r\n\r\nAdvances in the study of marine poly-P have historically been limited by a lack of analytical techniques; however, tools to fill critical knowledge gaps in marine poly-P cycling are now available through an integrated biogeochemical approach that combines the expertise and technical backgrounds of the investigator and sponsoring scientist. New mechanisms of poly-P production and microbial P assimilation discovered through this research have the potential to fundamentally advance biological models of P metabolism and transform current understanding of marine DOP by revealing new mechanisms that shape its composition, influence the linked cycles of other nutrients, oxygen, and carbon, and global climate.\r\n\r\nEducational broader impacts integrate with existing education and outreach opportunities at the host institution. The investigator will mentor two summer undergraduate students recruited through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Minority Student Fellowship Program. Mentoring approaches are designed to advance discovery and substantially enrich the students' scientific contributions, personal experiences, and overall likelihood of continuing in ocean science. Additional broadening participation activities will contribute to the existing infrastructure of ocean science education and foster participation in the broader community. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported under the NSF Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (OCE PRF) program, with goals to support novel research by early career scientists and increase the diversity of the U.S. ocean sciences workforce and research community. With OCE-PRF support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to ocean sciences and broaden participation of under-represented groups in the ocean sciences.",

Despite the potential physiological and biogeochemical importance of marine polyP, however, the composition, distribution, and dynamics of polyP in the marine environment are not well understood.  In this paper, we provide the first direct characterization of inorganic polyP content and dynamics (biological production and utilization) at Station ALOHA, a long-term oceanographic study site in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.  Furthermore, we complement field work with laboratory-based phytoplankton culture experiments in order to clarify potential biological utilization of polyP.  Overall, our results advance the emerging paradigm that bulk P availability affects the content and dynamics of particulate polyP in the ocean, with lower polyP levels and less intense production and utilization of polyP being characteristic of systems with relatively higher P availability, including Station ALOHA.  Our results also provide the first evidence that biological polyP utilization is species-specific.  Results therefore suggest that polyP may influence microbial community composition in ocean areas with low P availability and therefore have implications for marine primary productivity and the ocean\u00c6s role in the climate system.\n\n \n\nResults from this project fundamentally challenge our current understanding of the mechanisms leading to coral bleaching, a devastating ecological disease that has led to the loss and degradation of coral reefs worldwide.
