 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year, multi-path collaboration program between U.S. and Chinese researchers, scientists, educators, and leaders in higher education focuses on key issues regarding network deployment, global cyberinfrastructure, and interoperability. The project builds on engagement between Internet2, CERNET, CTSNET, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, ongoing collaborations and remote campus deployments between US universities and China, scientific interaction between the two countries, and findings derived from prior annual meetings of the Chinese-American Network Symposium (CANS) group.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this work is based on the international exchange of ideas it will foster. By bringing together network experts and leading researchers, and by building on the momentum established by campuses and the continuum of CANS events, these activities lead to sustainable and ongoing linkages and interactions to foster global cyberinfrastructure. As research and education increasingly acquire more globalparameters, interactions like this are critical. The broader impact results from the global interactions and ongoing collaborations to be translated to multiple scientific disciplines and the continued deployment of US satellite campuses to promote\r\nglobal exchange of educational findings and methodology.",
