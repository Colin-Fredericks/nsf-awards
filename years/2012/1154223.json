 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research team will investigate the relative roles of shock acceleration, flare acceleration, suprathermal particle composition, and particle transport as a function of position (along the shock and/or the longitudinal distance from the solar source region). The relative contributions of flare and shock acceleration to solar energetic particle (SEP) events and their resulting compositional signatures are as yet undetermined, and this fact provides the motivation for this work. The research team will use observations of specific individual SEP events obtained from multiple spacecraft, rather than attempting to infer phenomenology through statistical studies of many events measured by a single spacecraft under varying conditions, as has been done in the past. This approach will allow a more accurate determination of the driving coronal mass ejection's source region and of its related properties. The team's analysis technique will also provide a more global view of solar activity and non-local effects, which may play an important role in the generation of SEP events and in determining their longitudinal extent. This effort will directly address open scientific questions regarding SEP composition and particle transport. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the production, composition, and extent of SEP events is critical for accurate predictions of space weather and its potential impact on astronauts and satellites. The team will disseminate their scientific results through published articles, scientific talks, and the web pages associated with the relevant NASA spacecraft missions. This project will contribute to the training of a postdoctoral researcher as a co-investigator at George Mason University, and, through an international collaboration, a graduate student in Germany. The team will also supervise and train students at the University of Arizona and the Naval Research Laboratory who will work on this project. The Lead Principal Investigator at the California Institute of Technology is an active participant in \"Solar Week,\" a local program designed to encourage high school girls to pursue careers in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEnergetic particles originating in solar flares, which are very small, localized, compact regions on the Sun, can be dispersed in space over a wide range of longitudes.  These solar-flare related \"SEP events\" are seen at Earth, and typically last a day or so.  Besides spacecraft near Earth, we also have other spacecraft that share Earth's orbit around the Sun, but are at different ecliptic longitudes - the twin Stereo spacecraft.  These spacecraft have noted that the particles from these solar flares are often seen spread over wide separations of longitude, which presents a puzzle since they should be seen only over a rather narrow region.  Our research was aimed at understanding this. \n\nOur numerical modeling of these \"SEP\" events reveal that the dispersal of these particles is caused by a combination of effects related to their interaction with the interplanetary magnetic field.  This includes their being \u00c6scattered' by small variations in the magnetic field, but they also tend to follow along the lines of force, much like beads on a wire, which are bent as the Sun rotates - this is known as the Parker spiral magnetic field.  Generally, these two effects alone cannot explain why spacecraft separated by large distances in longitude around the Sun see particles from these small solar-flare events; however, there is another important effect that we have highlighted in this research.  It is the importance of large-scale variations of the magnetic field caused by turbulence near the solar surface.  This is due to the 'wiggling' of the field lines at the solar surface, and results in waves in the magnetic field that cause the particles to spread out in longitude quite efficiently.  This is known as 'field-line wandering.'  Including this effect in our numerical models has shown that the wide dispersal of energetic particles over ecliptic longitude can be understood, physically., in terms of the particles following along large-scale fluctuations in the interplanetary magnetic field caused both by the rotation of the Sun, as well as turbulence at the solar surface, and also by scattering off of these lines of force due to very small-scale fluctuations.\n\nBesides its intrinsic interest to the study of the Sun and its interaction with Earth, our work has application to the general problem of charged-particle interaction with magnetic fields which is important in other areas of astrophysics, such as cosmic ray transport in the Galaxy, and solar system.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joe Giacalone"
