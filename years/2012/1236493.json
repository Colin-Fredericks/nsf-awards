 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award by the Environmental Health and Safety of Nanotechnology program supports multidisciplinary work by Professors Howard Fairbrother, Ed Bouwer and Seth Guikema to characterize the effect of microbial interactions with biodegradable polymers that incorporate carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Polymer nanocomposites containing CNTs represent an example of a next generation type of nanomaterial because of the beneficial effects that CNTs have on many polymer properties. However, following consumer use polymer nanocomposites will enter the environment where their ultimate fate and impact will be intimately dependent upon their interactions with microorganisms present in environmental regimes such as landfills, soils or surface waters. To better understand the life cycle of this new class of nanomaterials we plan to develop a systematic understanding of the persistence and fate of biodegradable polymer nanocomposites exposed to different microbial populations, including potential pathways for CNT release. Findings from these experiments will also be used as the basis to develop a risk-based decision making framework that can determine the most appropriate means for disposing of polymer nanocomposites. Such a proactive approach for risk assessment and life cycle analysis is necessary for new types of nanomaterials in the developmental stage. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The experimental design is to establish relationships that link important parameters, such as CNT loading, type and surface chemistry with biodegradation and biofilm accumulation rates and biotransformation mechanisms. Through this approach environments will be identified where CNTs could be released as particles from the solid phase composite and where biodegradable polymer nanocomposites could resist biodegradation and persist, in stark contrast to the behavior of the native polymer. The PIs will initially focus on preparing a selected suite of well characterized CNTs and CNT-containing biodegradable polymer nanocomposites where CNT type, surface chemistry, loading and the biodegradable polymer matrix will be varied. Using selected single and mixed culture populations to mimic different environmental regimes, microbial interactions with polymer nanocomposites and CNT particles will be explored by conducting three types of complementary experiments: (1) flow cell studies to evaluate attachment and biofilm accumulation on the surface of the polymer nanocomposites, (2) batch studies to quantify biodegradation and CNT release, and (3) isotopically labeled CNTs to determine the fate of CNT-carbon and potential CNT degradation mechanisms. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts - This research will develop a fundamental and holistic scientific understanding of microbial interactions with CNT-containing biodegradable polymer nanocomposites, an emerging class of nanomaterial with enormous commercial potential. This information will also provide a predictive framework for the development of nanocomposites with material properties that have been engineered for positive social and economic consequences without long term industrial liability. The PIs will also provide research opportunities, guidance, and mentoring to female high school juniors through the Women in Science and Engineering program and female undergraduate students from the Notre Dame of Maryland University (a local, primarily teaching, women?s college). Additionally, the PIs and graduate students will give presentations in a pilot program, the City Springs Science Outreach Program, which focuses on enhancing scientific literacy and awareness for minority and underprivileged grade school students (5th grade) through exposure to hands-on science and engineering projects and activities.",

Consequently, polymer nanocomposites containing CNTs (PNC/CNTs) represent an example of a next generation type of nanomaterial. However, following consumer use polymer nanocomposites will enter the environment where their ultimate fate and impact will be intimately dependent upon their interactions with microorganisms present in environmental regimes such as landfills, soils or surface waters. The widely reported cytotoxicity of CNTs seemed likely to change the nature of these microbial interactions with PNC/CNTs. This provided the motivation to better understand the life cycle of this new class of nanomaterial and in this project we have explored various facets of PNC/CNT interactions with microorganisms, ranging from the initial attachment of microbes to PNC/CNT surfaces, the subsequent formation of biofilms and finally the effect that CNTs have on polymer biodegradation. Highlights from each of these various studies are summarized below:</p>\n<p><strong>Initial attachment of microbes to PNC/CNT surfaces:</strong> This represents the first step that occurs when PNC/CNTs enter an environmental regime that contains microorganisms. Using a staining procedure that could distinguish living (green) from dead (red) micro-organisms revealed that the inclusion of CNTs caused PNC surfaces to exhibit antimicrobial properties. The cytotoxicity of the surface towards microorganisms increased as the CNT content in the polymer increased (see Figure 1) as was also observed for both single walled and multi-walled CNTs. However, not every contact event/interaction between attached microorganisms and CNTs led to cell death.</p>\n<p><strong>Biofilm formation on PNC/CNT surfaces:</strong> Biofilm formation represents the colonization of an exposed surface by microorganisms and Is a ubiquitous process in the environment; almost all surfaces exposed to microorganisms are coated with a biofilm. The formation of a biofilm is also the necessary precursor for polymer biodegradation if this is possible. Because the antimicrobial properties of CNT/PNC surfaces requires direct CNT-microbe contact, initially deposited dead (red) cells were able to act as shields. This allowed living (green) cells to deposit on top of the &ldquo;dead layer&rdquo; of (red) cells where they were shielded from the cytotoxic effects of CNTs. This allowed biofilm formation to occur on CNT/PNCs exposed to microorganisms for longer time periods (see Figure 2).</p>\n<p><strong>Influence of CNT Inclusion on Polymer Biodegradation:</strong> An important subclass of polymers whose physical properties can benefit significantly from the inclusion of CNTs are naturally occurring and biodegradable, meaning that they will not accumulate and persist in the environment. Given the low cost and reduced environmental impact of these biodegradable polymers/plastics it is important to understand how the inclusion of CNTs, which in addition to being cytotoxic are anthropogenic and therefore not easily biodegraded by nature, will change the biodegradation process. &nbsp;Using two biodegradable polymers (polycapralactone (PCL) and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)) our results have uncovered two limiting case scenarios. When PCL/CNT polymer nanocomposites were exposed to a single culture organism the overall biodegradation process occurred over a period of several months and the presence of CNTs significantly retarded the rate of PCL biodegradation (top left plot in Figure 3). In contrast, when PHA/CNT nanocomposites were exposed to a mixed culture, more representative of what would be present in the environment, biodegradation occurred over a period of a few weeks and the presence of CNTs did not impact the rate of PHA biodegradation (bottom right plot in Figure 3). Collectively, these results suggest that CNTs will not prevent polymer biodegredation for ultimately occuring but are more likely to exert an inhibitory effect on the rate of polymer biodegradation as the timescale for biodegradation, the latter determined by the nature of the polymer and the composition and diversity of the microbial population, increases. In both studies our results suggest that biodegradation of PNC/CNTs does not cause CNT release into the environment, although the ultimate fate of the CNTs is to form a dense interconnected three dimensional network once all of the surrounding polymer matrix has been biodegraded which will then persist indefinitely in the environment (see Figure 4). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Howard&nbsp;Fairbrother</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1236493/1236493_10205721_1483116796962_Figure1-outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1236493/1236493_10205721_1483116796962_Figure1-outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1236493/1236493_10205721_1483116796962_Figure1-outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Effect of CNT inclusion on the initial cytotoxicity of a polymer nancomposite surface.
