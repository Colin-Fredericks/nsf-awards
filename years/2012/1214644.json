 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funds the research activities of Professors Mina Aganagic, Raphael Bousso, Petr Horava, and Yasunori Nomura at the University of California, Berkeley. \r\n\r\nThis project involves theoretical research at the crossroads of particle physics, quantum gravity, cosmology and string theory, with applications ranging from physics beyond the Standard Model to the multiverse approach in cosmology, the interface of string theory and condensed-matter physics, the nature of space and time in quantum gravity, and mathematical implications of topological strings.  Professor Aganagic will investigate applications of string theory in gauge theories and mathematics; Professor Bousso will examine the challenges encountered when extracting predictions from the string multiverse, in particular the measure problem of eternal inflation;  Professor Horava will continue to study quantum gravity with anisotropic scaling and its connections to string theory, particle phenomenology, the AdS/CFT correspondence, mathematics of the Ricci flow, and lattice gravity;  and Professor Nomura will consider various issues in theoretical particle physics and cosmology relevant to experiments coming in the next decades --- in particular the LHC --- with emphasis on supersymmetry breaking and its mediation, the origin and nature of dark matter, and the conceptual understanding of the multiverse and its implications for TeV-scale physics.\r\n\r\nThis project is also envisioned to have considerable broader impacts. These include the training of students and postdocs who will be involved in this research;  dissemination of research results to the general public;  involvement in QuarkNet;  and participation in lecture series and summer schools that reach under-privileged communities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnder the support of this Award, the four Principal Investigators (with the Junior Scholars and other associates) spearheaded an exceptionally broad and intense research in theoretical high-energy physics, addressing some of the deepest puzzles about the fundamental laws of the universe.  This research has wide-ranging implications both for quantum field theory, string theory,  particle physics, quantum gravity and cosmology, and  to a wide array of neighboring fields, ranging from condensed matter to cosmological inflation and pure mathematics.  \n\nSuperstring theory represents a leading paradigm for unifying gravity and general relativity with quantum mechanics particle physics.  Ever since its inception, this framework has demonstrated a truly remarkable ability to generate  novel concepts that revolutionize both physics and mathematics.  On the mathematical side, the topological string captures a subsector of the full superstring theory, protected by supersymmetry. This topological string sector exhibits powerful mathematical properties, and allows a  precise control over the partition function of the theory, both perturbatively and non-perturbatively.  The physical and mathematical concepts involved -- such as M-theory and the concept of the index -- have driven a revolution at this interface of physics and mathematics,  benefitting both string theory and pure mathematics.    \n\nFundamental puzzles of quantum gravity have played a central role in our  understanding of the physical laws of quantum mechanics and their limits.  The central principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity come into sharp contradiction at the horizon of a black hole. Four decades ago, Hawking first showed that information appears to be lost into black holes. But the price to be paid for unitarity was understood only very recently: if information is to escape from a black hole, the horizon must become a singular boundary of spacetime, or ``firewall.'' The research conducted under this Award has played a leading role in sharpening the conflict between the equivalence principle and quantum mechanics. Related investigations involve covariant Entropy Bound (or Bousso bound) conjectures, suggesting a universal relation between information and geometry.  The group has also contributed significantly to the ongoing efforts to understand the structure and properties of entanglement entropy in quantum field theories, quantum gravity and holography.\n\nThe vacuum landscape of string theory may solve the cosmological constant problem, explaining why the energy of empty space is observed to be at least 60 orders of magnitude smaller than several known contributions to it.  It leads to a ``multiverse'' in which every type of vacuum is produced infinitely many times, and of which we have observed but a tiny fraction.  This conceptual revolution has raised tremendous challenges in particle physics and cosmology, such as the measure problem of eternal inflation, and modeling the statistical distribution of vacua, whose detailed investigation has been initiated under this Award.  \n\nThe persistent fundamental puzzles of quantum gravity and theoretical particle physics may require novel ideas, one of which -- initiated by this group -- has received a lot of attention recently:  The possibility of gravity with non-relativistic short-distance behavior, in which time plays a special role  (generally referred to in the community as ``Ho\\v rava-Lifshitz gravity'', or HL gravity for short).  To begin to understand the stucture of quantum gravity in this  setting, it is important to understand first the quantum loop corrections and renormalization group behavior of simpler, non-gravitational non-relativistic theories of the Lifshitz type.  Precisely this investigation has been undertaken under this Award, leading to many surprising results in the area of universality classes of spontaneous symmetry breaking in non-relativistic systems, and their technical Naturalness...."
