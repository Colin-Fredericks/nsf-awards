This award will enable junior scientists without other means of support to attend the meeting.\r\n\r\nEINN offers a unique venue for the presentation and discussion of frontier research covering the electromagnetic properties of atomic nuclei.  The conference runs across different subfields of electromagnetic nuclear physics, including those at the interface between nuclear and particle physics. \r\n\r\nThe modest size of the conference and its cross-disciplinary aspect enhance the learning experience and provide serious training of the next generation of leaders in nuclear physics and related disciplines.  Students will have many opportunities to interact with present leaders in an informal setting.",
