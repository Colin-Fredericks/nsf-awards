 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the CAREER research and education project of Prof. Katherine Plass of Franklin & Marshall College. Prof. Plass and her undergraduate researchers will develop new syntheses of inexpensive nanoparticles designed to act as light-absorbers in photovoltaics. Specifically, the Plass group will create solid solutions consisting of highly abundant elements. This will afford nanoparticles with band gaps tunable from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet region, thereby enabling construction of low-cost nanoparticle-based multijunction photovoltaics. To create these compounds, the team will design precursors that induce cations with different sizes and affinities to react to form sulfides at similar rates. Surface chemistry and film formation will be studied to create chemically stable nanoparticle films that have the necessary high conductivities to efficiently collect photogenerated charges. Finally, photovoltaic devices will be constructed using these nanoparticles made from earth-abundant elements. \r\n\r\nUndergraduate students will carry out the research, author publications, and present results at national meetings, positioning them well for entry into graduate school. The undergraduate researchers performing this work represent the newest generation of well-trained scientists interested in using chemistry to develop renewable energy. Alternative energy research in general and this work in particular will be incorporated into undergraduate classes and outreach activities with the North Museum of Natural History & Science aimed at the general public and local grade school students.",
