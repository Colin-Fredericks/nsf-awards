 "awd_abstract_narration": "The age-old dilemma of protecting rights while allowing pursuit of other national purposes colors states' aspirations to be respectful of cultural differences while also protecting public safety in the era of concern about terrorism-related activities.  Turkey and the status of the Kurds within Turkey provides an important case study of how states have addressed the protection of rights while pursuing legal processes concerning activities the state is concerned may be precursors to terrorist activity.  In pursuit of its desire to join the European Union, Turkey implemented a series of reforms that allowed Kurds to exercise some of their formerly prohibited cultural rights. As cultural reforms have been undertaken, the state has simultaneously instituted strenuous new legal measures that have expanded the scope of prosecutable acts of terrorism. \r\n\r\nThis research will provide the first empirical data on anti-terror trials in Turkey and contribute to the newly emerging scholarship on law and global war on terror. This research will inquire into the portrayal of an antagonist relation between rights and security.  The international importance of concerns both for cultures and for public safety make this project important to broad communities.",

One of the major legal cases through which terrorism as a criminal category holds currency is that prosecuting the Kurdish population for being a member of the Kurdistan Workers&rsquo; Party (PKK), which is labeled as a terrorist organization in Turkey. Focusing on the most recent terrorism trial, which has been held since 2009 in the city of Diyarbakir where thousands of suspects were brought before the court, this research examined the ways in which the prosecutor frames the &ldquo;security threat&rdquo; that terrorism suspects pose, how the judges assess the suspects&rsquo; potential to threaten state security, and the evidence and testimonies deployed by suspects to contest the accusations. Over eighteen months, I attended courtroom hearings in which the generally monotonous procedural tone was interrupted by collective courtroom protests and contentious political defense statements. While collecting legal documents pertinent to the trial, I interviewed the judges, prosecutors, and defense lawyers to understand what legal codes and procedures were at play in the courtroom. When suspects of the trial were released on bail in April 2014, after 5 years of imprisonment, I conducted interviews with 40 individuals from different backgrounds, including civil servants, local governors, lawyers, civil society activists and former guerilla fighters.
