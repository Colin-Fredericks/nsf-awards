 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nA major materials science objective at present is to create nanostructured morphologies of different blend components.  For example, it is believed that the efficiency of ion and exciton conduction in energy related applications such as batteries and solar cells may be optimized by adjusting the morphology of the nanometer-sized polymer domains to form conducting pathways or channels.  One route to such ideal morphologies is through alignment of microdomains via the application of electric fields, particularly advantageous for these applications where electrodes are already part of the device.  Currently there is still limited understanding of how the presence of electric fields affects the miscibility of polymer blends and block copolymers.  In particular, what is the free energy contribution to mixing caused by the presence of an electric field?  Theory of this phenomenon is limited by a lack of unambiguous experimental data characterizing the shifts in miscibility with electric fields, which can be quite large, up to 50 K decrease in the phase separation temperature for field strengths around 10 V/micrometer.  The proposed research will use fluorescence to measure the phase separation temperature of polymer blends and the order-disorder transition temperature of block copolymers as a function of composition in the presence of electric fields.  The experimental results will be fit to a modified Flory-Huggins expression to ascertain the free energy contribution to mixing caused by the presence of an electric field.  These results will provide improved fundamental understanding of the polymer-polymer interactions that control miscibility and a means to locally tune and control the enthalpic interaction of a blend.  \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nUse of polymers in technologically advanced applications is widespread, with many of these applications using multiple polymer components arranged into nanometer-sized domains.  The alignment of these domains could be optimized by the application of electric fields across the existing electrodes of the device.  The PI will develop a fundamental understanding of how the presence of electric fields affects the blending interactions in polymers, a phenomenon which is currently not understood.  The educational component will develop a network of mentoring resources for practical career advice.  The centerpiece will be a web-based discussion forum where students of all ages and walks of life can exchange advice on potential career plans and first-hand experience in ways of accomplishing their goals.  Such a venue will help fill a void in practical career information that is currently lacking.  This is especially important for students from economically limited backgrounds, most frequently from underrepresented minorities, who typically do not have relatives or family friends in related careers that can provide the needed guidance.  The PI will directly motivate students at a range of levels about career opportunities, taking groups of graduate and undergraduate students to visit local public schools to share their aspirations about careers in science and technology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal for this project was to investigate how the application of electric fields (application of a voltage to electrodes across a material) can affect the blending ability (miscibility) of two different polymers.  Numerous energy related applications such as solar cells and batteries involve electric fields across a material made of a blend of more than one component where each component is chosen to optimize a particular property.  Usually the blend's miscibility is leveraged to get a desired morphology to optimize the device.  The scientific understanding of how the presence of electric fields can affect a blend's miscibility is still not well known.  Scientific progress has been hampered by a lack of unambiguous experimental data characterizing how electric fields shift blend miscibility, which can be used to validate theoretical efforts. \n\nDuring this project, we have shown that electric fields can be used to manipulate the mixing temperature of a blend of two polymers, polystyrene and poly(vinyl methyl ether).  A strong electric field strength of 17 MV/m increases the miscibility of the blend, shifting the phase separation temperature up by 13.5 &deg;C.  This effect is much stronger than what is predicted by existing theory.  We have also found that at a given temperature, the blend can be switched from its mixed state to phase separated state, and back again, by simply turning on and off the electric field. \n\nTo better understand the underlying cause of this phenomenon, we have also done studies of polymer behavior near interfaces.  These efforts have experimentally tested various theoretical models and assumptions used to interpret these materials.  In particular, we have found that the local glass transition temperature (temperature at which a polymer changes from a liquid to a solid) is very broad across a polymer-polymer interface between two different polymer domains.  This suggests that some of the local properties of the different domains are more strongly coupled than the local composition profile, an observation that challenges some of our basic assumptions about how these materials behave. \n\nEducational efforts included training of graduate and undergraduate students in the process of scientific research.  These students and the PI also participated in activities such as Physics Live!, part of the Atlanta Science Festival, that engaged grade school children and the public in the excitement of science.  A new book edited by the PI was published in 2016, Polymer Glasses (CRC Press), covering recent advances in molecular level understanding of polymer glasses in confinement and under deformation.  Polymer glasses are amorphous, non-equilibrium materials used extensively in applications from everyday disposable water bottles to structural supporting layers in advanced batteries and organic solar cells.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Connie B Roth"
