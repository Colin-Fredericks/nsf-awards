 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continued funding for an innovative effort to gather data about prices and incomes for many goods across many countries and across a very long time span.  The PIs and their collaborators in the US work with a global group of scholars to assemble data on the prices of staple goods and on the distribution of income. They make extensive searches of a variety of archival data sources to assemble this information.  The result is publicly available data that can be used to make comparsions about per capita incomes and living standards across time and across distance.  The PIs will continue previous effort with expanded data collection in China, Russia and Latin America. They will collect a new fiscal history data set that will compare certain indicators of government revenues and expenditures over the past centuries. The PIs plan research into whether relative prices are a cause of class-specific lifestyles and the structural determinants of fiscal capacity and fiscal choice. The PIs will also add this historical data to the Penn World Tables, which provide similar data for the period since 1950. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts include training both undergraduate and graduate students in the necessary research methods.  The data are also useful for policy makers who want to understand the historic roots of modern economic systems.",

The Group is proud of this, and is grateful to NSF for its crucial research support.\n\n            The central question driving the Group\u00c6s research efforts has been \"Who had better living standards than whom in the past?\" The answers provided by the GPIH Group\u00c6s research, and the downloadable data it supplies, have expanded since NSF support began.  A key starting point was to make the units of measurement comparable across countries, converting currency units into silver or hard currencies, and converting idiosyncratic local physical units into metric units.

The Group\u00c6s internet site sprouted new folders on government budgets and on nominal GDP.  Books published in this phase were Philip Hoffman\u00c6s Why Did Europe Conquer the World (2015), Guanglin Liu\u00c6s Chinese Market Economy, 1000-1500 (2015), and a still-forthcoming book by Debin Ma and co-authors on China\u00c6s economic growth over the last millennium, which they have previewed at length in the Journal of Economic Literature (March 2014). \n\n            Supported by these earlier waves of new data on wages, prices, GDP, and government spending around the world, a new phase of research has focused on inequality and fiscal redistribution, and also on some major revisions in the history of nations\u00c6 relative purchasing power.
