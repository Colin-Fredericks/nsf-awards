 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit.  All organisms, from viruses to man, must synthesize proteins from their genomes by the process of protein synthesis (translation). Plant viruses are especially intriguing, as they must compete with their host cells for limited translation factors without killing the cell.  Research on plant viruses has revealed that the end of the RNA genome most distal to where translation begins (the 3' end) is a critical region for attracting components of translation to the genome, leading to substantially enhanced translation.  The 3' region of one virus with an RNA genome, Pea enation mosaic virus, was recently found to contain a translational enhancer that attracts ribosomes, the central protein synthesizing machines, and may function by helping ribosomes recycle following genome translation.  In addition, this translational enhancer also participates in a long-distance joining with another element near the other end (the 5' end) of the virus.  This project will examine how this translational enhancer interacts with ribosomes and whether ribosomes can \"bridge\" the ends of the viral genome by interacting simultaneously with both 3' and 5' RNA elements.  Since viral genomes cannot be replicated and translated at the same time, this research will also investigate how the virus switches between these incompatible activities.  Finally, the research will explore the possibility that the host plant's genome contains similar ribosome-binding elements that enhance translation of host RNAs.  Developing new paradigms for how the 3' region participates in translation will prompt other investigators to correctly examine their genes or viruses for 3' translational enhancers, which will be transformative in the translation field.  By understanding how these translational enhancers function, it should be possible to include them when designing new ways to produce higher levels of products in plants for improvement of agricultural traits.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. This research will be conducted by graduate and postdoctoral researchers, who will learn state-of-the art techniques and model-building to enhance their development as scientists. Undergraduate researchers will also participate in all aspects of this project, learning about the excitement of scientific discoveries.  Enthusiasm for research-based discovery will continue to be conveyed weekly to Advanced Placement high school students and teachers at DuVal High School (98% minority) in Prince George's County, Maryland, with several students already benefiting by being accepted at top colleges/universities and majoring in STEM subjects.  The principal investigator will also continue to effectively represent science and scientists to the public, most recently as a consultant for a Discovery TV Series and participation in activities such as the Saturday morning science program at the University of Toledo.  Specific examples from this research will also be used to excite and enhance the education experience of students in their first year as science majors at the University of Maryland through an introductory biology course taught by the principal investigator.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRNA viruses are key pathogens of plants, animals, and humans.  Despite substantial research conducted over the past 50 years, how a virus interacts with its host to replicate and produce thousands of progeny viruses leading to a successful infection of the host remains elusive.  An RNA virus interacts with a cell in two ways:  through translation of its few proteins and through the structure of its RNA genome.  More and more, the structure of an RNA virus is being found to be an important determent for all aspects of the virus life cycle.  We identified novel structures in the trailing edge of the genome (the 3\u00c6 untranslated region or UTR) of a simple RNA virus that infects plants.  This virus, PEMV, was found to have an astonishing number of discrete RNA elements in its 3\u00c6UTR that are critical for translation of its genome.  We discovered two elements that fold into T-shaped structures and directly bind to ribosomes, the cellular machines responsible for protein translation.  We also found a Y-shaped structure that binds to a specific cellular protein and this binding appears to be critical for virus replication.  Two other novel structures were also identified that appear to function in protein translation.  This is the most complete map of 3\u00c6UTR RNA elements for any virus and provides a roadmap for other virus researchers who are trying to establish similar maps.\n\n We also analyzed a long-distance interaction between the RNA of one 3\u00c6UTR element and an RNA structure (the RSE) that is important for ribosomes to translate the virus\u00c6s polymerase, the enzyme responsible for virus replication.  The mechanism that PEMV uses causes ribosomes to either stop just before the RSE (and make another smaller protein), or a small percent of the time, to \"shift reading frames\" and continue making the full polymerase.  This process, called -1 ribosome frameshifting, and a related process (studied with a second virus, TCV) called ribosome readthough, have been extensively studied by others for the past 30 years and are processes used by a vast array of viruses including such important viruses as SARS, MERS, and HIV.  However, despite substantial efforts these processes remains enigmatic.  We realized that the approach being used by everyone (removing the RSE from the virus and attaching it to RNA that is easier to study) is resulting in misleading findings and holding back the field.  We found that TCV has a major alternative structure involving an extensive region of the RNA adjacent to the RSE region and that this alternative structure is the key to understanding ribosome readthrough.  In addition, we found that the field is wrong in thinking that an RSE is critical for the -1 frameshift event.  We determined that when the structure is removed in PEMV, that normal levels of frameshifting still occur.  This means that the RSE is important for fine tuning -1 frameshifting, but not for causing the event.  These findings will be highly significant to the field.\n\nWe have also made an important finding in the field of RNA silencing, the process that plants use to defend themselves against viruses.   Viruses, in turn, produce a protein called a silencing suppressor, which targets components of the RNA silencing system, thus allowing the virus to overcome the defenses of the plant.   We previously found that the entire 3\u00c6UTR forms many interactions in addition to ones that use traditional G:C and A:U base pairs.  We have been exploring these \"higher order\" interactions used a method whereby individual nucleotides known to be critical are changed, and then we let the virus replicate and naturally \"mutate\" its genome to accommodate these initial changes and improve its replication.  Many secondary changes were unexpectedly located within the region of the virus that specifies its coat protein.  In TCV, the coat protein has many functions, including serving as the virus\u00c6s suppressor of RNA silencing.  We found that the new alteration reduced the eff..."
