 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the most dramatic changes now underway in the polar cryosphere is the several-fold speedup of Greenland and West Antarctic outlet glaciers.   Computational models of ice sheets face considerable challenges in correctly   simulating these events, which in turn, limits glaciologists' and climatologists' ability to predict future change.  The challenge arises from limited knowledge of key variables, for example, the shape of the land surface beneath the ice. Data limitations present two problems; first, important details of ice behavior may be missed and second, models may produce results that compare well with observations but do so for   the wrong reasons. The goal of this project is to use these uncertainties   themselves as a guide to identifying which types of data are most important to   producing useful projection of future ice sheet change.  The work is focused on two regions, the Aurora basin in East Antarctica, where new high resolution data have recently become available, and the catchment surrounding South Pole station deep in the interior or East Antarctica, where ice flow is currently sluggish may have been faster in the past.    \r\n\r\nBayesian inference may be used to investigate formally the contributions of various model attributes to uncertainty in model projections by synthesizing information from different sources of data, modeling results, and corresponding error information. Here, an ice sheet model will be asked to identify the regions and processes that have the largest influence on ice flow and thickness change, according to an appropriate range of boundary conditions and initial model states. The approach will allow us to create and analyze correlation maps showing relationships between various boundary conditions and model outcome in selected study areas. Those parameters or regions that are most important should dominate the scatter in model projections of change. The associated posterior probability density will provide guidance on how to design observational strategies to meet specified scientific criteria.",

The difficulty is that much of what controls ice sheet mass balance is not easily observable because those processes occur on or near the subglacial bed. Of particular concern is the potential for unforced mass loss. That occurs when conditions supporting the current ice sheet configuration are no longer viable and the ice sheet evolves to a new, less extensive, configuration that is sustainable. Much of the western portion of the modern ice sheet rests on the ocean floor and has been sustained by the predominately glacial climate over 100,000s of years. We also know that climate similar to the modern existed 120,000 years ago and that sea level was 6 to 10 meters higher than present, perhaps because of ice that is currently residing in the marine portions of western Antarctica. Many scientists think that the modern ice sheet configuration is at or near a transition point, and that the ice sheet could be entering a period where rapid mass loss could proceed with little or no additional forcing such as warming from the surrounding ocean. The particular question of the grant is how to assess the risks from insufficient knowledge of the shape of the subglacial bed, which is one of several important factors that help determine transitions in simplified models of glacier flow generally known as the Marine Ice Sheet Instability.</p>\n<p>The project involves a collaboration between a climate scientist with expertise in uncertainty quantification and glaciologists with expertise in ice sheet modeling. A key concept in the proposed work is a synthesis of the combined effects of various unknowns on a model's predictions. We query ice sheet models for the regions and processes that have the largest influence on how ice sheets may respond to environmental change, under the constraint of available observational data. One may formalize this activity within a statistical framework and make use of high performance computing resources to explore a much more exhaustive set of possibilities than would be possible through single sensitivity experiments. Here we highlight project results concerning Thwaites Glacier in west Antarctica where rapid change is now underway and the potential for unstoppable grounding line retreat has been or is about to be crossed. In order to examine processes regulating basin-wide ice mass loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the research team applied an ice-sheet model to capture realistic grounding line dynamics at 250 meter resolution over hundreds of years. This resolution pushes the limits of ice sheet modeling and comes at a high cost.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to learn something about the dynamics of the system we deployed a modeling strategy used in climate dynamics to learn about the thresholds and stability of ocean circulation. In a set of experiments we very slowly ramped up ocean melting of the surrounding ice shelves to detect the point at which mass loss from imposed melt may become self-sustaining. In the set of experiments reported in Waibel et al. (2018), this occurred at 13 m/year melt. The system did not stop losing mass until nearly all of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was evacuated, taking nearly 2000 years to do so. The most interesting aspect of our experiments came from studying the effects of small differences in melt rate at or near the transition point. We found that with only 0.5 m/year additional forcing at the time the system is experiencing this flow transition, discharge rates were upwards of 50% higher for centuries. This result is due to the role of added forcing in creating steeper slopes at the grounding line (the point at which an ice sheet forms an ice shelf) which in turn cause higher discharge rates.
