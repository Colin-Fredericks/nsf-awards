 "awd_abstract_narration": "College of Menominee Nation (CMN) seeks to increase the number of CMN\r\nSTEM students participating in external research-based student internship opportunities.\r\nExternal research is defined as research outside of CMN and outside of the Menominee\r\nReservation and other local communities. The project is expected to increase STEM student\r\nretention, graduation, and matriculation rates.\r\nThe project uses three strategies.\r\n&#1048696; Development and coordination of the project: Key activities include hiring a researchbased\r\ninternship coordinator, reviewing feasibility of requiring research-based internships for\r\nSTEM degree attainment, coordination of advisory board meetings, and leveraging of outside\r\npartners to establish consistent research-based internships.\r\n&#1048696; Efforts to institutionalize the project: Key activities under strategy two include researching,\r\nand organizing the research opportunities, creating a database of opportunities, developing\r\nand coordinating processes, developing and maintaining a research-based internship\r\nwebpage, and leveraging funding to provide student support for such opportunities.\r\n&#1048696; Provision of critical student support activities aimed at increasing STEM student\r\nparticipation in external research-based internship opportunities: Activities include\r\nrecruiting STEM students to participate in program, matching students to appropriate\r\nopportunities, assisting with applications, and preparation for requirements, and interviews,\r\nassisting students make connections, encouraging students through the process, advocating\r\nfor student acceptance into internship programs, providing extensive follow-up and developing\r\nand coordinating a series of workshops related to research-based internships.\r\nIntellectual Merit: Tribal Colleges are key contributors to the body of knowledge on American\r\nIndians. To date many Tribal Colleges have integrated research opportunities into their STEM\r\ncapacity; however the focus has been on providing these opportunities within the context of the\r\ntribal colleges system and community. Although these experiences are indeed valuable to\r\ngaining student interest and are providing numerical increases in retention and graduation rates,\r\nthey exclude critical exposure opportunities for students outside of the institution and outside of\r\nthe community. To date, CMN has documented increased retention and graduation rates of\r\nstudents participating in external research. However these are only a handful of students. It is\r\ncritical that further study on the importance and impacts of external research-based internship\r\nopportunities within the tribal college system take place. Such data will focus on the impacts of\r\nexternal student research and how it achieves the ultimate outcomes of NSF?s investment in\r\ntribal colleges: ensuring students graduate, matriculate into four-year and graduate STEM\r\nprograms, and enter the workforce system as diverse qualified individuals.\r\nBroader Impacts: CMN?s project will build upon the research of the several NSF TCUP grants\r\nit has completed, continuing the investigation of essential research in discovering and\r\nunderstanding how Tribal Colleges and the unique strategies they implement promote STEM\r\neducation in minority students. As an institution that serves predominantly Native American\r\nstudents, CMN?s project further advances the research of American Indian undergraduate\r\neducation in STEM courses and programs as well as contributes to the global body of\r\nknowledge in underrepresented minority STEM education. Short term impacts include increases\r\nin retention and graduation rates at CMN. Long-term project impacts include an increase of\r\nAmerican Indians in four year and graduate STEM programs as well as an increase in American\r\nIndians in STEM employment fields.",
