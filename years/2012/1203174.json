 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The University of Colorado at Boulder, in collaboration with the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Virginia, and the University of Washington are supporting an extension service project that is synergistically serving the disciplines most in need of help for improving women?s representation: computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. At each of 30 institutions, interdepartmental teams of change agents from computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering departments are being established. In each institution, high-level administrative commitment is elicited. At each ?client? institution, the interdepartmental teams recruit cooperatively for ?net new women,? as opposed to raiding each other?s pool of potential majors. Each department is adopting research-based methods for retaining undergraduate women, such as improved faculty-student interaction, and will be held accountable for initiatives, evaluation, and reporting. Cooperative department teams are supported and guided by a cadre of highly trained and experienced consultants. These train their assigned interdisciplinary teams on proven practices and methods for recruiting and retaining women. In addition, experienced staff and external evaluators will support departments and consultants with tracking and evaluation tools, collect and review periodic progress reports, and recommend improvements. This extension service focuses on reforming departmental and faculty practices in sustainable ways for long-term improvement in their undergraduate gender balance. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project will significantly raise the number of women of all races and ethnicities who receive bachelor?s degrees in the neediest fields: computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Explicitly including minority-serving institutions will help to meet national diversity goals in these areas. Use of data to identify minority women?s typical major choices will support local recruiting on each campus. The project will bring explicit, widespread attention to the exemplar institutions and document their approaches so that others may emulate their practices.\r\n",
