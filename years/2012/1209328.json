  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn updated chronology for the GISP2 ice core, and implications for paleoclimate inferences\n\nJessica Lundin\n\nAccurate chronologies are paramount for properly assessing the timing of past climate events.  Paleoclimate research rests on accurate chronologies for ice cores and other proxies, for climate variation including temperature and precipitation.  Chronologies are continuously being refined, as laboratory techniques and methods for dating are improved.  Data from ice cores and other proxies are important for assigning physical processes in the ocean and atmosphere that explain the climate histories observed from ice cores and other proxies.  If these chronologies are incorrect, there are implications for the physical processes attributed for the observations.\n\nHere we improved the chronology of the Greenland Ice-Core Project 2 (GISP2) records.  The Meese-Sowers GISP2 chronology (Meese, et al., 1997; Sowers, et al., 1993) has been shown to differ by up to 2,500 years from the composite Greenland ice core chronology, GICC05 (Svensson, et al., 2010).  Using the method of Lundin, et al. (In Prep), we refined the GISP2 chronology and amend the significant difference between the GISP2 and GICC05 records.  The proposed method incorporates the ice core dating, dating uncertainty and the physics of ice deformation.  The physical basis for the method provides a robust chronology, and allows us to apply a cutting-edge method to improve the chronology of an important climate record. \n\nThe GISP2 ice core is an important chronology, because it represents paleoclimate conditions in both Greenland and the Arctic, including temperature, accumulation rate (precipitation), and atmospheric composition.  Temperature, accumulation rate and some atmospheric gas concentrations are local phenomena, so it is important to have a climate record in the Arctic to get a representative record. The GISP2 ice core has high temporal resolution among ice cores. Site conditions of GISP2 include high accumulation rates, which produce thicker annual layers in the ice core.  Thicker annual layers improve dating accuracy from counting annual layers by reducing the uncertainty, and therefore sites with high accumulation rates provide chronologies with less uncertainty and improved accuracy.  Greenland ice cores are characterized by high accumulation rates and better chronologies compared to Antarctic ice cores, which tend to have significantly lower accumulation rates, smaller annual layers, and poor chronologies due to lack of ability to accurately count annual layers.\n\nAlthough GISP2 is a Greenland record, it is also important for dating Antarctic ice cores, through the globally well-mixed methane record. From matching peaks in the methane record, dating from the high-resolution GISP2 chronology can be transferred to the Antarctic ice, which is challenging to date without such correlation to other Greenland records.  By improving the GISP2 chronology, we additionally improve the chronologies for multiple Antarctica ice cores.  With accurate climate records in both North and South hemispheres, the best possible understanding of global and regional climate dynamics including the bipolar seesaw can be observed.\n\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to improve the chronology of the Greenland Ice-sheet Project (GISP2) ice core.
