Sanders\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests two Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment items for the University of Delaware for use aboard the R/V HUGH R. SHARP; namely a new double-articulated side A-frame and up-grades to an existing portable deck winch.  Both items will enhance safety and provide greatly improved support capabilities to a wide variety of scientific projects.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nBroader Impact and Intellectual Merit:  The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP.  The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit.  During operations, these vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Specifically, College of Marine and Earth Studies participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events (Coast Day), participation the MATE program, and educational cruises.  The College also hosts the UNOLS East Coast Van Pool.  The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is scheduled to support over 90 NSF-funded days in CY 2012.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment program provides support to improve safety and enhance scientific productivity aboard research vessels who are members of the University National Oceanographic Laboratories System, or UNOLS academic fleet.  As a UNOLS member, the University of Georgia's Skidaway Institute of Oceanography in Savannah, Georgia operates the Research Vessel Savannah, a 92-foot coastal class vessel conducting primarily federally-funded research.  The majority of the R/V Savannah's research is conducted in the estuarine and continental shelf waters of the South Atlantic Bight (between Cape Hatteras, NC and Cape Canaveral FL).\n\nThis two-year grant provided funds for equipment and support services to  enhance safety during science operations by enabling the vessel to meet requirements as outlined in appendix A &amp; B of the Research Vessel Safety Standards (RVSS), upgrade monitoring of overboard handling systems and provide equipment for weight testing of those systems.  The items funded  from this grant are outlined below.\n\nTrawl Block\n\nA new over boarding sheave (trawl block) to be used with the  A-frame/trawl winch over boarding system for heavy lifting operations was funded through this grant.  The size (sheave diameter) of the  proposed new block, along with tension monitoring on the cable, would  allow for heavier lifts under the RVSS Appendix A criteria.  However,  attempts to establish monitoring on the cable (winch replacement and/or  monitoring at the block), were unsuccessful.  It was therefore decided that going ahead with the trawl block purchase would have been premature.  The residual funds from this item have been used for a synthetic tension member for weight testing, an A-frame structural analysis revision and A-frame drawings revision based on recent repairs, and  the physical refurbishment of the CTD sheave now at Rolls-Royce.  \n\nMonitoring Upgrades for CTD Winch Over Boarding Sheaves\n\nThe grant also provided funds for firmware and software upgrades for  two of the three Rolls-Royce Instrumented Metered Sheaves (IMS) on the Savannah.  These sheaves provide pay-out and tension  monitoring for the vessel's #1 and #2 CTD winches. The third sheave was  previously upgraded in 2011.  This upgrade is a modification of the  existing sheave output (tension and payout) rate from 1 Hz to 3 Hz and  changes this output from a proprietary format to a standard NEMA string  for integration with the ship\u00c6s primary data acquisition software (NOAA  SCS).  These upgrades provide real time monitoring and recording at 3 Hz  as  outlined in the Research Vessel Safety Standards (RVSS) Appendix A  and allow the operator to review wire tension history.\n\nLay, Pitman &amp; Associates, Inc. Engineering Study\n\nA major component of this request involved contracting the vessel's naval architect, Lay Pitman &amp; Associates, Inc., to conduct an analysis of the Savannah's overboard handling systems, including the A-frame and J-frame, articulating crane, pot hauling davit and all associated system components including winches, sheaves and vessel support structures.  This study has provided the vessel with Maximum Capability Documents (MCD's) for each system which allows the operator to establish safe operating parameters for the deployment and retrieval of science packages under various loading conditions and geometries.  Required two-year safety testing procedures have also been developed for each system.  \n\nDillon Dynamometer and Quick Check Tension Meter\n\n\nIn December of 2012 the R/V Savannah received a Dillon 25K EDX Dynamometer with wireless communicator from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the UNOLS fleet group purchase.  The Dynamometer is used in weight tests and to weigh science packages prior to deck loading.  A year later in December 2013, the Savannah received the Dillon Quick Check Tension Meter from WHOI as part of that same group purchase.  This meter has be..."
