Participants will include E&O personnel and advisors from facilities and large research projects supported by the Division of Earth Sciences and other related organizations. The Provider Summit will be co-facilitated and evaluated by E&O experts from the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) at Carleton College. The outcome and products of the meeting will constitute a unique resource for shaping informal and formal Earth science education and public outreach. The EarthScope National Office will ensure that the findings and products of the Provider Summit will be widely disseminated through its own channels, through SERC, and via the other participating organizations. These resources will be highly visible and freely available to all Earth science educators, educational institutions, and societies.",
