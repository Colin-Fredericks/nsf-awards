 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geophysical Investigation of the Mid-Continent Rift System \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the Central U.S. is an ideal place to study one of the more important processes shaping our planet - the breaking apart of continents to form new oceans. Throughout earth's history, continents have split along rifts, long zones of volcanism and stretching, which become spreading centers along which new ocean basins form and can grow to the size of the Atlantic and Pacific. It even looks like similar rifting may have happened on other planets.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how rifting works is important for both science and society, because rifting provides conditions for the deposition of hydrocarbons and other mineral resources. The problem is that when rifting succeeds in forming a new ocean, not much remains from its early stages so it's hard to see what happened.\r\n\r\nTo get around this, researchers are studying a spectacular rift that failed, the Mid-Continent Rift System.  This system evolved around 1.1 billion years ago, when North America nearly split.  However, the rift failed, leaving a 2000 km long belt of volcanic and sedimentary rocks left from the early rifting stage.  This fossil rift, which is similar in length to the present East African and Baikal rifts, has two major arms meeting in the Lake Superior region. One extends southwestward at least as far as Kansas, and the other extends southeastward through Michigan. These arms are identified using the large gravity and magnetic anomalies resulting from dense and highly magnetic igneous rocks. They are largely covered by younger sediments but outcrop near Lake Superior and can be followed further south in drill cores. \r\n\r\nThe study combines seismic and magnetotelluric data being acquired by NSF's EarthScope program with gravity and magnetic data to develop an integrated three-dimensional image of the rift system and constrain its evolution. One of its goals is to learn whether the rift formed as a response to melting in the underlying mantle, as commonly proposed for the East African Rift, or because of stresses transmitted within the lithosphere, as appears to be the case for Asia's Baikal Rift.",

This was quite a surprise. We have answered the question posed previously: \"What alteration of the deep lithosphere has taken place at the time of partial melting that persists 1.1 ga after the melting event and long after any residual melt should still be in place? Answering this requires a fully multidisciplinary approach and interaction with our seismic, potential fields and geochem/petrology colleagues.\". Indeed. By examining the geochemistry of the ancient environment, we now have such a mechanism.<br /><br />Broader Impacts:</p>\n<p>The mid-continent rift is associated with an iron and other mineral ore belt whose discovery and exploitation was foundational to industrial expansion in the US. The current work, for the first time, shows there is a clear magnetotelluric signature to these ore-bearing belts, and ties the origin of those materials to a hitherto undetected (but geologically suspected) upper mantle plume. This may have an impact on the exploitation and economic assessment of new ore bearing belts in future.</p>\n<p>Our recent discoveries further south in the Illinois Basin that resulted from this project are beginning to shed light on the accretionary history of the continental core. In the longer term, combined with increased understanding of the nearby New Madrid Seismic Zone, our work may contribute to better understanding the seismic risk of the mid-continent.</p>\n<p>The strong upper mantle conductivity anomaly detected by this project and attributed to the trace of the ancient Keweenaw hotspot beneath the Mid-Continent Rift coincides with a section of the electric power grid where relatively modest geomagnetic disturbances induce relatively large geomagnetically induced currents in the power grid. Thus there is a geological explanation for a phenomenon first detected by power system engineers. This approach is now playing a role in the electric utility industry's efforts to carry out risk assessment for vulnerabilities of the power grid to the effects of space weather.
