 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating hands-on biomedical engineering experiments and course materials with a focus on artificial organs.  These modules are being implemented in freshman engineering courses and in core and elective courses in chemical, mechanical and electrical engineering to expand the biomedical engineering workforce. The modules are also being adapted for Grade 6-12 teachers and students, which will expose more students to biomedical engineering careers. Each module is being introduced with a medical case study which provides context to motivate students and present ethical issues. Teams of students are engaging in guided discovery through hands-on laboratory investigations, which maximizes learning and enables them to discover underlying engineering principles to inform their design of an artificial organ. The project's focus on social relevance and teamwork is designed to increase diversity in engineering.",
