 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The PIs will use the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, as a model system and will attempt to optimize the design of networks of no-take reserves as a strategy for maintaining metapopulations of this commercially harvested species.  The project specifically recognizes that network persistence depends on (1) the potential for growth, survival, and reproduction within reserves, and (2) the potential to distribute offspring among reserves. Thus, demographic processes within reserves and settling areas play important roles, along with variability of physical transport.  The PIs plan to: (1) test and refine 3D bio-physical models of connectivity due to oyster larval transport in a shallow, wind-dominated system; (2) test, refine, and apply technology to detect natal origins of larvae using geochemical tags in larval shell; and (3) integrate regional connectivity and demographic rates to model metapopulation dynamics. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This study will produce new tools and test and refine others used for studying larval connectivity, a fundamentally important process in the maintenance of natural populations, and thus in biological conservation and resource management.  The tools include a hydrodynamic modeling tool coupled with an open-source particle tracking model that will be available on-line with computer code and user guide. The project will use integrated modeling approaches to evaluate the design of reserve networks: results will be directly useful to improving oyster and ecosystem-based management in Pamlico Sound, and the methods will inform approaches to network design in other locations.  There is extensive education and outreach in the form of training undergraduate and graduate students, mentoring post-docs, and providing hands-on research opportunities for high school students and their teachers.",

Therefore, a major challenge in marine ecology and marine resource management is describing patterns of larval dispersal and population connectivity in the sea. The goal of this study was to gain insight into the larval connectivity and dispersal of a commercially and ecologically important invertebrate, the Eastern oyster (<em>Crassostrea virginica</em>), within a large estuarine system along the eastern US (Pamlico Sound, NC).

Thus, provided that there are spatial gradients in environmental conditions, these hard parts can carry a permanent record/tag that allows researchers to retroactively track individuals through time and space (i.e., a flight data recorder).

Using these atlases, we predicted the natal origin (i.e., connectivity) for newly settled oysters (spat) during three field trials conducted over two summers (2013- 2014).
