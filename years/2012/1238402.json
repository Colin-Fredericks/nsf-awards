All participants receiving support are required to present a talk or a poster.\r\n \r\nConference is aimed to provide a holistic examination of subduction processes by discussing megathrust earthquakes and tsunami modeling, subduction dynamics and mantle convection, fluids in subduction systems, rheology and slab dynamics, seismic imaging of subducting slabs and induced mantle flow, and subduction and tectonics. The program includes a field trip aimed to provide a brief introduction of the Jeju Island geology. The Jeju island is a volcanic island recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its spectacular lava tubes.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will contribute to the development of the emerging scientists of the field by providing them with the opportunity to meet and interact with leading national and international researchers, gaining deeper understanding and broader perspective of the field, and forming the basis for future collaborations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis proposal funded the travel for five early career researchers to attend the Conference on the Geophysics of Slab Dynamics, Jeju Island, South Korea, August 19-22, 2012.  A group of 30-40 scientists from the US, Japan, Korea and Europe converged to spend three days discussing the latest results from the study of subduting plates ranging from tsunami generation to the ultimate fate of subducted material.  Below is a brief summary of the results.\n\nScientists who study the subduction of Earth's tectonic plate on the scale of hundreds to thousands of kilometers do not normally interact with the scientists who study deformation near the surface of a subduction zone (e.g., earthquakes, movement on faults, generation of tsunamis).  The main goal of the Conference on the Geophysics of Slab Dynamics was to begin to bridge that gap.  Participants at Jeju reached a consensus on moving toward integrating near?surface processes into subduction zone numerical models, based on the substantial progress in our ability to integrate crustal evolution into computational models of subduction. With advances in computational power and numerical algorithms, heterogeneities below the 1 kilometer scale, which were only a decade ago completely unthinkable, are now possible. \n\nWhile statistical analyses are important for testing hypotheses regarding the earthquake events, the limited number of the largest earthquakes makes the statistical approach inapplicable.  What is needed are more detailed, site?specific analysis of the deformation at subduction zones with tsunami observations and numerical modeling providing additional strong constraints on tsunami generation.  Over the past decade, progress in geodynamic numerical modeling has moved us closer to simulating short? and long?term processes, with a resolution of tens of meters near thrust faults.

A followup meeting is currently in the development stages and  all of the talks are on youtube and can be found by googling \"youtube geophysics of slab dynamics\".
