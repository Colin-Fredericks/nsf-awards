 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for NanoBiotechnology Research (CNBR) was established at Alabama State University in 2007 as a NSF Center of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST).  The Phase II Center will expand and strengthen a major research activity at Alabama State, which has become a model for the development of research scholarship at a university that only a decade ago was a primarily undergraduate institution with only a small amount of funded STEM research activity.  The Phase I award (HRD-0734232) trained 26 graduate students, led to the first 3 PhD students at Alabama State University (all programs), led to the first patents being awarded to ASU, enabled a world-class research infrastructure, led to new curricula development, and led to the formation of national and international collaborations.  The nanotechnology infrastructure now in place is capable of synthesizing, analyzing and applying nanomaterials into biological systems.\r\n\r\nThe Phase II CREST award will enable the advancement of nanobiotechnology and nanogenomics, which has the potential for development of a new generation of therapies and diagnostic tools. The new research projects that will comprise the scholarly activity of the CNBR will build on the Phase I activities that established a solid foundation at Alabama State in nanobiotechnology.  The Center will be a leader in the CREST goals to develop a diverse, advanced STEM workforce and should be positioned within the next 5 years to compete effectively for major support from NSF, NIH, and other state and federal agencies, as well as industry.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research is organized around the following subprojects:\r\n\r\n1.  Evaluation of Anti-RSV Multi-functionalized Nanobiomaterials and Their Effect on Host and Viral Genomes\r\n\r\nThe first project embarks on nanovirology by exploring nanomaterials to specifically target a virus. Virus specific biomolecules (anti-peptide and siRNA) with known properties will be used to functionalize nanomaterials and apply them to inhibit virus replication.\r\n\r\n2.  Nanobiomaterials as Anti-bacterial Agents\r\n\r\nThe second project focuses on applications of nanomaterials against bacteria. Many antibiotics are in the market but are resistant to many bacteria, necessitating the design of new classes of anti-bacterials. The research team will develop and apply novel nanomaterials that can destroy bacteria and stop their growth. The main goal is to understand the mechanisms by which nanomaterials kill bacteria.\r\n\r\n3.  Regulation of Immune Cells Using Novel Nanomaterials: Merging Nanoimmunology and Nanogenomics\r\n\r\nThe third project will explore novel materials that could non-specifically enhance immune functions and reduce disease manifestations.  Proposed nano-biomaterials will be synthesized, characterized and tested in biological systems using nanoscience tools and techniques.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe Phase II CREST award will enable the advancement of nanobiotechnology and nanogenomics, which has the potential for development of a new generation of therapies and diagnostic tools.  The three subprojects have overlapping research objectives.   All three projects will analyze genes from host as well as pathogens and use bioinformatics tools to analyze data. In addition, proteomics will be used by all projects which will study the impact of nanobiomaterials at the functional levels. All projects have common methods for analyzing nanomaterials and samples. The project relevancy and synergy are based on: 1) synthesis/characterization of nanomaterials, 2) genomic studies of host and pathogen, 3) proteomic studies of gene products in response to nanobiomaterials.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe CNBR will be a leader in the CREST goals to develop a diverse, advanced STEM workforce and should be positioned within the next 5 years to compete effectively for major support from NSF, NIH, and other state and federal agencies, as well as industry. The Phase I center support has resulted in the establishment of excellent research infrastructure to train minority students in nanobiotechnology, thus increasing the number of well-trained minority students for the scientific workforce. The Phase II CNBR will continue to increase the number of minorities in the Ph.D. program and the workforce in nanobiotechnology and nanogenomics. The center will provide leadership in new curricula development, undergraduate research opportunities and expose students to entrepreneurship. The center will continue to impact a large number of constituents in the state of Alabama by providing opportunities to high school students, hosting dignitaries, and offering seminars and workshops open to the general public. The center will work with over 15 U.S. institutions, 4 NSF centers, 6 NSF-funded programs (MSP, RISE, HBCU-UP, SBIR, C2 RII, PIRE) and will impact a large and diverse number of constituents. The center will continue to work with global partners to prepare students and faculty who are globally competitive in emerging scientific technologies.   \r\n\r\nThis award has been partially funded through the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research at the National Science Foundation.",
