 "awd_abstract_narration": "Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (University of Georgia) proposes to support technical services on R/V Savannah, a 92? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  They will provide a technician on most cruises to maintain and assist scientists in the use of shared-use instrumentation at sea.  The technical services group will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. All users (or the appropriate funding agencies) share support for basic technical services on the vessel equally, with NSF paying a share of technical support costs based on fractional usage of the vessel during the year.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Skidaway Institute of Oceanography operates the UNOLS Research Vessel Savannah with direct support in part from the Oceanographic Technical Services (OTS) program funded under Integrative Programs Section (IPS) of the Division of Ocean Sciences Division (OCE).   The completed 5-yr continuing OTS grant supported the salary for one full time Marine Technician on the R/V Savannah, backup technician salary, 2-months/year of salary for the Marine Operations Technical Manager, technical equipment/supplies, and instrumentation service costs.  All together OTS funds have enhanced the ship?s technical capabilities and provided technical support for scientist aboard all research cruises on the R/V Savannah.  \n\nA Marine Technician is onboard for all research cruises.  Zac Tait has served as the ship?s full-time Marine Technician since 2016, prior to this he served as the backup tech for two years.  The Marine Technician on the R/V Savannah works to ensure scientific data collections at sea are successful.  This begins ashore prior to a cruise with open and responsive communications with the Chief Scientist during pre-cruise planning.  Underway, the Marine Technician maintains the ship?s suite of data acquisition systems, including the UHDAS ADCP system, Seabird 911 CTD, and NOAA SCS surface water mapping/MET/Ship sensor integration.  At the end of each cruise the Marine Technician?s duties include the shutdown of data acquisition systems, shut down and back flush of the salt water flow-thru system, offloading of science gear, and cleaning of laboratory spaces.  Data collected by the ship?s systems (CTD, ADCP, SCS) are archived and burned to CD/DVD or external hard drive for the Chief Scientist.  Data is archived on the ship and on shore-based servers, as well as on a cloud-based system.  All shared-use equipment is maintained by the Marine Technician.  The Marine Technician routinely inspects this gear for potential repairs and maintenance.  All requested shared-use equipment is loaded onto the ship at the direction of the Marine Technician.     \n\nBetween 2012 and 2017 the ship conducted 209 cruises and acquired 967 at sea for science days.  Of the 967 days at sea 429 were NSF funded (44%).  Additionally, 119 and 337 were funded from other federal agencies of ONR (12%) and NOAA (35%), respectively.\n\nOf these cruises, several were focused toward providing innovative opportunities for students to work and study at sea, and all of the cruises provided similar opportunities for students and teachers.  Thus, the Savannah and its operations were able to further improve educational experiences for a diverse group of individuals. Over 550 graduate and undergraduate students participated in Savannah cruises during the course of this award.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James G Sanders"
