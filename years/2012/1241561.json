The funds will help defray the travel, lodging, and registration costs for 13 graduate students as well as two invited speakers. SoCS 2012 will bring together researchers in all aspects of heuristic search and combinatorial optimization and its use in a broad range of areas in AI including core topics of Robust Intelligence like robotics, planning, constraint programming, and in other areas of interest across IIS like bioinformatics. One of the oldest subareas of research in AI, search continues to grow. Its advances include real-time search, parallel search, search using external memory, methods for using inconsistent heuristics, etc. Today it is central to solving problems in areas as diverse as optimal alignment of DNA sequences and real-time navigation. A special focus of SoCS 2012 is path-planning, which is important in robotics and computational biology. SoCS 2012 will include a new grid-based path planning competition.",
