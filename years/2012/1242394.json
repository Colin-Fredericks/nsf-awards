 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluorescent probes comprise a $3.1B market, with quantum dots (QDs) forming an increasing share. With photostability superior to that of fluorescent dyes QDs have made a significant impact in biomedical imaging. However, despite their success, customers have identified three limitations in QD use: (1) insufficient brightness, (2) instability in harsh environments, particularly exposure to UV or laser illumination typical of many biological experiments, and (3) \"blinking\", an intermittent loss of fluorescence that limits application in single molecule tracking. The MultiDot technology, developed at Ohio State University under 4 separate NSF grants, can potentially address these challenges. MultiDots are composite QDs, similar in size to commercial QDs, but displaying 5 times the brightness, dramatically increased stability, and reduced blinking compared to commercial particles. \r\n\r\nThe MultiDot has significant commercial potential, most notably in the biomedical imaging and diagnostic point-of-care test markets, which offer initial market entry points. The primary outcome of the I-Corps program will be market research and product development toward those markets, with the goal of (1) a go/no go decision, and if applicable, (2) identification of minimum customer-desired features and development and testing of a product with those features and (3) development of a business plan for appropriate markets. Because the MultiDots can be seamlessly substituted for QD competitors, it is anticipated that MultiDots could enter the market within a year. Additionally, this research will permit critical validation experiments to be performed that will enhance licensing potential.  If successful, this research will not only advance the commercialization of the MultiDot technology, but will also provide a new method of large scale nanomanufacturing that can potentially be applied to other nanocomposites.",
