 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program supports work by Professor Yu Xia at Purdue University to develop and validate instrumentation for implementing biomolecule ion/radical reactions on a linear ion trap mass spectrometry (MS) system.  A pulsed pyrolysis nozzle will be used to form and transfer intense radical beams to a linear ion trap, where peptide ions are stored for reactions.  The performance of the modified instrument will be tested from reactions between disulfide linked peptide ions and allyl or phenyl radicals.  It is a high risk/high reward project where efficient formation and transfer of radicals into high vacuum is a challenging task. Yet the learned knowledge will not only enable better understanding of biomolecular ion/radical reactions, but also provide a viable platform to study other gas-phase reactions important to combustion processes and atmospheric chemistry. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research and education activities emphasize the role of integrated fundamental scientific research and instrumentation, which establishes excellent training ground for both graduate and undergraduate students in analytical chemistry. Female and minority students will be mentored in this program and be participating in Purdue AGEP (Midwest Crossroads Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate) events.",
