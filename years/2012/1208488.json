Novel modifications of the expectation-maximization algorithm are proposed for scalable and efficient model fitting and inference in several important biological applications.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop new statistical models, computational algorithms, and decision theoretic analysis of estimates for high-throughput biological data. \u00a0The new methods can be applied in the analysis of microarrays, RNA sequencing counts, label-free shotgun proteomics, metabolomics, the identification of quantitative trait loci and association mapping.",
