The meeting is attended by representatives of more than 120 separate projects funded by NSF, NASA, and NOAA climate education-related programs. Grant funds are being used to develop the meeting registration web site and rent audio-visual equipment and other materials as required by the meeting agenda. The conference has a strong focus on integration of research in the climate sciences and the learning sciences, in order to strengthen educational practices in formal and informal learning environments, as well as improve the acquisition of knowledge about the complex, interdisciplinary topic of climate by learners of all ages. A major goal of this jointly sponsored conference is to improve coordination, cohesion, and synergy among the grantees, in order to foster greater efficiency and impact. Development of a common framework for program evaluation related to climate change education, which directly addresses priorities articulated in the 2012 NSTC Co-STEM report \"Coordinating Federal Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Investments: Progress Report\", is another goal of the conference.",
