Additional information can be found at the following website:\r\nhttp://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2012/Topology12/index_e.php\r\nThis is a workshop on connections between simple topological invariants of a normal algebraic variety, and other natural invariants, especially those coming from birational and affine algebraic geometry. Major themes will include the simple connectedness of rationally connected varieties, the related development of the Shafarevich map via cycle space theory, and the resolution of the Shafarevich conjecture on the universal cover of a smooth variety (with linear fundamental group) via Hodge theory in various guises. Among other central subjects there will be recent advances in the theory of plumbing for surface singularities that bridged many classical problems on algebraic varieties with knots and the theory of 3-manifolds, and the key role of the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality on (orbifold) Chern numbers of singular varieties in several new break-through results in affine algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nThe conference will bring together experts in algebraic/analytic geometry as well as relevant topologists working in low dimensional complex singularity theory for fruitful exchange of information and interaction on an international scale. It will introduce modern topological and analytical tools used in this area to a new generation of researchers.",
