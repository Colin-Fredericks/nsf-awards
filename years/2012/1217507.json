The conference will be accepting full-student papers and posters about\r\nstudent Research in Progress. Syracuse University, as the cosponsor and host, is planning to support\r\ndesignated student presenters. This proposal is written to request Student Travel/Support Grant to fund\r\nthose students who will present their research papers at the ICUWB2012 in Syracuse, NY, September 17?\r\n20, 2012.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis conference provides a forum for the latest UWB systems, technologies and applications in both\r\nmicrowave and millimeter wave bands. Wide scale commercial and defense applications are available\r\nusing UWB technologies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nICUWB 2012 will present contributions and developments in the UWB field covering a broad range of\r\ntopics through oral and poster sessions, workshops/tutorials, exhibitions. In this conference, there are two\r\nvenues for students to present their work: (1) regular paper and (2) student progress-in-research\r\ncolloquium. Students who are currently pursuing their degree and have research they would like to share\r\nmay participate in the Student Program by presenting incomplete research, currently underway. Research\r\nprojects which are not complete, research proposals and conceptual or theoretical proposals are all\r\nwelcome topics. Audience members will participate by providing the author with feedback and questions\r\npertaining to the ongoing research. This experience will encourage further development and refinement of\r\nthe student's research-in-progress and give presenting students the opportunity to network with\r\nresearchers and professionals in the field of ultra-wideband technology. Presence of these experts will\r\ngive the students chance for one-to-one interaction, discussion, and guidance. Moreover, supporting the\r\nprojects of students related to UWB research and development will contribute to the future of UWB\r\ntechnology.",
