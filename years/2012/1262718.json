 "awd_abstract_narration": "1236316\r\nWard\r\n\r\nEmulsions are liquid-liquid mixtures that are subject to sedimentation driven by gravitational forces. Examples of dilute-dispersed phase emulsions that are relevant for biological applications, or derived from bio-materials, include pharmaceutical drugs (e.g. propofol), topical creams (e.g. facial creams) and vegetable oil fuel emulsions. These emulsions are all derived from some form of lipid (fatty acid, triglyceride) that may be converted directly in a surfactant via a hydrolysis or saponification chemical reaction. Converting a percentage of the fatty acids directly into a surfactant would provide an easy one step process for stabilizing certain biologically relevant emulsion.  It is well known that surfactants, when adsorbing to an interface from the bulk-dispersed phase, will lead to decelerated motion of a droplet. The decelerated motion is caused by a Marangoni stress generated by concentration gradients due to the accumulation of surfactant at the rear of the droplet that oppose droplet sedimentation. The researchers will study a process to generate desorption dominated motion which would cause a reversal in the Marangoni stresses and therefore produce accelerated droplet motion when compared with sedimentation of a droplet with a clean interface. To generate stresses that cause droplet acceleration one must produce more surfactant at the interface than the long elapsed time, equilibrium surface coverage value. The researchers will demonstrate that this stress reversal may be produced by generating surfactant at the interface through a fast chemical reaction. A key objective of this proposal is a study of both accelerated and decelerated steady low Reynolds number droplet sedimentation in a viscous liquid. The unique feature in this project is droplet sedimentation in the presence of dilute surfactant species generated by an interfacial chemical reaction. The study includes a combination of experiments and mathematical/computational analyses. The goal is to experimentally measure the translational velocity of a single droplet as a function of the input parameters which are the reactant types (vegetable oils and dispersed-aqueous sodium hydroxide), concentration of reactants, and droplet volume. Parallel to the experiments, a mathematical analysis is performed using a power series expansion of Legendre and Gegenbauer polynomials to satisfy the steady interfacial species conservation laws containing thermodynamic relationships for adsorption/desorption and chemical reaction kinetics combined with momentum transport equations in the Stokes flow limit.\r\n\r\nThis project will explore novel physical phenomenon associated with the sedimentation speed of a single droplet.  The research should provide additional insight for current and future processes that utilize the long term storage of dilute emulsions since these processes depend on the velocity of a single sedimenting droplet. Further understanding of long term storage processes will be vital for emulsions produced from biological material since decomposition limits their shelf life. An undergraduate student from an HBCU will work in the PI's lab during the summer to participate in the project. The research results also will be disseminated though departmental websites and at conference meetings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDr. Thomas Ward has completed research for the study of drop sedimentation in the presence of a chemical reaction that produces a surfactant at the interface, thereby modifying the sedimentation rate.  To achieve the research goals, Dr. Ward had worked with two graduate (one M.S. and one Ph.D.) and three undergraduate students.  The funds provided by the grant supported the graduate students to the completion of their degrees, respectively.\n\nIn the engineering field, the minimization techniques developed by the PI's lab have produced a novel method for estimating surface tension.  The algorithm for determining surface tension from pendant drop shapes that the PI has developed with his graduate students is available for use.  Furthermore, the PI has ensured user-friendliness of the algorithm and supporting code.  This was demonstrated during the funding period through the involvement of undergraduate students, who were able to independently use the code.  There are limitations on the algorithm, which limit the software programs that may be considered suitable for compiling and use i.e. for most of the project period the PI's research group only used MATLAB.  But the PI will continue to work to develop the code in other languages so that it may be more widely distributed.\n\nThe algorithm for measuring surface tension formed the basis for the remainder of the research.  The PI and students were able to apply the measurement technique to study problems from drop sedimentation in the presence of surfactants, and a surfactant producing chemical reaction, to the breakup of drops in horizontal rotating tanks due to shear.  Much of this information is contained in the Ph.D. thesis submitted by the former graduate student, Andrew White, at Iowa State University. The thesis contains many examples of applications where precise surface tension measurements allowed for good agreement between computation and theory, which is rare in the field of fluid mechanics when surfactants are present.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Ward"
