 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching question that Scale, Consumers and Lotic Ecosystem Rates (SCALER) will address is: How can small-scale ecological experiments be applied to understand the behavior of entire ecological systems? Funds are provided to address:: 1) How should measures of fundamental properties of streams and effects of animals on those properties be scaled up to predict ecosystem characteristics of stream networks. 2) How do patterns of scaling compare across the wide array of ecological systems (from tundra to tropical forest) that occurs across North American? The SCALER experiment will be done in tropical forest, temperate mountainous forest, prairie, northern boreal evergreen forest, and tundra areas. Streams in each of these five areas will be examined at scales of centimeters to 10?s of meters in small, medium and large streams.  Rates of stream metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration) and nutrient uptake will be measured as well as the way these rates respond to animal exclusions (used to mimic loss of animal diversity in streams). These local results will be linked to the scale of watersheds and regions by modeling. Watershed scale predictions will be verified by broader, but less intensive sampling. Mechanistic explanation of how ecological measurements and experiments in streams can be scaled to watersheds will be provided. This scaling will be characterized in each of the five areas across the continent to explore how scaling differs across natural habitats.  The knowledge that will be generated by this project is essential to quantify controls on stream ecosystem processes as well as to manage human impacts on entire watersheds. The experimental and modeling results will be relevant to general ecology because few nested, and experimental and theoretically coupled scaling experiments have been undertaken in any environment. Results will inform those involved in conservation, management, and restoration of freshwater resources. Resource managers will gain a quantitative rationale and framework to link local measurements to regional patterns. The highly collaborative team will train six graduate students, five post doctoral students, and mentor three early career faculty members. Additional collaborations will be encouraged to collaborate and perform similar projects at additional sites through workshops related to the objectives and research design.",

We made high frequency measurements of light intensity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentration at sites in Puerto Rico (tropical forest), North Carolina (deciduous temperate forest), Kansas (tallgrass prairie), Oregon (temperate rain forest), Alaska (tundra and boreal forest), and in Australia (tropical forest) for more than 700 days.  Using these empirical measurements and a dynamic model of dissolved oxygen concentration, we modeled GPP and ER, the two components of whole stream metabolism, for all days and estimated the parameters governing the light response of GPP and the temperate dependence of both GPP and ER.  This provided the comprehensive, high resolution characterization of whole stream metabolism to date.  Our study is the first to model whole stream metabolism using intra-day variation in both light intensity and temperate across multiple biomes that are characterized by significant variation in environmental conditions.  We discovered a previously undocumented, universal response of temperature dependence of whole stream metabolism to mean daily temperature and stream metabolic balance, defined as the ratio of GPP to the sum of GPP and ER.  This response allowed us to predict how metabolic balance is likely to respond to increases in global temperature.  We were also able to use our parameter estimates to predict that streams of similar size across the globe are likely to emit more carbon in response to a 1 degree celsius increase in temperate worldwide (and increase of approximately 0.02 petagrams).  In our modeling efforts, we refined the state of the art for models of whole stream metabolism by improving formulations of temperature dependence, and by providing computational guidance for parameter estimation in such models. By comparing whole stream metabolism to metabolism for subsets of stream reaches, we discovered a relationship between the sensitivity of GPP to light variation and variation in the light environment of a stream reach.  This relationship helps to explain why measurements of the same process, whole stream metabolism in our case, that are made at different scales often do not match.  This project resulted in six oral or poster presentations at national and international meetings, and multiple manuscripts (one has already been published, one is currently in the second round of review, and two are close to being in final draft form).  A graduate student was trained over the course of the project.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/02/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ford&nbsp;Ballantyne</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
