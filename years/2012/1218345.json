 "awd_abstract_narration": "1218345\r\nHarcum\r\n\r\nChinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells) are used to manufacture a majority of the therapeutic\r\nproteins on the market today. In particular, CHO cells are able to express recombinant\r\nglycoproteins, including monoclonal antibodies, which require complex post-translational\r\nmodifications. Even though CHO cells have become the new \"Escherichia coli\" workhorse cell\r\nline, there are still many engineering challenges that must be addressed. These challenges can\r\nbe calculated when assessing the cost to consumers of glycoprotein therapeutics ($10's to\r\n$1000's of dollars (US) per milligram with typical doses of 10's of milligrams).\r\n\r\nOne major production challenge for glycoproteins is protein aggregation. Glycoproteins are\r\nprone to aggregation due to the size of these molecules, incomplete glycosylation, high\r\nsynthesis rates, and free thiols. Fortunately, bioprocess engineers have discovered interim\r\nsolutions, such as, media additives that can reduce protein aggregation in CHO cell cultures,\r\nbut more efficient long-term solutions are necessary to stabilize production and reduce costs.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this research project is to develop and enhance the toolbox for better\r\nunderstanding protein aggregation beginning with gene expression. Factors that lead to protein\r\naggregation and conditions that reduce protein aggregation will be investigated by interrogating\r\nthe transcriptome profiles developed from the transcriptome-sequencing component of this\r\nproject. The CHO cell transcriptome will be made publicly available and characterized to\r\npromote genome-wide research in CHO cells. Transcriptome analysis will be used to identify\r\ngenes that affect and respond to protein aggregation.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide a strong conceptual route for increasing the availability of therapeutic\r\nproteins and glycoproteins to the public. The availability of this additional high quality CHO cell\r\ntranscriptome data to the public will allow for a commensurate community knowledge base that\r\nwill enable all scholars the ability to contribute to our understanding of bioreactor process effects\r\non this host cell line. Broader impacts also include the establishment and maintenance of a\r\npipeline of educated, motivated students, particularly those from under-represented minority\r\npopulations to undertake careers in biotechnology to meet this growing demand in the US.",
