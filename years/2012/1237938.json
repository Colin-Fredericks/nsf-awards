 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Initiation Award entitled - Investigating the combinatorial structure of special classes of matrices and graphs - has the goal to find a test that will determine the eventual nonnegativity of reducible matrices and determine eventual properties of other classes of matrices. In dynamical systems, one is frequently interested in qualitative information regarding state evolution. Due to physical and modeling constraints arising in applications, it is of interest to impose or consider conditions for nonnegativity of the states. Such applications are directly linked to the problem of understanding the behavior of A^k as k increases. The objectives in this project will transform how we answer open questions about the nonnegativity and reducibility of large powers of matrices.\r\n\r\nAn eventual property of a matrix M is a property that holds for all powers M^k, k >= k0, for some positive integer k0, the power index. Eventually positive matrices and eventually nonnegative matrices have applications to control theory and have been studied since their introduction in 1978. For a fixed n, the power index of an eventually positive or eventually nonnegative n x n matrix may be arbitrarily large, so it is not possible to show a matrix is not eventually positive or not eventually nonnegative by computing powers. Perron-Frobenius theory shows several ways to test for eventual positivity and in 2010 Hogben found a test for eventual nonnegativity for matrices that are not eventually reducible. The objective of this research is to investigate the remaining class of eventually nonnegative matrices that are not well understood.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\n This project funded a research collaboration in combinatorial matrix theory between the PI Ulrica Wilson at Morehouse College and Leslie Hogben at Iowa State University.  Given the data driven world we now live in and how often matrices are used to describe and manipulate data, understanding how properties of matrices change under certain operations is vital.  Combinatorial matrix theory studies properties of matrices viewed as arrays of numbers rather than just as algebraic objects.  In this project, we investigated eventual properties of special classes of matrices.  For instance, a matrix of real numbers M is positive (respectively, nonnegative) if all of its entries are positive (respectively, nonnegative).  A matrix is eventually positive (respectively, eventually nonnegative) there exists some positive integer K and for all integers k greater than or equal to K,  M^k is positive (respectively, nonnegative).   Eventually positive and eventually nonnegative matrices have been studied extensively.  This project introduces and establishes properties of eventually reducible matrices and eventually r-cyclic matrices.  We also prove some results about the Jordan structure of strongly eventually nonnegative matrices.   These results were disseminated in two publications and portions were presented at conferences in the United States, South Korea, and Belgium.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\n Eighteen Morehouse students&mdash;all African-American males&mdash;were mentored as part of this project.  Each student participated in one or more of the following:  (1) engaged in research supervised by the PI; (2) traveled with the PI to national conferences; (3) presented research at national conferences; and/or (4) participated in an intensive writing workshop led by the PI.   The writing workshop meet weekly during each Fall semester of the funding period.  Workshop participants drafted (and based on regular and specific feedback from PI redrafted and redrafted) personal statements, research statements, and fellowship applications for graduate school.  So far, eleven of the participants have already entered PhD programs at institutions across the country, including Harvard, Purdue, Yale, Vanderbilt, University of Maryland (College Park), University of Georgia and University of California (San Diego).    They are in various STEM disciplines including mathematics, biostatistics, materials sciences, engineering and biology.\n\n Among those who have not yet entered PhD programs, one accepted a position in industry; one is in a STEM education MS program, one is applying to medical school,  and  two are applying to PhD programs.  Among all 18 participants, one NSF graduate fellowship was awarded, a GEM fellowship, and a Ford Foundation predoctoral fellowship.  The workshop was highly received and successful and has been replicated at Morehouse. We expect this writing workshop to continue. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ulrica Wilson"
