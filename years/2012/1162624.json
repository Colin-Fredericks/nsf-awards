 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-day Workshop on Catalytic Mechanisms and the Emergence of Metabolic Networks in Biogenesis to be held in May, in Arlington, VA will address one of the longstanding problems in understanding the origin of life. The problem is that contemporary biocatalysts are macromolecules made of monomers which require biocatalysts for their synthesis. The past twenty years have pointed to the way out of this difficulty; catalysis is not confined to macromolecules but may be found in relatively small organic molecules as well as in complexes of transition metals coordinately bonded to ligands that may also be small organic molecules. The relative sparseness of metabolomes, especially for prokaryotes, suggests the necessity of autocatalytic networks that act as global attractors in the networks of small molecules. In order to develop a theory of metabolic networks that gave rise to the biosphere it is necessary to understand catalytic mechanisms and their role in generating metabolic networks. The background for these studies is the work of material scientists, industrial chemists, organic chemists, enzymologists, and quantum physical chemists. These are mature disciplines that often have little to do with each other and even less to do with biologists interested in the emergence of the biosphere. Since it is not yet clear as to which aspects of pre-macromolecular catalysis are of most significance, it is important to have experts in all of these to get a full view of the problem. The meeting will involve experts in these disciplines to address the questions related to autocatalysis during the emergence of life.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\"Catalytic Mechanisms and the Emergence of Metabolic Networks\"\n\nThis NSF sponsored meeting was held in Arlington, Virginia on May 23-25, 2012\n\nThe organizing committee was Harold Morowitz, George Mason University, Shelley Copley, University of Colorado, Boulder, George Cody, Carnegie Institution for Science, Geophysics Laboratory\n\nThere is a developing consensus that the first pathways to metabolism involved the chemical mechanisms. The fact that the background theory and data collections are so widely dispersed across disciplines makes it necessary that a collection of specialists gathered together to try and formulate an understanding of the emergence of catalysis in the early geochemistry to prune the combinatoric explosion to an emergent geochemical metabolism.  At the very least this should point the way to a series of quite basic experiments that should help in narrowing in on the most likely approaches.  Without this kind of coherent approach we are faced with an extensive collection of scenarios rather than a much smaller collection of schema that are subject to experimental test.  If one accepts that metabolism has the same kind of logical structure as that found in the periodic table of elements, then one must search for the theoretical understanding in the underlying quantum chemistry and physics.\n\nIt has become clear that biological catalytic mechanisms often involve transition metals and pre-macromolecular catalysis can be carried out by metallic surfaces and metal organic ligands.  Thus these mechanisms are of interest to enzymologists, organic chemists, geochemists, and origin of life scientists.  This workshop gathered scientists from the relevant disciplines to exchange information and see where the overlaps may be mutually helpful in developing understanding.  This was successful and led to subsequent and ongoing interaction among the attendees.\n\nWorkshop topics included Catalytic Mineral Surfaces, Organo-Catalysis, Transition Metal Ligand Catalysis, and all of the various catalytic processes that have found their way into the patent literature.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harold J Morowitz"
