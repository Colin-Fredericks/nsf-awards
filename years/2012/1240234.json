 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supporting implementation of a special professional development opportunity for current and future geoscience faculty and teaching assistants that is aimed at increasing capacity for educating students with disabilities in the geosciences and engaging them in geoscience education and career pathways.  This program, which will be launched at the 34th International Geological Congress in Brisbane Australia (Symposium 1.2. Geoscience Education Theme 1: Geoscience for Society) and repeated at the 2012 Geological Society of America (GSA) annual meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina.  This project is the outgrowth of a new collaboration between the International Advisory for Geoscience Diversity (IAGD) and the International Union of Geological Sciences/Commission on Geoscience Education, Training and Technology Transfer (IUGS/COGE). This instructional workshop is specifically designed for faculty who may need assistance in modifying course materials to include and accommodate students with disabilities. Most faculty members are not adequately prepared to include students with disabilities but are faced with the immediate challenge of retrofitting accommodations when such students arrive at their classes. The highlight of this professional development workshop session will be a first-hand perspective from students with disabilities involved in the presentation and workshop activities. Student presenters will discuss their experiences in the geosciences, and how instructional materials and activities can be accommodated to include them in every aspect of geoscience education. This workshop is being offered at no cost to the participants, in order to self-promote the effort of classroom accessibility and to disseminate the materials and teaching strategies as broadly as possible.",

This course targeted instructors at all levels of experience; those who have never had to modify a course, to those who have a great deal of experience accommodating students of various abilities.  A secondary outcome of this workshop connected attending faculty to an experienced community of people who teach students with disabilities, thus expanding the network of faculty and students who can share ideas, resources and curricula. \n\n \n\nThe design and presentation of this course was informed by current research focused on students with disabilities and understanding both the external, physical barriers to access and inclusion to the geoscience curriculum, and the internal, personal, psychological and social challenges that these students face.  This course was facilitated by members of the International Association for Geoscience Diversity (IAGD), including a student member of the IAGD who offered a first-hand perspective of learning geoscience content with a disability.\n\n \nThe workshop presented many topics, including theories of disability, barriers students may face, possible accommodations, and shared accommodation strategies and ideas.  Course participants gave unanimously positive feedback and many said they would recommend the course to others.\n \nUnfortunately, such workshops attract people who are already convinced of the benefits. Those we need to reach are not familiar with working with students with disabilities. Until such a student enters the classroom, many instructors do not see the benefit of knowing how to modify their instruction to accommodate them. We hope to change that with continued offerings and promoting the benefits of this workshop.\n \n\nThe workshop topics included:\n\nUtilizing best practices for accommodating students with disabilities and understanding the spectrum of abilities and physical and non-physical barriers to learning\nDeveloping course materials and activities through principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL)\nUnderstanding aspects of lesson plans and activities that have helped a variety of students with disabilities\nLearning how to find resources for accommodating students\nCreating opportunities for faculty to develop activities and/or lessons for their own students \n\n\n \n\nWorkshop offerings\n This workshop was offered at the 2012 International Geologic Congress (IGC) in Brisbane, Australia and at the Geological Society of America (GSA) 2012 Annual Meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina.  This workshop is scheduled to be presented at the 2013 American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting.  Discussions are ongoing for presenting it regionally, hosted at area universities for K-12 earth science teachers and community college faculty. \n \n\nResults\n\nInternational Geologic Congress (IGC) in Brisbane, Australia \n\nParticipants registered &ndash; 81\nParticipants attended &ndash; 0\nPossible reasons for lack of attendance &ndash; 1. This was offered as a pre-conference workshop, no information about workshop location was posted in the conference venue.  Initial registration opened after the workshop concluded.  Participants did not receive their conference guidebooks until registration.  2.  This workshop was offered free to participants.  Since there was no financial obligation, perhaps participants did not worry about attending a workshop that was difficult to find.  3.  The workshop was scheduled to begin at 8 o\u00c6clock on Sunday morning.  \n\n\n \n\nLessons learned\n\nMake sure the conference has information regarding about short courses independent of regardless of conference registration\nDo not offer a free workshop (or offer a refund for attendance)\nCommunicate with participants early and often\n\n\n \n\nGeological Society of America 2012 Annual Meeting in Charlotte, NC  USA\n\nPa..."
