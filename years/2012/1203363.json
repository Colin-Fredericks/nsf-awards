 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Angelo State Natural History Collections (ASNHC) house 120,000 voucher specimens of plants, mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians of the Concho Valley, other regions of Texas, the U.S. and the world.  The primary goal of this project is to improve researcher and educator access to the specimens and tissues housed in the Collections. The data associated with these specimens and digital images of plant specimens will be made available to researchers around the world.  Faculty curators and students will complete data entry, including geo-referencing specimens, update software, and make all data available through existing biodiversity portals. Specific web-based learning modules for K-12 and university level students will be created.  Holding facilities will be modernized and integrated pest management systems will be updated to protect specimens.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project are diverse.  The wider science community will have improved access to ASNHC databases, increasing use of the Collections.  K-12 science education throughout the region will benefit from new outreach resources (e.g. digital images) for teachers and students.  Angelo State University students, including their own Hispanic Serving Institution target group, will benefit from improved specimen-based instructional resources for classroom and laboratory instruction.",
