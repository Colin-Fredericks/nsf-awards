In the context of the PI's work, the study of these mathematical questions often involves the tools of a subject known as geometric measure theory, where the main issue is to study generalized notions of length, area, and volume, in non-smooth settings.\n\nA major component of the supported work is a result obtained in collaboration with David Jerison concerning the identification of spaces of functions for which the Hessian matrix (that is, the matrix of second partial derivatives) has a well-defined determinant (in a suitable generalized sense).  The understanding of mathematical properties of this determinant, which is made difficult by the high degree of nonlinearity involved, has close connections to several issues in geometry and nonlinear models of the behavior of elastic solids.\n\nThe research supported under this award has resulted in the publication of several articles in peer-reviewed journals, and the PI has given a number of seminar talks disseminating the research.  The PI also supported the integration of research into teaching activities during the award, designing a short \"Introduction to Proofs\" course addressed to an undergraduate audience at the host institution -- several motivating examples throughout this course involved the geometric concepts (notably, some of the basic definitions of geometric measure theory such as fractal dimension) related to the research problems studied under the award.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric T Baer"
