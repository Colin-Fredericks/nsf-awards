 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program (EPM) in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program (CSDM) in the Division of Chemistry (CHE).\r\nTechnical: The research component of this CAREER award investigates the origin of electronic properties of self-assembled monolayers and multilayers of molecules in molecular junctions. This investigation focuses on two electronic properties, multi-state conductance and rectification, and addresses the intimate connection between conductance and the vibration modes of molecular systems. These studies can provide an explanation for the dependence of molecular conductance on bias voltage and the redox states of molecules. The research aims of the project are to: (1) investigate the origin of conductance dependence on bias voltage and redox states of porphyrin monolayers in single molecule junctions, (2) identify the relationships between the vibration modes of porphyrins and its electronic properties in molecular junctions, and (3) investigate the origin of rectification in a porphyrin monolayer versus molecular multilayers. This project introduces studies that are systematically designed to identify experimental parameters that influence molecular transport properties (e.g., the dependence of thickness of molecular films on electronic behavior and the existence of vibration energies in molecular junctions). These parameters are tested using molecular break junctions, conductive atomic force microscopy, and nanogaps fabricated by electromigration.\r\nNon-technical: This research project in on electronics at the molecular level. The project supports the advancement of molecules for two-state devices and rectifiers. A better understanding of molecular transport can stimulate research in medicine (e.g., drug delivery techniques) and chemical sensors (e.g., detection of toxic gases). To cultivate a broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, the project promotes scientific training of students and broadens the participation of underrepresented groups. This is accomplished through an educational program called NOLA MOVERS, which is a summer program to support students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to participate in cutting edge research at Rensselaer. In addition, a program is introduced to Rensselaer's School of Science to retain and mobilize undeclared students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMolecular electronics are devices that use molecules as electronic components.  The molecules can be used to perform device functions, such as switching between 'on' and 'off' states, amplifying a signal, or controlling the electrical current through an electronic device.  Molecular electronics have several advantages including device size that can be smaller than typical electronic components, which can reduce cost for both the manufacturer and consumer; and these devices can have better performance and lead to a reduction of power consumption.  Molecular devices have the potential to replace electronic components in semiconductor-based circuits found in common devices, such as radios, televisions, or mobile devices.  To ensure the molecules exhibit the electronic properties that allow maximum performance of the device, we studied the origin of the electronic properties of porphyrin molecules.  \n\nPorphyrin molecules can carry electrical charge over long distances, which make porphyrin good candidates as molecular wires.  In this study we positioned porphyrins in a molecular junction (i.e. a gap used to position a molecule between two metal electrodes) to understand the electronic properties of the molecules.  We revealed key features of porphyrins when the molecules are integrated into an electronic circuit. We found that the electrical current through porphyrin molecules can be manipulated by deposition methods, operation temperature, and structural changes of the molecule.  \n\nWe discovered: (1) iron porphyrin conducts electricity better when the molecule is deprotected (i.e. a porphyrin molecule without S-acetyl functional end groups) compared to iron porphyrin molecules that remain protected by the end groups; (2) for zinc porphyrin the electrical current is distributed asymmetrically (unevenly) across an electro-migrated molecular junction (i.e. a molecular junction formed by applying electrical current) and the vibrational signature of the molecule can be identified; (3) electrical current through the molecule can be controlled by temperature; for example, zinc porphyrins exhibited bi-stability (two accessible electronic states) at 300 K (approximately room temperature) in vacuum that did not exist at colder temperatures (4 K); (4) simulations of the molecules determined that bi-stability was due to the conformational changes (geometrical changes) of the molecule; and (5) control of the electrical current only in one direction (called rectification) can be manipulated by a deposition method of the iron porphyrin molecules on the surface; rectification existed using a drop-dry deposition method that did not exist when molecules were deposited using a 60 second deposition method.  \n\nThe proposed work supported the design and advancement of molecules as rectifiers and multi-state devices (i.e. devices with two or more accessible electronic states), which are attractive for applications, such as molecular switches or electronic memory. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kim M Lewis"
