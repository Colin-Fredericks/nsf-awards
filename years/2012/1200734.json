Much of the funding will be directed toward the goal of disseminating knowledge to and the inclusion of underrepresented minorities and women mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThis conference is the thirty-sixth in a long-running series of real analysis summer symposia. The past decade has witnessed a resurgence, on both the national and international scenes, of research activity in the classical area of real analysis, a resurgence driven in part by the ever-growing importance of real analysis for many other mathematical disciplines. This trend is typified by the work of the three plenary speakers at the 2012 event: Zoltan Buczolich, Emma D'Aniello, and Yang Wang. The Summer Symposium, which throughout its existence has attracted a large international audience, will play a central role in future developments in the field. The conference will offer researchers the opportunity to hear and share the newest findings in the field of real analysis.",
