 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\n#1236596 \r\nZuo, Yi  \r\n\r\nThis NSF award by the Environmental Health and Safety of Nanotechnology program supports work by Professor Yi Zuo to study the interaction mechanism between nanomaterials and pulmonary surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is a detergent-like phospholipid-protein mixture that covers the entire internal surface of the respiratory tract. It plays an important role in surface tension reduction and host defense. Inhaled nanomaterials must first interact with this surfactant film before contacting lung cells and translocating to other organs. Therefore, interactions between nanomaterials and pulmonary surfactant represent the initial bio-nano interaction in the lungs. However, the interaction mechanism is still largely unknown. The research goal of this proposal is to study biophysicochemical interactions between natural pulmonary surfactants and engineered nanomaterials, thus characterizing the potential adverse health effect of inhaled nanomaterials on the respiratory system. This work is important to the general public because it will provide new data that complement the current nanotoxicological knowledge obtained from cell culture and animal-models, thus advancing current understanding of nanosafety.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:For the first time, the project team will systematically study biophysical and biochemical interactions between different nanomaterials (including carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoplatelets, and metal oxide nanoparticles) and pulmonary surfactants. This research will provide a novel insight into the interaction potential between surfactant phospholipids/proteins and carbon-based nanomaterials with unique aspect ratios/shapes. In addition, the project team will develop a novel in vitro model that mimics bio-nano interactions in the lungs, for studying the environmental, health and safety (EHS) impacts of airborne nanomaterials.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The interaction mechanism between nanomaterials and pulmonary surfactants has a translational value for nanomedicine-based pulmonary drug delivery and for pathophysiological study of respiratory diseases related to air pollution and particulate matters. Given the unique location of the University of Hawaii, the proposed work will promote participation of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and students from other underrepresented groups. The PI will develop new undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula with interdisciplinary components, and help enhance the infrastructure for research and education. With local and international collaborations, the PI will disseminate the research to increase public awareness of nanotechnology and its potential EHS impacts.",

Because NMs are lightweight and easily airborne, particle inhalation has become a real and serious risk for humans exposed to industrial NMs or consumer products that contain engineered NMs. Due to their small size, inhaled NMs can reach the deep lung region at which the NMs must first interact with the pulmonary surfactant (PS) film of the lungs (see Image 1). The PS film is a multilayered lipid-protein complex that covers the entire air-water interface of the lungs. It plays an important role in host defense and maintaining the large surface area of the lungs by reducing surface tensions. Interactions with the PS film determine the subsequent clearance, retention, and translocation of the inhaled NMs, and hence their potential toxicity. Therefore, studying interactions between NMs and PS is expected to not only significantly enhance current understanding of the EHS impacts of nanotechnology, but also help provide a useful metric for regulating and overseeing commercial applications of nanotechnology towards a safer and sustainable development.</p>\n<p class=\"Yi-Thesis-Heading-2\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intellectual Merit:</span><strong> </strong>The goal of this research is to systematically study biophysicochemical interactions between natural PS and engineered NMs, thus characterizing the potential adverse health effect of inhaled NMs on the respiratory system.

Using the CDS, we have determined the no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNM) at which the airborne CNM start damaging the normal physiological function of PS (see Image 4).
