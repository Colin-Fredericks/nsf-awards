 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research is to explore the full potential and limitations of border-collision models in describing cardiac alternans. The project will develop a theoretical understanding of nonsmooth bifurcations as unfoldings of piecewise smooth problems, which will allow a more complete comprehension of the relation between a piecewise smooth bifurcation problem and the original smooth one. The theory developed in the present project will be applied to existing and new cardiac models to examine hybrid smooth/nonsmooth bifurcation to alternans. Theoretical and numerical predictions will be validated experimentally using isolated cardiac myocytes as well as whole isolated rabbit hearts to explore physiological mechanisms accounting for hybrid phenomena in cardiac dynamics.\r\n\r\nCardiac alternans is a marker of ventricular fibrillation, a fatal heart rhythm that is one of the leading causes of mortality in the Western world. Mathematical analyses combined with experimental studies of this research may lead to new insights on the physiological mechanism of alternans and therefore will impact the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The developed bifurcation techniques will provide new approaches to other nonsmooth problems in engineering and biology such as vibro-impacting systems, systems with friction, and switching in electrical circuits. The research program will train graduate and undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary environment giving them the ability to use nonlinear analyses to understand complexities in engineering and biological systems. The outreach activities will expose high school students to mathematical biology and nonlinear ways of thinking.",

Destabilized patterns of electrical activity may lead to ventricular fibrillation. Previous experiments have shown that unstable cardiac dynamics may be induced by instabilities either in membrane voltage or in intracellular calcium cycling. While the first mechanism was intensively investigated, the later one received limited attention so far. We developed a simple mapping model of intracellular calcium cycling and used it to determine whether calcium-induced bifurcation is a border-collision type. We carried out theoretical analyses and numerical simulations of the return map. The mapping model undergoes a border collision bifurcation due to the discontinuous changes in the slope of the return map. A few examples of the observed solutions are shown in Figure 1, demonstrating a possibility of bifurcation from the period-1 solution into period-2, period-3, period-6 or chaotic solution. Note that the period-2 pattern is known as alternans and has been widely studied in various theoretical and experimental work. However, other bifurcation patterns can also be achieved by slight modifications of the slopes s1 and s2. Here, for the first time, we developed a piecewise mapping model describing a border-collision bifurcation of intracellular calcium cycling. The theoretical analysis of the model shows that cardiac bifurcation may lead to irregular periodic patterns and chaos, in addition to already known period-2 solution (alternans). We note that bifurcation analysis of a border-collision model satisfies different stability criteria compared to its smooth counterparts. In future work, we will extend the one-dimensional mapping model by accommodating voltage dynamics to investigate the excitation contraction coupling.

In this study, we experimentally investigated the spatial dynamics of bifurcation that governs the transition to alternans in isolated whole rabbit hearts. We identified the local onset of alternans, characterized the bifurcation type prior to its onset, and studied the spatial distribution of bifurcation characteristics across the LV surface of the heart.
