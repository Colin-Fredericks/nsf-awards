 "awd_abstract_narration": "In our own and in other species, physiological responses to stress can be regulated in important ways by the social environment. Although much is known about how the presence of key social partners can reduce the secretion of stress hormones in challenging circumstances, almost nothing is known about how the perception of the presence of the companion is transformed into neural signals that ultimately reduce the stress hormone secretion. These questions will be studied in guinea pigs, a species in which the ability of social partners to reduce stress hormone secretion is well documented. This project will use pharmacological procedures, which temporarily inactivate selected brain regions to determine the effect of those specific regions on stress hormone secretion during challenge, as well as on the reduction of stress hormone secretion in the presence of a close social companion. These studies will provide new basic information on the neural pathways through which stress hormone secretion is regulated by the social environment. The results will also inform later studies aimed at managing the negative consequences of stress exposure. The work will integrate research and undergraduate education by involving promising undergraduates interested in careers in the life sciences in every aspect of the studies.",

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the body&rsquo;s primary stress responsive neuroendocrine system. The end result of activation of this system is release of the steroid hormone cortisol into the bloodstream. When exposed to routine, brief stressors, this response is highly adaptive in that it frees up blood sugar to provide energy to escape from, combat, or otherwise cope with the stressor. However, prolonged elevations of cortisol can be damaging. One means by which social species, including humans, regulate levels of cortisol during exposure to stressors is through the phenomenon of social buffering, in which the presence of another member of the species reduces the individual&rsquo;s HPA activity.&nbsp; However, not all individuals of a species are effective social buffers for a particular individual, and the factors that determine the relative effectiveness of different individuals are not fully understood.

That is, it appears that buffering involves a separate inhibitory pathway to the HPA system, rather than a &ldquo;turning off&rdquo; of the activating system. One brain region that has neural connections to the source of the HPA axis, and which may initiate this inhibitory influence, is a portion of the prefrontal cortex (i.e., prelimbic region). We measured activity in this region in pups exposed to a novel enclosure alone or with different social partners. As expected the mother fully buffered the HPA response, whereas a littermate did not. This comparison indicates that the effect is not just due to the mother being familiar to the pup because a littermate is equally familiar (both have been with the pup since birth). What was unexpected was that an adult male that the pup had never been exposed to was as effective as the mother in buffering the HPA response. This finding was surprising because generally only social partners with which an individual exhibits a close social bond is effective as a social buffer.
