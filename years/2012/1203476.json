 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the Winter School and Workshop on Spin Physics and Topological Effects in Cold Atoms, Condensed Matter, and Beyond. The school/workshop will be held at the Mitchell Institute for Fundamental Physics and Astronomy in College Station, Texas from December 12th to the 17th, 2011. The main ojective is to bring together both experts and younger researchers in the areas of condensed matter and cold atom physics, to focus on spin and topological effects in materials and cold atom systems. These have become important themes of modern research in both fields. The school/workshop will facilitate the exchange of ideas and cross collaborations.\r\n\r\nIn condensed matter the spin of electrons plays a crucial role in the understanding of diverse phenomena and phases. The study of how to manipulate and control spin has led to the notion of spintronics, a new paradigm in electronic device technology.  The link of electron spin to the topology of the band-structure of materials, through spin-orbit coupling, has given rise to the discovery of new phases of matter and other phenomena such as spin Hall Effect and topological insulators.\r\n\r\nCold atoms, which can be trapped and manipulated, can serve as simulators of models for strongly interacting electrons in materials without disorder and other complicating effects that occur for electrons in materials.  Cold atom systems have gone beyond recreating simple well controlled systems whose outcomes are expected and mimic large coherent atomic physics, to a new level in which new states of matter and emergent phenomena can be tested and fundamental questions of many body interacting systems can be addressed.\r\n\r\nThis award provides support to enable the attendance of young researchers such as students, post-docs and junior faculty without external funding.  The PI will actively seek to recruit members of underrepresented groups to participate in the workshop.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this workshop/school is to bring together leading experts on spintronics and spin-related phenomena in conventional condensed-matter and on cold atoms to stimulate cross-fertilization of these fields.\r\n\r\nTopics of the workshop/school include: spin and anomalous Hall effect; spin transfer, spin pumping, and current-driven domain wall motion; cold atoms as simulators for quantum magnetism; spin orbit coupling in cold-atom systems; spin-imbalance in cold Fermi gases; pseudospin physics in graphene and semiconductor bilayers; and topological insulators.",

Priority was      given topics that can bring two complementary communities together to create      a very open atmosphere of cross-fertilization. \nCombining      research lectures with research talks: in these fast evolving fields,      a very attractive conference set-up is a combination of research lectures      that can bring experts from other fields rapidly in line with recent      developments, the latest understanding and a list of challenges, together      with a regular workshop of experts.\nDiverse      demographics: in combination with the      lectures and talks, focus was also put in promoting a diverse demographic      of the participants so as to include the current and the future experts in      the field.\n\n\nWith this in mind we proposed an international winter school and workshop entitled NewSpin2, a winter school and workshop on spin physics and topological effects in cold atoms, condensed matter, and beyond.
