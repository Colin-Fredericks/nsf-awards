 "awd_abstract_narration": "After photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation is the most important biochemical reaction on Earth; both processes are essential for life. Although 78% of the earth's atmosphere is diatomic nitrogen (N2), all living organisms require nitrogen but in either reduced (ammonia) or organic forms (amino acids, nucleic acids, etc.).  Nitrogen for plant growth is supplied mostly as commercial fertilizer, but the costs of fertilizer (and with it food) are increasing because synthetic nitrogen fertilizer requires natural gas for its production. Certain bacteria reduce or 'fix' N2 gas into ammonia as the starting point for amino and nucleic acid syntheses.  Nitrogen fixation is a crucial component of the nitrogen cycle, and thus essential for maintenance of the planet's nitrogen balance. This project will test members of the genus Burkholderia, recently discovered to nodulate such agriculturally important legumes as bean and cowpea, with Rhizobium strains in terms of providing fixed nitrogen to plants growing in arid, acidic, or saline soils, which will become more widespread as climate change continues. Our approach will be to inoculate legumes with Burkholderia species either singly or together with Rhizobium strains, or together with newly discovered plant growth-promoting bacteria that improve root architecture for water uptake or provide available phosphate or iron, to test for increased plant biomass, seed yield, shoot and root growth, nodule number, and nitrogen fixation ability.  Genetic tools including reporter gene fusions and mutagenesis as well as genome analysis and physiological/biochemical experimentation will be employed.  This project will provide scientific training and critical thinking skills to undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students, particularly members of groups who are currently underrepresented in STEM fields.  Our ultimate goal is to reduce our dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels by utilizing beneficial microbes that act synergistically with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to enhance plant growth and yield even on the most marginal soils.",

In addition, we strive to elevate student awareness of the importance of soils and their microbes in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Agricultural production will soon face a crisis because too few young people pursue advanced training in basic or applied plant biology in part due to reduced opportunities for training.  I became very aware of this as a member of an advisory board for a Bill and Melinda Gates grant awarded to Felix Dakora of South Africa for funding young Africans, especially women, to pursue advanced degree in plant-related fields.  In the next 10 years, many of the scientists who are now involved in advising farmers, doing research in agriculture, or who are professors at universities will retire, and few people are trained to replace them.  This is true in the USA as well because programs in the plant-related sciences have been drastically diminished in the last 20 years. Without thorough training and research in plant-related areas, we face a bleak future unless there are enough young scholars to replace the people who retire.\n\nOur research strategy has been to isolate PGPB from soils collected from arid areas and deserts, including the Negev Desert (Israel), the Kgalgadi Desert (Botswana; Gruber K. 2015.

The latter microbe is a Gram-negative strain that is not widely recognized as a PGPB.  We discovered a related microbe in a class and Paul Yang, a student, observed that it induced a bushy root phenotype on siratro (Fig. 6).   Our hypothesis is that this increase in root mass results in greater drought resistance.  When the roots were dug up from the corn plants observed in Fig. 5, we observed that this was the case, but that the roots were not shortened as they are in siratro.  This particular microbe is reported to synthesize auxin.  We will pursue this study further and also get the genome sequenced to verify that genes for auxin synthesis are present.\n\nAs a Nigerian proverb states:  \"It takes a village to raise a child\" (\"Ora na-azu nwa\" in Igbo).  Our studies have definitely led to the isolation of a \"village\" of bacteria to test as inoculants to be used for sustainable plant growth and yield, especially under drought stress conditions.  The next phase of this research will be looking for the most effective combinations for improved plant yield. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ann M Hirsch"
