 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to help developers in making applications? usage of personal information transparent to mobile phone users, system integrators, and other evaluators. Recent well-publicized mobile privacy incidents have demonstrated all these parties have lost count of what information mobile devices collect, store, and transmit. A successful project would lead to improved privacy and application transparency, and would help prevent future privacy compromises. Project results could be adopted into mobile operating systems and could guide FTC policy on mobile privacy. The project includes close collaboration with industry stakeholders to facilitate dissemination of new ideas. Work will be conducted with graduate and undergraduate students, which will not only provide them with training in research methodology, but also expose them to important ethical questions surrounding privacy issues in mobile applications.\r\n \r\nThis project will aid developers and nudge them to follow privacy principles by making their usage of personal information transparent. Towards this end, this project will develop guidelines for privacy-aware system APIs that encourage developers to employ privacy-by-design techniques. For example, system APIs designed from a privacy perspective will make it easier to obtain more general information, rather than potentially more sensitive, fine-grained personal information. Through case studies with developers and users, this project is expected to lead to novel insights into the effectiveness of these techniques.",
