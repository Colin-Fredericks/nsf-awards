 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prism@UCSD creates a campus-wide \"Big Data freeway\" composed of high-bandwidth end-to-end optical connections routed by a next-generation Arista switch.  This creates an optical fabric capable of more than 10 Terabit/s of aggregate bandwidth, has full bisection similar to in-machine room clusters but is deployed at a campus scale. This researcher-defined network unites users of in-lab scientific instruments such as genome sequencers and microscopes with remote compute, visualization, data-storage and analysis systems.   Prism  bridges to, augments,  and protects the existing campus production network by providing a complementary, specialized, cost-effective, massive-capacity network to a targeted group of data-intensive labs. \r\n\r\nPrism builds upon and upgrades  the Quartzite \"campus-scale network laboratory\" NSF MRI (awarded 2006) that was motivated by applications with extreme-scale bandwidth requirements. Compared to Quartzite, Prism not only adds IPv6 capability and support for software defined networks via OpenFlow, but also increases port capacity by 4x, lowers power consumption by 3x, and removes all card-to-switch-backplane over-subscription at the core switch.  In addition, the existing optical fiber connection to the San Diego Supercomputer Center is being  expanded  to 120Gbps as a high-bandwidth bridge to cloud/parallel storage and NSF XSEDE resources. This fundamentally enables research in multiple disciplines, including physics, chemistry, biology, climate change, oceanography, and computer science to address big-data challenges.\r\n\r\nWorkshops will be held with regional optical networks and EDUCAUSE to disseminate experience to research campuses and fully describe this cost-effective, expandable and replicable infrastructure.  In addition, a summer workshop aimed at minority serving institutions will build on Calit2 / SDSC's tradition of diversity outreach. Prism will form a model for others to follow in building their own big-data transportation systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Prism networking cyberinfrastructure had the general goals of providing very high-speed data delivery capability to numerous laboratories on the University of California San Diego campus.  The university operates a very capable network for its daily population of about 75000 students, faculty and research staff. However,  data intensive laboratories in areas of electron microscopy, earth system analysis, high-energy physics, computer science, computational biology and chemistry need to manipulate data sets that are simply too large to easily move across the campus' general purpose network.   These data sets are so large that if they were tranferred on the campus network, there would no left over capacity to support the larger campus.   Prism provides a companion to network designed to easily accomodate these enormous data sets.  Individual labs are provided dedicated networking with capacities that are two to eight times the capacity of the existing campus network. \n\nHowever, constructing a cost-effective network is simply not enough because these are just the \"roads\" of our research cyberinfrastructure.  This project also developed low-cost, highly-capable, networked data endpoints called Flash IO Network Appliances or FIONAs.  These devices, whose parts and plans are updated regularly and are publicly available, enable labs to store, send, and receive data sets in the tens to hundreds of terabytes.  They are modeled after devices deployed at supercomputer centers, but cost only about the same as two high-end laptops.  FIONAs  provide the key vehicles that enable domain scientists to more easily manipulate and share very large data sets.  \n\nWith the network (roads) and devices (vehicles) well-defined, Prism plays a key infrastructure role in supporting domain science. The following examples describe just some of the impact the enabing nature of Prism:  Petabytes of data used to support analysis in the Open Science Grid made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) to validate Einstein's theory traversed the Prism Network.  The National Center for Microscopy Imaging Research (NCMIR) uses Prism every day to transfer multi-terabyte images from their microscopes to large computing clusters and back to the scientist's workstation for further scientific analysis and insight.
