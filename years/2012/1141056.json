The project team, comprising experts in continental-margin research and geoscience education, is working with a user community to create, assess and disseminate a coherent set of modular mini-lessons and course segments for upper-division courses that engage students with cutting-edge findings on rupturing continental lithosphere, subduction processes, seismogenesis, and sediment dispersal from sources to sinks.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this project lies in the integration of research and education by transforming high-quality MARGINS science into educational resources for undergraduate classrooms. The Broader Impacts of this project lie in the multi-institutional effort to disseminate MARGINS science, offering scientists a powerful means of increasing the impact of their own research, while creating portable curricular resources to educate and engage geoscience students across a range of courses and institutional types.",
