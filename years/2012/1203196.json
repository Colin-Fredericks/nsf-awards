 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sea-ice thickness distribution (ITD) is fundamental to understanding the heat, mass and freshwater budgets of the Arctic Ocean, plays important roles in climate feedbacks, and exerts strong control on regional primary productivity, marine navigation and surface operations. Estimates of ITD based on observations in the perennial ice zone (PIZ) nearly always exhibit a prominent mode at some thickness, hm, larger than and distinct from modal thicknesses associated with the annual freezeup and recently-opened leads.  This mode has been interpreted as un-deformed multi-year ice at, or growing thermodynamically towards, its equilibrium thickness. Observations indicate significant inter-regional, annual and inter-annual variations of hm within the PIZ, over the approximate range 1 to 5 meters. This statistic of the ITD has received much less attention than other parameters, such as the mean, standard deviation and e-folding length scale of ridged ice. The results of this project will improve understanding of the variations in space and time of this ecologically and societally important measure of ice thickness.\r\n\r\nThe PI hypothesizes that measurements of ice of near-modal thickness have reduced bias and random error with respect to other measures of ice thickness, thus making the mode a robust parameter of the ITD. The goal of the proposed research is to enhance understanding of the ITD, focusing on the mode hm, by producing improved estimates of space/ time variations of the ITD, and greater understanding of its role in Arctic climate. Specific objectives are (a) to test the hypothesis that the mode is robust to observational errors; (b) to document space and time variation of hm and other parameters of the ITD in the PIZ; (c) to simulate the variations of the ITD and hm as a response to prescribed forcing and compare results with observations; (d) to study the dependence of simulated ITDs on the formulation of ridging and on errors in the forcing data; and (e) to synthesize the results as a new analysis and interpretation of the ITD emphasizing hm and its variations. The study domain is the Arctic Ocean PIZ during the period 1975-2010. The timescales to be considered include inter-seasonal, inter-annual and trends, as well as physical processes acting on hours and longer.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The sea ice that covers the surface of the Arctic Ocean has large impacts on climate, oceanography, ecology, transportation and economic activity in high northern latitudes.  The amount of sea ice at any location is measured by ice thickness.  The ice thickens and thins by freezing and melting during parts of each year, and, because of continual motion, frequently breaks open or is piled upon itself to form ridges so that ice thickness varies chaotically from zero to tens of meters over short distances.  To discern order in this chaos, the abundance of ice in an area is quantified statistically by the ice thickness distribution ITD, which gives the percentage of the area covered by ice of each thickness.   To estimate ITD requires many individual measurements of thickness, and these are made by upward-looking sonars (ULS), deployed beneath the ice where they record the range to the ice bottom.   The ITD has a prominent peak or mode at a thickness between about 2m and 3m which has been identified traditionally with ice that has not been broken up, and that has survived at least one summer without melting completely away.   Variations of the mode in time and space tell us how the thickness of the most commonly-encountered ice changes with season, from year to year, and over multiple decades.   The goal of this project is to document the variations of the ITD and especially the mode, in the central Arctic Ocean and to understand the role of these variations in climate.\n \n\nThere are three major outcomes from the project.  The first addresses large, systematic errors (\"footprint errors\") that arise because the footprint of the sonar beam on the bottom of the ice is too wide and the ULS records only the thickest ice in the beam.  This project developed a new mathematical model, based on physical acoustics and calibrated by sonar measurements, to diagnose more accurately the size of these footprint errors, and to adjust the statistics of ice thickness to greatly reduce their size. The model is sufficiently general to be applied to measurements made by many types of ULS. \n\n \n\nThe second outcome addresses the problem of sampling errors, i.e. differences between the true ITD, which depends on all ice thicknesses at the given time and place, and the sample ITD derived from a limited sample of measurements in the area.  Sampling error is enlarged because ice thickness exhibits dependence, such as autocorrelation, in both time and space.  Also, standard techniques for estimating sampling error of the average thickness are not applicable to other features of the ITD, such as the mode.  This project developed and implemented as a computer program, a new method for estimating the ITD and the sampling error of any of its parameters, by applying block bootstrap techniques to account for dependence in the data. \n\n \n\nThe third outcome is the application of the footprint error model and the block bootstrap estimation methods to reprocess existing ULS datasets acquired near the North Pole during 2001-2010.  The improved footprint error adjustment varies with ULS range, and at typical range is about twice as large as previous, traditional estimates.  This is large enough to explain the apparent positive bias in the average thickness from the North Pole ULS, compared to the output of a standard sea ice simulation model, that was reported A. Schweiger, et. al. in 2011.  The block bootstrap method shows that the variations in the estimated mode from month-to-month, year-to-year, and over the decade are significantly larger than the sampling error for the mode, so the mode can be used with confidence for climate analysis.  At the North Pole during 2001-2005, the adjusted ranges of inter-annual variation in the thickness mode are (2.1m &ndash; 2.8m) in winter (Dec-Mar), and (2.3m &ndash; 2.6m) in summer (Jul-Aug), compared to 2009-2010 winter (1.6m) and summer (1.6m).  Thus the modal thickness at the North Pole decreased by approximately 0.8m or 35% from..."
