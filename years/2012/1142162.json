 "awd_abstract_narration": "1142162/Stone\r\n\r\nThis award supports a project to conduct a reconnaissance geological and radar-sounding study of promising sites in West Antarctica as a prelude to a future project to conduct subglacial cosmogenic nuclide measurements. Field work will take place in the Whitmore Mountains, close to the WAIS divide, and on the Nash and Pirrit Hills, downflow from the divide in the Weddell Sea drainage. At each site geological indicators of higher (and lower) ice levels in the past will be mapped and evidence of subglacial erosion or its absence will be documented.   Elevation transects of both glacial erratics and adjacent bedrock samples will be collected to establish the timing of recent deglaciation at the sites and provide a complement to similar measurements on material from depth transects obtained by future subglacial drilling.  At each site, bedrock ridges will be traced into the subsurface with closely-spaced ice-penetrating radar surveys, using a combination of instruments and frequencies to obtain meter-scale surface detail, using synthetic aperture techniques. Collectively the results will define prospective sites for subglacial sampling, and maximize the potential information to be obtained from such samples in future studies.  The intellectual merit of this project is that measurements of cosmogenic nuclides in subglacial bedrock hold promise for resolving the questions of whether the West Antarctic ice sheet collapsed completely in the past, whether it is prone to repeated large deglaciations, and if so, what is their magnitude and frequency. Such studies will require careful choice of targets, to locate sites where bedrock geology is favorable, cosmogenic nuclide records are likely to have been protected from subglacial erosion, and the local ice-surface response is indicative of large-scale ice sheet behavior. The broader impacts of this work include helping to determine whether subglacial surfaces in West Antarctica were ever exposed to cosmic rays, which will provide unambiguous evidence for or against a smaller ice sheet in the past. This is an important step towards establishing whether the WAIS is vulnerable to collapse in future, and will ultimately help to address uncertainty in forecasting sea level change. The results will also provide ground truth for models of ice-sheet dynamics and long-term ice sheet evolution, and will help researchers use these models to identify paleoclimate conditions responsible for WAIS deglaciation.  The education and training of students (both undergraduate and graduate students) will play an important role in the project, which will involve Antarctic fieldwork, technically challenging labwork, data collection and interpretation, and communication of the outcome to scientists and the general public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGlacial-interglacial history of West Antarctic nunataks, and site reconnaissance for subglacial bedrock sampling\n\nThe goal of this project was to define prospective sites for future subglacial drilling, which will determine if the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has thinned and collapsed in the geological past.  The drilling project will recover core samples from bedrock underneath the ice sheet, which will be measured for isotopes produced by cosmic rays.  Because cosmic rays capable of producing these isotopes are blocked by only small amounts of snow or ice, the presence or absence of the isotopes will unambiguously test whether bedrock hundreds of feet below the ice sheet surface has ever been ice-free in the past few million years.  The results will show whether natural climate conditions have melted back the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in the past, and reveal climatic thresholds that might endanger the ice sheet in future.\n\nThree mountain groups in West Antarctica were assessed for potential drilling sites: the Pirrit Hills, the Nash Hills and the Whitmore Mountains (See map, and Figures 2-4).  Geological mapping of the exposed portions of these mountains, and radar surveys of surrounding subglacial bedrock identified a site 3 miles northeast of the Pirrit Hills as the optimal location for future drilling.  Sites around the Nash Hills were eliminated due to complicated bedrock geology.  Drilling near the Nash Hills could intersect an unsuitable rock type, lacking the minerals necessary for analysis of cosmic-ray-produced isotopes.  Further geophysical reconnaissance would be required to locate a suitable drill site here.  Bedrock geology at the Whitmore Mountains is favorable, but the site shows limited evidence of ice-sheet variation in the past. \n\nAt the Pirrit Hills, mapping and isotope measurements show that the ice sheet surface has varied significantly in the past.  During the last ice age the ice sheet here was approximately 1000 feet thicker; during past warm periods ice was thinner (by how much will be revealed by drilling). Isotope measurements on exposed rock show that the ice sheet here has likely been at or below its present level approximately 50 - 70% of the time during the past 1-2 million years.  Ice-penetrating radar surveys at the Pirrit Hills (e.g. Fig. 5) revealed a sub-glacial bedrock ridge with surfaces suitable for drilling, at depths of 300 - 1000 feet below the surface.  This will be the target of future drilling, and will provide the samples needed to test whether the ice sheet has been thinner in the past.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/10/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John O Stone"
