 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund a participatory and consultative workshop that brings together two indigenous groups, the Yup'ik of Newtok, Alaska and the people of the Carteret Islands, Papua New Guinea, to explore the social and cultural ramifications of being on the front line of global climate change. \r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Newtok and the Carteret Islands are part of a growing network of Arctic and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) whose communities are the first to be affected by climate induced environmental change. Newtok is a western Alaska, Bering Sea community being forced to relocate due to the deterioration of the substrate that underlies their village; Carteret Islands, Papua New Guinea, are being forced to relocate due to rising sea levels - the Islands on average are only 1.2 meters above sea level and have lost over 50% of their land mass since 1994. \r\n\r\nAs the PI states, \"reducing vulnerability and implementing adaptation to climate change are critical to ensure the resilience of indigenous communities in both regions\" and this workshop is the first step in understanding that process. As part of a community participatory process that is designed to start any research or assessment project with community discussions, this project will facilitate a research agenda that is informed by the local knowledge and goals of the affected communities themselves. This project is the first step in implementing an assessment or scientific research plan for understanding and facilitating the long term sustainability and resilience of Arctic and SIDS communities where climate-induced ecological change are affecting the health and well-being of the people who inhabit these regions. \r\n\r\nThrough a 10 day community participatory process that will start in Buka, Papua New Guinea, Yup'ik people will collaborate with Carteret Island people in order to better define and understand the decision making process that underlies their ultimate relocation. The workshop will be a community to community interaction of sharing experiences, visiting community sites, talking with local government officials, and creating an outline of guiding principles and capacity building for other communities facing similar challenges. \r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to a broader understanding of the social and cultural challenges that surround population migration through a community participatory process, which has the potential to create new paradigms for researchers studying these processes. Although bringing together two communities, one Arctic, one South Pacific, is a small step it is a critical step toward creating new knowledge concerning how communities are affected by and adapting to these environmental changes. \r\n\r\nFrom scientific research supported by the Arctic Social Sciences Program we know that community resettlement can have disastrous effects on health and well-being, as well as cultural and linguistic survival (Marino and Kingston, Twice \"Removed: King Islanders Experience of Community through Two Relocations,\" Human Organization, Vol. 69. N.2/Winter 2010, Pg. 119-128). This project has the potential to infuse decision making processes with community based perspectives and actions, which we know from other research (Arctic Human Development Report), are key to self determination and ultimately the long-term sustainability of indigenous communities across the Arctic and the Globe.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe workshop in Papua New Guinea was a critical first step in building a collaborative network of communities facing relocation in the Arctic and Small Island Developing States.  Community relocation may be the only adaptation strategy that can protect people from the combination of repeated extreme weather events coupled with on-going climate-induced environmental changes, such as rising sea levels and thawing permafrost.  Research has documented that government-mandated relocation can unravel the fabric of a community, weaken community institutions and social networks, disrupt subsistence and economic systems, and impact the cultural identity and traditional kinship ties within a community.  The focus of this research project is to determine whether a community-led relocation process will not only minimize or prevent these negative consequences, but also whether a community-led relocation can foster community resilience and long-term sustainability. \n\nDrawing on the knowledge and expertise of the indigenous communities of Newtok, Alaska and the Carteret Islands, Papua New Guinea, our objectives are to:  (1) document the experiences and lessons learned from these two communities\u00c6 relocation efforts; (2) identify the needs and challenges facing these communities as they plan their relocations; and (3) begin to develop appropriate tools and resources to assist these and similarly situated communities in their relocation efforts. \n\nThe workshop was historic because we brought together, for the first time, two communities that decided to relocate on their own initiative and through their own decision-making processes, thus laying the foundation for an original publication as a case study and also the collection of baseline data that can be used to evaluate the impact of relocation on community members.  Over a period of 10 days, community representatives from Newtok and the Carteret Islands met and exchanged their unique experiences in an informal setting.  Through this process, community members gained experience in communicating their stories, their challenges, and their future plans to an empathetic audience from a completely different culture. \n\nBased on the experiences and lessons learned in Newtok and the Carteret Islands, it is evident that any decisions regarding the relocation process must be made by or in direct consultation with community members.  Such decisions include:  when and where to relocate; development of principles to guide the relocation process; and planning for how the relocation will occur (e.g. design of the relocation site, development of income generating activities).   In Newtok and the Carteret Islands, community members documented the impacts of climate change on the environment as well as the habitability of their respective communities.  The documentation of this information was a critical first step to understanding how climate change affected each community.  This documentation also informed the decision-making process for adaptation strategies.  Each community decided that relocation was the only adaptation strategy that could protect the lives of community members and ensure the long-term resilience and sustainability of each community.\n\nLocal and national governments must also create enabling environments, by providing the necessary frameworks that will support communities in undertaking this work.  At present, there is a lack of legal/policy frameworks to guide relocation processes as well as a lack of financial resources to support them, and therefore communities have minimal tools or resources or even guidance throughout the relocation process \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/24/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robin Bronen"
