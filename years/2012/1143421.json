 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve the performance of Surface Acoustic Wave Nebulization (SAWN) for use with mass spectrometers. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a widely used method to measure chemical composition; i.e. what chemical elements (e.g. C, N, S, O) are in a given molecule and how are they configured structurally. For MS analysis chemical compounds must be moved from the laboratory environment to the MS instrument by a method known as ionization. The development of SAWN provides a novel means to ionize chemical compounds that combines the performance characteristics of electrospray ionization (ESI) with the ease of use of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI).\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are to position SAWN as a commercially viable ionization platform. The simplicity of SAWN, which operates on a planar surface with very low energy requirements and no moving parts, will provide a platform that sits between the two popular methods ESI and MALDI. The simplicity in design makes it more readily deployable to mobile laboratories than ESI and MALDI. An improved SAWN device will have a broad impact on multiple areas of science that rely on MS for quantitative and qualitative measurements, ranging from food science, forensics, life sciences and clinical medicine. Specifically, the lower level of energy required by SAWN to produce ions means that it is better able to detect chemical compounds that are destroyed by ESI and MALDI.",

We referred to this version of the SAWN chip as standing wave SAWN (SW-SAWN). Like ESI, SAWN generates small droplets of molecules that are analyzed by the mass spectrometer. With the original SAWN chip, the droplets being produced are large and are not properly evaporated by the mass spectrometer. SW-SAWN produces droplets that are smaller than the original SAWN device by changing the type of wave used to nebulize. We showed in our research here that a dramatic increase in signal is observed with SW-SAWN. Without this improvement in signal, SAWN will never expand beyond the laboratory. This technical achievement makes SAWN competitive against both ESI and MALDI, which currently dominate the ionization market. While SW-SAWN provides a large increase in sensitivity, the act of running samples in SAWN remained a manual process. To address this problem we demonstrated another type of SAWN device based on circular electrodes. We refer to this type of nebulizer as ring-SAWN. In our research we demonstrated that ring-SAWN, do to its circular nature, is very effective at keeping the sample constrained in a single location.
