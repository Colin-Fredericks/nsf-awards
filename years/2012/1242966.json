 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop, organized by researchers from Pepperdine University, brings leading STEM educational researchers from the US and Finland together to expand the discussion of innovation in education.  The workshop brings about 40 researchers, half from each country, together to focus on technology enhanced learning, educational innovation, and learning analytics. At the heart of the workshop is a series of short presentations, followed by intense, high-level discussions. The participants will produce a series of white papers that synthesize what is known on these topics and frame future research directions. \r\n\r\nThe pairing of researchers from the US with those from Finland, a nation whose students regularly rank at the top in international measures of STEM learning, in such a workshop holds great promise as scientific communities with somewhat complementary strengths come together. The goal of the workshop is to foster international collaboration between nations and, by so doing, to spur the production of proposals at the frontiers of our knowledge of STEM learning.",
