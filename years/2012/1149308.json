 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biodiversity loss and emerging infectious disease are among the most pressing environmental threats to society. While traditional biomedical research focuses on single-host, single-parasite systems, there is an urgent need to incorporate community ecology into disease research to understand host-pathogen interactions and patterns of disease emergence. Growing evidence suggests that other species in communities, including predators, alternative hosts, and other parasites, can alter patterns of disease and could provide novel tools for the control of emerging infections. The aim of this proposal is to bridge the gap between community ecology and disease ecology by determining how host, non-host, and parasite diversity interact to affect disease risk in a group of globally threatened vertebrates: amphibians. The investigators will combine field surveys of free-living and parasite communities in California with controlled experiments to determine how patterns of biodiversity function to influence the risk of disease. This work will lay a foundation for determining the role of parasites in ecological communities and developing effective tools for managing emerging infections in humans and wildlife.\r\n\r\nThis research will capitalize on the public's interest in the decline of amphibians. The four outreach activities are designed to reach a wide audience. First, in collaboration with the National Geographic Society and the USGS, this research will enhance a citizen science program focused on reporting deformed frogs. Second, the researchers will develop a documentary media package with the goal of promoting freshwater awareness and amphibian conservation. Third, the PI has partnered with biology textbook publishers Pearson and Sinauer to design an educational module for high school and undergraduate students. Beyond the PI's own classes, this effort will reach tens of thousands of students annually in classrooms and online learning environments (MasteringBiology). Building on the PI's ongoing commitment to involve undergraduate researchers from under-served groups, the investigators will partner with the Colorado Diversity Initiative to promote experiential research opportunities.",

While traditional biomedical research focuses on single-host, single-parasite systems, there is an urgent need to incorporate community ecology into disease research to understand host-pathogen interactions and patterns of disease emergence. Growing evidence suggests that other species in communities, including predators, alternative hosts, and even other parasites, can alter patterns of disease and could even provide novel tools for the control of emerging infections. The central aim of this proposal was to bridge the gap between community ecology and disease ecology by determining how host, non-host, and parasite diversity interact to affect disease risk in a group of globally threatened vertebrates: amphibians. Accordingly, the described research included extensive field surveys over 5 years and across 100 wetlands in California to characterize empirical patterns in the relationship between host diversity, parasite diversity and disease. Concurrently, controlled experiments both in the laboratory as well in outdoor mesocosms were used to determine how biodiversity mechanistically altered the risk of disease, both for individual hosts and entire communities. Taken together, these findings clearly demonstrate that increased biodiversity leads to decreases in parasite transmission and the risk of disease for amphibian host. Importantly, this occurs because host communities show highly predictable and repeatable patterns in assembly; thus, highly susceptible hosts tend to dominate among low-diversity wetlands while more diverse systems contain a greater fraction of host species with low susceptibility values. As a result, parasites have a harder time transmitting in diverse communities ? something that has proven difficult to demonstrate in other systems because of the intensity of data required. Beyond making these points for the amphibian-disease system specifically, this work helps to lay a foundation for determining the role of parasites in ecological communities and developing effective tools for managing emerging infections in humans and wildlife.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader impacts:</em></strong> This research capitalized on the public?s interest in amphibians generally ? and in amphibian deformities specifically ? to foster educational outreach and conservation awareness. The proposal completed four inter-related outreach activities designed to reach a wide audience. First, in collaboration with the <em>National Geographic Society</em> and the USGS, this research was used to launch a citizen science program focused on reporting deformed frogs and using reports from the public in educational exercises. Second, media specialists from <em>Freshwaters Illustrated</em> worked closely alongside project scientists to develop a series of video documentaries designed to promote awareness on topics such as emerging infectious diseases and amphibian conservation. Third, the PI and supported science personnel worked closely with students across a range of educational levels and backgrounds to foster research aptitude, encourage science career opportunities, and promote recruitment by under-represented groups. Partnering with programs such as the <em>Colorado Diversity Initiative</em>, the <em>Science Discovery Center</em>, and the <em>Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training </em>initiative, this grant provided experiential research opportunities for 27 undergraduates, 6 high school students, 12 technicians, 1 high school teacher, and 1 postdoctoral researcher. Of the 66 peer-reviewed publications produced by this project, 49 included undergraduate or graduate student co-authors and 34 were lead-authored by students.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/01/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Pieter&nbsp;T&nbsp;Johnson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556714642799_Freakshow--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556714642799_Freakshow--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Malformed frog\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556714642799_Freakshow--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Malformed frog\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Malformed frog found in Bay Area of California</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Travis McDevitt-Galles</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pieter&nbsp;T&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Malformed frog</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556714721908_PRPND0105_15D--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556714721908_PRPND0105_15D--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Helisoma in water\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556714721908_PRPND0105_15D--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Helisoma in water\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Snail in pond water.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Travis McDevitt-Galles</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pieter&nbsp;T&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Helisoma in water</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556714860760_Ribmiracidia_hatchingfromegg-Copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556714860760_Ribmiracidia_hatchingfromegg-Copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ribeiroia ondatrae hatching\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556714860760_Ribmiracidia_hatchingfromegg-Copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ribeiroia ondatrae hatching\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Eggs hatch in water, releasing free-swimming miracidia that infect snails, continuing the cycle.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dana Calhoun</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pieter&nbsp;T&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ribeiroia ondatrae hatching</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556715002821_ScreenShot2012-09-27at11.57.36AM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556715002821_ScreenShot2012-09-27at11.57.36AM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Malformed green tree frogs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556715002821_ScreenShot2012-09-27at11.57.36AM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Malformed green tree frogs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two malformed green tree frogs captured in the Bay Area of California</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Freshwaters Illustrated</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pieter&nbsp;T&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Malformed green tree frogs</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556715085011_P6040663--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556715085011_P6040663--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pond\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1149308/1149308_10182373_1556715085011_P6040663--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pond\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pond in Bay Area of California</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Travis McDevitt-Galles</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pieter&nbsp;T&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pond</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
