 "awd_abstract_narration": "THhis RAPID requestaims to collect a new and exciting data set that will support geyser eruption\r\nresearch currently funded by the National Science Foundation. The goal of this proposal\r\nis to create a short-term seismic array that will monitor and characterize the seismic\r\nbehavior of the shall subsurface at El Tatio Geyser Fields. This is the third largest\r\ngeyser field in the world. Due to the more relaxed stance on marginally invasive\r\nscientific investigations, El Tatio is an ideal location to deploy such a network. The data\r\nwill be unique in sensor density and duration. Consequently, results will likely surpass\r\nthose for any other geyser field. The goal is to characterize subsurface processes resulting in seismic vibrations and\r\ncorrelate these sources with surface eruption characteristics measured by Michael\r\nManga?s group (at UC Berkeley). The concurrent measurements of temperature,\r\ndischarge rate, eruption height, eruption duration and recurrence time, will make this data\r\nset completely unique. \r\n\r\nAs the world?s third largest geyser field, El Tatio is a key geotourism location. Better\r\nunderstanding of the subsurface processes for such locations will eventually help\r\neducation the broader public. Geyser eruptions are also key for understanding volcanic\r\neruption processes as well as constraining important properties for geothermal energy\r\ngeneration. Because this is a unique data set, and the data will be archived at the IRIS\r\nDMC for posterity, we anticipate that the data will contribute to further investigations\r\ninto geothermal and geyser processes.",
