 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate technical feasibility of producing low-cost, high-quality and large-area graphene films. The approach is to grow uniform graphene films over continuous tapes of electropolished catalytic copper foil in a roll-to-roll process. This project is expected to address critical challenges that limit industrial manufacture of graphene films including, (1) the need for high vacuum and high temperature, resulting in high cost; and (2) the limitation of graphene film size by the furnace dimension. \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide high-quality wafer-scale graphene material in industrial quantities. The technology will have advantages of cost, quality, and design flexibility over competing concepts. Large-area graphene films can be used for industrial applications including flexible, transparent electrode, Radio-Frequency electronics, Field-Effect-Transistor-based chemical sensors, near infrared detectors, as well as academic applications such as novel sample supports for ultra-high resolution transmission electron microscopy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nGraphene Frontiers is developing a low-cost manufacturing process for a large-area single and multi-atomic layer graphene sheets.  Many applications can benefit from graphene\u00c6s exceptional optical transparency, electrical and thermal conductivity, impermeability, flexibility, and strength in an atom thick film.  In this SBIR program, we have advanced and demonstrating the technical and commercial feasibility of our atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition process and an innovative transfer mechanism.  Based upon these results, we are confident that our process can scale up for industrial quantity production to help manufacturers incorporate graphene films in production lines at low cost. \n\nGraphene is a single atomic layer of carbon atoms, tightly bonded in a hexagonal lattice.  The inherent properties of graphene are appealing for a broad variety of applications in several fields.  The project is motivated by a need for large area, high quality graphene films for applications that exploit the graphene\u00c6s exceptional electronic, optical, mechanical, and chemical properties.  Potential applications include flexible, transparent electrodes, transistors, chemical sensors, nanopore filters, impermeable coatings for corrosion and/or chemical protection, supercapacitors, TEM supports, and others.  During Phase I, we chose to focus on transparent contacts for flexible displays (which is also potentially directly applicable to photovoltaics) due to customer interest, good technological fit with added value over current solutions, and the potential market scale in a rapidly changing industry.   Graphene Frontiers has been in contact with several industry players, providing samples and discussing industry needs.\n\nIn the Phase I and Phase IB programs we have successfully scaled up and improved our graphene fabrication processes and have developed a detailed process for roll-to-roll fabrication of graphene sheets and transfer of graphene sheets to arbitrary smooth substrates at low temperature and low cost.  We demonstrated graphene CVD films as large as 50 in2 and we developed a new, scalable, low-cost method of transferring graphene to other substrates that will provide us with a large competitive advantage over other existing methods.  During Phase I, we successfully raised private investment seed funding based upon this work allowing Graphene Frontiers to further advance the technology.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce I Willner"
