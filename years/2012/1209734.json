 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Zachary B. Haber of the University of Nevada, Reno to conduct a research project, entitled \"Development of prefabricated bridge columns with innovative structural design and connections,\" during the summer of 2012 at The National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientists are Prof. Kuo-Chun Chang of National Taiwan University and Prof. Yu-Chen Ou of National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to develop novel prefabricated concrete bridge columns that can be rapidly assembled and utilize innovative structural details. These new elements are being developed by integrating technologies developed and tested independently and brought together in this project. There are a number of advantages to the new design, including rapid replacement of of bridges during construction, repair, and replacement after severe natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, flooding, and hurricanes. \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

The use of ABC can have many benefits such as reduced overall project cost, reduced construction time (weeks instead of months), and can generally lessen the impact of construction on the public.  To effectively execute ABC projects, bridge designers use prefabricated concrete elements that can be quickly assembled to form a functional structural system. It is advantageous to the bridge designer if these systems emulate the design and behavior of conventional cast-in-place concrete bridge construction.  If this can be achieved, typical analysis and design procedures can be used.  The difficulty with designing prefabricated member with the intent to emulate conventional construction is usually encountered in the design and detailing of connections.  This is because connections play a critical role in the stability of the structure when it is subjected to an earthquake.\n\nThe use of mechanical reinforcing bar splices has become one option for creating moment connections between precast columns and cast-in-place (or precast) footings.
