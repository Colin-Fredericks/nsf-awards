 "awd_abstract_narration": "This mathematics research project in the area of complex dynamics in higher dimension has three components.  The first component investigates the properties of birational mappings in dimension 2 and higher.  Bedford and his collaborators will use tools from complex analysis and algebraic geometry to analyze fundamental properties of these mappings.  In particular, they will investigate how to determine the dynamical degrees in all dimensions.  The second component of this project investigates the existence of automorphisms of positive entropy in complex surfaces and 3-folds. The third component is focused on the complex Henon family of dynamical systems, which has served as an important model family.  These dynamical systems are represented by quite simple polynomials, but they exhibit complicated dynamical behaviors. They have been important because many observed phenomena can actually be proved mathematically.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mathematics research project is related to the field of study of chaos theory, which has applications to several disciplines, including physics, engineering, economics and biology. An important phenomenon in chaos theory is the so-called butterfly effect, which illustrates the unstable dependence on initial conditions for a given dynamical system. The Henon functions studied in this project have been a fertile testing ground for transformations that have simple formulas but which exhibit the butterfly effect. The study of birational maps has applications to the field of Lattice Statistical Mechanics (LSM) which considers materials that have a lattice structure like crystals.  LSM provides a formula for determining the energy and temperature of such a material in terms of the various interaction energies between the atoms in the lattice. This formula is very difficult to compute, but in many cases there are fundamental symmetries which lead to substantial simplifications.  These symmetries are given by birational maps such as those studied in this project, and the amount of simplification is given by the degree complexity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Project studied the dynamics of transformations of space.  The basic question of modern (mathematical) dynamics is to ask what happens when you iterate the transformation, which means that you apply the transformation repeatedly.  In other words, what is the long-term effect of this transformation as you repeat it a very large number of times.  This is sometimes known as the random or chaotic behavior that develops from deterministic transformations as they are repeated for very long time.  The transformations studied in this project can be presented as simple polynomial or rational mappings, but their dynamical behavior is chaotic.\nThe Henon family of  transformations of the plane were introduced by the astronomer Henon.  He introduced them because they had a simple form and yet could model the complicated dynamical behavior that arises in the n-body problem.  In our Project, we studied the stability/instability of these mappings under perturbation.  We found and studied the case where there is \"parabolic implosion\".  This is a behavior which is unstable, yet the Project showed that the exact instability can be described precisely.  In another of our results, we found that a different sort of perturbation produces continuous dependence under bifurcation.  \nWe also studied the bifurcation of the so-called \"horseshoe\" maps within the Henon family.  For this we obtained a \"symbolic representation\" for the dynamics.  With this symbolic representation we are able to give a precise criterion for which maps are horseshoe.\nFor mappings of complex space, there is the Julia set, which is where the chaotic dynamical behavior takes place.  For most maps, the Julia set is fractal, but in complex dimension one, there are certain polynomial maps for which the Julia set is smooth, either an interval or a circle.  These polynomial maps play a special role in understanding one-dimensional complex dynamics.  In this Project, we showed that there is no Henon map which is analogous:  No Julia set for a Henon map is ever smooth.  Thus, in this sense, no Henon maps are more special than the others.\nWe also made progress in dimension 3.  A mapping is said to be \"invertible\" if it has an inverse, which is another map which \"undoes\" the original map.  One further outcome was that we were able to give a mapping of 3-dimensional space which is a counterexample to the Guedj Conjecture for invertible rational maps.  The mapping produced by this counterexample cannot be analyzed using all previously known approaches to understanding the dynamics of invertible rational maps.  So these maps produce the challenge to develop a new approach.\nThe activities of this Project have had a positive effect on the development of graduate students and post-docs.  This Project also produced expository/survey articles that communicated to the nearby fields of Algebraic Geometry and Complex Analysis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/08/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric D Bedford"
