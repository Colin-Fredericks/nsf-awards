Ricketts\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) item for the R/V BLUE HERON; namely up-grades to the vessel?s winch wire monitoring system.  This item will enhance safety on deck and provide greatly improved science support capabilities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The University of Minnesota supports federally-funded scientific research on the Great Lakes and routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to the marine sciences.  The R/V BLUE HERON is scheduled to complete over 30 NSF sponsored days in 2012.",
