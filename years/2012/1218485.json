 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solid-state storage technologies, such as flash, phase-change memory\r\nand memristors promise large-capacity storage at speeds much faster\r\nthan disk. To date, mainstream use of these technologies has been as a\r\nreplacement for disks, storing a disk-oriented file system.  However,\r\nsolid-state storage is and will remain far more expensive than\r\ndisks. Thus, it will often be used as a cache or special-purpose\r\nstore, and not as the main repository of data.\r\n\r\nThis proposal develops new interfaces to solid-state storage that\r\nleverage its new features, such as access via ordinary memory\r\ninstructions, and its role in large software systems as a middle layer\r\nbetween memory and disk. It focuses on two forms of solid-state\r\nstorage: flash memory, common in solid-state drives and mobile\r\ndevices, and forthcoming storage-class memory, which compared to flash\r\npromises lower latency, better endurance, and access as memory rather\r\nthan as a device.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses important concerns about using solid-state\r\nstorage: how best to use the capabilities of these devices to improve\r\nspecific applications or use cases, such as caching; how to provide\r\naccess to internal management capabilities of solid-state storage\r\ndevices, such as address translation and garbage collection, to\r\napplications; how to remove software layers between an application and\r\nstorage to reduce latency; and how to provide reliable storage while\r\nremoving many of the layers that currently provide reliability.",
