Specifically, the Center, through the access it has to longitudinal state databases from a US Department of Education award, will conduct a preliminary analysis of how to create a survey using current state data and will query the data for what constitutes successful STEM schools. Through the use of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) methods, the project will identify school-level residual effects of STEM fields, holding prior student achievement constant. This work should contribute substantially to an approach for measuring efficacy across diverse programs.",
