 "awd_abstract_narration": "The core of this project is the development of a methodology (software\r\nand hardware) to produce synchronized visual and sonic representations\r\nof seismic wave fields in the Earth. Coupling these senses enables\r\npeople, from the general public to seasoned seismologists, to\r\nappreciate and perceive an enormous richness in the patterns of\r\nseismic wave fields. The aim is not to simulate the experience of an\r\nearthquake, but to render the physics of wave propagation in the globe\r\nand the nature of earthquake physics into a completely tactile\r\nexperience, unlike anything anyone has ever perceived. The working\r\ngroup is comprised of earth scientists, astrophysicists, sound and\r\ngraphics engineers and educators, from the Lamont Doherty Earth\r\nObservatory (LDEO), Princeton University, and the American Museum of\r\nNatural History (AMNH).\r\n\r\nThe images and sounds are generated from both USArray and GSN data, as\r\nwell as from simulations generated with the spectral element method\r\n(SEM), using the SPECFEM3D software.  Sounds are generated by shifting\r\nthe frequency of the seismic signal into the range of human hearing,\r\nand are filtered and stretched in time to optimize the coupled visual\r\nand sonic effects. Once the methodology is in place, it will take two\r\ngeneral forms:\r\n\r\nFirst, a web-based format that allows people to choose earthquakes and\r\nseismic data to listen to, with images produced by either a dense\r\narray of seismometers (i.e. the ground motion visualizations (GMVs)\r\nproduced by IRIS of the Transportable Array data) or a simulation of\r\nthe seismic wave field (i.e. by SPECFEM3D). This format will be useful\r\nfor classroom and laboratory purposes, and interactive museum\r\nexhibits, as well as for exploratory observation of raw data by\r\nseismologists.\r\n\r\nSecond, a version will be developed for the Hayden Planetarium at the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History, in New York City. The images,\r\nprojected on the planetarium dome, will include the surface of the\r\nEarth rendered as a membrane and also a volumetric rendering in which\r\nthe observer will see 3D wave fronts propagating throughout the globe.\r\nThe sounds will be tuned to the large speaker array in the\r\nPlanetarium.  Within the context of this project, several Public\r\nPrograms will occur in the Planetarium, in which the immersive\r\nexperience of listening to the Earth will be guided by the production\r\nteam.  These Public Programs are the essential first step towards\r\ndeveloping a full planetarium show on the dynamics of the Earth at\r\nAMNH.",
