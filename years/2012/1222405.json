 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT \r\n\r\n25 April 2012\r\nProposal Number:  1222405\r\nInstitution:  University of Delaware\r\nPI:   T. Deering\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests CY 2012 operational funding support for the East Coast Van Pool which is managed by the University of Delaware. The East Coast Van Pool is located at the College of Marine Studies in Lewes, Delaware.  The East Coast Van Pool supports federally-funded oceanographic research by providing properly outfitted and maintained portable laboratory vans of all types to the Academic Research Vessel Fleet.  Pooling of portable capital equipment such as this (1) provides Centers of Expertise with logistical support for science and ship operators; (2) provides equipment that is Free at the Point of Use to NSF-funded users which relieves burden on science and ship operations grants; (3) provides a mechanism for non-NSF funded users to share maintenance costs by paying established daily rates; (4) reduces the need for duplication of equipment at multiple institutions which results in a long-term cost savings to the federal agencies; (5) generates improved budget transparency on actual costs to operate and properly maintain capital, shared-use equipment; (6) allows NSF to make proper equipment purchase decisions based on science needs and provide the appropriate, dedicated, long-term support budgets; and (7) improves the quality and reliability of equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The research projects supported by the equipment pools have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit with all equipment deployments coordinated with University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) ship time requests.  During operations, vessels in the Academic Research Vessel Fleet routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Specifically, the College of Marine and Earth Studies at the University of Delaware participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events (Coast Day) and participation in the MATE program.  UD also owns and operates the R/V HUGH R. SHARP as part of the Academic Fleet.",
