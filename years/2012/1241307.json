 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at University of Texas - Pan American in the summer of 2013 on solitons in two-dimensional water waves and applications to tsunamis. The principal speaker will be Professor Yuji Kodama from Ohio State University. The lectures will cover such areas as Grassmannians, two-dimensional soliton solutions and stability, and the Mach reflection problem. In addition to the 10 main lectures by Dr. Kodama, lectures will be presented by other experts in the field. \r\n\r\nHallmarks of the NSF/CBMS regional conference series are focus on a single important and timely area of research by a leading practitioner, a published monograph for a wider audience, and continued effect and local stimulation through regional recruitment emphasis. This conference will also entail a lecture aimed at the public on Japan's tsunamis.  This award will support approximately 30 participants in the conference, many at early stages of their careers.",
