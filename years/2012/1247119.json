 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel support for three US researchers to attend a two-day workshop held in Bologna, Italy. The workshop will be organized by the US researchers in collaboration with leading Italian research groups. The objectives of the workshop are: 1) to explore new research opportunities in composite strengthening technology to advance current knowledge in fundamental theory, 2) to study new generations of composite materials, and 3) to establish new international lines of collaboration, with particular emphasis on student exchange opportunities. Repairing and strengthening of aging structures is becoming the only sustainable and economical solution to preserve the quality of the nation's infrastructure. Composite strengthening technology has demonstrated to be an effective and viable solution to repair and retrofit reinforced concrete and masonry structures. Fundamental aspects of this technology are yet to be understood in order to employ it effectively, while new composite materials are under development. The workshop will explore and identify new directions for research related to three topics: 1) fiber reinforced cementitious matrix composites, 2) steel reinforced grout composites, and 3) fatigue response of composite-strengthened structures. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will be structured to foster interaction between the participants, with presentations and discussions led by key researchers in their respective fields. Participants will include a diverse group of researchers with different cultural backgrounds and expertise. Graduate students will also be encouraged to participate, giving these next-generation researchers the opportunity to share international insights and benefit from cutting-edge research in their fields.",
