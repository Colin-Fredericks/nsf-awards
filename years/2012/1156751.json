 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gateways to Science Careers (G2SC) program is designed to provide undergraduate students with access to innovative science and mathematics education research. As a Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) site at Stanford University, this project would place 15 students per year in a summer training program and mentoring project that involves two primary activities. First, students will work as research assistants in three STEM education laboratories. G2SC will recruit students from across the nation to participate in the program, with particular focus on recruiting African-American students and through a collaborative effort with Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Second, students will receive year-long training and mentoring regarding graduate admissions. The objective of this project is to provide students mentoring and apprenticeship programs that will support their interest in STEM education careers. The students' participation in research and publishing in STEM education has the potential to help build capacity for participation of underrepresented groups in STEM education research.\r\n\r\nThe G2SC program intends to impact the way students interested in STEM careers envision themselves as members of the STEM education community. Through their direct research with leading African-American scholars in STEM education and their research groups, the participating students will be engaged in authentic apprenticeships that extend beyond a summer academy into the academic year. By offering this program to 15 students per year, the goal is to assist 45 students towards careers in science and mathematics education research. The broader impact of this project involves its capacity to provide a model for the recruitment and training of STEM education researchers. This project has the potential to produce 45 STEM educators and education researchers. The REU site and the research associated with this project may also provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of pipeline programs.",
