The purpose of the meeting is to showcase how the current projects promote innovative and creative STEM education and workforce development as well as front-line, interdisciplinary scientific research and technology advances.   Presentations will also explore the potential for future cubesat projects to provide crucial measurements from space that are needed to solve critical societal problems including:  climate change, land use and resource management, pollution and disaster monitoring, communication and space weather; and enable further scientific discoveries and engineering innovation, including: Manufacturing in space, materials research for 3D printing of satellites and components, sensor miniaturization, micro-electro-mechanical (MEM) systems, systems engineering, radio science, communication algorithms and networks, cloud physics, atmospheric chemistry, space physics, Earth radiation budget, ocean observations, and biology. The goal of the meeting is to identify ways and best practices for CubeSats to benefit interdisciplinary science goals along with STEM education and diversity objectives broadly within all relevant research areas of NSF.",
