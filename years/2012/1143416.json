 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) nanotags for diagnostic and security applications.  A novel class of SERS tags that exhibit much higher performance than other tag formulations were demonstrated.  This novel class of tags consists of a bimetallic nanoparticle with the Raman-active molecule trapped at the metal/metal junction.  In this project, four spectrally distinct SERS tags will be fabricated, coated with silica shells, and functionalized with antibodies to provide specific targeting for diagnostic applications, or with polymers to provide stability in solvents and inks for security applications.  Tags will be characterized using a novel high throughput flow spectroscopy instrument capable of analyzing thousands of individual SERS tags, enabling rapid optimization of tag formulations.  The performance of optimized tags will be tested in diagnostic and security applications to demonstrate and quantify tag efficacy. \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide bright, robust, and spectrally distinct molecules and nanoparticles that can be used to identify and track biologics, people, and products.  Currently fluorescent molecules are the most commonly used tag; however, due to their spectral widths, current instrumentation is limited to tracking only 5-20 tags simultaneously.  SERS tags, with their very narrow spectral features thus more distinct variants, offer the promise of much higher multiplexing.",

As we continue to develop formulations for these industries, nanoComposix has already commercialized a portion of the technology developed through this award, providing related nanomaterials to academic researchers and companies who are conducting fundamental scientific research and incorporating such particles into biological studies and renewable-energy (e.g. solar cells) applications.\n\n \n\nThe nanoparticles developed in this effort can be used as optical tags to identify and track biologics, people, and products.  For many applications, the more distinct variants that can be generated from a particular class of tags, the higher the degree of multiplexing and the more powerful the technology.  Previously, fluorescence labels have typically been used for these applications but have drawbacks associated with their brightness, stability, and the number of simultaneous tags that can be individually discriminated.
