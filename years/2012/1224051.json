 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PATHWAYS project, OUTSIDE: Over Under and Through, Students Informally Discover the Environment, is a descriptive study focusing on an informal environmental education program for underrepresented middle school students in Mississippi. The project is a collaboration between the University of Southern Mississippi's Biological Sciences Learning Center, the Lake Thoreau Environmental Center, the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, and the Hattiesburg Public School District. The partners will develop a training program for volunteer naturalists and, using an ethnographic approach, capture patterns in learning and interactions among the students and naturalists. They will answer the following research questions: 1) In what ways do students interact with naturalists, nature, and technology supplements while participating in OUTSIDE informal environmental programs? and 2) What are students' ideas about the environment and environmental awareness? Deliverables will include rich descriptions of participant experiences during the program; identification of environmental factors that may influence learning; a Beta version of the etrek app to supplement learning; a curriculum plan for post-secondary students and teachers; publications and presentations focused on research findings within broader review of literature and programs. \r\n\r\nOUTSIDE will help advance the informal science education (ISE) field by providing empirical support for pedagogical decision making among environmental educators who work with underrepresented and underserved STEM learners in high needs communities; offering insight into how ISE professionals can leverage local resources and embed sustainability in project designs; and developing technology that can serve a broader community.",

This project focused on researching how students learn science concepts while hiking around a nature preserve with an iPad in hand. Middle school student are more comfortable sitting inside with some sort of technology in their hands and less comfortable exploring nature and learning about science.&nbsp; They are also the group that is most likely to lose interest in science. As such only about 17% of high school students are proficient and interested enough to pursue a future in science. Schools can only do so much since most of what people learn and experience about science is done through informal contexts. We have found that students do not spend enough time engaging in nature, and those underrepresented in STEM have even fewer opportunities to participate. We are aware that informal learning environments can provide unique experiences for students thus helping to promote interest in science.&nbsp; With increased interest, students are more likely to develop positive attitudes toward science and hopefully more likely to continue science pursuits.&nbsp; Still, children are captivated by technology more than ever before and this has posed a problem of how to draw them away from screens into nature.&nbsp; Going outside can cause anxiety or disinterest for students because they would rather engage in technology driven activities that typically occur indoors. We used iPads to help ease the transition from indoor activities (e.g., looking at a screen) to an outdoor activity (i.e., a hike in a natural setting). In learning environments, learners&rsquo; attention is split across different types of participation. Within typical informal nature hike settings, students&rsquo; participation is split into two types, Social (with the naturalist and other students) and Nature (the outdoors). For OUTSIDE, we prepared college volunteer naturalists to interact with children during a nature hike series. Our project added a third participation type by integrating technology. We created a GO app (available free via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go-to-lake-thoreau/id593032744?mt=8\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go-to-lake-thoreau/id593032744?mt=8</a>) that offers content resources related to the hike and activity suggestions to get hikers engaged with nature. While adding more ways to participate could potentially become distracting, we found that the addition of iPad technology into our nature hikes acted as a hook to draw in the interest of children. Children used the iPad (specifically the GO app, camera, and notepad) to explore nature and stay engaged throughout the hike, with very little distraction. Over the course of OUTSIDE, we found significant learning gains about MS flora and constant increases in environmental awareness among children participants. The children also indicated a desire in returning to the site for future learning experiences and they responded positively toward interacting with nature. Likewise, OUTSIDE naturalists expressed 1) positive attitudes regarding the use of this supportive educational tool on the hikes, and 2) the tool supported their development of a naturalist identity. By leveraging the use of multiple types of participation (Technology, Social, and Nature), we created an engaging informal science opportunity that all children (including underserved groups) can participate in while learning more about nature.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/23/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kristy&nbsp;Daniel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t...",
