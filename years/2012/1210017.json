 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Marcus Welker of Dartmouth College to conduct a research project, entitled \"Restoration of Lake Champlain Atlantic salmon: A study of river and hatchery amino acids,\" during the summer of 2012 at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Hiroshi Ueda.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to understand the spatial and temporal variability of amino acids in river and hatchery waters - two key pieces of the Lake Champlain Atlantic salmon restoration systems. Amino acids are one of the key odorants responsible for the migratory and homing abilities of salmonids, however due to their economic and water quality insignificance, very little research has been conducted on their presence and concentrations in salmon streams.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

Amino acids are suspected to be the naturally occurring chemical that both Pacific (<em>Oncorhynchus spp</em>.) and Atlantic (<em>Salmo salar</em>) salmon smell as juveniles in their home-streams and create powerful memories of (imprint) and then use these memories as adults to find their way to the same place they were born on their adult spawning migration (homing).

Depending on the attractiveness of the waters flowing down one branch or the other, the fish will preferentially select one branch of the maze.
