More specifically, the 2012 conference emphasizes two new direction that are consistent with the Networks and Regulation cluster priorities. First, the conference focuses on an integrated perspective of stress response biology across scales of complexity from single to multicellular to microbe-host interaction systems. Second, the organizers make a concerted effort to include computational and systems-levelapproaches to study stress biology in microbes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe meeting offers numerous informal opportunities for young investigators to interact with senior researchers. Students and junior scientists will be selected for presentations based on their submitted abstracts. A particular effort will be made to recruit underrepresented minorities and participants from diverse geographical regions. Diverse participation is reflected also in the organizing committee with one of the two chairs being a female. Eleven of 32 invited and confirmed speakers/discussion leaders are females and two are members of an under-represented minority group.",
