 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cloud computing centers are used by most major corporations to store business data and provide flexibility in computing services allowing more agile business responses in this rapidly evolving economy. Individuals also benefit from cloud computing services ranging from data storage (e.g. dropbox.com) to mobile computation (e.g. the iPhone's Siri computes in the cloud). These cloud computing centers must adapt rapidly and efficiently to complex and intensive requests from many simultaneous users. One emerging mechanism for such complex real time allocations is to use pricing -- provide prices for various resources and allow an internal market to find good allocations. The goal of this project is to carefully analyze several important properties of price mechanisms. First and foremost is the accuracy and stability of prices and the allocations that they induce -- the so called market equilibria. Second, is their manipulability by users, a problem that has been observed in several such systems. Third is their relationship to external pricing and their relationship to various methods used to increase the income of cloud computing providers. \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to analyze price mechanisms for cloud computing, studied within the more general framework of resource allocation. In the first special case (the Leontief economy) it is assumed that the commodities are perfect complements. The second special case is the \"machine based model\" in which some machines are of use to only a subset of all users. The project will study the fairness properties of such schemes and particular their relation to Nash bargaining theory, the convergence rate to the clearing prices, and the potential for users to manipulate the market.\r\n\r\nThis research will have direct impact on the design and development of modern cloud computing centers, allowing them to provide lower cost service and avoid many pitfalls that have been problematic in the past. In addition, the study of prices and markets in such a controlled environment will allow us to develop mathematical and computational tools that will be useful in understanding the national and international economies. In particular, the study of price manipulations and the development of systems that limit such manipulations are of great importance. Also, the development of better mechanisms for managing cloud computing centers will improve the environment by reducing the number of computers required by these centers, saving resources and energy.  The PIs will participate in education outreach at local high schools and with women and under-represented groups at the Berkeley Foundation for Opportunities in Information Technology (BFOIT) summer workshop.",
