 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surprisingly little is known about how many species are on our planet. Most of the known species occur in the tropics, and most of these are insects. This project will inventory all of the different species of true flies (Diptera) at a single site in Costa Rica. Because this is the first time such a study has been attempted, the number of species is unknown, but is expected to be extremely high, with many new to science. Intensive collections will be made, and 46 experts from around the world will collaborate to study each of the 89 families of flies. At least 3,000 species are expected to be present at the study site. \r\n\r\nThe biodiversity on our planet is in serious trouble. Threats to mammals and birds are well studied but virtually nothing is known about the hugely diverse insects. As decomposers, pollinators, predators and much more, insects are vital components of ecosystems. The widespread destruction of habitats almost certainly means that thousands are going extinct every year, eliminating their important ecological services, and their potential to inform science. This survey will, for the first time, provide vital information of how many species of a major group of insects live in a tropical ecosystem. In addition, the investigators plan significant public outreach.  As an example, many people are familiar with the idea that there are large numbers of species on our planet and that many are under threat by such phenomena as global warming, ozone depletion, pollution and deforestation. Few, however, understand how scientists actually go about studying and interpreting biodiversity. A portion of the web site will describe the expedition to study the diversity of Diptera at a tropical site and will include copious photographs and a number of videos. The vernacular the investigators plan to use and the visual media to be employed will be directed to the general public, showing how scientists begin by being puzzled by, in this case, the tremendous diversity of flies in a tropical land. The site will describe the scientists? levels of ignorance and then, step by step, portray how they sample, sort and discover the species that are living there. Some presentations will additionally relate interesting stories of some of the species discovered.",
