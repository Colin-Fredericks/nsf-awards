 "awd_abstract_narration": "The product the team aims to bring to market is a cloud-based video encoding and transcoding service with superior performance, flexibility and security features. Customers using this service would upload video files through a web portal (or API) for encoding/transcoding into their choice of formats and bit-rates suitable for display on mobile devices. The differentiating features of the planned cloud video product include: (a) fast encoding/transcoding speed with superior video quality, (b) excellent cost/performance, and (c) the ability to support a wide variety of input and output video formats. Implementation of the proposed cloud service will employ distributed computing technologies such as Map/Reduce and Hadoop to achieve significant parallelism in video processing, resulting in efficient use of computing resources and faster processing time. \r\n\r\nThe cloud video prototype to be developed in this project is expected to result in a commercial service with significant revenue potential. The product will simplify video encoding and transcoding for a variety of enterprises including content producers, broadcasters and mobile service providers, by providing on-demand and low-cost video conversion services that currently require on-site equipment with related capital costs. If successful, the cloud video technology will thus enable improved and lower cost mobile content delivery benefiting a broad cross section of Internet and wireless end-users.",
