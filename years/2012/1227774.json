Kniffin\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests two Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V WALTON SMITH which is operated by the University of Miami; namely a new reverse osmosis water maker and engineering evaluations of the aft deck cranes for compliance with emergent UNOLS Research Vessel Safety Standards.  These items will either improve safety or enhance the vessel?s science support capability.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The R/V WALTON SMITH supports federally funded scientific research in the southern Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house events, and educational cruises.  The WALTON SMITH is scheduled to complete approximately 40 NSF sponsored days in 2012.",

Walton Smith.   In particular this project called for the replacement of the water maker on board the Walton Smith and to contract for the completion of Maximum Capability Documents for equipment aboard.\n\n \n\nThe old water maker aboard the Walton Smith only made 800 gallons of fresh water per day which was not enough to supply both the daily scientific and personal water requirements.  A new SK HC-1500 Reverse Osmosis Desalinization water system was installed aboard the Walton Smith.  The new water maker makes 1500 gallons of fresh water per day, a doubling of the fresh water capability of the ship.  Now there is sufficient capacity to provide fresh water for all operations aboard.    \n\n \n\nMurray and Associates, Naval Architects, completed required safety documentation for equipment aboard the F.G. Walton Smith.  Two Maximum Capability Documents, or MCD, were completed.  An MCD is a document that provides the user with the maximum permissible tension for a specific component or system for a given range of load geometries.   MCDs are required by the UNOLS Research Vessel Safety Standards.  As the F.G. Walton Smith is a UNOLS vessel it must meet the requirements of these safety standards.
