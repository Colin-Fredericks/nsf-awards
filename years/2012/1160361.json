 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project aims to understand how different regulatory institutions interact. It\r\nwill examine the following research question: \"Why has the European Union (EU) responded to\r\nexisting private environmental regulation in different issue areas in diverse regulatory ways?\"\r\nPrivate environmental regulation in this project refers to voluntary certification and eco-labeling\r\nprograms developed by non-state actors (industry organizations; firms; non-governmental\r\norganizations) to induce corporate environmentally friendly behavior. By examining EU\r\nresponses to private regulation in four issue areas (organic agriculture, biofuels, fisheries, and\r\nfair trade) this research will explain why in some cases the EU has responded strongly by\r\ndeveloping its own public certification program, while in other cases it has decided not to\r\nintervene at all, or only in a very limited way.\r\n\r\nBy examining the historical co-evolution of public policy and private regulation in these issue\r\nareas, and by analyzing the decision-making processes of the EU's regulatory responses, this\r\nstudy will identify the causal mechanisms and processes that can explain the observed\r\nvariation. Through in-depth, semi-structured interviews I will gather original data from EU\r\nofficials and decision-makers, EU-level and national interest and advocacy groups,\r\nrepresentatives from private environmental regulatory programs, issue experts and academics.\r\nThese data will be complemented with data on the decision-making processes, which will be\r\ngathered during desk research and from notes and documents obtained from interviewees.\r\n\r\nThis dissertation's main intellectual contribution is its focus on an unexplored dependent\r\nvariable, namely the regulatory responses of public authorities to private environmental\r\nregulation. This study will contribute to the nascent research on the interaction between public\r\nand private regulation and on the role of non-state actors in politics more broadly. Even though\r\nthis dissertation will be limited to environmental issue areas, it is expected that the conclusions\r\nare generalizable to other issue areas as well. It is not expected, in other words, that the\r\nparticular characteristics of the environmental issues determine public responses to private\r\nregulation, but rather that more general factors, such as the specific features of private\r\nregulatory programs and corporate involvement in these programs, explain public authorities'\r\nresponses.\r\n\r\nPrivate actors are currently using certification and labeling programs to address environmental\r\nand social problems in an increasingly diverse range of issue areas. This research will contribute\r\nto generating policy relevant knowledge on how public authorities can attain a better\r\nintegration of public and private policy instruments. Furthermore, understanding the way\r\npublic policy interacts with private regulatory programs will generate useful information for\r\ninitiators of such programs regarding their design and functioning.",
