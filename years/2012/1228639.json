 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at developing efficient methods for protecting the privacy of computations on outsourced data in distributed settings. The project addresses the design of an outsourced storage framework where the access pattern observed by the storage server gives no information about the actual data accessed by the client and cannot be correlated with external events. For example, the server cannot determine whether a certain item was previously accessed by the client or whether a certain algorithm is being executed.  This property provides a high level of privacy protection that goes far beyond standard data encryption. The project also deals with advanced methods for verifying the correctness of outsourced computations, focusing on keyword searches and graph algorithms. The educational component of the project includes a curricular development effort for introductory computer security courses.\r\n\r\nThe project has applications to a broad range of web services widely used by business and consumers. Privacy-preserving access for outsourced data is relevant to web-based email and office applications. Also, it is especially important for the management of proprietary business data, medical data, and other sensitive personal data.",

Identifying the server as \"honest-but-curious\" implies that the server is trusted to keep client's data safe, available, and to perform all the specified protocols, but at the same time the server wants to learn as much as possible about the client's data.  The methods developed in this project included several algorithms for oblivious random access machine (ORAM) simulation, in cloud computing environments where a client outsources her data to a server using small messages and the algorithm provides a way for the client to access the data remotely so that its privacy is preserved even in terms of any patterns as to how the data is accessed.  These methods were further parameterized by how much private storage is available to the client and the size of the messages exchanged between the client and the server. The developed algorithms combined various techniques to achieve improved input-output overheads over previous methods.
