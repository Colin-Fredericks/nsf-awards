 "awd_abstract_narration": "Comprehensive Support for STEM Students with Learning Disability (CS3LD) will use a multi-level approach to broaden participation and achievement of undergraduate students with LD in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). CS3LD is grounded in Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), which posits that a student?s knowledge and beliefs, together with the university environment, influence necessary behaviors for academic success and overall health/well-being. CS3LD will facilitate development of positive self-efficacy through activities that will increase knowledge and personal skills, foster interpersonal relationships, and leverage institutional supports. CS3LD creates a multi-level (personal, interpersonal and institutional) model for supporting success of students with LD in STEM. Implementation and evaluation of theCS3LD model will be rigorously documented and reported so that it can be replicated on other campuses and potentially applied to other disability groups across the country. Utilization of a Continuous Improvement Model (CIM) will enable project responsiveness and ensure that objectives are being met.\r\nTraditional models address the factors impacting students with learning disabilities in isolation, while this model integrates personal, interpersonal, and institutional level factors. Findings have the potential to advance knowledge and understanding in the fields of STEM, higher education, and disability studies.\r\n",

(2) the LD-knowledge needs of STEM mentors for supporting these students' academic/professional development and personal health/wellbeing; (3) the knowledge needs of campus faculty and staff for supporting these students within the classroom and on campus (e.g., social aspects of being a student); and (4) the changes an institution can make to provide an environment that better facilitates the growth of STEM students with LDs.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The CS3LD project facilitated the broad participation (e.g., academic, social) of individuals with learning and related disabilities in STEM higher education; it created, tested and validated a model and campus-based practices that can be replicated and/or extended to other campuses or disability groups.&nbsp; Broader impacts of the study's activities were realized through changes in the university's practices and culture with respect to undergraduate STEM students with LD.&nbsp; An example of a change in practice includes a new partnership between the university's disability office and career services office to create a series of workshops focusing on disability in the workplace; afterwards, the career services office began to house a career services advisor within the disability office. &nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural change was illustrated when the learning disability-focused council, created by CS3LD, was adopted by the university's disability office and was renamed to reflect an evolved focus on supporting students with a diverse range of learning styles.&nbsp; Discussion within the Council shifted from disability to diversity, which is valued for contributing to the richness of experiences and perspectives afforded from diverse campus members. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The university's infrastructure for STEM education was enhanced through the facilitation of LD-informed STEM mentorship.&nbsp; STEM faculty and graduate students were provided knowledge about LD which enhanced their mentorship and teaching.&nbsp; Additionally, we built a network of LD knowledgeable personnel across campus and supported the campus disability office's expansion of disability-related student tracking and outreach. &nbsp;At the institutional level and consistent with the CS3LD model, the project bridged the gap among student services (e.g., student affairs) and academic units for providing disability-related supports and promoting practices and principles that put the diversity of learners at the forefront (i.e., universal design for learning).&nbsp; This was accomplished through the creation and institutional adoption of the university-wide council that was later expanded beyond LD to encompass neurodiversity.&nbsp; Educator development is enhanced on campus through the ongoing inclusion of study findings regarding supportive classroom practices within the campus' central office for teaching development (i.e., Office of Faculty Development &amp; Teaching Excellence).&nbsp; Moreover, these findings and educator trainings (e.g., training videos) are available for public consumption through the Office of Faculty Development &amp; Teaching Excellence's website. &nbsp;The CS3LD project created avenues for self and public advocacy to raise awareness and understanding about LD through LD-focused advocacy projects that were created by STEM students with LD and disseminated on campus and through campus websites with assistance from Partnership/Neurodiversity Council members. &nbsp;&nbsp;Supports created within the CS3LD project have been and are continuing to be implemented within the services provided by the university's disability office.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/18/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Consuelo&nbsp;M&nbsp;Kreider</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1246587/1246587_10215440_1544885068423_1.Model--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1246587/1246587_10215440_1544885068423_1.Model--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Comprehensive Support for STEM Students with Learning Disability (CS3LD) Model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1246587/1246587_10215440_1544885068423_1.Model--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Comprehensive Support for STEM Students with Learning Disability (CS3LD) Model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The CS3LD model is a campus-based framework of integrated interventions that target changes at the institutional, personal, and interpersonal levels.
