 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Development of an Engineering Physics Program Concentration at NCCU - has the goal to design new courses and laboratories that infuse engineering principles and design into the curriculum with special emphasis on problem solving and developing communication skills. Students in the program will gain substantial experience with laboratory methods, data analysis, and computational methods. Graduates will be well equipped to pursue research and development careers in new and emerging technologies in industry that cut across engineering and science disciplines or to pursue graduate studies in science or engineering. The engineering physics curriculum is intended to recruit students to the physics program.\r\n\r\nThe planned activities are to extend physics-based laboratory courses to the engineering physics curriculum; infuse engineering physics into relevant courses in the Physics Department course inventory; develop new theme-based engineering physics courses and laboratories; establish a 3-plus-2 program with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University; develop the engineering physics curriculum; and recruit Engineering Physics majors. The proposed activities are centered in a department where African American students compose about 2/3 of the undergraduate population. The results of the project activities will be disseminated to the broader Physics community through presentations at meetings of professional Physics educators.",
