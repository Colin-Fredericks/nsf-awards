Scholarship recipients are learning about power engineering through interdisciplinary courses, guest lecturers, and field trips, as well as participation in a local chapter of professional organizations.   LTU is leveraging its network of local and regional industry partnerships, including DTE Energy Corporation, to aid in the recruitment, retention, and job placement of the S-STEM scholars.\r\n\r\nThe project is meeting national needs for a highly-skilled, diversified workforce in the generation, transmission, and distribution of power, and for highly-qualified candidates for graduate studies.  The project is strengthening the partnership between the two-year and four-year institutions of higher education, along with local engineering and technology employers.  As southeast Michigan is changing its economic base, the project will benefit a region with substantial challenges.",
