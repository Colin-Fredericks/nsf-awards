 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to design and develop highly efficient spatial and spatio-temporal database systems on flash memory storage. More specifically, this project conducts research, develops requisite scientific knowledge, builds software infrastructure, and integrates teaching activities with research for four specific aims: (1) Supporting efficient spatial indexing on flash memory, which includes data- and space-partitioning index structures, (2) Supporting efficient spatial query processing and optimization, which includes supporting various forms of the spatial join operation and query cost estimation, (3) Supporting spatio-temporal indexing and querying, which includes extending the spatial index data structures and the query processor to support the high update frequency common in spatio-temporal applications, and (4) Exploiting a storage hierarchy of flash and magnetic disks where spatial and spatio-temporal indexing, query processing, and optimization can exploit the full potential of both storage media. Besides its impact on industry, this project will have significant broader impact across multiple segments of society that include enhancing productivity, graduate and undergraduate student education, curriculum development, and tutorial presentations. Publications, technical reports, open-source software, and experimental data from this research are disseminated via the project web site (http://www.cs.umn.edu/~mokbel/flash).",
