 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Dewi Harjanto of Boston University to conduct a research project, entitled \"Using a mechanically-sensitive polymer to study cell-generated forces,\" during the summer of 2012 at Hanyang University in Seoul, Korea.  The host scientist is Professor Jong-Man Kim.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is in the use of the mechanically-sensitive polymer, polydiacetylene (PDA), in a potentially very powerful, novel application. By seeding live cells in RGD-functionalized 3D PDA scaffolds, researchers are attempting to directly observe and quantify traction force generation by cells in 3D based on color changes in the polymer. This highly interdisciplinary work combines chemical engineering and biology and promises to result in the development of a novel quantitative platform to study cell-matrix mechanics.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",
