The workshop builds on interests by NSF, Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), and other agencies in collaborative research in this rapidly developing area of research.  The workshop will explore the intellectual opportunities, educational and economically relevant impacts, and practical considerations needed for US-French collaboration to be successful.  The workshop will be attended by US and French researchers, and representatives from US and French funding organizations.  A report from the workshop will be made available at http://www.nsf.gov/crcns.",
