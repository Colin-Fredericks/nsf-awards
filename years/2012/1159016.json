 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project seeks to define and understand the concept of critical thinking in engineering, determine differences in how engineering students and engineering faculty view and instantiate critical thinking, and differentiate engineering's definition from those of other disciplines.  This work explores and will clarify foundational definitions within engineering education that are common across many degree programs. \r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project, if successful, will be to help faculty and curriculum designers in supporting the development of critical thinking in engineering degree programs.  Additionally the research technique that will be used may help engineering educators understand how different groups define and enact critical thinking.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by making investments that lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting existing fields.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.",

Much of the rhetoric regarding education and its reform revolves around teaching students to think and question critically.  Within engineering, although critical thinking does not appear on the list of ABET outcomes, many programs have adopted critical thinking as an ability which they wish to impart to their students.

Within the literature, there are few studies agreeing on the attributes of critical thinking, which is somewhat surprising considering its perceived importance.  The research study addressed three basic questions to establish a baseline for critical thinking in engineering:\n\nWhat are the expectations that engineering faculty have for critical thinking, and is this different from faculty in non-technical skills?\nHow is critical thinking enacted by engineering students, and is this different from students in non-technical fields?\nDo the ways in which students enact critical thinking match the expectations of faculty?\n\n\nA qualitative study that combined constructivist grounded theory to develop a new theory with thematic analysis based on existing theoretical frameworks was developed and conducted.  The use of emergent coding was important as many themes evolved from the interviews with faculty and students from within the college of engineering, and from faculty from literature and humanities.
