 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to enable more efficient and reliable operation of autonomous femtocell networks with agile spectrum access, autonomous interference control, as well as intelligent network self-organization and self-optimization. This project falls into four interacted thrusts: 1) Incorporate cognition into the femtocell networks to cognitively reuse the available spectrum sensed;  2) Develop distributed, dynamic and cooperative interference management schemes exploiting antenna techniques and based on sensed environmental conditions; 3) Investigate the scenarios and schemes that femtocells can be exploited to facilitate macrocell transmissions, and the potential gains in capacity, coverage and reliability; 4) Incorporate interference cancellation for data multicast, and develop techniques to support multiuser video streaming. The project also develops a testbed with open source programmable wireless platforms, for prototyping and evaluating the effectiveness of various techniques developed.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research has the potential to significantly increase the capacity and resilience of existing and future wireless networks. The agility and resilience of the system will also make it instrumental to support communications and applications that are important for national security and economy. The PIs will facilitate technology transfer through their industrial partners and industry affiliate programs. Complementary to the research agenda, the project will carry out a broad range of education and outreach activities, including integration of research findings into the courses, promoting underrepresented and undergraduate populations, and engaging with the K-12 schools to raise the level of student interests in pursuing advanced education and career in the areas of engineering and mathematics.",

The recent introduction of autonomous network concept presents as a paradigm shift from traditional cellular networks with planned deployment and centralized management to more autonomous, uncoordinated,  and intelligent rollouts of small base stations deployed by end users and overlaying wide area cellular networks. The aim of this project is to enable efficient and reliable operation of autonomous networks for significantly higher spectral efficiency and network capacity with agile spectrum access, autonomous interference control, as well as self-organization and self-optimization of the network. This is a collaborative  research project among State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook, Auburn University, and Lucent Technologies  Bell Laboratories.  The outcomes of our work is summarized as follows:\n\nDetermining optimal channle sensing order in multi-user cognitive radio networks.  We investigate the sensing order problem where multiple users  atempt to use the available spectrum.  We propose a novel metric that comprehensively consider the channel availability, transmission rate and collision probability, and exploit an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to establish the sensing order based on the metric to improve the sensing efficiency and transmission throughput.\nRobuts scheduling of sequential periodic sensing for cognitive radios.  To support better detect under-utilized spectrum and ensure the efficient monitoring of spectrum over time, we propose sequential periodic sensing of an in-band channel with on-going transmissions. We effectively adapt the sensing frequency and design efficient change and outlier detection schemes to facilitate short-term sensing adaptation to the variations in sensed data.\nExploiting transmission opportunities in both spectrum and spatial domain. We consider a network where each node is equipped with an array of cognitive radios, and mathematically model the opportunities and constraints with the objective of maximizing the weighted network throughput. We propose a centralized algorithm as our comparison benchmark, and a distributed algorithm to flexibly assign spectrum channel or spatial DoF exploiting the multiuser diversity, channel diversity and spatial diversity for a higher performance in a practical network. The results demonstrate that our algorithm is very effective and can significantly increase the network throughput while reducing the delay.\nIncrease of transmission efficiency to reduce the transmission bandwidth consumption. We propose to exploit CS at the transmitter side to reduce the redundancy of the data before transmission to conserve precious wireless bandwidth. We propose a set of mechanisms to enable compressive wireless data transmissions, and propose a comprehensive signal recovery algorithm to cope with the perturbations introduced by wireless channels. Transmission data reduction can complement existing efforts of improving wireless channel capacity to support the quick growth of wireless applications.\nSequential compressed spectrum sensing over wide spectrum band. We propose an integrated sequential wideband sensing framework which concurrently exploits sequential detection and compressed sensing (CS) techniques for more accurate and lower cost spectrum sensing. performance results demonstrate the significant advantages of our design in reducing the detection delay, increasing the detection accuracy, as well as reducing CS recovery overhead and compressive measurement requirements.\nInterference-aware cooperative communication in multi-radio multi-channel wireless networks. We concurrently exploit multi-radio and multi-channel technique and cooperative transmission technique to combat co-channel interference and improve the throughput of multi-hop wireless network. \nCooperative routing with relay assignment in multi-radio multi-hop wireless networks. We study a joint problem of multi-radio cooperative routing and relay assignment to maximize the minimum rate among a set of concurrent communication sessions.  Our performance results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the significant rate gains that can be achieved by incorporating cooperative communication in multi-radio multi-hop networks.\nDirectional beam alignment for millimeter wave cellular systems. We propose a comprehensive design for more efficient directional beam alignment in millimeter wave cellular networks.  Our proposed scheme selects only a fairly small number of TX and RX beam pairs to facilitate effective beam alignment. To avoid long and resource-consuming exhaustive search, our scheme not only takes advantage of the low rank characteristics of the channel to estimate the full channel information with a small number of measurements, but also further exploits the channel estimation from initial measurements to guide the selection of future beam pairs for more effective measurements later.
