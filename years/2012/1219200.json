 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) translate basic mental commands into computer-mediated actions.  BCIs allow the user to bypass the peripheral motor system and to interact with the world directly via brain activity.  These systems are being developed to aid users with motor deficits stemming from neurodegenerative disease, injury, or even environmental restrictions which make movement difficult or impossible.  One popular class of EEG-driven BCI systems is based on imagined movement.  In these systems the user interacts with a computer through motor imagery such as the imagination of hand vs. tongue movement.  But the ability of users to control such a BCI is very variable, and all the factors involved are not fully understood.  For example, EEG signals can change drastically from offline training to online use.  Unfortunately, drift in EEG can lead to loss of control of the BCI, which leads to user frustration and further drift of EEG signals from their training baselines.\r\n\r\nThe PI's goal in this project is to create a more robust BCI system by specifically addressing loss of control and system drift.  Her hypothesis is that explicitly training on a signal that incorporates a user's satisfaction and, more importantly, dissatisfaction with the current performance may result in a more natural interface, and thereby lead to a reduction in loss of control and improved system usability and performance.  The research will be carried out in three stages.  First, active and passive EEG signals of dissatisfaction and satisfaction will be analyzed in a simulated online setting.  Next, a real-time online system that recognizes dissatisfaction vs. satisfaction to control 1-D cursor movement will be constructed and system performance compared to that of a standard left/right motor imagery system.  Finally, the best working parts of the dissatisfaction/satisfaction system will be integrated with the more standard left/right system, to create a better hybrid system.  The (dis)satisfaction signals will be based on actively controlled motor imagery signals, interpreted emotion, and detection of error-like signals.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This project has the potential to vastly improve the robustness of EEG-based BCI systems, by responding to natural signals of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, by being resistant to drift, and by naturally taking advantage of frustration which is a common cause of loss of control.  By training the BCI to recognize frustration the PI expects to turn this typically negative trait into a positive.  The project will support and train an under-represented minority graduate student and a post-doc in this important interdisciplinary area, and it will create projects for under-represented REU participants as well as for high school students through the PI's partnerships with the NSF Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center (TDLC, where she is a member of the faculty governing and admissions committee for the REU program) and the Preuss School (a charter school for low income students with no college educated parent).  All software written for EEG signal processing and analysis, as well as data from the experiments, will be made available as add-ons to EEGLAB which is distributed by co-PI Makeig.",

Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a way of non-invasively measuring electrical activity from neurons in the brain as well as other electrical activity from the environment, muscles, and eye movements.  One popular form of EEG-based BCI is the motor imagery (MI) BCI where the user controls a cursor movement on a screen or other output device through imagining movement.  By imagining movement of different body parts, cursor movement can be commanded in different directions.  A common motor imagery paradigm is for the user to imagine right hand movements to move a cursor right and left hand movements to move a cursor left.  As the EEG signal is very noisy, the control is usually broken into multiple steps, with the cursor moving one step every second, to increase the overall accuracy of hitting a target on the right or left of the screen.\n\nOne problem with EEG is that it is a global measure of neuronal activity and thus reflects activity throughout the brain that may or may not be related to the task the user has been set.  For instance, frustration or excitement with the task reflect brain activity that may also be present in the EEG. The goal of this grant was to create a more robust BCI system by turning a signal that was previously considered \"noise\" into a useful signal to help infer the user's intent.  The signal of interest is the EEG response to individual cursor movements during the MI paradigm.  These cursor movements serve two purposes;  they track overall progress towards the targets, and each movement serves as a feedback signal to the user informing them of the computer's interpretation of their last motor imagery attempt.  We found that we could train the computer to determine from the user's EEG whether the cursor moved in the desired/\"good\" direction or the non-desired/\"bad\" direction with above chance probability.  In half the users, this signal was better classified than whether they were performing right or left motor imagery.  The information about the \"goodness\" of the cursor movements was contained in some of the same features of the EEG as the information about the motor imagery.  Previous MI BCIs ignored the issue of whether \"good\" or \"bad\" feedback was provided and considered any brain signal other than the motor imagery signal to be noise or simply looked for specific \"error\" signals, but by specifically learning to classify the \"goodness\" of cursor movement, and combining this information with the classified direction of motor imagery, we developed a method to obtain better accuracy in predicting the direction the user wanted the cursor to go.  Improvements varied across the users from no improvement (but no degradation) to 18% improvement in classification accuracy of individual seconds of motor imagery.\n\nThe project also studied and demonstrated the theoretical performance benefits of using an interactive (one that responds to the computer's feedback) control signal such as \"good movement\" and \"bad movement\" compared to a standard control signal that does not depend on the computer's feedback such as \"move left\" and \"move right\".  We also developed a modification to the most common spatial filtering algorithm for motor-imagery based brain-computer interfaces that performs more robust filtering in the presence of noise.\n\nIn the course of the work the performance of a real-time driver for a major EEG processing software (BCILAB) and a popular type of EEG hardware (Biosemi) was improved by the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience.  We also created a github repository for a firmware fix for OpenBCI, a low-cost open source brain-computer interface system, https://github.com/alxrsngrtn/OpenBCI_32 and LSL (Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience's Lab Streaming Layer) driver for OpenBCI, https://github.com/alxrsngrtn/OpenBCI-LSL The firmware fix provides timestamps when EEG samples are recorded.
