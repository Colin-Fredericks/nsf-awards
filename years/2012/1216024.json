 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extensive work over the last decade, done within theoretical computer science, has provided deep insights into the computability of market equilibria for various market models and utility functions, using the powerful tools of the modern theories of algorithmic design and algorithmic complexity. This follows up on a century-long work, within mathematical economics, on obtaining a mechanism that converges to equilibrium -- a goal that had to be eventually abandoned due to certain negative results on efficient computability of the equilibrium. The work in TCS was motivated in part by applications to markets on the Internet. \r\n \r\nThe current project will extend this work along several exciting directions. Recent work of the lead Principle Investigator (PI) on using complementary pivot algorithms, for obtaining usable algorithms for certain market models that are unlikely to have efficient algorithms in the usual sense of polynomial worst-case running time, opens up the possibility of extending this approach to broader classes of markets, in particular, markets with production.  A major new challenge is to address dynamically evolving markets. \r\n \r\nIn terms of applications of markets, the team brings to this project a wealth of experience on electricity markets, gained from work done with researchers in computer science and control dynamics. The PIs plan on bringing their expertise in mechanism design to bear on the problems of integrating renewable energy sources into the smart grid and providing better approaches to the pricing and allocation of ancillary services to guarantee reliability and stability. Another new challenge is to extend general equilibrium theory, the undisputed crown jewel of mathematical economics, to the digital economy. The traditional notion of equilibrium is not applicable to digital goods -- once produced, an unbounded number of copies of such goods are available. The digital realm is very rich and is increasingly occupying a larger share of our economy. It is imperative, therefore, to achieve the same depth of understanding of pricing for digital goods as was obtained for conventional goods. \r\n \r\nThis project will provide algorithms and insights into the computational aspects of markets, including electricity markets and transactions on the Internet, thereby helping make their operation more efficient. Hence, it is expected to contribute to advances in science and engineering, as well as to promote economic prosperity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMajor Activities:\n\nMy main effort was focused on understanding the interaction effects between the economics, control, and computation of distribution networks (that part of the electricity grid that serves the final customers). \n\nSpecific Objectives:\n\nThe work is theoretical and integrative  in nature.  There is much work by control theorists that ignores the economics and behavior of customers.  There is much work by economists that ignores the control realities of the network system.  My objective is to integrate the work of the two disciplines and to find a grid management and pricing policy that maximizes economic efficiency (social surplus) and stabilizes control.\n\nSignificant Results:\n\nTne main result found in the first year of the study was the identification of the potential instability of an electricity pricing policy known as \"prices to devices\".  That policy sends the current spot market price of power to the thermostats of customers which then adjust in response.  In equilibrium it is easy to show that this leads customers and generators to produce and consume at economically efficient levels.  But this ignores the dynamics of the control structure of the electricity grid.  When the economics and control are analyzed simultaneously, a basic instability arises which is increasing in the number of customers.\n\nKey outcomes or Other achievements:\n\ncompleted and presented\n\n. \"Residential Demand Response Program Design: Engineering and Economic Perspectives\"with Johanna L. Mathieu, Tobias and  Goran Andersson,  10th European Energy Market Conference, EEM13, in Stockholm, Sweden, May 28-30 2013.\n\n \n\nWe investigated the control and pricing of retail electricity distribution networks confronted by a significant increase in the supply of electricity from renewable resources such as wind and solar. \n\n \n\nIntellectual Impact We identified a potential instability that can arise from a policy of \"prices to devices\" which unintentionally encourages simultaneous responses to price changes that can generate unstable control cycles.  We then discovered a method to integrate Vol-Var control of the distribution network with pricing that (a) reduces the instability, (b) produces a significant increase in the efficiency of the system (the profits of the network operator and the net benefits to consumers increase), and (c) is computationally feasible. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts The approach we discovered has the potential to provide a significant decrease in electricity costs as the integration of renewables proceeds. With the help of data from Southern Cal Edison, we were able to simulate the impact of the integrated control on a specific distribution network with significant results.  We reduced energy costs by about 15%-25%.  The ability to integrate demand response accounted for about 70% of this.  System welfare (profits plus consumer net benefits) increased by 15-18%.  Volatility was virtually the same with most of the gain coming through reduction in peak use. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/16/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John O Ledyard"
