This emission is predicted to be bright enough to be detected by the newly commissioned LWA1 (Long Wavelength Array) radio telescope, and thus the detections (or upper limits) will be used to test planetary magnetospheric physics models.  As part of the project, the PIs will train undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher in instrumentation, computational expertise and data reduction and analysis techniques.  They will also make the software spectrometer available to other scientists in the community.",
