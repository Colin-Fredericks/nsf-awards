 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rutgers Film Bureau in collaboration with the scientists of the LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) project at Palmer will produce a multi-platform documentary project, Antarctic Quest: Racing to Understand a Changing Ocean.  This Connecting Researchers to Public Audiences proposal will focus on the scientists who are studying ocean physics, chemistry, biology, and ecology in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), which is the fastest winter warming location on earth.  The aim of the project is to promote scientific knowledge about the world's oceans and climate change, inspire interest in scientific careers, as well as train a cadre of next generation film students in the craft of science documentary filmmaking.\r\n\r\nThe project will articulate the research of the Palmer LTER's quest to understand the impact of climate change on the marine ecosystems of the WAP, while involving university students in the filmmaking process.  Deliverables include an hour television documentary intended for PBS television broadcast, an online \"Antarctic Quest community\" created through interactive and interconnected social media, three five-minute educational videos produced for the PBS Learning Media website, and a Digital Media Library to assist Earth science educators.  The production team will employ a diverse group of twenty film students from Rutgers University to be involved in the many phases and components of the project.  \r\n\r\nThe project is designed to advance the public's environmental literacy.  The project will raise awareness of the changes being observed in the world's oceans by illustrating how small changes in the physical conditions in the WAP can have profound impact on marine ecosystems and potentially the entire ocean system.  The project will also highlight the significance of innovative new technologies that are revolutionizing research methods as well document the importance of scientific collaboration to understand a complex interdisciplinary problem and the challenges of working in extreme environments.  The summative evaluation of the project will assess the effectiveness of the project in meeting its educational goals.  By communicating significant scientific research to the public while training a cohort of next generation of science documentary filmmakers, the project will also contribute to capacity-building in the Informal Science Education field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project provided the opportunity for two filmakers to join the Palmer LTER expedition to the West Antarctic Peninsula.  During the expedition the film makers collected footage of the scientists and crew collecting data across the Peninsula which has been experiencing rapid change over the last fifty years.  This footage was edited by Art students to create a student made feature length documentary that provides an overview of the affects of a changing climate on the marine ecosystems while also showing how scientists collect ocean data.  The film also provides a snapshot into the scientists and their passion for the work.  The film was played throughout the country in independent theatres, made available through ITunes and Netflix, and was broadcast nationally through Participant Media.  It was admitted to 19 film festivals and was an award winner in 9 of those festivals.  Beyong the film, this project focused on bridging the gap between the Arts and GeoSciences.  The scientists conducted lectures in the Art School on the science of climate change and oceanography.  These lectures provided the foundation for the Art students to create a science relevant and accurate film.  For the scientists, they benefitted from having creative young artists translate their work to engage the wider community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/12/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Oscar Schofield"
