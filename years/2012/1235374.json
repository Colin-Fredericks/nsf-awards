 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing numbers of jurisdictions participating in hazard mitigation planning activities has not guaranteed the implementation of mitigation strategies and practices at the local level. While several recent studies suggest a disconnection between mitigation planning and practice, little is known about the actual adoption and usage of mitigation practice by local jurisdictions. The objective of this study is to empirically investigate mitigation policy practices at the local level.  The study specifically seeks to: a) Examine the adoption and the implementation of broad-based hazard mitigation policies that can enhance hazard mitigation within local jurisdictions (counties and municipalities) along the Atlantic and Gulf coastal; b) Examine the influence of local capacity and commitment in the adoption and extent of hazard mitigation regulations, policies, and strategies; and c) Focus on the broader socio-political ecology for planning practice by examining the consequences of factors on various jurisdicational mitigation practices and profiles.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide an assessment of the effectiveness of federal policy designed to improve mitigation, as well as direction for improving such policies through the assessment of factors related to implementation, including the consistency of actions at different jurisdictional levels, as well as the commitment and capacity of local jurisdictions to act.  Broad dissemination to both academic and practitioner audiences through the development of a website and publication of best mitigation practices and model ordinances promises the return of the findings to the audiences who may best benefit from them. The findings of this research will have a direct bearing on the content of educational activities, directly influencing the broader planning community.",

This study had two primary objectives. The first objective was to examine the adoption and the implementation of a broad spectrum of hazard mitigation policies, paying primary attention to land use, development regulations, and other practices that can enhance disaster resilience. The second objective was to model factors potentially influencing adoption and implementation. These factors include a jurisdiction&rsquo;s capacity, commitment, legal authority/discretion, hazard vulnerability/risk, and socio-demographic and economic profiles. Figure 1 offers a simple conceptual model for thinking about the factors that may influence the adoption and implementation of hazard mitigation policies at the local level.</p>\n<p>To accomplish these dual objectives the major activities undertaken by this project focused on extensive primary and secondary data collection and processing:</p>\n<p><em>Primary data collection:</em> Primary data collection activities focused on conducting a survey of jurisdictions regarding the adoption and the implementation of hazard mitigation policies and practices that can enhance disaster resilience. The target units of analysis were all jurisdictions located in NOAA defined coastal counties along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts. Figure 2 identifies our target area. An internet survey methodology was employed to collect primary data from key jurisdictional informants. The survey instrument was developed based on previous research and with input from practitioners and local officials. A critical task in undertaking the survey was identifying key informants in each jurisdiction. Contact was made and key informants identified in 1,923 jurisdictions. Data was obtained from 1,172 jurisdictions yielding a response rate of 61.0%.</p>\n<p><em>Secondary data collection:</em> A great variety of secondary data were gathered and processed to capture additional jurisdictional characteristics from US Census sources such as the 2010 decennial census, the American Community Survey (ACS) five-year data, and data on local governmental finances and employment. Extraordinary efforts were also undertaken to gather, process, and generate natural hazards data assessing jurisdictional hazard vulnerability and risk related to inland flooding, hurricane surge, and wind in a more valid manner. Data sources include: flood data from FEMA&rsquo;s National Flood Insurance Program, surge data from NOAA, and wind hazard data from ASCE 7. To more accurately reflect populations at risk, approximately 2.1 million census blocks throughout the target area were processed with improved hazard data to determine the proportion of each block&rsquo;s area falling into hazard zones. On the basis of this process, populations in general and, in particular, by socio-economic or demographic characteristics, falling in specific hazard zones were more accurately enumerated.</p>\n<p>The primary and secondary datasets generated by this research were merged to create a <em>Coastal Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Policy Dataset</em> that is currently being more fully analyzed.
