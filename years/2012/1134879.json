 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed research will catalyze a long-term collaboration between U.S. and South Korean earth system scientists. It builds upon utilizing the Korean Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) newly launched icebreaker R/V Araon. KOPRI has outfitted the R/V Araon with selected research grade instruments to study atmospheric CO, NO/NO2, O3, CO2, Hg (g), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) along with chemical, physical and biological oceanographic parameters. The objectives include to\r\n1. Visit and examine the R/V Araon for its suitability for ocean-atmosphere research applications.\r\n2. Install and operate a ship-borne turbulence and motion correction flux system and chemical analyzers on the R/V Araon jackstaff tower and deck railing to survey and evaluate the suitability of the vessel for ship-borne research.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This project will develop a long-term collaboration between Korean and US scientists in utilizing one of the world's technologically most advanced ice breakers and research vessels, the R/V Araon. This effort is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together scientists with expertise in micrometeorology, biogeochemistry, atmospheric chemistry, oceanography, and Polar Regions. U.S. scientists will gain access to a unique observational research platform that will conduct yearly pole-to-pole cruises in the foreseeable future. Consequently, besides providing unique opportunities for oceanic and atmospheric research, this program will be a rare opportunity to observe changes in global chemical climate over the remote ocean and to quantify the processes controlling these changes. These activities are also expected to catalyze collaboration in other disciplines such as biology, marine geology and geophysics, cartography, and physical and chemical oceanography.",
