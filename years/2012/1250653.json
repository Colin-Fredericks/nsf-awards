The LittleFe cluster computers requested as part of this proposal are widely known and used in the HPC education community, thanks to an active outreach effort at past SC conferences and other venues. Curriculum developed at Pacific for the LittleFe clusters can be easily used by other institutions, greatly facilitating the spread of new educational innovations. The travel support requested for the all-female student team will enable future participation in the student cluster competition. This activity enables teaching of key HPC skills (such as cluster architecture, system administrative, and scientific computing) in a competitive learning environment.",
