The Science of Team Science is a new interdisciplinary field that empirically examines the processes by which these collaborations organize, communicate, and conduct research to achieve scientific breakthroughs that would otherwise not be attainable.  The National Research Council, via its Board on Behavioral, Cognitive and Sensory Sciences, will conduct a consensus study and appoint a committee of experts to assemble, synthesize, and communicate important findings from the Science of Team Science and related fields such as social psychology, science policy, organizational/business management, human resource development, organizational studies, social cognition, and industrial/organizational psychology.  The project will include two public workshops to gather information on team dynamics, team management, and institutional structures and policies that affect large and small science teams. The committee's final report will provide conclusions and recommendations to strengthen the efficiency and productivity of science teams in order to build their capacity for major scientific and technological advances. The report will both contribute to the advancement of research on science teams and inform those who conduct, fund, and manage interdisciplinary research collaborations in research universities, federal agencies and industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducted a study to explore the rapidly-growing research literatures emerging from the Science of Team Science and related fields.  The Science of Team Science is a new interdisciplinary field that empirically examines the processes by which large and small scientific teams, research centers, and institutes organize, communicate, and conduct research.  It is concerned with understanding and managing circumstances that facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of collaborative research, including translational research.\n\nThe Academies convened an expert committee composed of social scientists with expertise in teams, organizations and science policy, together with natural scientists who serve as leaders of science teams.  The committee reviewed, analyzed, and synthesized published research and current case studies to more clearly define team science, reach conclusions, and offer recommendations for improved effectiveness.  The intellectual merit of the project is represented in the final committee report, Enhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science (National Academies Press, 2015).  This report, which has been downloaded over 14,000 times since its release in April, 2015, provides useful information to scientists collaborating on team research projects, funders and managers of such teams and researchers engaged in the Science of Team Science.  The report supplies sorely-needed, research-based guidance to enhance the effectiveness of science teams and larger groups. \n\n \n\nAs discussed in the report, to address the growing complexity of societal and global challenges, research is increasingly conducted by interdisciplinary science teams, research centers, and institutes. For example one NSF-funded Science and Technology Center focuses on reducing the power consumption of electronic systems that undergird popular information technologies, and another promotes sustainable management of water resources in semiarid and arid regions.\n\n The broader impact of the study project will be to increase the efficiency and productivity of these and other national and international science teams and larger groups by improving their effectiveness in organizing, communicating, and conducting research.  The study illuminates the conditions that support effective team dynamics and collaborative processes, contributing to improved efficiency and productivity of science teams.  Thus, it builds the capacity of team science to achieve major scientific and technological, advances that positively impact society.\n\n \n\nThe committee found that team science is growing rapidly, but working collaboratively can create challenges that prevent teams and larger groups from achieving their scientific goals. However, a large body of research on teams outside of science has identified approaches to enhancing effectiveness that can be translated and applied to increase the effectiveness of science teams and larger groups.  Thus, the committee offered recommendations to improve three key dimensions of science teams and larger groups&mdash;composition, professional development (training), and leadership.  In addition, based on its review of research on organizational management, science policy, and higher education management, the committee recommended strategies to enhance the effectiveness of large, geographically distributed science teams and groups and approaches to increase research universities\u00c6 support for scientists working in teams.   All conclusions and recommendations can be found in the final report at: http://www.nap.edu/catalog/19007/enhancing-the-effectiveness-of-team-science\n\n \n\nSince the report was released in April, 2015, it has been widely read.  By December, 2015, it had been downloaded over 14,000 times, making it #48 in downloads among 6,100 Academies reports and #7 in downloads among 477 reports from the Academies Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education. \n..."
