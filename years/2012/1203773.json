 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the hypothesis that as the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) retreats, increased exposure and weathering will alter fluxes of radiogenic isotopes to the oceans. Radiogenic strontium (Sr) and lead (Pb) isotopes, and non\u00adradiogenic neodymium (Nd) are preferentially leached during initial weathering of fresh bedrock and sediments in glacial terrains. With increased duration and intensity of weathering, isotopic compositions of runoff approach parent rock values. Therefore, magnitudes of offsets between Sr, Nd and Pb isotope values of water and bedrock provide information about the extent of weathering. Specific hypotheses to be tested are (1) more radiogenic Sr and Pb and less radiogenic Nd discharge in water originating from the GrIS than from deglaciated watersheds without connections to the ice sheet, (2) values of isotope ratios depend on the exposure age of the deglaciated watersheds and the intensity of weathering in each environment, and (3) the total flux of radiogenic isotopes from continental glaciers depends on the relative aerial extents of glaciated and deglaciated watersheds. These hypotheses will be tested in western Greenland near Kangerlussuaq, where retreat of the GrIS since the Last Glacial Maximum has exposed an approximately 175 km wide strip of land. Water, sediment, and moraine material will be sampled from subglacial streams discharging from the outlet portals of the Russell and Leverett Glaciers, in the proglacial watershed of the Watson River, and in four deglaciated watersheds, not connected to the GrIS that drain moraines ranging in age from about 600 to 18,000 years. Water samples will be measured for major and trace element concentrations to model potential mineral dissolution and contributions to isotope fluxes, and for Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope ratios to assess their fluxes from subglacial, proglacial, and deglaciated watersheds. This work will link terrestrial weathering products in a continental glacier setting to oceanic fluxes of radiogenic isotopes, thereby improving the ability to interpret marine records. The work is important because of its location near the formation regions of North Atlantic Deep Water and it should contribute to planning for a proposed ocean drilling expedition off Greenland. The work will impact human resources through incorporation of 4 students from undergraduate to Ph.D. level, all of whom will participate in field work and will work collaboratively to complete laboratory and data analyses. Results of the work will be used in several graduate and undergraduate courses and will be presented at national and international scientific meetings and through publications. Outreach will include lectures at local schools, as invited speakers at colleges and universities, and in the annual open house at the Florida Museum of Natural History.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nContinental ice sheets have advanced and retreated approximately every 100,000 years over the past few million years.  This process grinds the underlying bedrock to create fine grained material that is then partially or completely dissolved when it comes into contact with water in a process referred to as weathering.  The water that drives weathering can come from melting of the ice sheet, as well as from precipitation that runs off exposed landscapes.  Weathering includes a variety of chemical reactions that alter the chemical composition of the stream water, which ultimately affects the chemical composition of seawater as streams flow to the ocean.  The chemistry of the streams is likely to depend on whether the water originates from the ice sheets themselves or originates from annual precipitation that flows over terrains that have exposed for many thousands of years after the ice sheet retreated farther inland.  This project aims to determine how and why the chemical compositions of water draining the ice sheet differs from water draining areas that are no longer connected the ice sheet.  The study focuses on an approximately 170 km region of western Greenland that contains streams draining both ice sheet meltwater and annual precipitation (Fig. 1).\n\nResults of our work show that weathering and dissolution of minerals in streams draining the ice sheet occurs in large outwash plains composed of sediment ground up by the ice sheet. Weathering occurs as water flows from the main stream channel into the pore spaces between grains in the stream bed.  Enough water exchanges between the stream channel and the stream bed that weathering in this environment may represent a major contribution to the stream water, and thus seawater, chemistry.  The rate and extent of weathering relates to the amount of organic carbon dissolved in the stream water.  In streams disconnected from the ice sheet, the amount of organic carbon and its reactivity depends on the amount of rainfall.  This dependence results from the amount of time the organic carbon remains in the streams; specifically, in regions with high amounts of precipitation, the organic carbon is rapidly flushed from the system, but where the region is arid, the organic carbon remains in the streams for longer periods of time.  Given more time, solar radiation breaks down the organic carbon and reduces its reactivity.  Organic carbon is also important for weathering reactions because it can produce carbonic acid, one of two acids that cause minerals to dissolve.  The other acid is sulfuric acid that originates from oxidation of sulfide minerals such as pyrite.  Dissolution caused by carbonic acid removes CO2 from the atmosphere, but dissolution of carbonate minerals by sulfuric acid produces CO2 that can degas from the stream water to the atmosphere.  Our work demonstrates that in western Greenland the acid causing weathering switches from predominately carbonic acid near the ice sheet in sediments that have been recently ground to small grain size, to predominately sulfuric acid in areas with older sediments that have been exposed to weathering for a period of time.  This shift alters the amount of CO2 either produced or consumed in weathering reaction with increased exposure age of the sediment.\n\nMelting of continental ice sheets is important to sea level rise.  Consequently, much work has focused on the chemical composition of the large volume of water draining from ice sheets.  Our work, however, shows that water draining from exposed areas that have become disconnected from the ice sheet are equally important in control of seawater chemistry.  Thus, as ice sheets grow and retreat, understanding of the reactions in these two types of regions will be important for evaluating how seawater and atmospheric compositions have changed in the past as well as for making predictions of how they may change in the future as extant ice sheets continue to melt.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/11/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan B Martin"
