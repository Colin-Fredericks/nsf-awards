 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation project from Western New England University focuses on an ultrasonic acoustophoretic separation technology platform that will accomplish efficient separation technologies for multi-component liquid streams that eliminate waste, reduce required energy, and promote a sustainable environment.  This platform provides an innovative solution that consists of a large volume flow rate acoustophoretic phase separator based on ultrasonic standing waves.  Acoustophoresis is a low-power, no-pressure-drop, no-clog, solid-state approach to particle removal from fluid suspensions and is used to achieve separations typically performed with porous filters, but with none of the disadvantages of porous filters.  The acoustic resonator is designed to create a high intensity three-dimensional ultrasonic standing wave resulting in an acoustic radiation force larger than the combined effects of fluid drag and buoyancy and is therefore able to trap and hold stationary, the suspended phase. The novelty is in the ability to create ultrasonic standing wave fields that can trap particles in flow fields with linear velocities in excess of 1 cm.  High frequency (MHz), high-power, and high-efficiency ultrasonic drivers based on solid state switching mode amplifiers will be designed and developed. An embedded control solution using a Digital Signal Processor and microcontroller will be implemented to maintain resonance operation and control power delivery and acoustic trapping force. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are improved, green, and sustainable separation technology with applications such as environmental oil clean-up, bio-fuels production, and biomedical applications such as blood-lipid separation.  The partners on project team are eager to develop this technology and create green jobs to provide a nascent manufacturing base in Western Massachusetts, a region devastated by a significant decline in its manufacturing base. The project brings together a unique team with proven innovators from several small companies, engineering faculty from across several disciplines, three graduate students, and eleven undergraduate engineering students. Efforts are being undertaken to include underrepresented minorities in the REU and MS programs.\r\n \r\nPartners at the inception of the project are Western New England College, as the lead institution, with collaborators from the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Departments in the College of Engineering, and three knowledge-enhancing small business partners: FloDesign Sonics Inc. (Wilbraham, Massachusetts), UTX Inc. (Holmes, New York), and FloDesign Inc. (Wilbraham, Massachusetts). An additional partner is the University of Southern Maine.",

A total of twenty senior capstone design projects for undergraduate engineering students were sponsored and supervised.  The NSF BIC award directly funded seventeen Research Experiences for Undergraduates.  The award provided for tuition for four graduate students to successfully finish a Master of Science in Engineering degree.  Three new graduate courses in acoustics were developed and taught. \n\n One of the knowledge enhancing partners, FloDesign Sonics, has successfully commercialized the acoustic separation platform technology.  The funding of this award has enabled FloDesign Sonics to accelerate the commercial development and provide jobs to twenty five people.

Through other funding, one of the KEP partners, FloDesign Sonics, has been able to reach out to several community college students in the area and been able to offer summer internship opportunities to them.  \n\nIn summary, the NSF BIC grant has been very productive and successful.  It has accelerated the research and development of the acoustic separation platform through interactions of the university researchers and the knowledge enhancing partners.  The interactions have led to the identification of several promising new markets and customers, which in turn have led to a re-evaluation of the platform.  The NSF BIC has affected a wide community of faculty researchers, industry innovators and entrepreneurs, and undergraduate and graduate students.  \n\nThe image shows a photo of emulsified oil droplets trapped in an acoustic standing wave on the left, and a prediction of the ..."
