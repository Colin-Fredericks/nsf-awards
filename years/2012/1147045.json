 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flower maturation is critical for plant reproduction because it ensures coordinated maturation of female and male reproductive organs as well as floral display that attracts pollinators. The Arabidopsis transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 6 (ARF6) and ARF8 regulate these complex processes by promoting petal expansion, male and female organ maturation and other processes.  This project will identify floral genes directly regulated by ARF6 and ARF8, determine their effects on chromatin modifications that influence gene expression, and identify other transcription factors that act together with ARF6 and ARF8. By understanding the functions of ARF6 and ARF8 in flower maturation the project will provide general insights into regulation of coordinated developmental processes.  The research may also inform strategies to optimize seed or fruit production in the face of declining pollinator populations.  The project will provide scientific training for postdoctoral fellows and students and will produce an interactive 30-minute multimedia presentation for schoolchildren and the general public. Produced in collaboration with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center at the University of North Carolina, this presentation will educate the public about genetics and flower function and will be presented daily in the summer months. The project will generate extensive genome binding and gene expression data that will be published and deposited in the public NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database.  Plant materials generated in the project will be deposited in the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            To reproduce, plants need to control the timing and extent of petal and stamen growth, pollen release from anthers, and pistil competence to accept pollen.  In the model plant Arabidopsis, two transcription factors called ARF6 and ARF8 act together to control and coordinate these aspects of flower maturation.  Without these factors, flowers remain as closed buds and are infertile (see Figure).  ARF6 and ARF8 are also required for proper stem elongation, both in adults and seedlings.  This project was to identify genes that these factors control, so as to understand both how these events are coordinated, and the various processes that contribute to successful reproduction. \n\n \n\n            To identify ARF6 and ARF8 regulatory targets, mRNA was sequenced from developing stamens (male flower organs) or gynoecia (female flower organs) with either decreased or increased ARF6/ARF8 activity.  This resulted in a list of several hundred candidate target genes.  Locations in the genome bound by ARF8 were also sequenced, but this dataset was found to be unreliable.  Therefore the RNA-Seq data was considered a more relevant source of likely target genes. \n\n \n\n            Functions of several selected candidate target genes were analyzed by genetic means.  Among these, a clade of five closely related ABCG transporters were found to be required to make extracellular barriers in roots, seed coats, and pollen.  In roots and seed coats, these transporters contribute to synthesis of an effective suberin barrier.  Suberin is a polymer that forms a seal to protect against water loss or pathogen attack, and mutant plants lacking combinations of these transporters had roots and seed coats that were more permeable to water or salts.  These mutant plants also had few lateral roots and precocious thickening in primary roots, suggesting that the plants may have adjusted their root growth to compensate for the defective barrier.  In pollen, two of the transporters contribute to synthesis of an intact pollen wall, and mutant pollen shriveled at the time of anther desiccation.  These pollen phenotypes reveal that the genes are expressed in maturing flowers in order to ensure that viable pollen is produced.  These results suggest that these transporters export common or related precursors that are incorporated into both suberin and pollen wall extracellular barriers.  Chemical analyses of suberin and of root wax from the mutant suggest that the transported substrates may be alkylhydroxycinnamate esters. \n\n \n\n            ARF6 and ARF8 also contribute to seedling growth, together with another member of the same protein family, NPH4/ARF7.  Experiments with plants deficient in different combinations of these factors revealed that all three together are required for growth of the seedling stem (hypocotyl) in response to the hormone auxin.  Seedlings lacking all three remain short under most growth conditions, but can still respond to growth-promoting hormones other than auxin.  These ARF proteins thus collectively have a major role in growth in both adult (flower) and juvenile tissues, and future work may reveal whether they regulate the same target genes in both contexts.  Interestingly, partial loss of these factors had the opposite effect, leading to increased hypocotyl growth under some conditions.  This is likely due to decreased negative feedback regulation in the plants with partial ARF deficiency. \n\n \n\n            Under this grant, one postdoctoral researcher and several undergraduates were trained in research techniques.  In addition, a public show on pollination was presented in summers at the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center on the UNC campus.  Aspects of the work were also presented at the annual UNC Science Expo and in local schools. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason W Reed"
