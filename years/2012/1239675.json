The students will be chosen based on a open competition and preference will be given to students who don't have any existing support or belong to underrepresented groups",

Consequently, an important piece of training to be a scientist is participation in  scientific meetings.  This participation can take place in a variety of ways that include presentation if papers, presentation of posters, participation as part of the audience, taking notes of lectures, and interaction one on one or in small groups with other scientists. \n\nThis project was concerned with enabling PhD students, as part of their training, to participate and engage in the most important annual conference dedicated to the performance evaluation of computer systems and communication networks.  This international conference, the joint SIGMETRICS/ Performance conference was sponsored by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) and the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP), the two professional societies dedicated to computer science, and held in London, UK on June 11-15, 2012.

The selection of these students was done by a committee based on a careful assessment of the studnets' potential to benefit from attending this meeting.   In addition to attending the conference, which included several activities direccted to students, such as a student poster session, the awardees were asked to act as scribes during the technical sessions.  The outcome of this scribing process was a summary of each technical paper and lecture along with the questions and discussion that followed each paper.  These summaries have been compiled into a single document that describes the technical program and has been made available to the scientific community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donald F Towsley"
