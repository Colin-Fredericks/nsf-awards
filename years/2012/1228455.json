This meeting, expected to attract 500 scientists from around the world, will bring together junior and senior researchers to discuss the latest findings in C. elegans development, cell biology and gene expression studies. The C. elegans Topic Meetings, held every two years at diverse locations, are smaller meetings that encourage frequent interactions between meeting attendees through short oral presentations, long poster sessions, workshops and shared meals. An Organizing Committee with a breadth of experience and background will select the best talks from submitted Abstracts with particular attention to highlight the work of graduate students and postdocs and to keep the speaker list diverse. Students and postdoctoral fellows, and persons underrepresented in science will be encouraged to present their research at this meeting to promote their scientific and career development. This meeting will include seven thematic sessions. Each will begin with a Keynote Address from a leading C. elegans researcher, including one Nobel Laureate, who will place their work in historical context for the benefit of new researchers in the field and to highlight the interconnections between different subfields of biology that have led to the growth of research in C. elegans development, cell biology and gene expression\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis meeting will promote excellent science and will support the career development of younger scientists. The findings from the meeting will be shared with the public through the posting of meeting Abstracts and of data collections introduced at the meeting via WormBase (www.wormbase.org), a well-curated web site that supports research in C. elegans. Support from the NSF will allow scientists in the U.S. to send their junior trainees to the meeting including undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as lab members with disabilities and/or persons underrepresented in science, who may otherwise not be able to attend this meeting. Of the four meeting organizers three are women, including two underrepresented in science. The Organizing Committee includes men and women from around the world, with high representation by junior faculty.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe C. elegans Development, Cell Biology and Gene Expression Meeting, held on June 7-10, 2012 in Madison, Wisconsin, brought together over 300 C. elegans researchers from around the world, including North and South America, Europe and Asia.   The speakers included Nobel Laureate Craig Mello, the discoverer of the PAR proteins, Ken Kemphues, and other junior and senior scientists who came together to share recent discoveries in developmental, cell biology and gene expression. \n\n \n\nScientists using the soil nematode, C. elegans, a simple round worm, have made numerous basic science discoveries that give us fundamental  insights into animal biology and human biology.  Six Nobel Prizes in the past twelve years have been awarded to C. elegans researchers.  C. elegans scientists have a tradition of sharing reagents and ideas, and scientific meetings facilitate this process.  However, reduced federal funding for research has strongly affected attendance at scientific meetings, especially for scientists at the beginning of their careers.\n\n \n\nThis Conference Travel Grant from the NSF supported the attendance of 20 young scientists at this meeting.  The funds supported part of the registration costs for 11 junior faculty who helped organize the meeting as part of the Organizing Committee.  In addition, 9 young scientists were selected for travel funds. They represented scientists at beginning stages of their careers including four (4) undergraduate students, one Masters\u00c6 student, one doctoral graduate student and two postdoctoral fellows.   Three of the 9 recipients belonged to populations underrepresented in science, including one first generation college student and researchers from various ethnic groups.  These young scientists, who would otherwise have not been able to attend this meeting, were able to present their work through posters and oral presentations.\n\n \n\nThe conference web site can be found at: http://www.union.wisc.edu/celegans/index2012.html\n\n \n\nThis site includes the entire Conference Program, and the Abstracts of all of the scientific presentations.\n\n \n\nConference Abstracts can also be viewed through the wormbase web site, a public web site funded by the United States and Brittish governments, to support the exchange of scientific ideas:\n\n \n\nwww.wormbase.org/\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/07/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Martha C Soto"
