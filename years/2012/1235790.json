 "awd_abstract_narration": "1235790\r\nTafti\r\n\r\nCardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the number one causes of death in the world. Extensive research has shown that arterial wall mechanics and fluid dynamics play an important role in CVD mediation. As the heart beats, the coronary arteries (CA), which are attached to the pericardial surface or penetrate the myocardial wall, also experience substantial motion. This motion is large scale and three dimensional in nature, with local changes in curvature and torsion of the vessel. The effect of this motion on the fluid dynamics of blood flow is further complicated by variations in arterial wall stiffness resulting from plaque formation (atherosclerosis) or the placement of stents. The research is driven by the hypothesis that in CA flows, the large scale motions due to the motion of the myocardium along with local variations or discontinuities of the vessel stiffness lead to non-physiological flow patterns and abnormal wall shear stresses triggering atherosclerosis.  In order to tackle the scientific and engineering challenges imposed, we will use state-of-art highly-resolved computations to create a unique research framework that will significantly augment our understanding of these complex flow systems.  Using computational modeling of fully resolved fluid-structure-interaction (FSI), the computations will tackle with unprecedented fidelity the unsteady coupled fluid structure interactions with applied motion of the myocardium and the arterial flow characteristics that have challenged researchers in the past. Resolving the physical mechanisms of FSI in flexible vessels with anisotropic compliance under the influence of the myocardial motion as experienced in coronary arteries will lead to new understanding of transport processes in physiological systems. The research grant will train one graduate student and provide research experience to a number of undergraduate students. A number of initiatives will be undertaken to involve women and minorities in research and education, and to foster research partnerships with medical institutions. The proposed research will contribute towards better diagnosis of vascular disease and will have broad ranging implications on the management of cardio-vascular disease with the potential of saving millions of lives. It will provide the foundation needed for analyzing and improving vascular implants as well as enable the development of new and improved treatments and devices.",
