 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemical characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are expected to be modified by an array of biogeochemical processes (sources, sinks, transformations) along a salinity gradient such as the river-estuary-ocean system. To quantify such changes in the quality and quantity of DOM, scientists have relied upon methods of isolation such as solid-phase extractions (SPE) and ultrafiltration (UF), for which yields of DOM typically decline substantially along the salinity gradient. Observed changes in the chemistry of isolated samples of DOM along a salinity gradient are the integrated result of biogeochemical processing and salinity-dependent fractionation of DOM as the retention characteristics of individual compounds are modified by increased salinity. Most prior work has interpreted measured compositional changes solely in terms of biogeochemistry. \r\n\r\nIn this project, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology will conduct laboratory experiments to optimize a coupled reverse osmosis/electrodialysis (RO/ED) method to maximize the yield of DOM and minimize co-concentration of inorganic solutes. Field experiments along the full salinity gradients of the Satilla and Altamaha rivers in southeast Georgia will provide feedback to the design and optimization of the modified RO/ED method. High-quality, low-ash samples of DOM will be collected across a range of salinities and characterized chemically and spectroscopically (elemental analyses (CHONS), acid-base titrations, 13C NMR and FTICR spectrometry). The goals of the proposed research are: (1) to extend the range of water chemistries over which the RO/ED method can be applied, (2) to develop new capabilities for removing residual inorganic materials to obtain low-ash samples of marine DOM, and (3) to isolate DOM in high yield along several complete river-estuary-ocean salinity gradients and to test the hypothesis that DOM is not significantly fractionated by the RO/ED isolation method.. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The project will provide financial support for the doctoral research of one graduate student. Knowledge gained during the project will be shared formally through publications in the peer-reviewed literature and presentations at national and international meetings and directly with current collaborators and other scientists who have requested the PI?s formal support in using the RO/ED method to isolate DOM from a variety of natural waters.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNatural organic matter (NOM) is a highly complex mixture of organic compounds having a range of chemical and physical properties, and it occurs in virtually all natural waters. When NOM is isolated from water for detailed study and characterization, the most common methods of isolation (solid-phase extraction and ultracentrifugation) recover NOM much more efficiently from fresh water than from saline waters.  When a scientist wants to know how the chemical properties of NOM vary along a riverine salinity gradient (river to estuary to ocean), it is necessary to distinguish between natural biogeochemical changes that occur along the salinity gradient and salinity-driven losses of NOM that depend on the selected method of isolation.  A solution is to select a salinity-independent method of isolation, and the only available method is the coupled reverse osmosis/electrodialysis (RO/ED) method that Perdue and colleagues developed to isolate NOM from seawater.\n\nThis project has seen the RO/ED method used to isolate NOM from two Georgia Rivers, with nine sampling points per each river along its full salinity gradient.  One river was sampled in 2013 and 2014, and the other was sampled only in 2014, thus yielding 27 samples.  We have achieved an average yield of 82 +/- 8%, with no dependence on salinity.  If chemical properties of these samples vary with salinity, the variations are due to biogeochemistry and not to salinity-driven isolation artifacts.  A subset of the samples have already been analyzed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS), by which 6000-11000 molecular formulae were detected per sample.  Approximately 1000-1700 compounds were found in all sampling locations, regardless of salinity.  These compounds are either found everywhere or they are introduced to the river a low salinity and travel unaltered through the estuary and into the ocean.  In contrast, the organic C/N atomic ratios of isolated samples decrease gradually from fresh waters to the ocean.  The major components of NOM do not contain nitrogen, so the salinity dependence of C/N ratios must be due to local variations in sources, sinks, and transformation of nitrogen-containing compounds, which become relatively more abundant at higher salinity.  When all data are generated and interpreted, a more comprehensive analysis will be published.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: E. Michael Perdue"
