The XRD would replace an extant but antiquated (25 yrs old) XRD in the Department of Geosciences at Georgia State University (GSU).  The new XRD will support a range of PI and collaborative research including studies of: 1) the  137Cs sorption potential of clay minerals at the DOE Savannah River Site ; 2) paleoclimatological and paleoanthropological investigations of East African Rift ancestral lake sediments recovered from an International Continental Drilling Project that rely on authigenic clay mineral identification to elucidate paleoenvironmental conditions; and 3) investigations of the pedogenesis of volcanic tephras, to name a few.  The XRD will support undergraduate and graduate education and will be incorporated into a distance learning course developed by the PI that seeks to engage both K-12 teachers students statewide. The PI is an early career investigator.  \r\n\r\n***",
