They are: nanotechnology integrated across the curriculum, development of a chemistry program, faculty professional development in nanotechnology and chemistry, interactive, 3-D visualization learning objects and a 3-D classroom for STEM courses, Summer Bridge activities emphasizing nanotechnology, summer technology camps for middle school students, a Summer Technology Institute to introduce nanotechnology to secondary school educators, a first-year student coaching program shown to be effective in raising second-year and long-term retention rates, supplemental instruction that places peer mentors and tutors in classrooms to assist faculty and students, faculty and student research projects that can be presented at conferences, virtual learning communities utilizing interconnection between the College's Blackboard Learning Management System and various social network systems, and research on the effectiveness of student coaching, supplemental instruction, and interactive, 3-D learning objects on the retention and learning outcomes of minority, female, first-generation, and economically under-resourced students. This project will prepare veterans, minorities, women, first-generation students, and economically under-resourced students for a broad range of new and exciting, high-wage, high-demand STEM careers.",

Community colleges have proved and played a significant role in addressing these gaps.  The results from this implementation project at Drake State Community and Technical College have shown the importance of collaboration and professional development. \n\nFinally, the impact of the summer projects has contributed to the three-percent (3%) increase in the retention rate for the college.  As well as impacting the over ninety percent (90%) increase in the student\u2019s awards in certificates, certification and degrees for the college in the last 5 years.
