 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use a combination of spacecraft observations from the POLAR spacecraft (one of the missions that was part of NASA's International Solar Terrestrial Physics program) in conjunction with kinetic, 3-D simulations to examine the physical dynamics of collisionless magnetic reconnection.  Earth's magnetopause provides an ideal laboratory for testing the validating the results that have been obtained by kinetic simulations of reconnection.  Part of the research will involve the creation of a database of events from the POLAR spacecraft where the satellite crossed the reconnection separatrix and electron diffusion region.  The spacecraft data will then be compared to the kinetic simulations. Specifically the project will examine three issues related to the physics of magnetic reconnection: (1) How the electron diffusion region evolves during the process, which leads to secondary islands and temporal fluctuations in the reconnection rate; (2) How the electron layers interact to generate turbulent reconnection; and (3) How the reconnection process leads to electric fields parallel to the ambient magnetic field and how these structures grow to macroscopic scales.\r\n\r\nMagnetic reconnection plays a critical role in the process of converting energy stored in a magnetic field to kinetic energy of electrons and ions.  In particular, collisionless reconnection is the primary mechanism by which energy is transferred from the solar wind into Earth's magnetosphere.  Magnetic reconnection also plays a critical role in the generation of magnetic substorms and storms.  These processes are important to our understanding of space weather.  The database of reconnection events and the results from the simulations will both be made available to the space science community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA magnetopause provides a magnetic umbrella for the planet and people below;  occasionally this umbrella develops tears that represent new magnetic highways for charged particles to get inside the umbrella and sometimes get down to the atmosphere and make aurorae.  The process of forming these tears is \"magnetic reconnection\", but such sites are difficult to document.  The research funded under this grant permitted the 3D modeling of a portion of this umbrella to find better ``observable'' ways to detect the sites of these tears.  Theoretically the modeling of these layers involves concepts that are impossible to measure in situ, yet the discipline of space physics still seeks to identify these layers and identify what processes facilitate their occurrence. With the numerical model of these layers this research has worked on both sides of theory and observation.  On the theoretical side we have advanced the procedural ways to identify these tears using the quantity shown in the attached picture.  Prior to this work there was no way to visualize the pattern of these tears in 3D as there was no accepted way to even define the occurrence of the tears in current layers with spatial variations in all 3 directions.  This research has also shown ways to deduce the occurrence of these tears by finding observables (in the same simulation) that can also be determined from spacecraft, that are almost as reliable as having all the unobservable information used from the simulation to make this picture!  Over the course of this research these techniques have been used with in situ spacecraft data to document and resolve the first such site where the tears are actually under construction.  This work has immediate application in subsequent in situ detection schemes such as being performed with NASA's MMS mission on orbit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/12/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jack D Scudder"
