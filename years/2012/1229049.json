The current high performance PM heavily depend on Rare-Earth elements (RE). The consortium aims to develop RE-free PM. Emphasis focuses on thin films and nano-particles of PM with (BH) max of about 25 MGOe as the first step. Such Permanent Magnets have the potential to make possible new applications such as magnetic MEMS and biomedical sensors.  At the second stage, emphasis will be placed on the development from thin films and nanoparticles to powders and bulk Permanent Magnets. Also, the development of fabrication processes for production and recycling of the materials will be integrated with the aid of a non-funded industry expert. The goal is to build the knowledge to achieve (BH) max, comparable to that for NdFeB.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of six organizations from three countries. All the partner members have had rich experience on Permanent Magnets including the proposed Mn alloy systems. The consortium will work on RE free PM from fundamental materials issues, processing and manufacturing, and cost-effectiveness points of view. Also, emphasis will be placed on training students and post-doctoral fellows.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n1. Introduction\n\nPermanent magnets (PM) have been widely used in numerous applications.   To date, the best overall-PM involve the rare-earth elements (RE) such as Nd and Dy in the form of Nd-Fe-B.   However, there has been a growing concern with the RE regarding a shortage in supply, price and serious environmental problems.   Therefore, the development of high performance RE free PM is an urgent necessity and of strategic importance for many high tech applications.\n\nA figure of merit for evaluating the strength of PM is (BH)max, where B is the magnetic flux and H is the magnetic field.  The current maximum value of (BH)max is about 55 MGOe at room temperature in NdFeB magnets.\n\nThe Manganese (Mn) alloy systems, such as Mn-Al, Mn-Bi and Mn-Ga are known to exhibit high magnetic anisotropy, thus high coercivity. However, the (BH)max is much lower than that for NdFeB magnets.  Nevertheless, since Mn and Al elements are abundant, the Mn-based PM are attractive, allowing a cost-effective and sustainable process in manufacturing.  Until now, very little work has been carried out on developing Mn-based PM with high (BH)max.   Therefore, the present project has focused on Mn-based alloy systems with Al, Bi, Ga, and other elements.  The objective is to develop high performance and sustainable  PM through better understanding of magnetism and structure by performing a systematic study of fabrication, characterization, and theory.   The final goal is to establish the knowledge towards sustainable manufacturing of PM. (Figure 1) \n\nThe project is performed by the international consortium, which consists of six organizations from three countries: i) MINT Center at University of Alabama (USA), ii) University of Delaware (USA), iii) National Institute for Materials Sciences (NIMS, Japan), iv) Max-Planck Institute (MPI, Germany), v) Technical University of Darmstadt (Germany) and vi) TDK Corporation (Japan, unfunded). (Figure 1)\n\n \n\n2. Accomplishments\n\n(a) High Performance Manganese-Bismuth (MnBi) Film Permanent Magnets\n\nMultilayers of Mn and Bi nano-meter layers were fabricated onto various substrates  by using a DC magnetron sputtering system.    Measurements of magnetic and structural properties were carried out using several tools including magnetometers, X-ray diffractometers and transmission electron microscopes.   The optimization of fabrication condition for obtaining the single crystalline films of MnBi of the low-temperature-phase (LTP) with the c-axis along the film normal was made.  The samples thus fabricated are found to exhibit the very attractive temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy; it increases with temperature above room temperature.  This implies that the strength of magnets increases with temperature (Figure 2).   This result is significant since the LTP MnBi films can be the attractive candidates for future nanotechnology-based electronics devices such as micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS). \n\n(b) The Mechanism for Magnetic Anisotropy in Manganese-Gallium (MnGa) Alloy Thin Films\n\nThe MnGa alloy thin films have been studied in order to investigate its origin for high magnetic anisotropy.   The fabrication method was similar to that for the MnBi alloy thin films.   The characterization and analyses were performed by using magnetometers, X-ray diffractometers and transmission electron microscopes.  The films thus fabricated are found to be of single crystalline L10 phase with the c-axis normal to the film plane.  The correlation between anisotropy and saturation magnetization was carefully analyzed as a function temperature.  It is found that the two-ion mechanism is responsible for the high magnetic anisotropy of L10 MnGa films.  (Figure 3).  The result is important to shed light on basic magnetism.\n\n\n(c) Successful Fabrication of Single Crystalline MnGa(Al) Thin Films \n\nIn order to investigate into controlling of magnetic properties of L10 MnGa thin films so as to control the performance of MnGa PM, efforts have been made to add Aluminum (Al) in to the MnGa system.   The fabrication method was the similar to those used for  MnBi and MnGa.   For the first time, the present project has been able to fabricate the single crystalline films of MnGaAl of the L10 phase.    It is found that the magnetic properties can be controlled by adding (Al), thus leading to the capability of controlling the magnetic properties of MnGa PM.\n\n(d) Successful Fabrication of Ferromagnetic Phase Manganese-Rhodium (Mn-Rh) Films for Future Permanent Magnets an Spintronics Applications.\n\nThe Mn-Rh alloy of  around 50at%Mn of bulk is known to exhibit antiferromagnetism at room temperature.   The present project has successfully demonstrated the establishment of the ferromagnetic phase at room temperature of MnRh thin films deposited onto single crystalline MgO substrate, leading to a lattice expansion.  This result is significant since it provides the mean to control the magnetism through controlling the lattice constants of a magnetic substance.\n\n3. Impact\n\nThe present project has successfully demonstrated that high performance magnets of MnBi and MnGa films can be manufactural and useful for future nanotechnology based devices such as MEMS.  Furthermore, the use of Mn-based PM has an societal impact on cost-performance and environmental issues.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Takao Suzuki"
