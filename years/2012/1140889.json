 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is transforming biology undergraduate education at the University of Wisconsin-Stout to include potentially publishable original research as an integral part of introductory laboratory courses for all students taking such courses, both science majors and those majoring in other disciplines.  The intellectual merit lies in their choice of a local problem as the basis for the research. Both the intellectual merit and broader impacts are enhanced by the documentation of student cognitive, personal, and professional development in classrooms featuring a research approach compared to these outcomes in students who are involved in apprenticeship style research activities.  The initial research problems being introduced are investigation of the high phosphorus content of a nearby lake affected by agricultural runoff and the effects of implementation of remediation efforts.  It is estimated that over 1000 students will be exposed to classroom research approaches during the course of this project.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was designed to transform undergraduate STEM education at UW-Stout and elsewhere by integrating authentic research experiences into the science classroom.  In this approach, students who enroll in science classes make original scientific discoveries as part of their coursework.  They develop hypotheses, design and execute experiments, analyze findings, and share their results with a wide audience just as scientists do.  To measure the effectiveness of this approach, we studied how students learned and developed in response to integrated research experiences. \n\nUsing a widely employed tool, we studied student attitudes and compared our results to national averages.  Research students reported substantial gains in scientific thinking and personal development (Fig. 1).  Science majors and non-majors alike reported strong development in areas important for rational thinking and good decision-making.  In some areas, majors and non-majors showed significant differences, highlighting the unique characteristics of these two student populations.\n\n Figure 1. Selected results from the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) survey comparing science majors to non-science majors. \n\nThese results were encouraging, so we further surveyed students to uncover which elements of the research environment particularly impacted student learning and development.  Again, there were differences between science majors and non-majors, but overall, keeping a laboratory notebook and performing work in the laboratory played large roles in helping students think and act like scientists (Fig. 2). \n\nFigure 2.  Open-ended student responses regarding which elements of the research classroom most helped learning and development.\n\nMoving beyond self-reported student data, we wanted to measure gains in scientific thinking skills.  For this, we employed the Views About Scientific Inquiry (VASI) assessment, a tool that measures student conceptions about how scientists construct and justify scientific knowledge.  Surprisingly, we did not detect significant improvement in scientific thinking skills after the classroom research experience (Fig. 3).  Non-majors and science majors alike scored no differently than traditionally-taught students.  These results indicate the importance of directly addressing scientific thinking skills in the curriculum in addition to the laboratory experiences.\nFigure 3.  VASI results showing no significant gains or losses in scientific thinking skills after classroom-based research experiences.\nOverall, classroom-based research experiences are an effective tool for developing student attitudes and confidence in their abilities to think and act like scientists.  Specific interventions that address scientific inquiry skills need to be incorporated into the curriculum that accompanies classroom research, and science majors differ from non-majors in important ways, so studying how classroom research experiences fit these student needs will be an important research area in the future.\n\nIn the end, over 50 baccalaureate and K-12 educators were exposed to this novel approach in professional development workshops facilitated by the principal investigator.  A great many more students (over 1200 and counting!) benefited from the adoption of classroom-based research experiences at UW-Stout and elsewhere.  Many presentations at regional and national conferences and results have been shared in the peer-reviewed literature.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen C Nold"
