Several of the topics covered are central in extremely active areas of current research in ergodic theory; ergodic properties of interval exchange transformations and of Teichmuller flows, the pointwise or norm convergence of nonconventional ergodic averages, rigidity of group actions. Young researchers are given ample opportunities to speak, to talk and to participate in the conference activities.",
