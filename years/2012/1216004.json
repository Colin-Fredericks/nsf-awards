 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern marketplaces, enabled by recent advances in information\r\ntechnology, are becoming ever more complex, dynamic and\r\ninterconnected. Customers are increasingly more informed about the\r\nchoices available to them and are thus able to make better decisions.\r\nFor firms, this presents both opportunities and challenges. On the\r\npositive side, the firm has a bigger than ever array of tools at its\r\ndisposal that enable it to better sell to its customers. Such tools\r\nare both computational (pricing algorithms, customer targeting data,\r\nsocial networking information) and economical (dynamic mechanisms) in\r\nnature. The challenging aspect for the firm is that modern technology\r\nalso allows consumers to easily learn the opinions of fellow customers\r\nand to be strategic in their decision-making. Having such strategic\r\nand networked customers is not necessarily a net negative for the\r\nfirm, but it certainly makes the firm's problem of how to sell its\r\nproducts a more complex one.\r\n\r\nThis project aims  to develop a framework for understanding how to\r\nsell goods in markets that are fundamentally dynamic and\r\ninterconnected. The project will research what mechanisms are revenue-optimal\r\n(or near-optimal, while being simple and computationally tractable) in\r\ndynamic settings where customers can learn from each other. The PIs will\r\nstudy the effect of network learning on the firm's behavior and\r\nwhether it forces the firm to share some of the costs associated with\r\nconsumer learning.  The project will also focus on how the social\r\nnetworkstructure affects the optimal mechanism and will try to\r\nunderstand whether such network learning effects lead to lower (or\r\nhigher) revenue for the firm and aggregate consumer welfare.\r\n\r\nFundamental research in the dynamics of networked markets provides\r\ndeeper knowledge to a broad audience that includes firms, consumer\r\ngroups and regulators.  Curriculum development at the interface of\r\noperations research, information systems and computer science will\r\nbenefit from this research experience.",
