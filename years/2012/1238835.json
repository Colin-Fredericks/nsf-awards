 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this project is to create a fundamental understanding and methods for predicting the properties of heterogeneous media including precipitated solids, multiphase multifunctional composites and self-assembled crystals, and to exploit such knowledge for new models for heterogeneous media and optimal design of composite materials.  Composites are broadly used in daily life ranging from plastic bags and concrete (used as a construction material) to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner whose fuselage is made of carbon composites.  The challenge facing researchers today consists of extending this success to smart/multifunctional composites.  These are composites that serve several functions and can be excited by and respond to multiple external stimuli.  The properties of multifunctional composites are predominantly determined by the microstructure of the constituent phases.  The present research systematically addresses how microstructures influence the properties of multifunctional composites and what are the optimal microstructures for a desired property, e.g., the magnetoelectric coupling coefficient.  These predictive modeling and optimal design problems are addressed by an inverse method: microstructures are \"a priori\" designed to find the quantitative relation between microstructures and material properties.  Also, a numerical toolset will be developed to compute optimal microstructures for various applications. \r\n\r\nThe bottleneck of many technologies, e.g., batteries and turbine engines, hinges on the development of new multifunctional materials.  The results of this research can be used to develop new multifunctional composites and new manufacturing processes for these technologies, which have the potential to mitigate some aspects of the current energy crisis.  Educationally, an interactive visualization demonstrations project will be launched to promote students' interest and responsibility to learn engineering.",

Thermoelectric (TE) materials directly convert heat into electric energy. They are often used for power generation and refrigeration. Being all solid state and without moving parts, thermoelectric devices have the unique advantage of portability, silence, scalability, durability and reliability in extreme environment. In this work we develop a continuum theory for TE  bodies following the framework of continuum mechanics and conforming to general principles of thermodynamics. Further,  the theoretical model is applied to predict effective properties of thermoelectric composites. In particular, explicit formulas of effective properties are obtained for simple microstructures of laminates and periodic E-inclusions. Moreover, we predict that the power factor, one of the most important properties of TE devices, can be improved by hundreds of times and propose large-scale applications of TE generators. \n\n\n \n\nFig. 2: Contour of the effective power factors of TE composites. Horizontal axis: volume fraction of metallic phase; vertical axis: the shape of the metallic particle in a TE semiconductor.\n\n \n\nAn energy formulation of continuum magneto-electro-elasticity with applications. Modern nanotechnology and bioengineering have focused on the development of multifunctional or multiferroic materials where strain, polarization and magnetization are simultaneously coupled. These materials have broad applications ranging from the technologies of actuators, sensors, imaging devices to smart self-adaptive structures, artificial muscles, etc. This work is to address the fundamental aspect of such multifunctional materials. From the first-principle, i.e., the Maxwell equations and Newton\u00c6s law, we achieve an energy formulation of continuum electro-elasticity and magneto-electroelasticity. Based on this new theoretical formulation, we discovered a new mechanism of magnetoelectricity of soft materials.  \n\n\n\n\nFig. 3: Effective ME properties as a function of externally applied magnetic field.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/24/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Liping Liu"
