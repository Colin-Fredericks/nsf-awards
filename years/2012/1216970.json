 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is aimed at developing a non-asymptotic homogenization\r\ntheory of Maxwell's equations in artificial periodic composites\r\n(metamaterials). Currently, there is a consensus that sufficiently\r\nlarge lattice cell sizes are necessary for some nontrivial physical\r\neffects to occur in such structures. (The most intriguing of these\r\neffects is high-frequency magnetism.) Classical homogenization\r\ntheories work well in the zero-cell-size limit but are difficult to\r\napply to large metamaterial cells. In contrast, the proposed theory is\r\nnon-asymptotic and does not involve any series expansions with respect\r\nto the cell size. The electromagnetic field in the material is\r\napproximated by a finite set of functions (modes) usually but not\r\nnecessarily Trefftz functions such as Bloch waves. The coarse-grained\r\nfields and flux densities are defined via curl-conforming and\r\ndiv-conforming interpolations, respectively. A linear map between\r\nthese interpolants is established and defines an extended material\r\ntensor. In a certain canonical basis, this extended tensor has a\r\nclassical block of 36 local parameters and a novel block quantifying\r\nnonlocal effects. From the differential-geometric perspective, this\r\nconstitutive relationship can be viewed as a realization of\r\nBossavit-Hiptmair's discrete Hodge operators (linear maps between\r\ndiscretized 1-forms that correspond to vector fields and 2-forms that\r\ncorrespond to fluxes).\r\n\r\nOver the last decade, metamaterials have attracted unprecedented\r\nattention due to a variety of potential applications that include\r\nsuperlensing, electromagnetic cloaking, electromagnetically-induced\r\ntransparency, efficient antennas, and more. Experimental\r\ndemonstrations of these effects have been limited to proofs of\r\nprinciple and at optical frequencies have so far been incomplete.\r\nSubwavelength optical imaging has been achieved only in the\r\nquasi-static (near-field) regime, standard for the more conventional\r\nnear-field optics; the so-called \"carpet cloak\" conceals surface bumps\r\nrather than 3D objects, and so on. Moreover, applications that do not\r\ndepend critically on the effective medium description of metamaterials\r\nappear to be more easily achievable than the ones that do. The latter\r\ngroup includes, notably, superlensing and cloaking. This suggests\r\nthat, to make further progress, theoretical and mathematical issues at\r\nthe heart of metamaterial science must be unambiguously resolved. The\r\nmain problem can be stated as follows. Given the composition of a\r\nmetamaterial cell and the operating frequency, determine whether this\r\nmetamaterial can be reasonably described as a continuous medium with\r\nsome effective parameters, just like any natural optical material; if\r\nthe answer is positive, develop a rigorous methodology for such a\r\ndescription. The proposed research is aimed at solving this problem in\r\nthe most difficult case when the cell size of the composite is an\r\nappreciable fraction of the wavelength of light. The methodology, once\r\ndeveloped, will allow the scientific community to delineate the\r\npossible from the impossible in the field of metamaterials.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research is in the development\r\nof a new paradigm of non-asymptotic homogenization, of new\r\ncomputational methods related to it, and in the application of the\r\nproposed methodology to electromagnetic metamaterials, allowing one to\r\ngain a much deeper understanding of their properties and limitations.\r\nAs a new area of research, non-asymptotic homogenization will also\r\nhave a broader technical impact in other areas of applied physics and\r\nengineering, such as acoustics, heat transfer and possibly elasticity.",
