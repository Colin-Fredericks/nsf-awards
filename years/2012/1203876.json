 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collaborative team will take advantage of the currently funded Greenland Inland Traverse (GrIT) traveling between Thule and Summit Greenland to access a spatially diverse area of the GIS in order to better understand albedo variability and the snow properties that influence albedo. The GrIT route offers a unique opportunity to study a wide range of snow accumulation zones (i.e. the ablation zone, soaked snow zone, the percolation zone and the dry snow zone) across Greenland, which are expected to have a broad range of albedo values as well as significant variability in snow physical properties and concentrations of light absorbing compounds (i.e. dust, elemental carbon, and brown carbon). The project's field component will take place over two seasons during the spring of 2013 and 2014. The approach will include stopping along the traverse to collect coincident daily measurements of snow spectral albedo, snow physical properties (i.e. specific surface area, density), surface snow light absorption properties (i.e. wavelength dependent absorption of water soluble compounds and particulates), and the concentrations of trace elements, organic, and elemental carbon. Additionally, the temporal evolution of spectral albedo will be monitored continuously during the sunlit months using autonomous stations deployed along the traverse route to track seasonal variations of snow albedo and to help attribute these variations to the physical and chemical composition of the snow.  The results of this project will yield a unique data set characterizing the temporal and spatial variability of surface albedo as well as the physical and chemical properties of Greenland snow, which are broadly useful to both modeling, ice mass balance, and remote sensing communities. Conference presentations, rapid publication of results, and most importantly close collaboration with modelers, (i.e. through work with the CESM PCWG) will ensure that this knowledge used to improve process parameterizations in predictive global climate models.  The team will also build on international collaborations begun in the Dartmouth IGERT program, including a week-long ambassadorship to Nuuk by co-PI Polashenski including lectures at the college and Katuuaq cultural center.  Graduate, undergraduate, and high school student training will also be included in the project.",

One interesting finding is that snow surface microstructure and chemistry can vary over scales of 1-10 m, with variations at these smaller scales on the order of variations occurring over several 10&rsquo;s of km.

Latent heat transport into the snowpack due to meltwater percolation drives the observed warming. Modeling shows that heat is stored at depth for several years and energy delivered from consecutive melt events accumulates. The observed warming is likely not yet in equilibrium with recent melt production rates, but captures the steady upward climb of the zone around the interior ice sheet where enough melting occurs in the summer to produce runoff.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The work involved training opportunities for four graduate students and several undergraduate students from Georgia Tech and Dartmouth College.&nbsp; For the students who participated in the Greenland field campaign, this was their first research trip in Greenland, and the first expedition-type research experience.&nbsp; In addition, undergraduate students from Dartmouth College, the University of Vermont, and high school students assisted with lab measurements and data analysis.
