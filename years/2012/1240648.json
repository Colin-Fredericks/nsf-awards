The funds requested will be used to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending the meeting. \r\n\r\nThe Material Measurement Symposium will consist more than 100 conference papers, including 15 invited talks, 58 contributed talks, and more than 30 contributed posters over 15 technical sessions (13 oral and 2 poster). The focus of the symposium is on emerging characterization techniques that hold the promise the help reveal the microscopic mechanisms underpinning the performance and life time of energy storage and conversion systems. This symposium will bring together scientists and engineers across various disciplines to address the most challenging issues in characterizing materials and energy systems in transient and nonequilibrium states.",
