 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work will solve a fundamental manufacturing issue: the inability to directly pattern metal with sub-100nm resolution. Addressing the nanopatterning of silver, which finds application in photonics and electronics, it develops a novel solid-liquid electrochemical process capable of large-area, low-cost and high fidelity patterning. In addition to deriving a fundamental physical understanding of transport of metallic ion species across multi-phase domains such as ionic glass-liquid electrolyte systems, the proposed research will exploit high speed, continuous, direct nanoscale patterning of metallic substrates to generate high performance biosensors.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the proposed research will provide the manufacturing community with a valuable new technology. The obtained knowledge of the physical, chemical, and transport properties of silver-based solid electrolyte material systems can be used in the design and industrial-scale manufacturing of optical biosensors. In addition, the understanding developed in this research can be translated to other similar systems, such as liquid junction photovoltaic devices and lithium ion batteries with nanostructured anodes thus inspiring similar systems to be studied and developed for a range of applications including renewable energy conversion and new sensor designs.",

As a result it finds applications in electronic interconnects, optical bio-sensors, structural color generation and bactericides. However, since (like most metals) Ag cannot be directly patterned at these small scales, lengthy and expensive lithography-based, indirect patterning techniques must be used to produce these structures, limiting the applications of Ag nanostructures.</p>\n<p>This project has explored the possibility of directly making Ag nanostructures using a stamping/imprinting process and, as a result, developed a new and novel process of &lsquo;electrochemical&rsquo; stamping. Patterns are transferred to a Ag film by anodic dissolution of the film at the contact interface with a pre-patterned ionically conductive stamp brought into contact with it and configured into an electochemical cell with the film as the anode. To achieve this, an ionically active, Ag-based glass mixture, xAgI(1-x)AgPO3, was synthesized for use as a &lsquo;stamp&rsquo; material. Besides being a pure ionic conductor (i.e., charge is conducted as a result of the motion of ions instead of electrons, as in the more commonly-used electronic conductors like metals) with tunable conductivity, the glass mixture is optically transparent and has a low glass transition temperature (between 85&deg;C and 125&deg;C). The low glass transition temperature makes it possible to melt-process accurate stamps with nanoscale patterns without serious thermal deformations. The optical transparency is important because it allows overlay registration of the stamp with other features on the film being patterned. This project has not only developed the process, but also the methodology for synthesizing optically clear stamp materials and large-area flat stamps with nanoscale features, thus enabling a novel, cost-effective, direct method for producing large-area Ag nanopatterned films &nbsp;for applications such as Surface-Enhanced Raman Sensing (SERS) and plasmonic color generation.</p>\n<p>During this project, while imaging patterned stamps, we made a serendipitous discovery that the glass changed color when exposed to an electron beam. We studied this effect and found that it was related to the ionic conductivity of the glass. The supply of electrons by the beam causes the precipitation of stable atomic clusters of Ag. &nbsp;&nbsp;We were able to tune the size and spatial density of these clusters within the glass by changing the dose and energy of electrons in the beam to generated different colors with high contrast and spatial resolution. When the electron dosage at a particular location is large enough, the ripening atomic clusters merge to form a continuous film that grows out of the glass in the form of an Ag nanostructure. Thus, also making it possible to directly &lsquo;write&rsquo; Ag nanopatterns on the surface of the glass. &nbsp;The implications of this discovery might lead to new &lsquo;painting&rsquo; technology as wells as new ways to prototype and repair nanoscale circuits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project has provided an opportunity for 1 MS and 3 PhD students to conduct graduate research in an area that bridges advanced manufacturing, materials and electrochemistry. Further, 6 journal articles and several conference papers have been published on the results of this project. The project has also provided research and mentoring to 1 high-school and 2 undergraduate students. One research engineer and&nbsp; one PhD student have entered academia as assistant professors, one PhD is working as a post-doctoral researcher and one is in the process of completing his PhD research. The MS student has obtained a position in industry. The initial project results have also served as the basis for implementation of this patterning process in industry. We are currently working with a Fortune 100 company to evaluate the possibility of the use of this process for their nano-patterning needs. Further, with the emergence of large-area e-beam polishing systems, the aforementioned e-beam color generation will have applications in surface coloring without the use of pigments.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/05/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Placid&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ferreira</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200780/1200780_10204941_1491428569313_Outcomes-Structures--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200780/1200780_10204941_1491428569313_Outcomes-Structures--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Structures Produced by S4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200780/1200780_10204941_1491428569313_Outcomes-Structures--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Structures Produced by S4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Nano-Structures Produced by the S4 Process</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kyle Jacobs</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Placid&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ferreira</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Structures Produced by S4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200780/1200780_10204941_1491428231469_Outcomes-S4Description--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200780/1200780_10204941_1491428231469_Outcomes-S4Description--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Process Descriptions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1200780/1200780_10204941_1491428231469_Outcomes-S4Description--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Process Descriptions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic Depiction of the Solid State Superionic Stamping Process and its Advantages</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">P.
