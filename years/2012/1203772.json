 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide new data on the paleoclimates, paleoenviroments and the biodiversity impacts of sea level rise on the southern edge of the Bering Land Bridge (BLB), and is intended to facilitate a better understanding of why woolly mammoths survived late into the mid-Holocene only in the environments of Arctic islands of this area. Furthermore, this research will attempt to establish the actual time of extinction of the Holocene mammoth population on St. Paul Island, Pribilof Islands, Alaska, and apply this information to test various proposed causal hypotheses for the extinction.\r\n\r\nCores from Cagaloq Lake, St. Paul, will be sampled for chironomids (aquatic invertebrates), pollen, coprophilous fungi spores, plant macrofossils, charcoal, ancient DNA and cryptotephras. Oxygen isotopes from the heads of chironomids will provide an independent climate record that can be supplemented by paleoecological analyses of the chironomid assemblages. Studies will also test chironomid species for isotope fractionation to disentangle climate signals from ground water effects. Terrestrial community changes will be reconstructed from pollen, spores and plant macrofossils; and charcoal frequency will be used to document fire events. Analysis of ancient DNA will provide data on cryptic plant and animal species that have not been detected by traditional methods of analysis, and can also be used to identify taxa to species.\r\n\r\nSpores that grow on animal dung will be used as proxies for the mammoth population size and to document the time of mammoth extinction on the island. Ancient DNA will serve as an important cross-check by helping to resolve specific identifications of these spores as well as providing an independent estimate the time of extinction by the absence of mammoth DNA.\r\n\r\nDigital elevations, bathymetric data, sea level curves, and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology will be used to reconstruct island size from the time of its isolation until today. A highly constrained chronology of the Cagaloq record will be achieved by using 14 C dates and tephras. All data can be compared temporally in order to test hypotheses for mammoth extinction. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide opportunities for two PhD students, a postdoctoral fellow, graduate student assistant and undergraduate student. Results of the study will be disseminated widely in peer-reviewed journals. An exhibit on the results of the project will be prepared by the EMS Museum at Penn State University with a web component. In addition, a special on-line, interactive exhibit will allow participants to reconstruct the island at various sizes, populate it with differing mammoth populations and define different climate and environmental factors to observe how each of these components affects mammoth extinction. The interactive exhibit will be available on the Neotoma database. Members of the group will make presentations on the project at the Alaska Quaternary Center in Fairbanks, which serves as a hub for promoting Alaska Quaternary research and outreach to the public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goal of this project was to better understand the timing and causes of extinction of woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) on St. Paul Island, AK.  St. Paul Island was once part of the Bering Land Bridge connecting Alaska and eastern Asia, but was isolated when sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age.  St. Paul is not a big island (12km wide), so it is remarkable that this woolly mammoth population is the second-latest known surviving population on earth.  Previous research papers have placed its extinction at 6,500 years ago, coincident with the rise of early agricultural civilizations, and thousands of years after mainland mammoth populations went extinct. \n\nA secondary goal of this project was to test hypotheses about the habitats and climates of the southern Bering Land Bridge.  The Bering Land Bridge was a major conduit for the first humans migrating to the Americas, and it hosted a diverse community of large mammals, now mostly extinct.  Because much of the Bering Land Bridge is now underwater and hence largely inaccessible, scientists continue to debate whether it was a refugium for trees and shrubs during cold glacial periods and whether the dominant vegetation was grass or shrub tundra.\n\nTo this end, our research team visited St. Paul in 2013 and collected a series of cores from Lake Hill and new woolly mammoth fossil specimens, many of the latter donated by local inhabitants.  The University of Wisconsin team led the analyses and interpretation of fossil pollen and spores from dung fungi (Sporormiella, Sordaria, Podospora):  the former is an indicator of past vegetation, the latter is an indirect indicator of the presence of large herbivores such as woolly mammoth.  This is a collaborative research proposal; other institutions (Penn State, UC Santa Barbara, University of Alaska Fairbanks, University of Alberta) have led the collection and analysis of other paleoclimatic and paleoecological indicators (radiocarbon dates, ash layers, ancient DNA, plant fossils, stable isotopes, cladocerans, and diatoms).  The Wisconsin team has also been running modeling experiments with Niche Mapper, a physics-based mammalian energetics model, to test hypotheses about the environmental drivers of woolly mammoth extinction on St. Paul. \n\nKey findings from this research include:\n\n1)      New estimates of the timing of extinction.  Five independent indicators of extinction (direct radiocarbon dating of mammoth fossils, three coprophilous spores [Sporormiella, Podospora, and Sordaria] from the Lake Hill sediments, and ancient DNA from the Lake Hill sediments) show that woolly mammoths survived on St. Paul for centuries later than previously reported dates.  Because of these multiple independent indicators, the St. Paul mammoth demise is now one of the best-dated extinctions in the prehistoric record.\n\n2)      The pollen data indicate fairly little vegetation change on St. Paul Island during the Holocene, suggesting that the vegetation was insensitive to whatever caused the mammoth extinction.  Moreover, the vegetation stability seems to rule out hypotheses that the mammoth extinction was caused by habitat change.\n\n3)      We have strong evidence that the southern Bering land bridge and St. Paul Island was a grass tundra continuously from the last glacial maximum (18,000 years ago) through the present.  This contradicts recent papers arguing that much of the Bering Land Bridge was a shrub tundra.\n\n4)      We have strong evidence that the southern Bering land bridge and St. Paul Island was *not* a refugium for woody plant species during the last glacial period.  Ancient DNA and plant macrofossil data all show no sign of local presence of most tree and shrub species that today are common in the Arctic.\n\nMuch of the work to date has focused on the upper 8m of the Lake Hill cores, which corresponds to roughly the last 12,000 years.  Work continues on the lower portions of the cores (8 to 13m), which are believed to represe..."
