 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit: Genes consist of DNA.  In order for the genetic information to be expressed, the DNA must be transcribed into an RNA message.  This RNA in turn directs synthesis of the proteins through which the cell carries out its various functions.  In the cell, genes are tightly packaged by proteins within chromosomes.  It is now clear that control of gene expression is exerted not only by direct influence on the machinery which transcribes the DNA into the RNA message, but also by other events which regulate chromosomal unfolding.  However, it is not understood how genes are selectively revealed to the molecular machinery that transcribes the genetic information into RNA messages.  The studies which will be carried out in this project are intended to provide a mechanistic understanding of the processes through which genes are transcribed in the chromosomal context.  Thus, the results from this research should be broadly applicable in elucidating the pathways through which all genes are controlled.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The work carried out in this project should have an important educational impact in several ways.  First, it is expected that a significant fraction of this research will be performed by undergraduates.  Students majoring in the life sciences may be attracted to careers in research; however, classroom instruction and the typical undergraduate lab exercises do not introduce them to either the excitement or the complexities of an actual hypothesis-driven research project.  Because of long-standing relationships between the host institution and local undergraduate colleges it is likely that students will be able to participate in this project not only full-time during the summer but on a part-time basis during the academic year as well.   There will also be an impact of the proposed work in the classroom.  The cutting-edge research approaches to be employed in this work can be directly applied by the principal investigator for advanced instruction in the areas of gene expression and gene regulation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject outcomes report, NSF 1121210\n\nAppropriate control of gene expression is essential for the proper function of all cells in our bodies, and misregulation of gene expression is the cause of many human diseases.  While it has long been appreciated that gene regulation depends on the differential ability of the gene expression machinery to access individual genes, it has recently become apparent that a second critical control point occurs immediately after transcription of the DNA has begun.  At nearly all genes, transcription pauses shortly after it has started.  The controlled crossing of this second \"gate\" into the gene is a major feature of gene regulation, but the mechanisms that control this gate have remained obscure.  In the work supported by 1121210, we have provided important new insight into this process.  We showed that part of the establishment of the gate is based on the exchange of two factors very early in gene expression, one which supports gene recognition and extended transcription, and a second which antagonizes the first and thus favors closing of the gate.  An unexpected observation was that the antagonistic factor is actually excluded from the transcription machinery at the point of transcript initiation.  We demonstrated that association of the antagonistic factor must wait for the transcription machinery to complete the earliest stages of transcript synthesis.  We were thus able to propose that the dynamics of factor loading and unloading during the initial phase of gene expression are tuned to pause the transcription machinery at the appropriate point for further regulatory input.  This model was strongly supported by the other, collaborative study that we performed under the support of this award.  In that work, we showed along with colleagues that a drug which blocks modifications to the transcriptional machinery at the start of transcription also unexpectedly blocks factor loading at that stage, leading to failure of the normal early pause step and a reduction in gene expression.  All of our studies point to the idea that the transcriptional machinery must \"mature\" appropriately in the initial stages of transcription through a coordinated series of factor exchanges and acquisitions.  These events are required for effective expression of genes. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donal Luse"
