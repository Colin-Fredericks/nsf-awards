 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to operate the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) as a national user facility, to support NSCL faculty and staff research in nuclear physics, nuclear chemistry, nuclear astrophysics, accelerator physics and instrumentation development, and to continue serving as a national user facility dedicated to the training of the next generation of scientists and diverse workforce in these disciplines.  The award will allow the NSCL to continue its nationally and internationally prominent leadership role in these areas by operating as the nation's premier user facility dedicated to the production and study of rare (short-lived) isotopes.\r\n\r\nThe development of new instrumentation along with new techniques and new beam capabilities form a potent combination allowing extraordinary discovery potential to be realized.  The proposed physics program builds upon these strengths while creating new assets that will sustain and enhance NSCL's scientific standing.  MSU was recently selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) for the next generation national Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB).  These opportunities have strong overlap with the stated scientific goals of the 2007 NSAC Long Range Plan, and form a coherent trajectory towards the implementation of FRIB. \r\n\r\nThe NSCL is a university-based national user facility serving a user community of more than 700 registered users from the U.S. and abroad.  The NSCL plays a prominent role in the education of the next generation of scientists through a close synergy of classroom education and hands-on laboratory research throughout the entire graduate career.  Approximately 60 graduate students at the NSCL have research assistantships that support their thesis research.  Further, NSCL faculty and staff are strongly engaged in cross-disciplinary research, K-12 and undergraduate education, and science outreach to the general public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report\n\n(PHY1102511)\n\nThe National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) is a national user facility for fundamental research in nuclear science and related fields.  It has operated since 1983 and this project funded operations from fiscal year 2012 to 2016.  This project supported use by a 1300 member national and international nuclear science community, with facility time allocated on the basis of scientific merit.  The project also supported the research of NSCL faculty and staff in nuclear science, nuclear astrophysics and accelerator and instrumentation physics.  A major new, world-unique capability to produce and reaccelerate rare isotopes to study nuclear reactions that occur in stars, the Reaccelerator to 3 MeV/u (ReA3), was implemented.  In September 2015, this new ReA3 Facility began User Operations.\n\nThe science program concentrated on nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics studies with beams of rare isotopes.  Rare isotopes are not normally found in nature, except in violent stellar environments.  Their properties are key to modeling astrophysical environments and understanding atomic nuclei and their interactions.  The Coupled Cyclotron Facility (CCF) at NSCL is capable of providing intense primary beams of ions from oxygen to uranium with energies up to 200 MeV/nucleon.  Beams of rare isotopes are produced by projectile fragmentation or fission and separated in flight with the A1900, a large solid-angle, third-generation magnetic fragment separator, and then delivered to the experimental end-station by means of NSCL's superconducting beam transport system.  Since inception of the CCF, over 900 different rare isotope beams have been produced and used in a wide range of experiments.\n\nScientists carried out a vigorous world-class research program at NSCL.  The research demonstrated that standard approaches to model atomic nuclei are incomplete and provided data that are leading to major improvements.  Modeling of astrophysical objects, such as neutron star crusts was significantly improved by determination of important nuclear properties at NSCL.  The role of novae in the origin of elements in the universe was better elucidated and NSCL research led to a better understanding of various astrophysical processes including the p-, alpha-, rp-, and r-process.  Accelerator technology developed at NSCL was used in construction of a number of proton therapy facilities worldwide used to cure diseases.  From October 1, 2011 through October 31, 2017 (with the final year a No-Cost Extension that did not fund operations) NSCL research supported by the project led to the publication of 923 papers in refereed journals (including 149 papers published in Physical Review Letter and Physics Letters), 450 invited talks at major conferences, the award of 77 PhD and 9 Masters degrees in nuclear physics, nuclear chemistry, accelerator physics and engineering.\n\nIn the operating period from October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2016, the CCF was scheduled to operate for a total of 21,496 hours (average: 4,300 hours/year) and delivered 19,199 hours of beam for research with an average availability of 90 percent.  During this time, 87 PAC-approved experiments were completed, in addition to 32 short test runs and discretionary experiments.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bradley M Sherrill"
