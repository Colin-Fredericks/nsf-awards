 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research Digitization TCN: Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN): A Model for Collections Digitization to Promote Taxonomic and Ecological Research\r\n\r\nThe Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN) brings together 10 diverse arthropod collections at universities and museums throughout the Southwest to create a virtual network of ground dwelling arthropods which are notably responsive to temporal and spatial environmental changes. These 10 collections document much of the Southwest's biodiversity, but currently the data associated with millions of arthropod specimens are not easily accessible. To overcome this, SCAN will develop methods for integrating existing databases, catalogue-image specimens, develop new electronic identification techniques, and produce a virtual library of ground-dwelling arthropods (beetles, grasshoppers, spiders, ants). In addition the project will work with the existing project Filtered Push to increase the capacity of experts to provide remote identifications and annotations of data that can be sent throughout the network.\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive SCAN online library and expert information will be available to the public as well as professionals in taxonomy, ecology, and climate change science. Smaller institutions will be provided increased access to large data sets for promoting research. The SCAN datasets will support a number of ongoing projects examining the effects of environmental and land-use change on individual arthropod species. By increasing access to this information, SCAN will stimulate new research and increased awareness in biodiversity conservation throughout the region. Over 50 undergraduates also will be trained in cyberinfrastructure, systematics, and ecology. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource, iDigBio.org.",

Each institution has targeted work on these taxa. \n\nFor the University of Colorado, the major goals for the project were:  1) database the focal groups of arthropods occurring in our collection, including the Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets), focal Hymenoptera (ants and wasps), focal Coleoptera (beetles), and Araneae (spiders); 2) to optimize our workflow and create protocols for digitization, curation, and imaging that will be used for future digitization and imaging efforts; 3) to optimize our imaging procedures and to image representative focal taxa (grasshoppers and wasps); 4) to implement the program Specify as our databasing platform; 5) to upload data and images to the Symbiota portal, making them available world-wide; 6) to train students in digitization, curation, and imaging.  The result of these efforts was to make the data residing with the specimens in the University of Colorado entomology collection available to researchers and the public and to provide images that can aid in future identification of specimens from other institutions and individuals.\n\nOver the past 5 years, 94,227 specimens, including all our holdings of SCAN focal taxa and additional closely related taxa, mainly Coleoptera (beetles), Hemiptera (true bugs), Hymenoptera (ants and wasps), Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets), and Araneae (spiders) were databased.  The total number of SCAN focal taxa databased at the University of Colorado entomology section now numbers 110,729, and the total number of specimens databased stands at 178,371.  Data from 100,748 of those specimens are currently available through the SCAN/Symbiota portal (and GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility: a repository for information about specimens in collections that can be accessed by a world-wide audience).  These specimens are identified to the genus or species level and are georeferenced.   \n\nIn the past 5 years, 4684 high resolution, focus stacked images of 1243 specimens have been taken for the SCAN project using the imaging system obtained through this grant.  These images are all available through the Symbiota portal.  In addition to images directly related to the goals of this project, an additional 1703 images were taken that were used in student theses and projects, as well as museum exhibits and publicity at the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, and for research purposes within the Entomology Section.  In addition, training and imaging capability were provided to other sections of the museum including Anthropology, Vertebrate Zoology, and Vertebrate Paleontology and CU?s Department of Art and Art History.  Approximately 200 images were made by or for these groups.  Thus, this imaging system was used to reach the public, as well as providing images valuable to researchers. \n\nThe entomology section has converted to using Specify as the database platform, and set up a server to facilitate timely publishing of recently databased specimen data.  These would not have happened without the funding for this project and will be extremely important for the section in the coming years.  A sustainability plan that will allow databasing and imaging efforts to continue in the coming years was developed. \n\nOver the course of the grant, 23 undergraduates, 7 graduate students, and a post-doc were trained in databasing, curation, museum collection best practices, and imaging.  In addition, a number of other students and staff were trained in imaging methodology.\n\nIn sum, the results of this project went far beyond what was originally proposed.  In addition to the specimen data and images that were generated, numerous students and staff were trained in appropriate collection protocols.  The data and images generated in the course of this project are now available to researchers and the public around the world.  The impact of the project was felt far beyond the entomology section, as images produced by the imaging system were used in numerous museum exhibits, in outreach efforts, and in presentations and publications by museum students, faculty and staff.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: M.
