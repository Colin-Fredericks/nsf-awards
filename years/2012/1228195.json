The specific research is into the influence of free-stream turbulence and instability modes on transition in non-equilibrium boundary layers. This is particularly relevant to applications in aerodynamics, most importantly aircraft engines. The research program addresses basic questions, but it includes development of practical prediction methods that can be used in engineering design; its scope has benefited from advice from colleagues in industry.\r\n\r\nThe present research addresses fundamental aspects of the 'mixed mode' interaction between effects of disturbances induced in the boundary layer by ambient turbulence and instability waves that grow on the boundary layer shear. The research then moves on to more challenging, and practically important aspects of this subject as such the need for semi-empirical techniques that can be used for predictive purposes in computational fluid dynamics codes. This study will extend model capabilities and provide data for developing and testing such techniques. The modeling is a concrete link to engineering needs for practical predictive ability. \r\nA conceptual framework of theory and computer simulations of 'bypass transition' under free-stream turbulence has previously lead to advances in our fundamental under- standing and practical prediction ability in that area. The present project will contribute an understanding and extend our modeling capability of the 'mixed mode', where in- stability waves occur beneath free-stream disturbances. Again, a theoretical perspective can be developed from linear, and weakly nonlinear, theory. To extend the mathematical framework for this work, computer simulations and specialized data analysis techniques will explore the fully non-linear processes at play. Simulation will also create benchmark data for use in model development. These data will be made available to the community for transition research. \r\nThe computer simulations will provide projects on data processing and visualization to undergraduates in aerospace engineering. In addition to the experience with large data sets, they will see fluid dynamics from a perspective quite different from their course work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research consisted of studies of the process of laminar to turbulent transition via high fidelity computer simulation.  A significant discovery is that, in a decellerating flow, with ambient disturbances, transition is initiated by helical patterns that develop out of an interaction between sheared, amplifying velocity fluctuations and instability waves that occur in decellerating flow.  This was a new and unanticipated discovery.  The helices grow rapidly in amplitude and break down into a patch of turbulence.  Under the conditions of decelleration (in fluid dynamics, this is called adverse pressure gradient) and moderate ambient disturbances (free-stream turbulence), we found this to be the common mode of breakdown to turbulence.  The phenomenon was explored by other simulations with a controlled inlet condition and it was shown to be a mode-interaction effect.\n\nThe study has also produced basic data on laminar to turbulent transition under free-stream turbulence, with and without instability waves. \n\nThe research also contained a practical component:  a prediction method for laminar to turbulent transition was developed.  Effects of surface roughness were included, because roughness initiates transition in some of the practical applications of this type of model.  Our method is based on the notion of `intermittency'.  This is an indicator function that rises from zero in laminar flow to unity in turbulent flow.   We developed a transport equation for intermittency.  It was implemented into the open source code, OpenFoam, and validated against laboratory and computer simulation data from experiments on boundary layers, ducts, separated flow and compressor blades.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul A Durbin"
