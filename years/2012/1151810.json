 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research and education in physics of correlated light-matter systems. Motivated by recent progress in cavity quantum electrodynamics on various atomic as well as solid-state platforms, the PI will explore collective effects in interacting light-matter systems. Collective behavior emerges when either the light-confining medium or the material system is complex or composed of a large number of interacting components, in a similar fashion to the emergence of superconductivity, superfluidity, quantum magnetism, and other states of matter.\r\n\r\nResearch thrusts include, to: (1) understand the nature quantum emitters coupled strongly to extended light-confining media, such as photonic molecules or crystals, where multi-mode effects are important, (2) study collective phenomena due to coupling of complex states of quantum matter, such as atomic condensates, to cavities, (3) investigate collective phenomena in a lattice of  cavity quantum electrodynamics systems. In (1) the collective effects derive from many modes of a cavity, in (2) from many degrees of freedom of the material system, and in (3) from both.\r\n\r\nA major challenge in studying collective phenomena in light-matter systems is the inherent non-equilibrium nature of these systems. Correlated light-matter systems fit neither into conventional theoretical frameworks of condensed matter physics, nor in quantum optics. The PI aims to develop a new approach and phenomenology that combines theoretical and computational techniques from different areas into a unified framework to address out-of-equilibrium quantum many body systems, and to identify new phenomena that will guide future experiments. \r\n\r\nThe techniques and concepts that the PI aims to integrate include: stochastic evolution methods and input-output formalism of quantum optics, matrix-product-states and variational wavefunction approaches of strongly correlated systems physics and Green's function methods of photonics, to address non-equilibrium phenomena in correlated light-matter systems. Close contact will be maintained to experiments through existing collaborative links of the PI with experimental groups working on semiconductor- as well as superconductor-circuit based light-matter platforms. \r\n\r\nThrough the education component, the PI aims to melt the boundaries between the fields of condensed matter physics, quantum optics, photonics and atomic optics. In-classroom and hands-on research experiences will be enriched by organization of workshops and summer schools that target the formation of a new community of scientists and engineers that can operate at interfaces of traditional disciplines. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research and education to explore novel properties of interacting light-matter systems. Light-matter interactions can be enhanced by placing optically active quantum materials into an optical resonator, a system of mirrors arranged so that light a particular frequency is trapped and enhanced. Under these conditions, when either the light-confining medium or the material system is complex or composed of a large number of interacting components, unusual phases of light and matter can be generated and studied in a controlled setting. These novel `materials? of light and matter are sustained away from the steady state of equilibrium.  Many natural and technological systems including living organisms are anchored on processes far from equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe study of collective effects and correlated states of photons represents an emerging area, bringing together researchers from condensed matter physics, quantum optics, atomic and molecular optics and photonics. The next generation of optoelectronic devices will require an unprecedented control over light-matter interactions. This research contributes to the foundations of future device technologies.\r\n\r\nThe PI aims to develop an educational program that will melt the traditional boundaries between the fields of condensed matter physics, quantum optics, photonics and atomic optics. The research will generate new approaches, tools and concepts that will be part of the curriculum of the next-generation educational programs in quantum science and engineering. In-classroom and hands-on research experiences will be enriched by organization of workshops and summer schools that targets the formation of a new community of scientists and engineers that can operate at interfaces of traditional disciplines.",
