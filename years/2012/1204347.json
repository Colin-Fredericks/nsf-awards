 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last several years, Georgetown University has espoused a\r\npolicy of growth for its science departments.  This project supports\r\nGeorgetown University's growth goals by positing a multifaceted\r\nresearch program that explores new techniques for processing large\r\ncollections of text data.\r\n\r\nThe project examines how both new and existing text processing methods\r\nmay be applied to a variety of open problems across different\r\ndisciplines within computer science.  Research activities include text\r\nmining for large-scale document collections; machine learning\r\ntechniques for detecting malicious executables; information retrieval\r\nmethods for performing proactive digital forensic investigations; text\r\nprocessing approaches for preventing privacy breaches in encrypted\r\nvoice-over-IP (VoIP) communication; and data mining and sentiment\r\ndetection methods for automated content analysis of large quantities\r\nof political science texts.\r\n\r\nTo support these goals, the project includes the creation of a\r\nnext-generation infrastructure for large-scale text processing.\r\nData-intensive tasks will use interconnected front-end systems,\r\nconnected via high-speed networking to scalable back-end storage\r\nsolutions.  The infrastructure supports the development and testing of\r\nnovel text processing algorithms on very large corpora.\r\n\r\nThe project's themes of text processing and information assurance have\r\nbeen integrated into the undergraduate and graduate curricula at\r\nGeorgetown University.  More broadly, the project benefits society by\r\nimproving the ability to (1) process large quantities of information,\r\n(2) identify malicious applications, and (3) improve the resiliency of\r\ndigital communication networks to eavesdropping attacks.  The project\r\nbroadens the participation in research through the University's Summer\r\nPrograms for High School Students and the Center for Multicultural\r\nEquity and Access.\r\n",
