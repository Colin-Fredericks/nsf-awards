 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds Ellenor J Brown of the Georgia Institute of Technology to conduct a research project, entitled \"Muscle Training Effects from Physical Interaction with a Wearable Robotic System,\" during the summer of 2012 at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) in Nara, Japan.  The host scientist is Dr. Tsukasa Ogasawara.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the research project is to gain a better understanding of muscle coordination in healthy adults, information that may be useful for understanding  and rehabilitating muscle coordination disorders and for target muscle training for fitness and conditioning.  Muscle coordination is being monitored using an exoskeleton robot worn by the subjects.  The long-term goal of the project is to develop ways to predict and alter muscle coordination for a given movement task.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.",

The user specifies the position of the arm, a baseline condition with forces and moments applied at the hand, the muscles to be targeted, and how much the user wants the activation of the target muscles to change.  The program predicts which forces and moments to apply to the hand to make the specified muscle activation changes.  The past experiment used a wearable exoskeleton to control the joints of the wearers as they held a weight in their right hand. The subjects\u00c6 muscle activation was measured by using electromyography (EMG).  In the recent study, subjects held the handle of a robotic arm and resisted the movement of the handle.  The researchers measured EMG and took an ultrasound of the muscle in order to measure changes in muscle stiffness as the activation of the muscles changed.\nFor this study, eleven healthy male subjects were recruited.
