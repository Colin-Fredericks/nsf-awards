 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robust modeling of both strength and orientation of anisotropic\r\nstructure is a tantalizing tool for constraining the dynamic processes in the lithospheric and\r\nsub-lithospheric mantle beneath North America, directly meeting the Earthscope goals of understanding\r\nthe active deformation of North America and tying it to deep Earth structure and\r\ndynamics. The long term goal of this research is to develop more detailed regional and global\r\nmodels of seismic anisotropy that can both illuminate the dynamic processes of the upper mantle,\r\nas well as allowing for direct comparison with geodynamically predicted models. The\r\nobjective of this EAGER application, which is the next step towards this long-term goal, is to\r\ndevelop a new approach to image dynamic processes in the lithospheric and sub-lithospheric\r\nmantle beneath North America with a novel technique combining both body wave and surface\r\nwave observables that allows for finite-frequency vectorial tomography. The international collaboration\r\nproposed here is uniquely suited to bring these approaches the PI and the research\r\ngroup of S\u00b4ebastien Chevrot have been working on together and take advantage of the incredible\r\ndataset offered by the USArray transportable array to move towards obtaining an unprecedented\r\nmodel of anisotropic structure beneath North America. The project will develop these models\r\nby pursuing the following specific aims. 1) Perform synthetic testing of joint inversions using\r\nthis new approach. The inversions will allow us to gain unprecedented information about both\r\nstrength and orientation of anisotropy. 2) Assemble and process USArray shear splitting and\r\nsurface wave data and merge and improve existing software between the two research groups.\r\nDense data coverage of both splitting intensity and multi-taper fundamental mode phase delay\r\nwill be possible, and since both approaches have been developed from a consistent elastic parameterization,\r\nmerging the software and performing joint inversions of the data shows great\r\npotential for greatly improving the capabilities of anisotropic modeling.",
