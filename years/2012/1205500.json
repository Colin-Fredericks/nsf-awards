 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support continued research at the University of California, Santa Barbara into a quantum theory of gravity and its application to cosmology. James Hartle will investigate the principles which determine the quantum state of the universe and the generalizations of quantum mechanics necessary to understand it. Gary Horowitz will investigate the gravitational aspects of string theory, a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. Don Marolf will explore interacting quantum matter around black holes and in cosmology.\r\n\r\nThis work in centered in the ongoing quest of physics for a unified theory of nature's fundamental forces and the origin of the universe. These are subjects not only of great interest to scientists but also the general public. By engaging the interest of students and the public, the principal investigators hope to encourage general appreciation for science.  In addition, the project will develop human resources for science and technology by training graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in advanced techniques.",
