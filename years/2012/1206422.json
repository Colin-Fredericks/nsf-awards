 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomical adaptive optics systems can be classified into two basic types: 1) a standard telescope equipped with an adaptive optics bench that includes transfer optics, wavefront sensors, filters, and one or more deformable mirrors, and 2) a system that incorporates an adaptive secondary mirror (ASM) directly into the telescope itself, reducing the number of reflections and preserving a clean optical system all the way to the instrument focus.  The latter scheme is in some ways more difficult and expensive to achieve, but has demonstrated the highest on-telescope image quality, as well as providing far better performance in the infrared.\r\n\r\nThe sole example of installed ASM technology in the southern hemisphere is the 585 actuator secondary installed by Dr. Laird Close and collaborators from The University of Arizona and Arcetri Observatory (Italy) on the 6.5m Clay Magellan telescope at Las Campanas, Chile.  With the mirror now in place, Dr. Close is planning instrumental upgrades to make use of the greatly sharpened images.  Two improvements are proposed: 1) enhanced electronics and a ?smart?, high-speed shutter that will limit exposure only to intervals of excellent correction and thereby enable high-resolution imaging in the optical (wavelengths of ~0.6 nm), and 2) precise coronagraphic masks and vibration control to allow 1-5 micron imaging and spectroscopy of sources in the AO-sharpened field with a bright central object obscured.   Initial science to be performed with these systems includes high-contrast imaging of reflected visible light from mature giant exoplanets (a key step towards discovering true Earths), the mass-loss from evolved stars, structures of ionized gas regions around hot stars, surfaces of solar-system asteroids and moons, and high-contrast L and M band (3.5 and 5 microns) imaging/spectroscopy of newly-discovered young dusty exoplanets.\r\n\r\nDr. Close has demonstrated an excellent history of mentoring and collaborating with students and young faculty, and his current activities are no exceptions.  The new adaptive optics detector systems will also be made available to others with access to the Magellan telescopes, and hopefully to the general astronomical community when public access to privately-funded facilities is renegotiated.\r\n\r\nFunding for the development of new imaging and spectroscopic capabilities for the Magellan telescope adaptive optics systems is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.",

(See fig 2: Close et. al. 2013).\nRemoving the \"twinkle\" From the Stars in Visible Light\n\nThe reason for the factor of 2 improvement over past efforts is that,  for the first time, a large 6.5m telescope is being used for digital  photography at its theoretical resolution limit in wavelengths of  visible light. As you move from infrared to visible light, your image  sharpness improves.

HST has always produced the best  available visible light images, since until now even large ground-based  telescope with complex adaptive optics imaging cameras could only make  \"blurry\" images in light that the eye can see (visible light). To obtain  the excellent correction of atmospheric turbulence required for \"visible  light AO\", the team developed a very powerful adaptive optics system  that floats a thin (1/16 inch (1.6 mm) thick) curved glass mirror (2.7  feet (85 cm) across) on a magnetic field 30 feet (9.2m) above the large  21 foot (6.5m) primary mirror of the telescope (see figure 1).

This has lead to over 15 ApJ papers in the exciting field of exoplanet science already. \n\nFor example, MagAO discovered the widest planetary system then know HD106906b (See figure 3).\n\nMagAO also imaged extraSolar planets in the Visible for the first time (Males et al. 2014). See Figure 4.\n\nMagAO was also the first system to discover accreting \"Halpha\" objects inside the gaps of disks of gas and dust around young stars (Close et al. 2014). See figure 5.\n\nMagAO was also able to use its visible wavelengths to discover the famous planet 1RXS 1609b was really found to be a brown dwarf hiding behind a disk of dust around it --making it appear planet like (faint and red). See Wu et al. 2015 and see Figure 6.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/15/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laird M Close"
