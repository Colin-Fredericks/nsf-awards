 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's request partial support for the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) Summit \"A New Decade for an Integrated and Sustained Ocean Observing System\". The 2002 Ocean.US Workshop \"Building Consensus: Toward an Integrated and Sustained Ocean Observing System\",  in Warrenton, Virginia March 10-15, 2002 set the stage for the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). Ten years later, IOOS has evolved significantly to meet the nation?s ocean observing needs. Looking ahead at the next ten years, with the foundation of an integrated system now in place, the ocean observing community can begin planning how to optimize technical, scientific, and management components. The Interagency Ocean Observation Committee (IOOC) is planning this IOOS Summit, the week of November 12, 2012, to help give voice to the work of various ocean observers, researchers, scientists, and policy expert-led subgroups charged with identifying practical solutions to enhancing IOOS capabilities through the next decade.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:     \r\n\r\nThis Summit is all about bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders to discuss the future of ocean observing systems. The Summit will set the stage for planning the next ten years, including how to optimize technical, scientific, management, and policy components.",
