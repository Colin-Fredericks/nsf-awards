 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description:  Vanadium dioxide exhibits a reversible insulator-to-metal transition that can be initiated optically with femtosecond lasers, and is thus potentially ideal for high-speed electronic, photonic and memory devices.  This research project addresses two challenges to the realization of this potential:  First, the insulator-to-metal transition is fast (sub-picosecond), but the metal-to-insulator transition is slow (sub-nanosecond) because it requires a rearrangement of crystal structure.  Second, scalable low-temperature thin-film fabrication has not been demonstrated for epitaxial vanadium-dioxide films on technologically useful substrates.     The activity addresses these issues by correlating materials properties (film morphology, substrate interactions, dopant concentration, lattice match, strain and crystalline phases) to the static and dynamic optical constants of the thin-film structures and to the time-dependent electronic response and lattice vibrations that govern the speed of the transition.  The relative merits of sputter, electron-beam and atomic-layer film-deposition techniques are assessed and the equilibrium optical and physical properties of the films are characterized by ellipsometry, X-ray diffraction and by high-resolution transmission-electron, Raman and X-ray photoelectron microscopy.  Dynamical optical properties are measured with femtosecond time resolution by visible, infrared and THz pump-probe spectroscopy, time-dependent ellipsometry, interferometric autocorrelation and photoelectron electron microscopy.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description.  Vanadium dioxide is a remarkable material that changes from an insulator to a metal in about a trillionth of a second when illuminated by a short burst of laser light, making it ideal for applications in telecommunications, electronics and optical computing.  The goal of this project is to optimize vanadium dioxide properties to make the fastest possible optical switch while developing fabrication tools to make vanadium dioxide thin-film devices on a size scale suitable for real-world applications.    The project promotes the development of the future science and engineering work force by training graduate students to think and work at the interdisciplinary boundary between science and engineering.  The research fosters work-force diversity by recruiting a graduate student from, and collaborating with researchers at, two universities that serve underrepresented populations.  Undergraduate students involved in the research present the concept of optical switching to local high school students through Vanderbilt Students Volunteering for Science.  Statewide impact on future science and engineering undergraduates is fostered by a long-standing interaction between the graduate students and the annual Tennessee Governor's School for Emerging Technologies.  The research project also motivates ongoing dialogue with industrial partners who are developing technologies based on vanadium dioxide.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Vanadium dioxide (VO2), discovered at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in the late 1950s, is now being intensively studied around the world because of its potential for applications ranging from thermal control surfaces to ultrafast optical and electronic switches.  The scientific basis for these potential technologies rests on the fact that vanadium dioxide can change from an semiconductor to an insulator by applying heat, pressure, mechanical stress or light; this semiconductor-to-metal transition (SMT) is accompanied by a change in crystal structure (Image 1) as well as by large differences in electrical resistivity and optical transmission.  Our project was focused on the latter possibilities.  It required mastering the art of fabricating this material in the form of thin films and then learning how to use these films as components of simple optical devices, such as nanometer-size antennas and as an optical switch in a silicon modulator called a ring resonator (Image 2) &ndash; at switching speeds as fast as a trillionth of a second (that?s a millionth of a millionth of a second!).k  For reference, the ring in the left image is less than one tenth the diameter of a human hair.\nThin vanadium dioxide films fabricated by different methods have fascinating surface structures, depending on the method and the surface on which the film is deposited, as shown in Image 3.  This has to do with the local strain between the film and the substrate as it forms, and on how well it wets and adheres to the surface.  Fortunately, vanadium dioxide works especially well on both silicon and transparent sapphire surfaces &ndash; meaning that it can be equally useful in both electronic and optical devices.  Since our interest is particularly in using light to switch the vanadium dioxide, we were especially pleased to find out that these differences in film morphology and substrate do not seem to matter.  As we see in Image 4, the speed at which the film turns on and off depends only on the energy density of the light pulse used to trigger the SMT.  If the energy density is low enough, the switching speed is a few trillionths of a second (the blue trace in Image 4) and the film turns metallic only for that very short time; if the energy density is too high, however, the VO2 turns metallic and takes a very long time to switch back to the semiconducting phase.  And it turns out that the required energy is just right for switching the ring resonator at ultrahigh speed.\nBased on these results we can now imagine an ultrafast switch or modulator that could fit on a computer chip, solving the major bottlenecks that now slow down large computing networks.  Such a modulator would be based on the ring resonator with a vanadium dioxide micropatch (red) like those shown in Image 2.  The concept is shown in Image 5.  When the vanadium dioxide is in the \"off\" or semiconducting state, the ring is strongly coupled to the waveguide, and stores signal pulses from the input side of the device rather than letting them pass through the waveguide.  On the other hand, when the vanadium dioxide patch is switched to the \"on\" state by a laser pulse (green), the ring no longer couples to the waveguide, and the signal pulses pass from input to output through the waveguide. Modulator assemblies made from such ring resonators could act as modulators, routing signals either from one chip to another or between computers and dramatically increasing data-transport and signal-processing rates.\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/19/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard F Haglund"
