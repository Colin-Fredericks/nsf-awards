 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do animals, including humans, cooperate? Cooperative behaviors often involve extraordinary precision for success. Consider, for example, the level of coordination and control that is necessary for an Olympic couples' figure skating. The goal of the project is to understand how the brains of two or more individual animals integrate sensory cues to modulate an animal's motor systems to achieve these sorts of remarkable performances. The investigators will study a well-suited animal model system, the plain-tailed wren, which produces a cooperative duet song that is unusually amenable to behavioral and neurophysiological experiments. The investigators will travel to the natural habitats of these birds in the Andes Mountains and work with undergraduates and under-represented students from the United States and Ecuador. These students will be trained to conduct the technically complex experiments, which involve the analysis of brain activity of single neurons. The project will also develop research infrastructure in Ecuador, which will be used in teaching efforts for students from the United States and other countries, and in monitoring of animal activity in unique Andean habitats. These experiments will elucidate the specific neural mechanisms and computations that are used in the coordination of vocal behavior between individual wrens. Because birds and other vertebrate animals (including humans) use nearly identical neural structures and mechanisms, these data will have implications that are relevant across animal species. The work will also include the construction of mathematical models that capture the findings, which will facilitate the translation of insights from the brains of these unique animals to the study of other species and into engineering principles and applications.",

In order for individuals to cooperate, brain circuits in each individual must integrate information both from the animal&rsquo;s own movement and from sensory cues produced by the partner. Discovering the mechanisms by which animals coordinate their behavior is critical for understanding social behavior in animals including humans, and for the development of sophisticated algorithms for the coordination of interactions between humans and machines. For this project, we identified a unique species of songbird known as the plain-tailed wren (Figure 1) which have an adaptation that makes them well-suited for the study cooperation. These wrens sing an extraordinary duet in which the male and female alternate syllable production very rapidly, often with less than a tenth of a second in between syllables (Figure 2). This behavior requires the birds to coordinate their own singing patterns with sensory cues from their partner. We had two major aims for this proposal: To quantify the parameters of duet singing behavior in plain-tailed wrens and to determine the neural basis for the coordination of duetting.</p>\n<p>These birds live on the slopes of the Andes in Ecuador, so all experiments were conducted in Ecuador. In order to understand which sensory cues are necessary to coordinate the motor program in each bird we examined the role of visual and auditory input in duet production from observations of birds in their natural habitat and from experiments conducted with pairs of birds in the field laboratories (Figure 3). We found that visual cues were not necessary for duet projection, but that auditory cues were critical in the timing of the duet. Further, these wrens are located in different regions of Ecuador and we found that these birds have different dialects, as humans have different dialects. We also found that the wrens have very complex duets that have general rules in the structure of the song, but each individual produces many different syllable types. This is like jazz musicians who innovate music that has a particular structure, but the details of the specific notes can change. For the wrens, auditory input from the partner determines the timing and structure of the syllables. These behavioral data framed the experiments in which we determined the neural mechanisms of coordinated behavior.</p>\n<p>As auditory information was critical for duet production, we first examined the auditory responses in the bird brain in neurophysiological recordings of anesthetized animals (Figure 4, bottom traces). We found that the brains of both males and female wrens respond best to complete duets. In addition, neurons in both males and females had a larger response to female syllables, suggesting that females may lead the duet and provide critical timing cues for the coordination of duet performances.</p>\n<p>To understand how the brain of each individual responds during a duet we recorded from awake birds as they sang duet songs. We recorded from an area of the brain called HVC that is a site of sensorimotor integration. Surprisingly, we did not find evidence of auditory responses in HVC during singing, despite the fact acoustic cues are essential for the coordination of duets in both males and females. Instead, we observed premotor activity related to each bird&rsquo;s own singing (Figure 4, top traces). These data suggest that HVC contains a circuit that generates the pattern for song, but that auditory cues from the partner must be integrated in other parts of the brain. These data may fundamentally shift the current models for the circuitry of song production in song birds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Broader Impacts achieved under this award included an integrated program of teaching and development at an R1 university and a liberal arts college in the US, and a university in Ecuador. We conducted two neuroethology courses in Ecuador that combined the strengths of US students with Ecuadorian students. We also included Ecuadorian students in all of our research and teaching activities in Ecuador. Through these activities, three Ecuadorian students have pursued advanced degrees in the US. It has also contributed to the education of students in the US, three of whom are now in graduate school.
