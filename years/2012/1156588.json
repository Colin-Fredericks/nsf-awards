 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n \r\nThe international workshop on Safe Global Water(SGW): Building Partnerships for Sustainable Global Access to Safe Water and Sanitation will address the global challenge of fostering the economic growth of the most impoverished one billion people of the world by improving their quality of life and productivity through access to safe water for human consumption and food security, and sanitation for resource recovery (energy, nutrients) and revenue generation. To achieve this, the SGW workshop will bring together an unprecedented global coalition of researchers from social and natural sciences, and engineering coupled with global stakeholders and practitioners from government and international agencies, non-governmental organizations, and industry. The following workshop objectives are highly resonant with EFRI: (1) Explore effective strategies based on cutting edge research co-located at U.S. and target nations to make revolutionary advances in science and technology in safe water and sanitation while simultaneously building capacity into higher education institutions; and (2) Explore innovative approaches to impact technology design, acceptance, and sustainability through integrated multinational teams of engineers partnered with social and natural scientists. The SGW international workshop will bring stakeholders from around the world to address the challenges of providing safe water and sanitation to developing countries and emerging communities. This challenge can only be addressed with transformational advances in safe water and sanitation technologies that are developed for the socio-cultural contexts in which they will be used. Such advances require a global coalition of strategically selected academic, entrepreneurial, industrial, practitioner, governmental, and NGO partners. This workshop will form the foundation upon which existing and new partnerships can be grown. Having all of the stakeholders, academic and otherwise, together for an intensive workshop will allow a new paradigm in safe water and sanitation solutions that will be technically and socially sustainable.  This international gathering of research and policy leaders with a vested interest in Safe Global Water will represent: universities, national agencies, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, industry, and graduate students. This workshop will have at its focus an unprecedented engagement of basic scientists, engineers, social scientists, policy makers, and stakeholders to create a plan to solve the technical SGW needs of the target countries while simultaneously building human capacity and micro-marketplaces within locally sustainable socio-cultural contexts. The targeted outcome of the workshop to formulate and initiate research on safe global water and sanitation at the boundaries of basis science, engineering, and social sciences through higher education based international collaborations is a paradigm shift that will lead to fundamental advances in the understanding of safe water and sanitation issues while also producing an interdisciplinary and international education environment that will better prepare U.S. students for working in the ever growing global research context.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSafe Global Water and Sanitation Summit\n January 30-Feb 1st, 2013\n Arusha, Tanzania\n\nBy bringing together world renowned water experts with diverse cultural perspectives and professional backgrounds, the Safe Global Water &amp; Sanitation Summit in Arusha, Tanzania, created the ideal context for future collaborations reaching across geographic, political, and disciplinary boundaries. Moving forward from the inspiration and interactions of the Summit, participants are already engaging in partnerships that take innovative approaches to helping East Africa and the developing world build a future with safe water and adequate sanitation.  New global partnerships of academic institutions, government agencies, industrial affiliates, innovators, non-governmental organizations, and practitioners are embarking on synergistic activities to maximize the impact of their efforts in the region.  Here are representative activities by one of the key Summit sponsors, the Safe Global Water Institute (SGWI).\n\nSGWI-Tanzania Program: Assessment Phase\n\nThe SGWI will collaborate with Oikos East Africa, Population Services International (PSI), Community Based Health Care Center (CBHCC) and Netherlands Development Organization (SNV) on the activities of a student design course sponsored by the SGWI and WaterCAMPWS, a NSF Science and Technology Center.  Graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (USA), Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology (Tanzania), and the University of Nairobi (Kenya) have already visited three communities in Tanzania that have safe water and sanitation issues.  The students tested source waters, distribution points, in-home purification systems, alternate energy sources for cook stoves, and conducted assessment surveys with villagers to better understand their local priorities and needs.  Students will work on solutions for these communities.  This effort is supported by the Honorable Mizengo Pinda Prime Minister of Tanzania and receives additional financial support from the U.S. Office of Naval Research (USA) and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (Saudi Arabia).\n\nSGWI-Tanzania Program: Market Literacy / Advanced Water Testing\n\nIn collaboration with our partners at Instituto Oikos and PSI, researchers from the SGWI will return to the test-bed communities in Tanzania visited by design course students during the Assessment Phase.  The goal of this visit is to gain additional seasonal water quality data, explore additional communities, and develop an economic sustainability plan for our efforts based on microfinance and market literacy research. \n\n \n\nSGWI-Uganda Program: Safe Water &amp; Nutrition \n\nResearchers from SGWI, Tufts University, and Mekerere University will be broadening existing nutrition and health activities to include a better understanding of the impact of safe water and sanitation on community health in Uganda.  Water and Health has become an important component of the USAID global effort; SGWI is honored to have been chosen to help address these needs.\n\nBeyond this small sampling of SGWI projects, a broad range of real-world, solutions-oriented collaborations are under development among the academic, innovation, and implementation partners who attended the Safe Global Water &amp; Sanitation Summit.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/26/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benito J Marinas"
