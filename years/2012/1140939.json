 "awd_abstract_narration": "This innovative software development course is developing and testing a novel approach to computer science instruction at San Francisco State University and California State University Los Angeles. In classrooms emulating typical industry work environments, students are collectively creating and building a Multiplayer Online Game using a variety of complex software components. In the process, students are developing: (1) effective communication, presentation, collaboration and trouble-shooting skills; (2) heightened motivation to master core computer science content; (3) a robust end product; and (4) practical insights to prepare them for successful careers in industry.\r\n\r\nThe scalable game programming course includes a suite of instructional materials with accompanying documentation, all of which are being made freely available to the educational community. Materials can be flexibly adopted by computer science instructors including those who do not have sufficient background to develop multiplayer online game programming or senior-level software design courses on their own.\r\n\r\nThe project is a collaboration of two campuses in the California State University System--one of the nation's largest and most ethnically diverse systems of higher education--and is being disseminated regionally and nationally. The innovative course design appeals to students who have not traditionally been attracted to STEM education, including many from minorities underrepresented in the sciences that enroll in large numbers at the two pilot campuses. The project reaches out to the public by making the student-produced games freely available, thereby playfully exposing non-scientists to essential computer science concepts and potentially inspiring young people to consider careers in software development.",

Explaining these two game mechanics will provide a general idea about the complexities of games and common code base, how the class was organized, and how the course materials, tools, and guidelines can be used to manage this class.</p>\n<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; World of Balance is a persistent virtual world where many players can register, log-in, chat with other players, check their ranking, and play various mini-games. This virtual world is called lobby and players can play a single player game, host multiplayer game or join a multiplayer game that is waiting for opponents. World of Balance game is an ecology educational game, so the theme of the mini games include understanding prey-predator relationship and population dynamics. It consists of several mini mages: &ldquo;Clash of Species inspired by Clash of Clans&rdquo; &ldquo;Cards of Wild inspired by HeartStone,&rdquo; &ldquo;Running Rhino&rdquo; platform-based racing game, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Eat Me inspired by Plant vs. Zombie, &rdquo; and &ldquo;Sea Dividened&rdquo; (Figure 1)</p>\n<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Debugger also has a persistent virtual world where many players can register, log-in, chat with other players, check their ranking and play various mini-games.

Students will interact with each other both to finish their team assignments and to integrate their team-produced components into the larger product development cycle. Students and teams will be involved in numerous presentations to report on their progress both within the teams and across the entire class.</p>\n<p>(2) <em>Motivate students to learn essential CS core content</em> (3D graphics, networks, databases, software engineering) by making learning experience relevant and fun, thereby increasing student engagement in the course.</p>\n<p>(3) <em>Enable students to produce a robust end product</em>, a game that can be played by the public and that can be continuously expanded by other students in future classes.</p>\n<p>(4) <em>Give students insights into the real-world environment of the computer industry</em> to expose them to the challenges of a CS career (complex code base, large team communication, using Git for parallel development) and prepare for them.</p>\n<p>During the project period, this course was offered at SFSU (in Spring) 4 times and CSULA (in Fall) 3 times.
