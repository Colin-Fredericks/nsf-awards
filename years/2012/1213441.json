 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this RUI Award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Professor LuAnne McNulty of Butler University to study the preparation and reactions of alkenyl cyclic boronic half esters.  Alkenyl cyclic boronic half esters are readily prepared by transesterification of homoallylic alcohols with alkenylboronic acids, followed by ring closing metathesis.  Alkenyl cyclic boronic half esters are suitable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions with aryl halides and beta-halo-alpha,beta-unsaturated electrophiles.  The Suzuki-Miyaura affords products that are capable of undergoing an intramolecular oxa-Michael reaction to generate dihydropyrans.  The optimization of a single pot tandem Suzuki-Miyaura/Michael reaction will be studied through the modification of the base beta-halo-alpha,beta-unsaturated electrophiles used in the coupling reaction.  \r\n\t\t\r\nThe proposed work strives to provide an alternate method to the preparation of dihydropyrans, common natural product substructural units.  In addition, the work could allow one to set  multiple stereoisomers of the same dihydropyran by modification of substituents on the precursor alkenyl cyclic boronate.  The educational broader impacts of this project involve training undergraduate students.  The PI will continue her strong history of mentoring women in synthetic research.  Undergraduate students that participate in this project will gain valuable experience in modern synthetic chemistry, including organo-boron and transition metal-mediated chemistry, and will have opportunities to present their work at regional and national meetings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary scientific aim of the project was to develop a reliable route to cis-alkenes because they are found in a variety of naturally occurring compounds that possess interesting biological activity. Cis-alkenes are difficult to prepare due to the fact that they are less stable than trans-alkenes, which means that most methods available for making alkenes favor the formation of trans-alkenes.  \n\nThe method proposed utilized a cyclic vinyl boronic half acid which served as the template for building the new cis-alkenes.  Two advantages of the method were (1) the ease of preparation of the cyclic template and (2) the availability of methods for linking the key part of the template with other groups to make the cis-alkenes.  The research demonstrated that the proposed methodology was moderately effective at making the desired cis-alkenes. \n\nThe broader impacts of the reward were positive.  Ten students participated in the research, which provided those students with exposure to research and helped them develop critical thinking skills and problem solving skills.  Of the students that were supported by the grant, two of the students went on to graduate school and seven either enrolled in medical school or dental school.  Six women were involved in the project.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Luanne Mcnulty"
