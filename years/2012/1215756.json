 "awd_abstract_narration": "The profound influence of repulsive colloid-surface interactions on colloid transport under environmental conditions (so-called unfavorable conditions) has rendered quantitative prediction of colloid transport in porous media under these conditions unattainable to date.  A major question is whether surfaces can generally be interpreted/categorized in terms of a bulk repulsive surface that includes attractive ?heterodomains? of given size and spatial frequency (surface coverage).  Specifically, it is unknown whether characterizing surfaces in this way allows prediction of colloid transport in porous media under unfavorable conditions.  This discrete heterogeneity model predicts (and experiments indicate) that a fraction of colloids in the fluid surrounding a porous media grain will spend long residence times in the near-surface fluid due to weak attractive interactions, which raises another fundamental question: how do the long residence times of colloids in the near-surface fluid under unfavorable conditions influence transport behavior at the Darcy scale?  What scale-up strategies are needed to recognize the influence of long near-surface residence times?   We posit that these long near-surface residence times yield incomplete mixing of colloids across the fluid domain, necessitating memory function/multirate or correlated random walk approaches to upscaling.  Our recently-developed mechanistic model with heterodomains captures colloid transport and retention behavior at the pore scale under unfavorable conditions.  This model will serve as the platform from which to scale up predictions to the Darcy scale under unfavorable conditions.  The model results will be compared to experimental results for colloid transport in an impinging jet and in porous media for a range of colloid sizes, solution ionic strengths, and fluid velocities.  We anticipate producing a mechanistic model that will predict the extent and mode of colloid retention under unfavorable conditions. \r\n\r\nThis project will represent unfavorable surfaces in numerical models of colloid transport in order to provide mechanistic prediction of colloid retention during transport in porous media.  The results of this mechanistic model will be used to explore the influence of colloid-surface interaction on strategies to upscale transport prediction from the pore to the Darcy scale.  This project will greatly enhance our ability to predict colloid transport under environmental conditions, in contexts such as pathogen transport in the environment, and targeted delivery of bacteria with novel metabolic properties.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the primary measures of water quality in hydrology and environmental engineering is the \"Total Suspended Solids,\" (TSS) that is, the amount of suspended particulate material present in the water.  The control of TSS is a critical step in the treatment of drinking water supplies and the treatment of waste water from municipal and industrial water uses.  It is also an important element of remediation of contaminated groundwater and the design of filters for removal of potentially pathogenic microbes.  This research project focused on the fundamental physics and fluid mechanics that govern what happens to particulate matter, known as colloids, when water containing these colloids moves through granular porous media, which is commonly used as a filter.  We developed computer models of how colloids move with the water and how they interact with the surfaces of the filter in order to develop a predictive model of the efficiency of filters in general.  Our objective was to develop an equation that predicted the rate of removal of colloids in water passage through a filter with given properties, such as grain sizes, water flow rate, and electrostatic properties.  Also included are colloid properties such as colloid size, density, and electrostatic surface properties.  Our primary finding is that the way filters work is controlled largely by the balance between diffusion forces and surface interaction forces when the colloid gets close to surfaces, and that the current state-of-the-art in the theoretical basis for representing  colloid-surface interactions overestimates the efficiency of filters for most colloids.  Our research suggests that more improvements should be made in the way we understand and represent colloid diffusion near surfaces in general.  Furthermore, our work discovered a new way to solve the challenging mathematical problem of calculating the net interaction forces between a colloid and an arbitrarily curved surface.  This is one of the most important steps in figuring out how filters work in removing colloids, and it has broader impacts in mathematical physics in general because these sort of calculations are required in a wide range of fields.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/12/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy R Ginn"
