 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Symposium on Rice Functional Genomics (ISRFG) is an annual event that serves as a global platform to highlight cutting edge, multidisciplinary basic and applied research in rice and its translation to the field. The ISRFG attracts plant scientists from around the world to share new information and techniques, to encourage intellectual exchanges, and most importantly, to help develop the careers of young scientists and trainees. \u201cRice Research for Global Food Security\u201d is the theme of the 21st ISRFG meeting which will be held in Little Rock (AR), September 9-11, 2024. Topics will include rice/cereal genomics, germplasm characterization, trait discovery, GWAS for QTL identification, genomic prediction and machine learning, molecular breeding and gene editing.\r\n\r\nThe ISRFB is designed to promote advances in rice research made by the international research community, provide opportunities for participants to learn about the latest developments in structural, functional, and evolutionary genomics and genetics research, and facilitate international collaborations. NSF funds will be used to allow U.S.-based early career scientists - students, postdoctoral scholars, and pre-tenure investigators - from underrepresented groups in STEM and those from the rural parts of the U.S. to participate in the ISRFG. Their participation ensures the future of the broader rice research community and the participation of women and scientists from rural America promotes research and education of the underrepresented groups in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
