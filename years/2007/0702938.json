 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is building on two prior NSF-supported projects that identified thirteen separate and unique certification areas in the avionics and electronics technician career-field.  In these earlier projects the investigators developed standards, curricula, and certification testing for four of the areas (aircraft electronics, navigation systems, communication systems, and avionics and electronics system installation and integration), and they are completing the remaining ones on the current project. In doing this, they are establishing aviation industry defined and endorsed avionics and electronics standards; developing and publishing curriculum with lesson plans and student study guides for each standard; and establishing an industry recognized certification program for avionics and electronics technicians.  The investigators also have a K-12 outreach initiative that involves summer workshops for teachers and counselors, FAA Aviation Career Education (ACE) Academy workshops, and a shared program with American Airlines C.R. Smith Museum.  All the educational materials are available to secondary schools nationally.  Evaluation, being conducted by independent evaluators, involves pre and post tests and structured interviews to monitor progress toward the project's outcomes.  The investigators are disseminating their work through presentations and exhibits at major aviation conferences and trade shows, through journal publications, and through an on-line newsletter.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the developed material and the  K-12 outreach programs.",
