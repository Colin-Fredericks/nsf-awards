 "awd_abstract_narration": "There will be an international conference on Algebra and Related Areas\r\nheld in Beijing during August 18-20, 2007.  The conference will be\r\nsupported by Qinghua University,  Institute of System Sciences, Chinese\r\nAcademy of Sciences and National Science Foundation of China. The funding\r\nfrom the NSF will support American mathematicians who will speak or participate\r\nin the conference. There will be 18 talks by prominent people covering\r\ntopics of current interest such as infinite dimensional Lie algebras, vertex operator\r\nalgebras, representation theory, algebraic geometry, number theory,\r\ncomputational group theory, combinatorics, and application of algebra in\r\nother fields. The goal of the proposed conference is to present some of\r\nthe most important advances in algebra and related areas and to discuss\r\nfuture research directions. A major part of the conference focuses on\r\nbringing mathematical leaders together with students, postdoctoral fellows\r\nand young academics in a stimulating environment.\r\n\r\nThe conference has chosen two women professors from US universities as\r\nmain speakers so the broad participation can be achieved.\r\nAlso the senior mathematicians from US institutions can attract and\r\nrecruit best Chinese students to do graduate study in US. The\r\nconference will help to strengthen the communication and cooperation\r\nbetween algebra communities in US and China.\r\n",
