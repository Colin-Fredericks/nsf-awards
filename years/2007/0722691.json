 "awd_abstract_narration": "The understanding of fluid motion and heat transfer is fundamental in solving some of mankind's most pressing scientific problems. Some examples include: 1) understanding how heat is transferred between the oceans and atmosphere to improve global climate models and better understand the impact of climate change, 2) development of methods to sequester carbon dioxide, before it is emitted into the atmosphere, in underground wells by studying how carbon dioxide is transported through rocks, and 3) understanding how the motion of fluid inside of bones affects how bones grow, develop, age, and respond to diseases such as osteoporosis. The acquisition of a stereoscopic Molecular Tagging Velocimetry/Molecular Tagging Thermometry (sMTV/MTT system will provide unique experimental capabilities for investigation of the fluid-flow and  fluid-structure interaction aspects of these problems. The MTV/MTT system will enhance collaborative research across academic departments and disciplines, provide state-of-the-art instrumentation for training of graduate and undergraduate students interested in emerging areas of engineering mechanics and biology, and help in the recruitment of students from underrepresented groups by adding advanced experimental capabilities to fluid-flow laboratory and wind tunnel facilities. This equipment will enhance experiential project-based learning, and aid in soliciting students to participate to such projects. It will positively impact outreach to the K-12 community of students and teachers through laboratory demonstrations and web site displays. The final outcome of acquisition of this equipment will be to support the educational mission of Clarkson University on multiple levels through the training and involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in educational experiences outside of the classroom.",
