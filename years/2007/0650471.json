This meeting is being held to commemorate the 20th anniversary of SN1987A.\r\n\r\nAll of the broad SN 1987A research topics will be covered, including theories for the nucleosynthesis and explosion mechanisms, progenitor stars, pulsar and supernova remnant formation, interaction with the circumstellar medium, and particle acceleration mechanisms.  Observations at all available wavelengths, and in non-electromagnetic emissions, will be discussed in detail, and the conference will expand to include other supernovae, supernova cosmology, and gamma-ray bursters.  The core program will comprise review and invited talks from an international set of highly respected speakers.  There will be contributed talks and poster presentations, as well as a public lecture.  The concentration of astronomers and astrophysicists from all parts of the world and from all of the subspecialties of the field will lead to a better understanding of supernovae and gamma-ray bursters and their effects on all areas of modern astrophysics.  Significant US and international participation will strongly enhance the broader impact of this meeting.",
