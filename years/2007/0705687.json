 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides a fundamental understanding the parameters that affect the nucleation and growth of organic semiconductors from vapor phase for the fabrication of large arrays of organic transistor devices with single crystal channels. Due to the polycrystalline nature of thin films, thin film devices rarely reach the high mobilities of single crystal devices due to trapping at grain boundaries. In order to significantly improve device performance, single crystals and single crystalline films are being provided to produce large arrays of single crystal devices for practical applications. Although technologically challenging, the realization of large arrays of single crystal devices will lead to dramatic performance improvement of organic semiconductor based devices. Detailed studies will be carried out to investigate effects of surface topology,\r\nchemical interactions between surface chemical functionalities and organic semiconductors, orientation of the chemical groups, ordering of the chemical groups, and distribution of chemical groups on the substrate surface.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\n Organic semiconductors are promising candidates as the active elements in plastic circuits, particularly those using field-effect transistors (FETs) as switching or\r\nlogic elements. Providing the mechanisms for patterning and investigating the numerous parameters that affect the nucleation and growth of organic semiconductors from\r\nvapor phase for the fabrication of large arrays of organic transistor devices with single crystal channels will advance an understanding of organic semiconductor nucleation and growth in general. This research will expose both under-represented graduate students and undergraduates to organic chemistry, surface chemistry, materials and thin film characterization, device fabrication, and device characterization. They will also learn the multidisciplinary approach to problem solving.\r\n",

This technique has since been widely used for modifying the dielectric surface for obtaining high quality semiconductor-dielectric interface, which is critical for obtaining high electronic performance.\n\nNew materials are typically discovered experimentally, with theoretical characterization providing only post-facto justification of the observed device performance. In our work, we utilized a computational screening procedure to guide chemical synthesis, which led to the discovery of a new high-performance semiconductor.8 This compound is one of the very few organic semiconductors that has exhibited mobility greater than 10 cm2 V-1 s-1. The study suggests that a computational screening approach can lead to the informed synthesis and characterization of novel organic materials for electronics applications.\n\nBroader Impact:\nThis work resulted in a systematic understanding of nucleation and growth in solution processing of organic semiconductors. This is crucial for advancing the field of organic electronics as well as providing insights for future manufacturing of these devices.  Our approach resulted in unprecedented performance of organic semiconductors. Since organic semiconductors are key components for organic light emitting diodes, organic solar cells, transistors and sensors, enhanced charge transport will result in better performance for these devices.\n \nWe have been committed to work closely with our existing NSF centers and Office of Science Outreach on campus to reac..."
