 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  research project is focused on the analytical aspects of the theory\r\nof integrable systems related to the Riemann-Hilbert  and isomonodromy\r\nmethods. The problems under consideration include: (a) the investigation\r\nof the  double scaling limits in the  theory of random matrices and\r\northogonal polynomials and their applications to the two-dimensional\r\nquantum gravity and enumerative topology; (b) the  asymptotic analysis\r\nof the Toeplitz and Fredholm determinants and the multiple integrals\r\nassociated with the correlation functions  of  exactly solvable quantum\r\nfield and statistical mechanics models; (c) the related aspects of  the\r\nglobal asymptotic analysis  of the solutions of integrable differential \r\nequations of the  Painleve' and KdV types. \r\n\r\nThe theory of integrable systems is an expanding area  which plays an\r\nincreasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new\r\nanalytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics\r\nand theoretical physics. At the same time, it provides an efficient\r\nanalytic tool for the study of some of the fundamental  mathematical\r\nmodels arising in  modern nonlinear science and technology. \r\nSpecifically,  the research directions indicated above deal with the\r\nmathematical models which form the  theoretical basis for the following\r\nfields: condensed matter, high energy and plasma physics, nonlinear\r\nhydrodynamics, high-bit rate telecommunication systems, and information\r\nscience. A special attention  in the project is given to  the  analysis\r\nof the distributions of random matrix theory which govern  statistical\r\nproperties of the  large systems which  do not  obey the usual laws of\r\nclassical probability. This kind of systems appear in many different\r\nareas of applied science and technology including heavy nuclei, polymer\r\ngrowth, high-dimensional data  analysis, and  certain percolation\r\nprocesses. Simultaneously, the random matrices are playing increasingly\r\nimportant role, as an extremely powerful analytic apparatus, in several\r\npure theoretical domains such as the string theory, enumerative topology\r\nand certain fundamental aspects of number theory.",
