The main focus of his research, the Cauchy\r\nproblem for the Einstein equations, interacts deeply with each of\r\nthese areas.  Among the topics considered in this proposal are\r\nglobal stability of cosmological models, the theory of marginally\r\ntrapped surfaces and dynamical horizons, and the structure of\r\ncosmological singularities. Andersson will attempt to prove that\r\nin the case of spacetime dimension at least eleven, there are\r\nfamilies of vacuum cosmological models which are globally stable,\r\nwith quiescent singularity.  In the 3+1 dimensional case, similar\r\nresults are expected to hold for the Einstein-scalar field\r\nequations.  Andersson and collaborators have recently been able\r\nto apply techniques developed in the theory of minimal surfaces\r\nto the case of stable marginally trapped surfaces, which play the\r\nrole of apparent horizons in general relativity. Andersson plans\r\nto pursue the connection between marginal surfaces and minimal\r\nsurfaces in his future research, and to apply these techniques\r\nalso to dynamical horizons.  In addition to the above topics,\r\nAndersson proposes a program of research using analytic and\r\nnumerical techniques, directed towards investigating the\r\nasymptotic behavior of general inhomogenous cosmologies near the\r\nsingularity.\r\n\r\nThe Einstein equations describe the geometry of spacetime, which\r\nin turn determines the motion of bodies (planets, stars,\r\ngalaxies) in space, as well as the dynamics of fields and\r\nparticles via their respective field theories. The geometric view\r\nof the universe provided by the Einstein equations has led to\r\nsome of the most fundamental and paradoxical features of our\r\npicture of the universe, including the initial spacetime\r\nsingularity or Big Bang and black holes. The mathematical study\r\nof spacetimes in extreme conditions such as near the Big Bang\r\nsingularity or near the singularity in black holes has led to a\r\nfar reaching conjecture called ``Cosmic Censorship'', which\r\nimplies that phenomena which violate the intuitive notions of\r\ncausality must be hidden (censored) from observers. In this\r\nproject, problems related to cosmic censorship are studied using\r\na combination of computer based and analytical techniques, with a\r\nparticular focus on the evolution of geometry from initial\r\nconditions.\r\n",
