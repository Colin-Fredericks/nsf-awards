One would like to have nice metric\r\nspaces on which a given group can act, either by isometries or\r\ntopologically; and to make them \"as canonical as possible\".  The\r\nprincipal investigator's symmetric join construction and the\r\nconformal metric on the boundaries of hyperbolic groups, and\r\nothers, were steps in this general direction. Ideally, one would\r\nlike to have a functorial construction that associates to every\r\ngroup in a given class (with a metric on it), say, a uniquely\r\ngeodesic metric space with a (cocompact, isometric, properly\r\ndiscontinuous) action by the group. This seems to be a very\r\ndifficult question (this is the kind of things that Perelman's\r\nRicci flow does to manifolds, and we essentially want its\r\nanalogue for general metric spaces).  This question is related to\r\nseveral major problems in topology and geometry.  Our goal is to\r\nmake further progress in this direction. Another goal is to\r\nfurther investigate how geometry of groups is reflected in\r\nvarious types of (co)homology, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nA metric space is one of the most important and most basic\r\nmathematical notions: it is a set of points in which one is given\r\nthe distance between any two points, with very natural\r\nproperties. All branches of mathematics use this notion. Our\r\nUniverse is an example of a metric space, and there is no reason\r\nfor it to look like the 3-dimensional Euclidean space at all. We\r\nare interested in understanding what kinds of metric spaces can\r\npossibly be there, and \"how good\" they can be.  For example, in\r\norder to be \"good\", one should at least be able to pass from one\r\npoint to another by a shortest possible path within the given\r\nspace. Manifolds considered by classical Riemannian geometry have\r\nthis property. We aim for a generalization of classical geometry\r\nfrom manifolds to metric spaces. One goal of this project is to\r\nexplicitly construct good metric spaces and to understand how\r\nthey form.  This simple idea is related to deep questions facing\r\nmodern mathematics.  As a by-product, this might give us more\r\ninsight to the structure and formation of our Universe. Our\r\noriginal motivation though is the beauty and mathematical\r\nimportance of the problem rather than any particular immediate\r\napplication.  (Our Universe is only a special case of a metric\r\nspace.)\r\n\r\n",
