This Center is being designed to (a) provide leadership opportunities for educating science and engineering technicians to meet the growing demand for a highly skilled workforce in the national energy industry, utilizing the proven pipeline model which was piloted at Central Virginia Community College; (b) assist other institutions to adapt this model; and (c) serve as a clearinghouse for educational materials and research-based educational methods.  The project focuses on the energy industry, defined as those organizations that are involved in the production and transmission of electric power, including fossil fuel, nuclear, and alternative energy. Planning activities include identifying the network leadership, developing regional partnerships, preparing partners to use the pipeline model, and securing all appropriate commitments.",
