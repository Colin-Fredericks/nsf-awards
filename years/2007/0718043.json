 "awd_abstract_narration": "David N. Beratan of Duke University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to design, analyze and interpret inelastic electron-transfer kinetics in molecules with bridge-localized vibrational modes.  He is developing interpretive and predictive descriptions of intramolecular inelastic electron-tunneling in a variety of molecules containing an electron donor, a rigid bridge, and an electron acceptor. This work is in collaboration with the experimental group of Rubtsov at Tulane to examine analogies between the double slit electron transmission experiment and the molecular electron-transfer problem.  The goal is to define new schemes to control electron transfer and to develop approaches to manipulate the strength of molecule-mediated electronic coupling.  This work is having a broad impact in developing intuition that may lead to applications in optical communication and solar energy harvesting.  The PI is promoting science education by providing summer research opportunities to economically disadvantaged and historically underrepresented groups.  A new course cluster for first-year students is under development to examine the fundamental philosophical foundations of science.",
