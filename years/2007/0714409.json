In 1999, the three United States sections of the international Combustion Institute - Eastern States, Central States, and Western States - initiated a biennial series of national meetings on combustion.  These meetings have been highly successful, based on the attendance and the number of presentations. Consequently, this biennial event has gained a prominent stature and become the premier national conference in fundamental and applied combustion. \r\n\r\nThe NSF funds will be targeted to provide partial travel support to graduate students and young researchers who make podium or poster presentations. The information about the availability of travel support to graduate students will be provided in all the meeting announcements and on appropriate websites. In addition, an announcement about the availability of travel support will be mailed to members of the Combustion Institute.\r\n\r\n",
