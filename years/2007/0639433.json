 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nelson\r\n0639433\r\nDrought is a normal part of climate for virtually all regions of the United States. Recent droughts have\r\nhighlighted the increasing vulnerability of all regions to drought-induced water shortages. Climate change\r\nand potential increases in the frequency, severity, and duration of drought episodes is further exacerbating\r\nwater management issues and conflicts among users. With mounting pressure on finite water supplies from\r\nexpanding and shifting population, urbanization, environmental degradation, and many other factors, it is\r\nimperative for the United States to consider a paradigm shift to a risk-based approach to drought\r\nmanagement.\r\nManaging Drought and Water Scarcity in Vulnerable Environments: Creating the Roadmap for Change in\r\nthe United States is the first national level meeting concerned with both the science and the policy of\r\ndrought management that involves stakeholders from many disciplines and perspectives and that is\r\nconvened for the purpose of creating a science- and policy-based briefing document. The goals of the\r\nmeeting are to create an integrated, interactive forum for understanding and improving our management of\r\ndrought and water scarcity in the United States, and to stimulate national debate through the publication\r\nand wide distribution of The Roadmap for Change, a science- and policy-based briefing document.\r\nThe meeting, which is convened by the Geological Society of America and 22 meeting partners, is\r\ndesigned to promote collaboration between the policy and science communities. A variety of formats will\r\nencourage attendee participation: plenary and invited talks, panel discussions, interactive roundtables and\r\nbreakout group discussions, and poster presentations of case studies and innovative research and outreach\r\nefforts. Invited speakers are among the best qualified in their respective disciplines, and represent a broad\r\nperspective on drought management. The key findings and recommendations of this meeting will be\r\ndistributed in electronic format as The Roadmap for Change. This science- and policy-based briefing\r\ndocument will identify needed scientific research for a more reliable and usable technical basis for public\r\npolicy decision-making, and identify successful, promising, and novel approaches to developing drought\r\nscience-based policies and programs.\r\nIt is important to have many perspectives represented, and many of the stakeholders will need financial\r\nassistance to travel to and attend the meeting. The purpose of this funding request is to provide travel and\r\nregistration support to stakeholders who otherwise would not be able to attend, including underrepresented\r\ngroups such as Native American and Hispanic people, and students. We will seek applications from these\r\nunderrepresented groups through our web site and our network of contacts.\r\nWhat is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?\r\nIn the face of mounting pressure on finite water supplies, it is imperative for the United States to consider a\r\nparadigm shift to a risk-based approach to drought management. This meeting is unique in that it seeks the\r\nperspective of a range of stakeholders, including scientists, policy makers, and water users, to create a\r\nunique collaborative document, The Roadmap for Change. This science- and policy-based briefing\r\ndocument will identify the needed scientific research that can provide a more reliable and usable technical\r\nbasis for public policy decision-making, and will identify successful, promising, and novel approaches to\r\ndeveloping drought science-based policies and programs.\r\nWhat are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?\r\nThis collaborative, interactive forum for understanding and improving our management of drought and\r\nwater scarcity will serve as an example of a model for inclusive and integrated science and policy\r\ndiscussions. The Roadmap for Change will stimulate national debate on the challenges of drought and\r\nwater scarcity in the United States, and will be useful in efforts to effect policy changes.\r\n\r\n",
