U.S. participation in the China-U.S. Science Popularization Forum is being organized by Walter Staveloz, International Relations Director for the Association of Science  Technology Centers (ASTC).  The counterpart organizer is PAN, Zheng, Director of the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum, with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.  In addition to the Forum, U.S. participants will visit additional sites including the Shanghai Entomological Museum, Museum of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the Shanghai Energy Conservation and Supervision Center for extended discussions on joint projects of interest.   \r\n\r\nThe topic to be addressed is an important one in the bilateral relationship and promotes not only the importance of science and technology to the public, but also exemplifies for the U.S. informal science education community, the value added by taking a cross-cultural perspective in spurring new public interest in science in both countries.  The U.S. and Chinese participants are well qualified, noted experts on the topics, and the format of the meeting, with attendant site visits, will have a positive impact on generating ideas for future projects. \r\n \r\n",
