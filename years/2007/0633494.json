 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structured Query Language (SQL) is the most widely used multipurpose database language. Extensive knowledge and fluency in SQL is mandatory in mastering modern database technologies. This project is developing an innovative tool that allows Information Science students to develop practical SQL skills through the use of interactive automatically evaluated exercises and examples. The PIs are leveraging the results of an NSF-supported project that uses interactive exercises for C language programming by exploring the value of interactive exercises in the context of Database courses. They are adapting an existing technology for automatic evaluation of SQL exercises (SQL-Tutor) developed at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand by Dr. Antonija Mitrovic and developing a complementary script-based evaluation technology.\r\n\r\nThis project is providing a complimentary set of interactive SQL examples for the original SQL-Tutor technology and enhancing it with personalized guidance that is known to increase student engagement and success rate. Achieving better engagement and success rate is essential to adapting the original SQL-Tutor technology to a different target audience that is less prepared and less motivated to work with interactive exercises. To explore the value of individualized exercises, examples, and personalization in the context of Database courses, the University of Pittsburgh also is running several formative and summative classroom studies.\r\n\r\n",
