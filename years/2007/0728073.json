 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project partners the University of South Florida with Rogers Corporation to develop nanomanufacturing methods for hybrid polymer/microwave laminates. Primary goals include addressing key materials science and engineering issues in polymer films with embedded ferroelectric and ferromagnetic nanoparticles, developing accurate microwave characterization and parameter extraction methods and demonstrating miniaturized high performance RF devices such as multi-function antennas and resonators. The synthesis of polymer nanocomposites with high permittivity and permeability above 1 GHz will be pursued. PMMA, PVDF and polypyrrole will be investigated as host polymers with barium ferrite and barium titanate materials as nanocomposite inclusions. Surfactant coating of nanoparticles will be used to obtain uniform dispersion within the polymer media. Solution-based synthetic routes will be explored that would allow for scaling up to achieve large area coatings using spray and screen printing technologies. The structural, magnetic and dielectric properties of the nanocomposite films will be characterized. Microwave characterization, modeling and design flow will be demonstrated for multi-function antennas and resonators based on the polymer nanocomposite films with tunable electromagnetic properties. Successful development of the RF polymer technology will provide to the RF/microwave community new laminates with unique capabilities for miniaturization of high frequency circuits and antennas, as well as the potential for real-time tunability of frequency, bandwidth and impedance.\r\n\r\nThe materials used in RF telecommunication devices are generally hard in nature as they are solids that are semiconductors, metals or ceramics. This project addresses a paradigm shift in such devices with its goal to explore soft materials like polymers that are lightweight, cost effective and easy to process and manufacture in large quantity. The innovative research strategy combines nanotechnology and polymer processing to come up with advanced, next-generation microwave materials and devices. The successful demonstration of functional, high frequency nanocomposite polymers and large-scale manufacturing methods commonly practiced in industry would benefit applications from defense/security to commercial electronics. The project will provide hands-on training in materials science and microwave design engineering both of which are highly sought after by employers to participating students. The investigators have an extensive record of mentoring students in interdisciplinary research. A major outcome of the project is the training provided to students in cutting edge science and technology, thus having the potential to contribute to a highly skilled workforce ready to take on the challenges of the next generation telecommunication devices.",
