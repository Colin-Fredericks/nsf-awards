 "awd_abstract_narration": "I am interested in quantitative aspects of Geometric Calculus\r\nof Variations. In 1951 J.P. Serre proved that every two points\r\non a closed Riemannian manifold can be connected by an infinite set\r\nof distinct geodesics. I would like to prove that the lengths of the first\r\nk of them admit an upper bound of the form f(n,k)d, where n is the dimension\r\nand d is the diameter of the manifold. I am interested in similar \r\ncurvature-free upper bounds for the length of the shortest periodic geodesic\r\nand the smallest area of a minimal surface. I am also interested\r\nin distribution of geodesic segments between a fixed pair of points\r\nand geodesic nets on a manifold. In another direction I would like to extend\r\nmy previous results on fractal features of Morse\r\nlandscapes of Riemannian functionals to scale-invariant Riemannian\r\nfunctionals involving a lower bound for the Ricci curvature.  This would\r\ninvolve proving some new results about Riemannian manifolds with Ricci\r\ncurvature bounded from below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe notion of a closed Riemannian manifold is a higher dimensional\r\ngeneralization of a closed surface, like the surface of a donut, or a sphere.\r\nWe plan to study connections between ``sizes\" of various extremal\r\nobjects on a closed Riemannian manifold and the ``size\" of the manifold.\r\nExamples of extremal objects include geodesic segments (i.e.\r\nstraightest curves between two points), periodic geodesics (i.e.\r\nstraight curves on manifolds that smoothly close on themselves), geodesic\r\nnets (objects that arize when one tries to connect three or more points\r\nby a shortest tree) and minimal surfaces (i.e. mathematical models\r\nof soap bubbles). In another direction we plan to study\r\n\"optimal\" shapes of higher dimensional manifolds. Our approach to this last\r\nquestion involves ideas coming from different areas of Mathematics,\r\nincluding Computability Theory.\r\n\r\n",
