 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a technological infrastructure for deploying and using ad hoc airborne video sensor (AVS) networks.  In particular, autonomous blimps are used as the airborne platform, and are equipped with a compact processing unit, sophisticated camera assembly, and certain sensing devices.  The AVS network can be envisioned being used \r\nfor detection of unusual activities in emergency and disaster control situations, monitoring of unplanned events, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of the main research components involves development of efficient algorithms for various versions of the video coverage problems in the context of the AVS network. The second main research component of the research involves declarative representation and automated evaluation of high-level video activities.  In addition to above, the project \r\nalso entails research issues that arise in the areas of robotics and computer vision. An important component of the work is development of two testbeds - one with a large number of autonomous indoor blimps with a modest camera set-up, and the other with a smaller number of larger autonomous outdoor blimps with a sophisticated camera set-up.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is new applications that the AVS network facilitates, especially those requiring response to unplanned emergencies and threats. The project also contributes to education and involvement of minority students in advances to science and engineering. The results of the project are disseminated over the web at http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~hgupta/airborne.\r\n",
