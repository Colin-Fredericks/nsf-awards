 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n7 August 2007\r\nProposal Number:  0732807\r\nInstitution: University of Delaware\r\nPI: M. Hawkins\r\n\r\nThe proposal as submitted requested five Shipboard Scientific Support items for the R/V Hugh Sharp, including a second trawl winch, auto-render for existing trawl winch, large diameter hanging blocks, a replacement Digital-GPS unit and upgrade safety items.  In addition, a general-purpose clean laboratory van was requested for the ?Laboratory Van Pool?.  The proposed winch and auto-render units were viewed as back-up items and will not be funded at this time.  The general-purpose clean chemistry van will be used to support the Geo-Traces project.  A working D-GPS unit is a necessity for precise navigation and will be funded.  The University of Delaware will do a group purchase of large diameter hanging blocks, providing 14 of these unique blocks to eight of the academic research vessels.  The Sharp will receive the requested major safety equipment through a group purchase being done by Harbor Branch Inst. of Oceanography.  Safety equipment benefits all users of the ship.  Doing a group purchase of safety items provides standardization of equipment from one ship to another and thus increases user familiarity with life saving equipment.  It should be noted the R/V Sharp is less than 300 gross tons and is therefore not USCG inspected.  However, the academic research fleet must adhere to the UNOLS safety standards, which are based on USCG, IMO and SOLAS regulations.  The proposed equipment will help support scientific operations and data collection in the mid-Atlantic region.  The number of missions supported by the ship averages around thirty per year.  The Sharp is an integral part of the University public outreach program and supports several educational and public outreach events during the year through the use of the vessel during Coast-Day open-house, student training at sea, and web-based projects.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
