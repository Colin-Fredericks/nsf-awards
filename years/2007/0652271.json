 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Hierarchical Integration and Control of Distributed Energy Resources\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of the research is to investigate a hierarchical framework for integration of a strongly heterogeneous set of distributed energy resources into utility grids or microgrids. The approach is to define the detailed functions of each level in the hierarchical architecture, to develop control strategies for each level that effectively decouple the nonlinear controls of dc, ac and synchronous links, and to evaluate and validate through extensive simulation studies the performance of an example microgrid that uses those strategies and architectures. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\n\r\nThe research tackles a widely-recognized but as yet unresolved problem that increasingly challenges the power community.  This project will find its success in definition of a framework that includes physical and control interface requirements, and in bounding the performance of those standards and interfaces through simulation studies. This will enable high penetration of distributed resources in the existing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nSafe and reliable integration of distributed energy resources will benefit all segments of society, from individuals who install photovoltaic roofing, to companies that install peak-shaving equipment, from owners of the power distribution infrastructure, to all of the consumers who will benefit from the resulting more-robust electric grid. This research will also provide abundant material for new courses, research topics, and hands-on learning opportunities for students, including the large population of minority students at the two institutions. The research will be used in existing and new outreach programs to cultivate students' enthusiasm in engineering and to attract them to engage in this area.\r\n",
