 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's request funding to further develop in situ voltammetry for widespread integration into cabled observatory networks. In this proposal, emphasis is placed on instrument improvement for ultimate quantification of the transport of soluble components in surface sediments, which are known to significantly contribute to biogeochemical cycling in nearshore systems. The PIs propose to build upon recent developments of in situ electrochemical analyzers that have drastically reduced sampling artifacts, increasing measurement sensitivity and decreasing induced changes in sample chemical speciation, thus providing better accuracy and precision of measurement. Kilo Nalu Nearshore Reef Observatory provides an ideal framework to make necessary advancements required for integration of voltammetry and cabled ocean observatories: (1) nearshore permeable sediment systems are a focus of intensive recent public and academic interest; (2) an existing observing system with power and high bandwidth communications is already present; (3) Oahu's south shore is host to a wide and predictable variety of surface wave conditions that impact voltammetrically-measurable characteristics of the sediment-water interface geochemistry. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe successful integration of state-of-the-art in situ analytical instrumentation and pioneering information and computer science technology, within the Kilo Nalu Observatory framework, could serve as a template for development and integration of other chemical sensors into larger ocean observing networks. The PIs' participation in the University of Hawaii-NASA Astrobiology Institute's education and outreach programs should serve to disseminate their findings to an even broader audience. The project includes collaboration with a commercial enterprise and will partially support thesis work for a UH master's degree student.\r\n",
