 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Self-Managing Resource Allocation in Unsupervised Distributed Systems\r\n\r\nRecent years have seen a growing deployment of distributed computing\r\ninfrastructures such as Grids, PlanetLab, @home, and peer-to-peer systems,\r\nthat run a variety of Web, commercial, and scientific applications.\r\nMany of these infrastructures are unsupervised---they consist of large number \r\nof loosely-connected nodes that contribute computational and storage \r\nresources but are not centrally managed. Such unsupervised infrastructures \r\nare characterized by uncertainty in their resource availability caused by \r\nfailures, varying load conditions, and node churn, thus putting undue burden on\r\napplication writers and system administrators for the successful\r\ndeployment and execution of applications. This project is developing a \r\nself-managing resource allocation framework that would hide\r\nthe infrastructure uncertainties and dynamics from applications, \r\nwhile transparently adapting to changing conditions within the infrastructure.\r\nAs part of this framework, this project is developing techniques for:\r\n(i) Predictable resource aggregation to provide resource guarantees to \r\napplications in the presence of dynamic loads and changing resource availability,\r\n(ii) Reliability-aware resource management to provide desired levels\r\nof reliability and availability, and\r\n(iii) System inference and prediction to enable decentralized inference\r\nof global system conditions for proactive response to dynamic infrastructure changes.\r\nThese techniques are based on cooperation and redundancy among nodes in the \r\ninfrastructure to provide scalability and decentralization. \r\nThe proposed research will have significant impact on distributed \r\ncomputing by enabling effective deployment of large-scale scientific \r\nand commercial applications on resource-rich but unreliable infrastructures",
