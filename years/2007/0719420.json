 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mark Ratner of Northwestern University is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research on the development of theoretical methods for the study of electron transfer in molecules. There are three major thrusts for the work: (1) a density matrix formalism approach is being used to describe systems with multiple pathways; (2) dephasing in multi-spin systems is being studied; and (3) a Green's functions approach to build a first principle theory of electron transfer is being developed. \r\n\r\nThe work is having a broader impact on our understanding of a number of systems involving electron transfer, including photochemical and electronic systems. Ratner also continues to be involved in a number of outreach and educational activities involving his research, futher broadening its impact on society.\r\n",
