 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Botanical Society of America, Texas A&M University, and BioQuest are collaborating to enhance student interest in information technology-related plant science careers and understanding of information technologies used in the study of plant science. The goals of the Plant IT Careers, Cases, and Collaborations project are to (1) increase high school and middle school student awareness of IT-intensive plant careers and practicing scientists, (2) create new and adapt existing instructional materials that enhance student interest in and understanding of plant biology and technologies scientists use in conducting plant research, (3) help secondary school teachers infuse technology and scientific inquiry into their teaching of plant biology, and (4) engage students and teachers in forming collaborative learning communities. The project is exposing students to diverse plant science career pathways and providing them with opportunities to conduct, design, and discuss plant science investigations. The STEM content focus is IT-rich topics in plant biology such as bioinformatics, biotechnology, GIS mapping, and image analysis. The IT emphasis is on video, modeling, spreadsheets, digital libraries, and online communication.\r\n\r\nThe project is providing approximately 60 teachers recruited from across the nation with 120 hours of professional development during two-week long summer institutes and quarterly online reflection meetings during the school year. Approximately 70 students from rural and urban areas of Texas are attending one-week long summer camps. Indirectly, the project will impact at least 7,000 students nationwide. About 50 scientists are participating in project activities. The evaluation plan is assessing changes in participants' IT skills, science understanding, career awareness, attitudes, and practices.",
