The main topics of the research\r\nare (1) the development and analysis of multilevel continuation\r\nalgorithms for optimization problems with integral equation\r\nconstraints and the application of those methods in simulating\r\natomic and molecular fluids, (2) the design and analysis of\r\ncontinuation/quasi-Newton methods for nonsmooth nonlinear least\r\nsquares, with applications to calibration of models of blood\r\nflow, (3) continued study of the conditioning of the linear\r\nsystems and eigenproblems that arise when pseudo-arclength\r\ncontinuation is used in bifurcation analysis, and (4) multi-model\r\nmethods in which one physical model, based on differential or\r\nintegral equations, for example, is used as a preconditioner for\r\na solver which is based on a more accurate, more expensive to\r\nevaluate model, such as a molecular dynamics or stochastic\r\nsimulation.\r\n\r\n     Nonlinear equations and optimization problems are commonly\r\nencountered in science and engineering.  Motivated by\r\napplications in chemistry and medicine, the principal\r\ninvestigator studies equations with multiple solutions, the\r\nchallenge being to determine which of those solutions represents\r\nthe real world and which cannot be seen in actual physical\r\nsystems, and optimization problems for which standard methods and\r\ncomputer codes fail.  This work should lead to new approaches\r\nuseful in many branches of science and engineering.\r\n",
