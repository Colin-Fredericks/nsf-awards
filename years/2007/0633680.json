 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\n\r\nThe project is developing curricular materials and methodologies for teaching high frequency and microwave design to undergraduate engineering students in a way that enables them to apply the knowledge in a variety of application areas, including medical, biological, computer, communication, environmental, and military applications. The investigators are focusing on research-based approaches that enhance knowledge transfer and retention. They are developing instructional modules using Just-in-Time-Teaching techniques to increase conceptual understanding, laboratory modules using reverse engineering to help student learn measurement and verification techniques, and case studies and design projects to illustrate ways that high frequency design impacts other areas. This project specifically addresses teaching complex technologies in ways that include their impact on society and could serve as a model for other areas. The evaluation effort is using surveys, special tests, including a concept diagnostic test, interviews, and analysis of student work to monitor progress and document the project's success. The investigators are describing their approach and results in education journals; they are posting their material on their website and submitting it to general distribution sites such MERLOT and the Connections Project; and they are offering local workshops on interacting with students and national workshops on their instructional approach at IEEE electromagnetic meetings and at a special meeting focused on using case studies in STEM education. The project's broader impacts include the dissemination of the material, including the model for teaching complex technology using societal impact as a motivator, and the focus on increasing the participation of underrepresented groups, especially women, in high frequency design. \r\n",
