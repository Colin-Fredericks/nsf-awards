This is a biannual conference.  The payoffs are expected to be in the core defense and security related areas such as sensing, data processing, computation and communications.  \r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe scientific and technological information and the resulting Nanoscience Technology Roadmap will be widely disseminated throughout academia/universities, government and industrial institutions and the public at large (including the entire international community.  It will produce a unique set of guidelines for future research and educational activities.  The funds are expected to be used exclusively to support graduate student attendance and this will broaden the impact of the meeting to the education experiences and education of future scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
