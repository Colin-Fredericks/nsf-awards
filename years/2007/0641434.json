 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steroid hormones profoundly influence most life processes, including development, growth, physiology, and behavior. It is known that in egg-laying species such as the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis), mothers deposit steroids into their eggs during yolk formation. However, less is known about how maternal condition influences this steroid deposition and about the range of consequences for offspring of yolk steroid exposure. This project will examine (1) the effects of maternal social environment as manipulated by breeding densities and physical condition as manipulated by diet quality on deposition of yolk steroids, (2) the effects of experimentally increased yolk steroid exposure on juvenile steroid profiles, growth, behavior, and survival, and (3) the effects of experimentally increased yolk steroid exposure on adult steroid profiles and physiological and behavioral measures of their reproductive success. It is anticipated that this research will show that yolk steroid allocation can be a powerful maternal effect, or mechanism by which females can influence the phenotype of their offspring independent of the genes that are transferred. Maternal condition likely is communicated to offspring via yolk steroids, which in turn influence the development and expression of offspring traits during juvenile as well as adult life stages. This work will advance scientific discovery by examining systematically the causes and consequences of yolk steroid transfer from mother to offspring, hatching to adulthood. This work also will promote the educational advancement of a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students who will receive quality mentoring, training, and support through their participation in research.",
