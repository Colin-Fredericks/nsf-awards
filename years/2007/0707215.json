 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nThis award provides funding to acquire items of shared-use scientific instrumentation intended for use on the two research vessels (R/V Kila Moana and R/V KOK) operated by the University of Hawaii as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Together, these vessels will support a total of 318 days of scientific research in 2007. This award reflects a modification and reprioritization due to changes in ship schedules and lost equipment.  Specifically, support is recommended for \r\n\r\n1. Hardware for deployment and recovery of instruments\r\n2. Deck capstan improvements\r\n3. Oceanographic sensor redundancy\r\n4. Spectrum analyzer for HiSeasNet\r\n5. Shipboard networking instrumentation\r\n6. Dredging hardware\r\n7. Subbottom profiler upgrade\r\n* tow cable and tow fish replacement\r\n\r\nItems requested but omitted from the recommendation include the Soundmetrics DIDSON remote imaging sonar. Replacement of a tow cable and tow fish for a moving vessel profiler system that was not part of the original proposal is also recommended via this award. These items were lost during operations in 2006 and must be replaced for cruises scheduled in 2007.\r\n  \r\nProgram is pleased to recommend support as described above, noting that the proposal was well received by reviewers, and clearly identified the needs and planned uses of the instrumentation requested.  The items recommended for support here should substantially improve the capabilities of the two University of Hawaii research vessels, and make them more effective platforms for implementing scientific research cruises in 2007 and beyond. They will provide an important shared-use infrastructure capability for basic oceanographic research that is cost-effective, and should ensure that proper maintenance and calibration will be undertaken on behalf of a diverse group of investigators from around the U.S.  The University of Hawaii technical support group has the expertise to maintain and operate the recommended systems.\r\n",
