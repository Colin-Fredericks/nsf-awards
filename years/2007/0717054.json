 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research centers on the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) and the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), the two most widespread, abundant and ecologically damaging invasive ants in North America.  Both of these ants commonly develop mutualistic relationships with honeydew-producing true bugs (Hemiptera), including a wide variety of aphids, scales, and mealybugs.  These associations lead to immense damage in agricultural systems.  The goal of this research is to understand how these associations between invasive ants and honeydew producing insects enhance the dominance of invasive ants and their impacts in the United States.  This will be accomplished through a combination of greenhouse experiments, field manipulations, and stable-isotope analysis. \r\n\r\nAnts and their associated Hemiptera provide unique educational opportunities. The familiarity of fire ants and Argentine ants as urban pests and their prominence as invasive species make them ideal instructional tools for students interested in ecology, behavior, and conservation. Moreover, interactions between ants and honeydew-producing Hemiptera provide ubiquitous and easily observed examples of mutualisms. The experimental tractability of this research has the potential to generate numerous opportunities for student involvement. The PIs are committed to fostering diversity and will continue to involve and to mentor under-represented groups in science. The findings of the proposed research will also figure prominently in a web-based educational tool.",
