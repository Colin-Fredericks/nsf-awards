 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, entitled Frontiers in Developmental Biology: Concepts, Techniques and Model Organisms, and jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place at the Leloir Institute, in Buenos Aires, Argentina from October 23 to November 1, 2008, in conjunction with the Fourth International Meeting of the Latin American Society of Developmental Biology (LASDB).  Organized by Dr. Eric Wieschaus and Dr. Ida Chow of the Society for Developmental Biology, the PASI will involve the participation of 10 distinguished scientists and 15 students from the United States and 15 from Latin America.  The institute will give a balanced view of the potentials and limitations of several different, mainstream, and emerging model organisms and technologies in developmental biology.\r\n\r\nThe PASI will train young investigators in the Americas eager to use innovative approaches and indigenous model organisms to expand the knowledge base and understanding of developmental processes, promote interactions between senior and junior investigators that may lead to future advances in the field, and provide an open forum for discussion of current topics in developmental biology that are relevant to education and science policy in the Western Hemisphere.  In addition, it will serve as a resource for colleagues who might plan to organize similar courses in other parts of the World, or even within the United States.  PASI lectures will be posted on the course website and through other portals and dissemination mechanisms.",
