 "awd_abstract_narration": "This critical workshop will bring together leaders in the emerging fields of biomanufacturing and nanomanufacturing to explore synergies and opportunities at the interface of bio and nano integrated manufacturing. This workshop will discuss grand challenges and drivers for this field for year 2020 and beyond. The workshop will identify, discuss and recommend key collaborative areas for bio-nano integrated manufacturing. \r\n\r\nIt will invite and engage experts from the range of bio-nano manufacturing subjects areas such as cell-based biomanufacturing, freeform fabrication based biomanufacturing, bio-printing and patterning, organ and cell printing, biomaterials designing and coating as well as nanodesigning and multiscale modeling, active and passive nano structures by designing, functionally graded hirachical nanointegrated systems, cellular sensory and actuator systems, multifunctional nano and micro metrology tools, targeted drug delivery, etc. In addition this workshop will also discuss new opportunities for education curricula to train next generation workforce. Industry members will be an important part of this workshop where progress in small and well as large industries will be discussed and recommended to assure global competitiveness of US industries in this emerging field of bio-nano integrated manufacturing.",
