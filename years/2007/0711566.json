 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of stacks is the study of symmetries of geometric objects and, as\r\nsuch, has wide impact throughout mathematics: it is a central theme in\r\ncurrent work in algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, number theory,\r\nanalytic and differential geometry, and mathematical physics. Indeed, the\r\ntheory has proved flexible enough to apply to any field of mathematics were\r\nit is important to study symmetries across continuous families of geometric\r\nobjects, especially when the groups of self-symmetries can vary\r\nnon-continuously throughout the family.  This workshop, to be held at the\r\nFields Institute in Toronto, will bring together leading researchers,\r\npostdoctoral mathematicians, and graduate students from fields which apply\r\nthe theory of stacks; the intent is to discuss recent advances, and to\r\nexplore and stimulate potentially important new areas of applications. The\r\nmain speakers will address current problems in chromatic stable homotopy\r\ntheory, orbifolds, mathematical physics, geometry in various forms, and the\r\nemerging field of derived algebraic geometry. Researchers who have agreed to\r\nparticipate include Mark Behrens (MIT), Ian Grojnowksi (Cambridge), Jacob\r\nLurie (Harvard), Gabriele Vezzosi (Firenze), and Angelo Vistolli (Scuola\r\nNormale Superiore).  In addition, Mike Hopkins (Harvard) will give a series\r\nof lectures concurrently with this workshop.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be the central event of a two-month subprogram\r\nentitled ``Stacks in geometry and topology'', within the thematic program\r\n``Geometric applications of homotopy theory''. The full program will run\r\nfrom January through June of 2007 at the Fields Institute. Beyond the\r\nworkshop, there a directly related mini-courses by Paul Goerss\r\n(Northwestern), Ezra Getzler (Northwestern), and Jacob Lurie (Harvard).\r\nThe workshop and the mini-courses will pursue the theory of stacks\r\nacross a diverse fields of mathematics where this theory has been applied,\r\nand an important goal of this whole program is to foster cross-disciplinary\r\ninteraction.\r\n",
