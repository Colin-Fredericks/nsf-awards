 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to study research on stochastic processing networks in the heavy traffic\r\nregime. The focus will be on the creation of constructive approximations methods for the performance\r\nanalysis questions arising in the area of stochastic processing networks, as well as extending the scope\r\nof the stochastic networks framework to the new domains of applications. The project will pursue a\r\nthree-fold goal: extending the applicability of the heavy traffic theory to stochastic queueing networks\r\noperating in the equilibrium (steady-state) regime, creating a performance analysis framework for large\r\nscale call center models in the heavy traffic regime, and creating a general framework for modeling\r\nstochastic queueing processes with shared resources in the heavy traffic regime.\r\nIf successful, the results of the research will have the following important implications. For the\r\nfield of stochastic networks in the heavy traffic regime it will make heuristic approaches of analyzing\r\nnetworks in equilibrium, into a theory and thus making a formal connection between diffusion processes\r\nand the underlying stochastic networks in the equilibrium regime. In the area of large scale call\r\ncenter models it will provide general and practical methods for the performance of such systems in\r\nthe heavy traffic regime, without the restrictive assumptions on the statistical properties of the call\r\nlengths distribution. The state of the art techniques can only handle the special case of exponentially\r\ndistributed call lengths. If successful the project will also provide methods for analyzing call centers\r\nin the non-stationary regime, which is the predominant regime of call center operations. The nonstationarity\r\nissue will be addressed by obtaining bounds on the relaxation times of large scale call\r\ncenter models. Finally, by utilizing a combination of methods, such as the theory of Markov random\r\nfields, a systematic theory of queueing models with shared resources in the heavy traffic regime will be\r\nconsidered, with a specific goal of constructive performance analysis methods. Stochastic systems with\r\nshared resources appear in a variety of fields, including communication networks, computer systems\r\nand business processes. Yet constructive and general theory of such processes is lacking. The project\r\nwill be an important step in the direction of building such a theory.",
