Formans essay of 1971 deeply affected the work of a generation of historians and contributed powerfully to the emergence of the sociology of scientific knowledge. Although one of the most cited works in the field, it nevertheless cannot be considered generally accepted, but, on the contrary, remains the subject of widely diverging opinions and scholarly positions. Broader Impacts  The goal of the meeting is to foster critical dialogue, bringing the classic formulations of Formans problem into interaction with the wealth of new empirical studies and more recent methodological developments  and to make the results widely available in a special journal issue. The conference will help pull together a new community of scholars, many of them younger researchers, and spur collective reflection on contemporary trends and promising targets of future investigation. In line with the Forman thesis foundational significance, the projects impacts range broadly. The conference  talks will be opened to the public, including possibly a large graduate student gathering. The published product will be a resource for graduate teaching\r\nin the history and philosophy of science. Moreover, the widely recognized status of modern physics as a test case for the new cultural history of science means that its findings will carry far afield.\r\n",
