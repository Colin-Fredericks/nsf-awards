 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering Technology (58)\r\n\r\nEmbedded systems are common today in industrial and medical environments, but few undergraduate engineering curricula offer courses in embedded systems networking. This academic institution is working with industry to create a knowledge base in embedded systems by developing a new laboratory for teaching real time embedded-systems (RT/ES) networking, teaching a new undergraduate course in the laboratory, using the laboratory for senior design projects in two engineering majors, holding a summer camp for high school teachers and students, and teaching a two-day workshop for engineering faculty on teaching RT/ES courses.  Measurable outcomes in terms of student learning will be assessed.  The primary focus of this project includes developing engineering faculty expertise in teaching RT/ES networking and infusing RT/ES concepts into an existing pre-college engineering education program.  A collaborative effort between Engineering and Education faculty, this project integrates research and STEM education, broadens the participation of underrepresented groups, enhances the infrastructure for research and education, disseminates results of the research broadly, and benefits society at large. \r\n",
