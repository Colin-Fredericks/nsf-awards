 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECCS-0644245\r\nCarol Livermore-Clifford, MIT\r\n\r\nThis CAREER proposal focuses on a selective microcomponent manipulation process called templated assembly by selective removal (TASR), its applications for manufacturing complex microsystems by self-assembly, and its use for filtering and chromatography. \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this work lies in the creation and understanding of flexible, broadly-applicable micro and nanomanufacturing techniques based on TASR, and in the creation of the practical systems such as optically-based sensors that it enables.  TASR simultaneously and selectively organizes diverse, small-scale (100 nanometer to 10 micron) components from fluid into shape- and size-matched holes in a substrate.  The topography of the substrate is prepatterned, and the surface is coated to promote component-substrate adhesion.  Selectivity is ensured by applying megahertz frequency ultrasonic excitation; the resulting quantitatively-describable, controllable fluid forces preferentially remove components from poorly-matched holes while leaving them in the well-matched holes in which they are more strongly attached. One key research topic is the selective placement of components of different shapes, materials, and hardnesses.  Well-characterized experiments and quantitative analytic models will elucidate TASR's capabilities and limits.  A second key research topic is the creation of economical template hardware to guide the selective manipulation process.  The final major research topic is the application of the TASR approach to create functional systems.  TASR offers extremely high selectivity based on differences in size and shape along with a rapid means of assembling systems of diverse components that are hard to create by traditional top-down techniques. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this work are in the integration of educational and research activities and in the broad dissemination of tools produced in the research.  Educational activities include the creation of undergraduate laboratory curriculum pertaining to self-assembly, research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and the creation, implementation, and dissemination of research-related materials for outreach to underrepresented high school students.  \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring this project we created, demonstrated and learned to control a method of creating systems of many small parts simply, effectively, and at low cost.  There are of course many different ways of organizing small parts into systems that serve various purposes.  The method created here has the advantage that the system organizes itself, through directed self assembly, into the desired configuration.  People provide the small parts and the right assembly conditions, and the parts proceed to organize themselves so that the system builds itself.  In the assembly process the different types of parts are distinguished from each other by their size and shape. \n\nOne of the most exciting potential applications for this research is to organize biological cells to create human tissues, for example for transplant or to speed the development of pharmaceuticals.  Human tissues have very specific structures such as networks of blood vessels and layers of cells that enable them to perform their functions.  It can be very difficult to mimic these systems in the laboratory, because scientists generally lack the control to place all of the cells where they should be.  However, with technologies like the one demonstrated in this project, we now have the potential to place cells individually where they need to go and structure complex tissues that really work.\n\nOur research accomplishments over the course of this project have made these applications feasible in the near future.  These accomplishments include the following.  We have created mathematical models to describe how the small parts try out different locations in the system, and how they select the appropriate locations in which to settle.  We have done experiments to demonstrate that what we have learned from these models is true.  These experiments include selectively assembling small rigid spheres and small deformable spheres from a fraction of a micrometer to a few micrometers in size; selectively assembling small cylinders at the 20 &ndash; 60 micrometer scale; and selectively assembling biological cells from both insects and mammals.  Finally, we have demonstrated some of the key manufacturing concepts for using these approaches to create many low-cost systems in the future. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the fact that it has demonstrated the feasibility of selectively sorting and assembling systems of small-scale objects, including biological cells and objects with complex shapes, in a single step.  It has also demonstrated that the sorting technique is benign and does not harm even sensitive mammalian cells.  Not only have these capabilities been demonstrated experimentally, but they are also supported by mathematical modeling.\n\nThe broader impacts of this research include both the impacts of the technology itself and the outreach activities that we have carried out to bring this research to a wider audience.  From a technology point of view, this research offers enhanced tools for biomedical research, medical tests, and even tissue generation.  From an outreach point of view, the results of this project have been presented to a wide audience, ranging from high school students and the general public to professional audiences at conferences and seminars.  The project broadens participation of under-represented groups (women). \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/02/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carol Livermore-Clifford"
