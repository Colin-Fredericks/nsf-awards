 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIn algebraic topology, generalized cohomology theories have become a\r\npowerful tool for translating topological problems into algebraic\r\nproblems, where one can expect to do calculations.  The more algebraic structure\r\none can extract, the better.  The last 30 years or so have seen extensive\r\ndevelopment of the family of complex-oriented cohomology theories, which\r\nallow one to tap into the existing rich algebraic machinery of formal\r\ngroup laws.  Applications include many profound results in topology.\r\nHowever, much of the work has taken place at a rather small number of\r\ncenters, and the proposed 4-day conference is intended to disseminate\r\nthe present state of the field to a wider audience, including publication\r\nof the proceedings of the conference.\r\n\r\nTopology is the study of those properties of geometric objects such as\r\nspheres, tori and other surfaces, and higher-dimensional analogues, that\r\ndo not depend on such concepts as distance and angle.  A stock example\r\nis that a donut is treated as equivalent to a coffee mug, as one can be\r\ndeformed into the other, without tearing or gluing, if they are plastic\r\nenough, but not equivalent to a cup without a handle, as the hole will\r\nnot go away.  Algebraic topology seeks to convert topological problems\r\ninto algebraic problems that one can solve.  One powerful modern tool\r\nis the concept of a complex-oriented cohomology theory, which is the\r\nfocus of the proposed 4-day conference.  This conference is intended to\r\ndisseminate the present state of the field and its results more widely.\r\n",
