 "awd_abstract_narration": "Securing data, information and applications accessible through the web or otherwise is a major goal for many organizations. While there have been many developments in data and applications security research including enforcing access control policies, trust negotiation, and securing web services, the data and applications security community currently lacks a coherent direction for research and development. Therefore the objective of this project is to host a workshop that examines the developments in data and applications security, determines the challenges that need to be addressed and establishes a research agenda for the next decade.  The workshop participants are leading experts in the areas of information security and data and knowledgement management from academia, industry and government agencies.  The workshop program includes individual presentations as well as breakout session discussions and presentations.  The workshop is planned to take place in spring 2008.  The workshop agenda, participants, position papers, and report will be made available to the public via the workshop website: http://www.utdallas.edu/~lkhan/NSF-DAS-Workshop.htm\r\n\r\n",
