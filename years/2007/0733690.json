 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New Mexico State University's (NMSU) proposal aims at replicating the \"Gadsden Mathematics Initiative\" (GMI), a five-year NSF/ESI/Local Systemic Change-funded project consisting of a partnership between the Gadsden Independent School District and NMSU. GMI resulted in closing the achievement gap for K-8 underrepresented students in a 94% Hispanic, 60% English Language Learners (ELLs), and high-poverty border school district. The GMI Capacity Building Systems Model for Mathematics Achievement includes three major components: (1) quality-aligned curriculum, (2) teacher quality and collaboration, and (3) administrative and STEM community support. Building on this model, the goals of the proposal are: (1) to investigate whether or not it is possible to successfully scale-up and adapt the Capacity Building Systems Model used in the GMI and improve mathematics achievement for all students in a larger school district, and (2) to replicate success in broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in entering STEM field by closing the achievement gap and raising the achievement level of underrepresented students in mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe study will involve the analysis of the implementation of the model in the Las Cruces Public Schools with a student population including 70% Hispanics and 12% ELLs, in terms of how each of the three theoretical constructs of the model affect student achievement. With the school district as the unit of analysis, the proposal identifies three major research questions: (1) Can the implementation of a capacity building systems model that closed the achievement gap in a rural New Mexico school district also work in a larger district with mixed ethnicities?; (2) How does the model need to be modified by participating stakeholders in order to strengthen its potential replicability?; and (3) Which elements of the model have the most positive effect on student achievement in the new district? The project will use a mixed effect linear hierarchical model to analyze data related to how each element of the model affect student achievement in a larger school district. \r\n\r\nAnticipated products include: (1) a researched and proven professional development systems model for mathematics achievement, (2) published research results that describe the effects of the model, and (3) guidelines and tools that can be used by other school districts and partners interested in replicating the model.",

The model was implemented through a partnership between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and Las Cruces Public Schools (LCPS).  The research project focused on the ways in which the systemic model should be modified to ensure its effectiveness in a large urban district with a relatively high number of English language learners. The project also examined the components of the model that had the greatest effect on student achievement. \n\n      The results of this research project contributes to a broader understanding of systemic mathematics reform in five specific areas:\n\n1) how to build the system-wide capacity of a school district to support student learning; 2) the importance and structure of on-going professional development; 3) the use of data to drive effective instruction for all students; and 4) the usefulness of research-developed instruments to document a) classroom learning environments, b) professional learning communities, and c) sustainable and effective partnerships.\n\n      The SUMA building capacity model needed to be modified to support change in a larger and more diverse school district than the one in which it was originally designed.
