 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to synthesize and characterize new diamond-like semiconductors (DLS) and dilute magnetic semiconductors with diamond-like structures. DLS are a particularly attractive category of materials to pursue because they have potential applications in a variety of fields. The preparation of these materials will be carried out using four synthetic strategies: microwave irradiation, solvothermal reaction, molten metal growth and high-temperature solid-state synthesis. Targeted materials have been carefully chosen based upon theoretical predictions that these compounds should possess interesting properties. The optical, electrical and magnetic properties of these new semiconductors will be systematically studied as a function of composition and structure. The compositional flexibility in these systems will allow for the tuning of physical properties. This research has the potential to bring us closer to the realization of new materials for specialized non-linear optical applications and spin-based devices that function near room temperature. The proposed project integrates research and education in several ways, such as development of new courses in materials chemistry, graduate and undergraduate research, minority high school student summer research and outreach activities geared towards women and minorities.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nDiamond-like semiconductors are important materials because they exhibit a variety of useful applications. This project focuses on preparing these materials via both traditional and nontraditional avenues and measuring their properties. The proposed research has broader impacts in its potential to affect technologies that rely heavily upon materials with unique optical and magnetic characteristics, by identifying new compounds with the desired properties. New nonlinear optical materials prepared through this project have potential uses in the areas of spectroscopy, medicine and remote sensing. Magnetic semiconductors prepared through this project could potentially benefit numerous technologies, including IC (integrated circuit) cards, missile control and quantum computing. Graduate, undergraduate and high school students involved in this project will be trained for careers in government, academic, pharmaceutical, chemical and crime laboratories. New courses will be developed to strengthen the department's materials chemistry curriculum. This project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science through the Project SEED program for economically disadvantaged high school students, many of whom are minorities, and the Women in Science program at Duquesne University for graduate and undergraduate female students.\r\n\r\n",
