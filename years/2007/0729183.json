 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through collaboration with the Wichita State University and its state of the art crash test facility at the National Institute for Aviation Research, the study of 'Child Safety Seats Performance in Lateral Sled Tests at Varying Speeds' will support the mission and the expansion of the existing Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Child Injury Research and Prevention at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  \r\n\r\nThe study will provide an in-depth assessment of the performance of child safety seats and the response of the anthropomorphic test device.  In addition, the results from the study will add the understanding of the child safety seats and the anthropomorphic test device interactions at different speeds in side impacts to the current knowledge of the seat testing and help in defining and regulating the procedures for testing in side impact configurations. \r\n\r\nThis new partnership between the I/UCRC at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Wichita State University will further enhance the capability of the Center to support research in injury prevention, in addition the findings from this study will augment the current efforts to define regulatory sled setup procedure for side impact crashes involving children in child safety seats, which currently do not exist.\r\n",
