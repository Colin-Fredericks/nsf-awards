 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient Algorithms for Problems in the Next Generation of Computing\r\n\r\nCliff Stein\r\nColumbia University\r\n\r\n\r\nComputers, computer systems and the computational infrastructure\r\nprovided by the Internet are now essential for many aspects of modern\r\nlife.  It is well-known and well-documented that, even as computing\r\npower and network bandwidth increase at a rapid rate, the demands that\r\nusers and applications place on these resource increase at roughly the\r\nsame pace.  Thus, no matter how much progress we make on the hardware\r\nand network ends, we will always need efficient algorithms to manage\r\nthese resources.  This research focuses on several algorithmic\r\nproblems in computer systems and networks; arising both from existing\r\ntechnologies and at technologies that are evolving, or have been\r\nproposed.  By improve the efficiency with which we manage our devices\r\nand infrastructure, there will be tremendous savings, both in time and\r\neconomically.  In addition, the investigator integrates theory and\r\nsystems and encourages more collaboration between these areas, with\r\nobvious benefits.  This work has an impact on the decisions that are\r\nbeing made presently about the next generation of the Internet, of\r\nrouting, and of scheduling in operating systems.\r\n  \r\nIn particular, the investigator studies four concrete problem areas:\r\nscheduling in operating systems -- finding schedules that are low overhead and use resources fairly; \r\n scheduling in the next generation of routers -- designing algorithms\r\nthat allow packets with different levels of service to be routed\r\nefficiently; network coding -- designing algorithms to manage this\r\nexciting new routing technology, and power management -- designing\r\nalgorithms that schedule jobs to provide good response time and to use\r\npower efficiently.  While the details of these various areas differ,\r\nthe overall goals are to design simple, low overhead algorithms, use\r\nalgorithms with rigorously proved bounds and analysis, design new\r\ntheory and transfer existing theory closer to the systems.  The\r\ninvestigator also designs educational materials suitable for teaching\r\nalgorithms to a wider audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
