 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research is a scientific understanding sufficient to enable casting of metallic sheets, ribbon or foil, of commercially acceptable quality, directly from the molten metal state. Experimental testing along side computational and mathematical modeling will be used to achieve the desired understanding.  From aluminum foil to airplane wings, most metallic components used today are formed from flat pieces. As in current commercial practice, mechanical rolling and thermal annealing stages have high energy, environmental and capital costs. The goal is to develop processes to solidify raw material directly into final product, without downstream processing steps. This is a vision that goes back to Bessemer (1865) and its realization would revolutionize thin-sheet manufacturing.  The casting method forces molten metal into contact with a spinning cold wheel where the metal solidifies and is spun off.  Manipulation of the contacting and solidification events is the focus.\r\n\r\nAs compared to current practice, there would be direct energy savings for single-step casting.  Indirect benefits include the reduction of greenhouse gases, particularly, carbon dioxide. Capital costs for manufacturing would be reduced and productivity would be increased. Both environment and industry benefit.  As China and India industrialize and the demand for flat products grows, these benefits to society will accrue.  A further benefit will be through education. Undergraduates and graduates will be involved in this research as a problem-solving team, with educational outreach to local schools.\r\n",
