 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator proposes to work on two distinct but related projects. The first project\r\nis a study of Selmer groups and Mordell-Weil groups of elliptic curves over towers of number fields,\r\nand the second is to resolve certain deformational problems related to automorphic forms. One\r\nof the aims of the first project is to prove that Selmer rank grows at least as fast as would be\r\npredicted by heuristics governing the signs of expected functional equations. One of the aims of\r\nthe second is to understand the parameter spaces of automorphic forms that are usually referred\r\nto as \"eigenvarieties.\"\r\n\r\nThe first project pursued by the principal investigator is the fundamental arithmetic problem of understanding\r\nthe structure of triples of algebraic numbers that are solutions of given homogeneous\r\npolynomials of degree three in three variables, this cubic case having an extraordinary amount\r\nof structure and playing a pivotal role in the larger project of understanding the arithmetic of\r\npolynomial equations in general. This type of number theory was critical, for example, in the\r\nestablishment of Fermat's Last Theorem (work of Wiles and Taylor-Wiles) over a dozen years ago,\r\nand - indeed - becomes ever more powerful and continues to be crucial for a wide range of applications,\r\nfor example in cryptography. The second project proposed by the Principal Investigator has\r\nits historical origin in classical work of Ramanujan, that dealt with the arithmetic properties of the\r\nFourier coefficients of modular forms. Ramanujan unearthed striking congruences that on the one\r\nhand contain important number theoretic information, and on the other suggest that a mysterious\r\ncoherence underlies a large assortment of basic arithmetic phenomena; one of the goals of modern\r\nnumber theory is to expand this, and use its power for a range of applications.\r\n1\r\n",
