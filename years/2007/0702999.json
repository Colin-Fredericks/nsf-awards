 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is addressing industry shortages of highly skilled technicians in Northern Kentucky and the greater Cincinnati area. The project is:\r\n1. Improving and expanding certificate and degree options within the manufacturing technology programs at the college to provide a larger pool of skilled technicians;\r\n2. Improving the knowledge and skills of postsecondary faculty from the manufacturing technology programs; and \r\n3. Improving the recruitment of students into manufacturing technology programs.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the project include the creation of a new Mechatronics Technician certificate, professional development of community college faculty, development and implementation of an outreach plan to recruit more high school students to the college technician programs, and a summer camp for secondary students. Teams are designed to carry out each of the objectives.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum development is based on the materials in the Siemens Certified Mechatronics System. The mechatronics instructor is being certified through the Siemens Professional Education Center in Berlin, Germany.  The Kentucky Community and Technical College System, comprising 15 colleges, is adopting the Siemens curricular materials, and has agreed to be the USA trainer for Siemens.",
