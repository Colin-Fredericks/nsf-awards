 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the stability and instability of\r\nequilibria in fluids and plasmas, focusing on the two-dimensional\r\nEuler equation in fluids and on Vlasov systems in plasma physics\r\nand stellar dynamics.  He aims to develop general methods of\r\nfinding linearly growing modes (especially for asymmetric modes\r\nand boundary modes), to investigate nonlinear stability under\r\nsharp linear stability criteria and for non-monotonic equilibria\r\nthat cannot be handled by the usual energy-Casimir method, and to\r\nestablish nonlinear instability from linear instability when the\r\nparticle trajectory is non-integrable. \r\n\r\n     A plasma is a gas composed of particles, each carrying a\r\npositive or negative electrical charge, with approximately equal\r\nconcentrations of each charge.  Most of the universe is plasma;\r\nexamples include the solar wind, the ionosphere, galactic nebulae,\r\nand comet tails.  Plasmas also arise in physics and engineering,\r\nfor instance in nuclear fusion.  The investigator studies the\r\nstability and instability of equilibria in fluids and plasmas. \r\nMathematical advances here enhance our understanding of the\r\nphysical mechanisms that govern stability and instability, and so\r\ncan lead to better numerical methods for simulations of these\r\ncomplex phenomena.  Fluid stability is important in understanding\r\nthe mechanisms of ocean waves and the movements of the atmosphere\r\nas well as in engineering applications.  Questions of plasma\r\nstability arise in areas as diverse as sunspots, fundamental\r\nplasma physics, the design of fusion machines, and plasma display\r\ndevices.",
