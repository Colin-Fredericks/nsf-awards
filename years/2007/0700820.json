 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: This project involves the development of an optical receiver technology that can provide a dramatic leap in performance.  The research approach used is based on a novel amplification device called the Solid-state Impact-ionization Multiplier.  This device employs the same gain mechanism found in avalanche photodiodes but has physical advantages that allow for lower-noise amplification and thus improved receiver sensitivity.  The basic mechanism of the Solid-state Impact-ionization Multiplier has been demonstrated by fabricating devices in silicon and measuring gain and frequency responses.  Computer simulations have been used to design a next generation device capable of high speeds (2.5 Gbit/s).  The premise of this proposed research program is that high-speed Solid-state Impact-ionization Multipliers can be fabricated and integrated with photodiodes and post amplifiers to produce extreme sensitivity optical communication receivers.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The research program outlined above has significant broader impact.  In addition to advancing receiver and device science and technology, the work will incorporate a strong educational component that will take advantage of the cooperation between BYU and industry partners.  Graduate students will participate in device simulation, fabrication, packaging, and testing.  Undergraduate research will also be integrated into the project and will specifically be involved in the creation of demonstration models that will be used for an outreach program.  This outreach will be centered on BYU's Summer of Academic Refinement (SOAR) program.  SOAR allows hundreds of under-represented minority high school students to spend several summer weeks on the BYU campus preparing for college admissions and learning about different programs of study including those in science and engineering.  Workshops with SOAR students will use newly created demos to introduce them to the principles behind optical communications, optoelectronics, and the specific research being pursued at BYU.\r\n",
