 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to fabricate electro-active polymer (EAP) based nanocomposites using nanoimprint lithography (NIL), and to engineer the size, morphology, and distribution of nanoscale fillers precisely in an EAP matrix, a task that is very difficult to achieve by conventional nanocomposite processing techniques.  The EAP matrix will be patterned using nanoimprinting, which is then used as a template to deposit second-phase fillers with designed size, morphology, and distribution. The NIL-based processing will be used to design and optimize electro-active polymeric nanocomposites for various applications, guided by nanomechanics modeling and simulations. The structures and properties of NIL-processed nanocomposites will also be thoroughly characterized to validate theoretical models and confirm the designed property enhancement. Such nanostructure engineering will enable the design and optimization of electro-active polymeric nanocomposites for enhanced functional properties, ideal for many technological applications, including sensing, actuation, energy storage, and electromagnetic interference shielding.\r\n\r\nThe NIL-based nanocomposite processing could lead to nanostructure-designed EAP devices and systems with enhanced functionality. Furthermore, education and outreach activities tightly integrated into research will be carried out, including: (1) graduate students will be trained in the integrated research and educational program; (2) undergraduate students will be trained through Undergraduate Research Program at University of Washington; (3) a set of carefully designed experiments underlying nanoimprinting will be developed for K-12 teachers and students to convey the key concepts of Nanotechnology; and (4) collaborations with industry partners will be actively pursued for applications of the developed materials and technology. These activities will stimulate scientific interests of college and K-12 students, promote public understanding on nanotechnology, and attract and train next generation of workforce in nanotechnology.\r\n",
