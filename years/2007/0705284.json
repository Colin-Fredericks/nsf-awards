String duality from string theory has motivated many deep\r\nmathematical results and theories. The principal investigator\r\nproposes to have an intensive study on applying localization method\r\ncombined with other newly developed geometric techniques to solve\r\nfundamental problems arisen from string duality about the geometry\r\nand topology of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and stable maps.\r\nThere are several specific problems that we hope to solve under the\r\nsupport of the proposed research grant, these include the general\r\nrecursion formulas for intersection numbers of general tautological\r\nclasses which include the Faber conjecture \r\nas special case, the Virasoro conjecture for general projective manifolds,\r\nthe understanding of topology, algebraic geometry of moduli spaces,\r\nand the computing of the holomorphic anomaly by using our geometric\r\nresults about moduli spaces.\r\n\r\nThe interactions of mathematics and physics have motivated many \r\nfundamental advances in both disciplines.\r\nString Theory, as the most promising candidate for the grand\r\nunification of all fundamental forces in the nature, should include\r\nall previous theories like the Yang-Mills and the Chern-Simons\r\ntheory. String duality which identifies different theories in string\r\ntheory has produced many surprisingly beautiful mathematical\r\nformulas about the geometry and topology of moduli spaces of Riemann\r\nsurfaces. The mathematical proofs of many of these conjectural\r\nformulas depend crucially on localization techniques. This program\r\nwill not only help verify important physical theories, but also\r\nproduce beautiful and fundamental mathematics. In carrying out the\r\nproject we will also train several young students and post-doctors to conduct research in\r\nthese subjects through collaboration and lectures.",
