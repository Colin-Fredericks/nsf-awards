The aim in the\r\nfirst project is to give a topological interpretation to the\r\nclass of highest weight representations of infinite dimensional\r\nKac-Moody groups. The PI plans to construct a variant of equivariant\r\nK-theory on the category of spaces that admit a proper action of\r\na Kac-Moody group. In particular, one hopes to relate the class of\r\nhighest weight representations with elements in this\r\nK-theory. This project will generalize recent work of\r\nFreed-Hopkins-Teleman. The authors cited gave a topological\r\ninterpretation of the positive energy representations of Loop\r\ngroups. This is a special case of an affine Kac-Moody group. \r\nThis research program will study more general Kac-Moody groups.\r\nThe goal of the next project is to understand the topology of the\r\nspace of compatible complex structures on a symplectic\r\n4-manifold. This builds on an earlier joint project of mine where\r\nwe showed that for rational ruled surfaces with arbitrary\r\nsymplectic forms, the space of compatible complex structures is\r\nweakly contractible. In that project, we use a comparison\r\ntechnique that relates the space of complex structures with the\r\nspace of almost complex structures, and decompose the latter\r\nusing the theory of J-holomorphic curves. In the proposed\r\nproject, we will attempt to apply our techniques to other\r\n4-dimensional symplectic manifolds. As a by product of our\r\ntechniques, we hope to derive consequences about the group of\r\nsymplectomorphisms of 4-dimensional manifolds. In the final\r\nproject, we study a new cohomology theory called real\r\nJohnson-Wilson theory, and develop computational tools to make it\r\naccessible. Real Johnson-Wilson theory is constructed by taking\r\nfixed points with respect to an involution on standard\r\nJohnson-Wilson theory. These are 2-local theories indexed over\r\nthe integers, with the first theory being 2-localized real\r\nK-theory. We plan to use our tools, along with techniques in\r\nAlgebraic Topology, to settle various old questions regarding\r\nimmersions of real projective spaces in euclidean\r\nspace. Previously, the best know results used the theory TMF\r\n(Topological Modular forms).\r\n\r\nThe general focus of my projects is to explore the interaction\r\nbetween geometry and topology.  The objects of study in geometry\r\nare fundamental physical objects (in possibly more than three\r\ndimensions), that are endowed with various structure. The\r\nstructure one associates to these spaces could be as crude as the\r\nhomotopy type (the information about the space that is preserved\r\nunder all continuous deformations), or one may be interested in\r\nmore subtle structure like the differential structure (the local\r\ninformation about the space that makes it smooth). One may refine\r\nthe smooth structure even further and study symplectic, or\r\ncomplex structure. These questions are motivated by fundamental\r\ninquiries into our physical universe. Indeed, mathematical\r\nphysics is a rich source of questions and ideas. Given a\r\nparticular structure of interest, one may ask the question of how\r\nto enumerate them. In other words, one is interested in ways to\r\nparametrize all possible structures on a space. For example, John\r\nMilnor was the first person to really show that spheres admit\r\nmultiple non-equivalent smooth structures, starting with the\r\n7-dimensional sphere which admits 28 such structures. One of my\r\nprojects is to study the question that inquires into the number\r\nof complex structures in 4-dimensional smooth spaces. The\r\ntechniques that one uses to understand the space of complex\r\nstructures is to decompose it into pieces that have some\r\nsignificance in terms of their symmetry. Then one studies these\r\npieces using the invariants of topology and then reassembles\r\nthese pieces to get a coherent picture on the global level.  The\r\nquestion of symmetry is also important in other projects that I\r\npropose. For example, the linear symmetries of a vector space\r\n(like euclidean space), which preserve some property, are known\r\nas representations. Another project aims to study a class of such\r\nrepresentations that act on infinite dimensional vector\r\nspaces. We will try to encode these objects via a topological\r\ninvariant known as equivariant K-theory. Such invariants are\r\ngenerally known as cohomology theories and form natural\r\nreceptacles for algebraic information derived from geometry. In a\r\nthird and final project, the PI plans to develop such a\r\ncohomology theory, called real Johnson-Wilson theory. We hope to\r\njustify its importance by showing that it helps to solve an old\r\ngeometric question about the minimum dimension of euclidean space\r\nwhere a certain class of spaces, known as real projective spaces,\r\nmay be realized.\r\n",
