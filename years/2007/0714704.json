 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea Studios Foundation will extend the Strange Days on Planet Earth multimedia initiative to raise public science literacy on pressing environmental issues.  Based on pioneering Earth System Science research, Phase Two will be a media and outreach project focused on the ocean and water issues.  The goal of the project is to increase public awareness and understanding of the scope and scale of key issues affecting the ocean.  At the core of the project is a four part television documentary series for PBS primetime entitled Strange Days, Ocean.  The programs will concentrate on four content areas: overexploitation of ocean resources, pollution, coastal development, climate change and the role of the ocean in Earth's system.  Each episode is structured around a compelling scientific questions designed to engage the audience in a search for answers based on the most current research from the varied Earth System Science disciplines.  The series focuses on explaining how scientists come to know what they know.  The series will be complemented by activity-based learning supported by a national consortium of informal learning institutions, a citizen science program, training sessions for informal educators, and a project website.  Collaborators include the National Geographic and three new major partners: Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Program to expand citizen science programs around invasive species; Americans for Informed Democracy (AID), dedicated to organizing college campus educational events; The Ocean Project (TOP), a network of 600 organizations; plus the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum and eight other informal science institutions.  Knight Williams Research Communications, and Public Knowledge and Cultural Logic will assess the impact of the series.  The project will contribute to the field of informal science education by providing widely applicable communication lessons on ocean and water issues and a model methodology for creating science education media that is credible, informative, and relevant. The results of two unique adult learning case studies will be shared with the field through presentations at national meetings and workshops, and posted online.",

Overall, the viewers consistently liked the program, thought the story was interesting, felt the program was visually exciting and clear, and struck the right balance in terms of the amount of science provided. \u00e1\u00e1Moreover, viewers with and without prior knowledge of otters demonstrated they learned new information about otters, relating to their: grooming/feeding behavior, survival threats, importance as a keystone species, rehabilitation, and need for conservation.\n\u00e1Study 2, which compared the viewing experiences of adults that viewed the film in a theater versus an educational screening, further found that the project generally achieved its goals of motivating both types of viewers to: a) recommend the film to others and to b) visit the Otter 501 Facebook and homepages. \u00e1Most viewers indicated they were extremely likely to do each of these activities, or reported they had done so already. Viewers also indicated they were likely to watch otter videos on YouTube and follow-up on ways they could help sea otters, or had already done so. \u00e1Despite their willingness to explore these social media and take some action, however, the viewers as a whole indicated they were unlikely to follow the project on Tumblr or Twitte..."
