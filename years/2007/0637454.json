 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I research project will develop monolithic multicolor sensor array with high quantum efficiency, high speed for numerous system applications. Today's sensor arrays are designed to work either in visible or in near infrared region. None of these can provide broad spectral response (300 nm to 2500 nm). The goal is to identify suitable sensor array structures for broad range detection, with combined high quantum efficiency, and high speed. A second goal is to identify a photodiode or sensor array structure where each pixel can be addressed independently. The design, performance simulation, and also physical parameters optimization will also be carried out as a part of this research activity.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research is that broad spectral image sensors are required for various ground-based, air-borne, space-borne geo-science instruments for the atmospheric properties measurement, surface topography, range detection, remote sensing, and real-time monitoring of biological systems. To date, several sensors covering different spectral ranges are used for this purpose. Next generation geo-science and astronomical instrumentation require single sensor that can detect multiple spectral bands (300 to 2500 nm of wavelengths) and could be used for multiple earth-science measurements. Use of single sensor having multifunctional capability can make the instrument unusually small, light and low-power requirement.\r\n",
