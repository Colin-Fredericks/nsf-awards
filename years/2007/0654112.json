 "awd_abstract_narration": "The FlexEBio Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award supports a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional science and engineering doctoral program for biodevice development in flexible electronics. Three core institutions (Cornell University, Binghamton University, and the University of Albany/Wadsworth Center) work with key partners in US academia (Clark Atlanta University, Howard University, Lincoln University), overseas(Cambridge University, Seoul National University, University of Melbourne) and in industry(DuPont, Endicott Interconnect, General Electric, Kodak, Rohm & Haas). The program links (a) research in fundamental physical and biological science; (b) training in innovation and team-based technology management; (c) curriculum development; and (d) extended internships at international partner laboratories and at commercial facilities. Program faculty will mentor student research in i) bioelectronic and bio-optic sensors; ii) the material-biology interface; and\r\niii) flexible neural electronics. A coordinated course of study will cover topics related to\r\nnanobiotechnology, flexible electronics, ethics, and biophysical laboratory methods. These research experiences and courses will be the foundation for student-initiated Team Focus Projects aimed at designing and prototyping new breakthrough devices. Partnerships with minority-serving institutions will enhance the diversity of the program and provide avenues for doctoral research to students from underrepresented groups. The program will develop globally engaged scientists and engineers who have acquired the vision and motivation to apply their unique talents to advancing the emerging biodevice revolution. These student leaders will have impact on technological advances such as mechanically-compliant neural implants and wirelessly-controlled sensing and drug delivery.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.\r\n",
