 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Title: \"Statistical Methods for the Combined Analysis of Biological Networks and Large Data Sets\" \r\n\r\nThis project is awarded under the Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biological Informatics Program for 2006. The research develops statistical methods to better incorporate the many different sources of data available in biology into a single coherent analysis. In particular, the research focuses on using biological information that is represented visually as a network or graph as an aid to analyzing the massive amounts of data collected in high throughput experiments. By incorporating the information from the network, the analysis of the experiments will be more biologically relevant and also better explain the complexities of the biological system as a whole. The research will make use of statistical learning tools, in particular kernel methods, as well as other statistical procedures for multiple testing and estimation. \r\n\r\nThe training goals of this fellowship are to develop skills for interfacing between statistics and biology -- an important part of which will be developing collaborations with biologists. The research will be carried out in the lab of Sandrine Dudoit at the University of California, Berkeley where the fellow will gain experience in compiling networks and other information from large biological databases and in implementing and disseminating software code to other researchers. \r\n",
