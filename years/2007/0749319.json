 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:\r\nThe objective of this SGER proposal is to investigate, specialized physical models and numerical techniques required to simulate novel devices and materials including, high efficiency multi-junction and multi-gap solar cell structures;  The PIs would like to create accurate simulation models for the variety of materials used in solar cells; and will conduct experiments on various samples of solar cell advanced material structures in order to confirm predicted efficiencies by modeling and simulation.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\nThe PIs plan to use novel modeling, simulation and experimental techniques to work in areas of research that are within the main stream, but have potential for unique results.  These areas include such materials as crystalline Si, amorphous and microcrystalline Si, and CiS, CdTe and other II-VI Ternary thin film cells. Material engineering through induced band gap manipulation and band gap splitting, such as introduction of nitrogen and of oxygen in highly mismatched semiconductor alloys (HMA) are also active research areas. \r\n\r\nBroader impact:\r\nThe proposed research will be conducted within the Center of Excellence for Renewable Energy (CERE) of the University of the District of Columbia whose mission includes the dissemination of the benefits of renewable energy in the community at large. The Center engages several undergraduate science and engineering students in research on various topics related to renewable energy power generation. Research results will be displayed to the public in the soon to be completed zero energy visitors? center (ZEVC) on the Van Ness campus of the University located in upper-north west of Washington D.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
