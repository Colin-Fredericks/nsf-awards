 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), mesh networking, appropriate sensors, and model-based control software to improve both the efficiency and the environmental impacts of aluminum smelting. The project includes 1) Evaluation of the robustness, latency, & desirable power management issues when WSNs are employed in \"hostile\" heavy industries; 2)   \"Micro-energy audits\" to measure typical heat fluxes and vibrations in order to provide design rules for other researchers who desire to run WSN nodes without replaceable batteries; 3) Determining the energy efficiency and pollution control; and 4) Large current measurements with precision in hostile environments.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the value of energy saving resulting from full deployment of the wireless technology throughout the US aluminum industry would be approximately $130 million/year with comparable savings possible in Canada, the EU and other nations. Such energy savings would likely be accompanied by savings of maintenance cost and the benefits of diminished fluoride emissions. The proposed technolgy can contribute to the advancement of wireless technology in many fields.  Examples include the copper industry or chlor-alkali industry, the tanks, distillation columns and other equipment of an oil refinery and the looms of the weaving industry.\r\n",
