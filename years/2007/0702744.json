The research will result in the development of new building blocks (i.e. a new MATLAB toolbox, called Power Box,) which are fully parameterized for power and performance. The proposed research involves the design and development of theory, algorithms, software implementations, and experiments, with sufficient scope for education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in VLSI design and system modeling. The research results will be widely available through PIs' publications. This project can effectively serve the large, complex, digital system simulation community of researchers, in both academia and industry to boost further research and to reduce design cycle time. This collaborative research will be performed by researchers at the University of North Texas (UNT) and the Texas A&M University (TAMU). \r\n",
