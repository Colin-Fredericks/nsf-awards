 "awd_abstract_narration": "This endeavor is to provide need-based student travel grants to attend the Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, held April 25-27th, 2007, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The symposium traditionally brings together researchers in the broad field of wireless and sensor networks including distributed signal processing, network protocols, architectural considerations, wireless communication, network middleware, network services and applications, platform design, and communication resource management. The symposium is well-aligned with the goals and thrusts of the NSF Networking Technology and Systems\r\n(NeTS) Program. The purpose from the aforementioned travel grants is to encourage the attendance of those students who otherwise would not have the opportunity to visit the conference. The effort is directed at promoting student exposure to research and enhancing the integration of research and education, pursuant to NSF policy.",
