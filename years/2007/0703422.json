 "awd_abstract_narration": "The supplement will allow the college to examine its STEM program\r\nspecifically focusing on Mathematics 120 (MATH 120). This course is the lower level remedial\r\nmath course. Available statistics show more than half of all incoming students need this course\r\nand of these, half will fail the first attempt. For the CCCC students, this course is truly the\r\ncritical gateway. To graduate, transfer to a four year college, and enter a STEM career, the\r\nstudent must succeed in this course.\r\nThrough this grant, the college will pilot innovations in its math instructional delivery\r\nand identify critical changes needed in the infrastructure of the college to foster student success.\r\nThe college fully expects the lessons learned in this project will have widespread application to\r\nfirst other STEM courses, but ultimately to all courses offered by CCCC. This is in keeping with\r\nthe college's belief the STEM courses are a critical core element of the college. The college will\r\nuse the prior three years as baseline data for purposes of comparing the test areas of this grant.",
