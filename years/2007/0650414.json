 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division Prof. Richard N. Zare of Stanford University and his postdoctoral and graduate student colleagues will examine chemical reactions with the most exquisite detail.  Prof. Zare and his group will continue their studies of state-to-state reaction dynamics in fundamental chemical systems, seeking to identify how chemical reactions depend upon the precise distribution of molecular excitation within the reacting partners, and to probe the deposition of the energy into the chemical products.  The ultimate goal of these studies is to understand, at the most fundamental level, the driving forces for chemical reactions.  The centerpiece of this work will be the study of the reaction and inelastic scattering of a hydrogen atom with molecular hydrogen.  \r\n\r\nProf. Zare will continue to serve as a mentor to a diverse group of young scientists, and will continue in his wide ranging efforts at educating the public about the importance of science.  In this regard, Prof. Zare's service as a host of WONDERFEST is emblematic; WONDERFEST is a Bay Area celebration of science and attracts over one thousand people a year to learn about and debate upon current topics in science.\r\n",
