 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the organization of the annual CISE PI meeting for REU Sites.  The meeting is to be held in April, 2007 in San Jose, CA. An executive committee of CISE REU Site PIs, led by the PI of this award, is organizing the meeting.  The PI meeting provides an opportunity for REU site PIs to network and share details about their sites. The PI meeting provides an excellent mechanism to sustain and improve the well-developed CISE REU Site PI community and promote collaboration and success through participation in the community. \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in strong team that is leading the effort. The leadership team includes three individuals who are respected for their research as well as their involvement of undergraduates in their research. The meeting includes opportunities for the PIs to promote their own sites and research, as well as to develop ideas for increasing the value of the REU site program as well as enhancing the many research efforts that are the foundation of the REU site experience.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience for undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups and community college students. The REU Site program is one of the most effective ways of transitioning undergraduates to graduate school.  Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.  The project will also provide a better technically educated workforce to meet national security and economic priorities.\r\n",
