 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is the development of a numerical tool to optimally design multiscale nanocomposites. A multiphysics optimization framework that uses lower fidelity simulation models in place of molecular dynamic material simulations to drive the nanocomposite design process will result from this work. Existing molecular dynamic material simulations can take up to 24 hours to complete on a 32 processor parallel computing system. The high cost of computation associated with invoking the molecular dynamic material simulation prevents it from being used alone in the optimization process where reaching a solution may require hundreds of iterations. The use of lower fidelity physics models facilitates the use of optimization tools for this class of material design problems. Model management strategies pioneered by the investigators will be employed to guarantee that design decisions based on lower fidelity information will yield improvements in the actual nanocomposite material design. The proposed research is one of the first developments of a material design tool that integrates atomistic and meso-scale simulations within an optimum design framework. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of high-temperature nano-ceramic matrix composites. The proposed multiscale design tool will significantly reduce material design cycle times as compared to expensive ad-hoc experiments for developing advanced nanomaterials. The design methodology developed in this research, when applied specifically to SiC-Si3N4 nanocomposites, will be useful for understanding the applicability of these materials to future fossil energy conversion systems. The demand for higher efficiency and reduced emissions in advanced fossil-fuel conversion systems will require materials with higher oxidation, corrosion, creep, and fracture resistance.\r\n",
