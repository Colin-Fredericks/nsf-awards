These responsibilities take two forms: participating in governance of the\r\nInstitute through participation in the IIASA Council and direct interaction with the organization; and\r\nfacilitating and encouraging U.S. interest in IIASA's activities. The Board on International\r\nOrganizations (BISO) of the National Research Council (NRC) executes these responsibilities through the\r\nU.S. Committee for IIASA, chaired by Professor Simon Levin of Princeton.\r\nIIASA was established in 1972 as a multilateral, non-governmental research institution devoted to\r\ninterdisciplinary, policy-oriented research. At IIASA, multidisciplinary, international teams of\r\nresearchers conduct research on issues related to environmental, technological, and economic aspects of\r\nglobal change, including energy and technology, population, and natural resources. The Institute thus\r\nserves as a neutral forum for sustained investigation and discussion of global and international issues. It\r\nis located in Laxenburg, Austria, near Vienna.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal consists of the work by the U.S. NMO, in collaboration with\r\ninterested U.S. researchers and Government agencies, to formulate U.S. views regarding IIASA's\r\nresearch, budget, and administration. This helps to insure the integrity of the Institute and guides the\r\nIIASA research program in ways that will maintain its quality and its relevance to U.S. research and\r\npolicy concerns. The NMO works to broaden the impact of the Institute and its work by serving as a\r\nliaison to the U.S. science, technology, and policy communities, with the goal of increasing participation\r\nin and awareness of IIASA by Americans in academia, government, business, and non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs). This includes recruiting for and funding IIASA's Young Scientists Summer\r\nProgram for advanced graduate students; helping to find suitable candidates for IIASA's job vacancies;\r\nserving as the hub of a national network of interested scholars and policymakers; and helping IIASA to\r\nfind opportunities to participate in national policy debates.\r\nThe chairman of the U.S. Committee represents the U.S. NMO at IIASA's Council meetings. The\r\nCouncil is composed of representatives from the 16 NMO's; each NMO country pays an annual\r\nmembership contribution. The U.S. Council member was elected to a three-year term as Chairman of the\r\nCouncil in November 2003, and he works with the Director of IIASA, the IIASA Council Program\r\nCommittee, and the IIASA Science Advisory Committee to guide and strengthen the IIASA research\r\nprogram. The U.S. national committee carries out an annual review of IIASA's research progress,\r\nsoliciting comments from academic, government, and other experts in the U.S. scientific community.",
