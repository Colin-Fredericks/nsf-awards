Researchers will approach questions on multiple scales, including the molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem.  \r\n\r\nThe research conducted by the center will increase the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners by solving problems on multiple temporal and spatial scales and determining fundamental solutions that transcend traditional species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Center for Advanced Forestry Systems came into existence in September 2007 with North Carolina State University as the lead institution and concluded Phase I in August 2013.  Originally four universities were sites within the center and currently that number has expanded to nine.  The mission of the center is to conduct interdisciplinary and interregional research and technology transfer to promote forest productivity, value and sustainability.\n\nKey research projects that NC State faculty and students have conducted include a field study to determine how specific genotypes behave in plantation settings.  Although the study is ongoing, results to date indicate there are differences among crop ideotypes (narrow or wide crown) that will allow forest landowners to maximize growth and value in plantations.  Another study examines the theoretical limits to forest productivity by eliminating nutrient deficiencies and weed competition in forest stands.  Results show that, on a variety of soil types, potential productivity is substantially greater than that normally achieved in plantations, providing landowners with additional options for establishing and maintaining plantations.\nIn addition, several other research studies have contributed to the overall understanding of pine plantation establishment and management in the US and South America, including: effects of site preparation, early fertilization and weed control on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) growth in the southeastern United States; long term effects of soil preparation, weed control and fertilization on loblolly pine growth in Argentina; mid-rotation fertilization in loblolly pine plantations; loblolly pine growth response to early fertilization; response of mid-rotation loblolly pine plantations to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilization; surface and subsurface tillage in the southeastern US; mid-rotation weed control and fertilization; rate and frequency of N fertilization in juvenile stands; response to repeated nutrient additions at different rates in young loblolly pine stands in Argentina; a thinning by fertilization trial series; managing density to optimize value in fertilized pine plantations; thinning and fertilization in loblolly pine in Argentina; and early thinning and fertilization study in loblolly pine in Uruguay.\n\nResults have been disseminated to member companies and the general public through Center meetings, scientific conferences and guided field tours.  As these practices are put into place, forest landowners, including CAFS members will derive greater financial returns from their plantations and society will be able to grow more wood on less land, allowing for alternative land uses.\n\nA major focus of CAFS is graduate and undergraduate training in industry-relevant research.  During Phase I, 11 graduate students received their degrees, including 3 masters students and 8 PhD students.  Of these, 1 MS student is employed by forest industry, 1 is employed by an environmental consulting firm and 1 returned home to employment in Sweden. Of the PhD graduates, 1 is employed by the US EPA, 1 for a non-profit research institute, 1 is now an assistant professor, 1 is in a post-doc position, and 4 work for forest industry, 3 of these companies by CAFS members.  Twelve undergraduate students at NC State have been employed or conducted undergraduate research projects as part of CAFS.  Two of these were funded by supplemental REU grants and one by a REV grant.\n\nFinally, CAFS scientists have contributed significantly to the scientific literature and community.  NC State CAFS scientists have published 20 peer-reviewed journal articles as author or co-author.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barry Goldfarb"
