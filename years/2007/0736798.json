 "awd_abstract_narration": "Toward understanding the relation between volcanic eruptions, \r\nseismicity, and infrasound\r\n\r\nResearchers at the University of New Hampshire and Lehigh University are \r\nfocused on understanding the relation between volcanic eruptions and the \r\nenergy which is radiated into both the seismic and acoustic wavefields.  \r\nThrough support from the National Science Foundation, they will be \r\ninvestigating the temporal relation between explosive degassing and the \r\ngeneration of elastic waves in order to gain greater insight into \r\nvolcano conduit source processes prior to and during explosive \r\nfragmentation of magma.  They will also be quantifying the elastic \r\nenergy release and comparing it with observed eruption intensities \r\n(quantified through high-speed video), which will be used to develop \r\nempirical and theoretical models for energy transfer during eruptions.  \r\nThis topic has import implications for using elastic waves to remotely \r\nasess the intensity of eruptions especially during periods of inclement \r\nweather when visible or satellite observations are not possible.  A \r\nbetter understanding of the mechanisms and trends of volcanic activity \r\nwill ultimately increase our ability to predict the timing and nature of \r\ndestructive events\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these goals, the grantees will analyze existing \r\nseismo-acoustic datasets from seven diverse erupting volcanoes, which \r\nexhibit intermittent and low-level explosive volcanic activity.  \r\nAdditionally, two volcanoes located in Guatemala (Fuego and Santiaguito) \r\nare to serve as field sites for an integrated seismo-acoustic-video \r\nexperiment to be conducted in the winter of 2006.  These two volcanoes \r\nhave been selected because of the extraordinary visibility of their \r\nactive vents afforded from vantage points atop nearby neighboring \r\nsummits.  High-speed, high-resolution, satellite-time synced video will \r\nbe acquired in concert with seismic and acoustic monitoring.  New video \r\nimage processing techniques will be developed to analyze and quantify \r\neruptive manifestations.  The intellectual merit of this project \r\nincludes improved understanding of the enigmatic seismicity that is \r\nradiated during volcanic eruptions.  Other broader impacts include \r\nresearch opportunities for a graduate student at the University of New \r\nHampshire and expanded collaboration and outreach with volcano \r\nobservatories in other countries. \r\n",
