The network will support involvement and collaboration in the CI-ML community and enhance the existing engineering virtual organization (EVO) infrastructure by promoting the creation and sharing of resources and software tools.  The CIMLVIN is intended to facilitate interaction between CI-ML researchers and cooperation with bioinformaticians, computational physicists, chemists, biologists, earth science researchers, and others.\r\n\r\nThe CIMLVIN will facilitate a virtual community for researchers, software developers, educators, and end-users for the sharing of computational and educational resources relevant to CI-ML.  Members will contribute data for sharing, data utilization and analysis software, and other computational tools.  Members will also evaluate and accept software submitted by contributors for inclusion in the network's repository.  The potential research and technical benefits of the network include acceleration of CI-ML discovery, access to experts, technology transfer towards applications, facilitation of collaborative application development, interdisciplinary interaction, open access to the network environment for end-users with less computing and educational resources, and upward mobility for all end-users based on their contributions.  Educational benefits of the network include bridging research and education, access to well-documented CI-ML tools along with their theory, insight into working applications, access to practical models, and the opportunity for students and practitioners to add their own contributions.  The network will feature access to prerecorded multimedia lectures, as well as to virtual laboratories and educational demonstrations.  Outreach activities to broaden the impact of this EVO include familiarizing K-12 students, teachers, and counselors with CI-ML applications and demonstrations and offering orientation sessions about virtual communities.  Project activities include a workshop on ?CI-ML Cyberinfrastructure for Research, Education and Practice? to identify key challenges and opportunities.  The workshop will develop advice on how to best define and implement the network, which collaborative tools and strategies are to be adopted for the full implementation, and what are the priorities and specifications for the software to be developed to achieve the long-term objectives of the CI-ML EVO.\r\n",
