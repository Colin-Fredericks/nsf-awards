With the advent of lithium batteries used in cell phones and laptop computers, the search for an all solid state battery has continued. Current configurations have a liquid or gel electrolyte between the anode and cathode. This leads to problems with electrolyte loss and decreased performance over time. Polymer electrolytes are more compliant than conventional inorganic glass or ceramic electrolytes. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate novel nanoscale polymer electrolyte flexible thin films based on the self-assembly of block copolymers. Block copolymers will be synthesized, consisting of polyethylene oxide (PEO) as the first block, and a random copolymer of poly(methylmethacrylate) and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMMA-ran-PMAA) as the second block. Casting of the synthesized polymer from a solvent results in a self-assembled flexible nanocomposite structure, with high ionic conductivity and high lithium ion transference. A variety of microstructure and electrical properties characterization tools will be employed to evaluate the self-assembled nanostructured polymeric electrolyte's performance. Molecular weight and polydispersity index are to be determined using gel permeation chromatography combined with light scattering. The microstructure of flexible thin and bulk polymer films will be characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Polymer electrolyte complex impedance spectroscopy will be performed to assess ion transmission and cyclic voltammetry to address cell potentials.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research relate to a block copolymer nanoscale battery system which would be flexible because it is made out of a polymer. The ease of processing a polymer electrolyte would allow the production of thin film nanoscale self-assembled flexible batteries that could be wound into coils or processed as coatings and sheets. A solid polymer electrolyte based on the nanoscale self-assembly of block copolymers will provide devices with integrated electronics, yet distributed over a large area substrate as freestanding flexible films or coatings. The active circuit components would be directly integrated on the flexible substrate. The education activities to be undertaken in this work include undergraduate and graduate course development, graduate student mentoring, and training of a diverse population of undergraduate and high school students.\r\n",
