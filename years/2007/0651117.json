 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides travel funds for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate researchers to actively participate in the Wind River Conference on Procaryotic Biology.  This conference is held annually and features four keynote or thematic lectures given by distinguished scientists who are leaders in their respective fields of prokaryotic microbial biology. The majority of the remaining oral research presentations at the meeting are made by students and fellows.  The conference provides an ideal opportunity for these young scientists to have the experience of presenting their data in a clear, concise and informative manner, and to field and respond to questions from their peers as well as the senior scientists who attend this international meeting. The meeting agenda is set each year to address the most important emerging issues in prokaryotic biology. Moreover the meeting provides a unique and conducive atmosphere for young participants to interact with senior scientists, professors and researchers in an informal manner, to discuss research, and to arrange formal and informal collaborations, studentships or post doctorial appointments.",
