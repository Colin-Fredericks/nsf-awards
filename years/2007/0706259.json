Davis\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years, two new lines of research have opened\r\nup: weighted L^2 -cohomology of Coxeter groups and simplicial\r\nnonpositive curvature. Davis and Januszkiewicz plan to continue\r\ntheir research on these and other topics in geometric group\r\ntheory.  The \"weight\" in L^2 -cohomology depends on a positive\r\nreal parameter q and on word length in the Coxeter group W.  The\r\nmajor unsolved problem is to determine this cohomology in the\r\n\"intermediate range,\" for q between r and 1/r, where r is the\r\nradius of convergence of the growth series of W.  Januszkiewicz\r\nplans to develop a theory of \"combinatorial nonpositive\r\ncurvature\" which will simultaneously generalize simplicial\r\nnonpositive curvature and the theory of nonpositively curved\r\ncubical complexes.  In this new theory the cells will be products\r\nof simplices.  Other problems concern the compactly supported\r\ncohomology of buildings, the L^2 -cohomology of hyperplane\r\ncomplements and the question if certain hyperplane complements\r\nare the classifying spaces for Artin groups.\r\n\r\nNonpositive curvature relates to areas outside pure mathematics\r\nranging from robotics to statistical mechanics. The theory of\r\ngroups generated by reflections is ubiquitous in mathematics.\r\nReflection groups are used in areas ranging from geometry and\r\ntopology to dynamical systems to number theory and they play a\r\ndecisive role in Lie theory and in the theory of algebraic\r\ngroups.  Around 1960 Jacques Tits introduced the notion of a\r\n\"Coxeter group.\"  Synonymous terminology could have been an\r\n\"abstract reflection group.\"  Coxeter groups form a much wider\r\nclass of groups than do the classical examples of geometric\r\nreflection groups.  In 1987 Moussong proved that each Coxeter\r\ngroup acts as a reflection group on a certain nonpositively\r\ncurved space. Because of this, Coxeter groups have become\r\nimportant in geometric group theory both as a source of new\r\nexamples and as a paradigm for predicting new results.  The new\r\nresearch on weighted L^2 -cohomology has revealed some unexpected\r\nconnections between several different topics in the theory of\r\nCoxeter groups.  More remains to be discovered.\r\n",
