 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular layer deposition (MLD) is the primary focus of this research project.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor George and his coworkers at the University of Colorado are examining the mechanisms and processes of sequential self-limiting growth of conformal molecular and polymer layers on solid substrates.  Using a viscous flow reactor coupled with FT-IR, quartz crystal microgravimetry, and quadrupole mass spectrometry, the mechanism and kinetics of various self-limiting molecular layer deposition reactions are being examined.  The processes developed here will be useful in the design and fabrication of organic electronic devices and nanocomposite materials with novel mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. \r\n\r\nA combination of process engineering and fundamental surface chemistry is the focus of the research carried out by Professor George and his coworkers at the University of Colorado.  The investigation of self-limiting molecular layer deposition reactions is being done using a flow reactor and various spectroscopic probes of the growing molecular layers.  Polymer coupling reactions, the use of bifunctional precursors in the growth process, and exploration of inorganic/organic nanocomposite materials are the three major thrusts of these studies.  \r\n",
