The University of Alabama in Huntsville is establishing a detector characterization laboratory. The primary objective of this effort is to realize the full potential of CCD technology that may offer superior soft X-ray, EUV, UV, blue and near-IR sensitivity, as well as superior radiation tolerance and point spread function control compared to traditional astronomical CCDs.  Dr. Oluseyi will work to address the under-representation of women and minorities in astronomy and physics, connecting students with appropriate mentors, preparing students for key transition points in their careers, keeping students motivated and inspired, and providing students with appropriate scientific challenges.  These efforts will be in partnership with Alabama A&M University (a Historically Black University), the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and NASA's National Space Science Technology Center.  \r\n\r\n",
