The use of the jet-environment interaction as the framework to explore jet physics is novel, and is an especially fruitful approach to some of the most basic and refractory problems involving jets that have remained unsolved for over thirty years.  Because the radiative signatures of this interaction can span many orders of magnitude in energy, the conference will present and discuss X-ray, optical, infrared and radio data.  In addition, cosmogonic models show an increasing need for energy feedback during the early epoch of galaxy formation, which is likely to be coming from active galactic nuclei, and thus probably jet-related.  The emphasis at this meeting is thus relevant to understanding the fundamental parameters of jets themselves, and to current research on galaxy formation and evolution.\r\n\r\nA major goal of the workshop is to enhance communication and to further collaboration.  Ample time for discussions is scheduled between and around talks.  Publication of the proceedings will help to ensure that progress made at the meeting will have the greatest long-term impact on the participants' research, and that this influence can spread beyond the attendees themselves.  There will also be an important impact on the University of Alaska Anchorage, the primary local host for the meeting, which is working to enhance its visibility in scientific research and to encourage more Alaskan students to stay within the state for their higher education.",
