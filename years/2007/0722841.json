 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to Clemson University under the direction of Dr. Steven E. Ellis for the acquisition of a laser capture microscope system for use in research and education.  The system will allow biologists to excise small tissue samples, or remove parts of living cells for further study of genetics and biochemistry.  This microdissection tool can be used by a wide variety of researchers, including work on bovine mammary tissue, oyster bio-mineralization, and plant development.  Researchers from science departments across the Clemson campus, as well as those from a nearby small college, can also take advantage of the instrument.  The microdissection system will be used in student research and in courses and workshops for undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom will receive hands-on experience with the device. Special training sessions will be held for students in programs recruiting women and underrepresented groups into the science curriculum, and in summer programs for high school teachers.",
