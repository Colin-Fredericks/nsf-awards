 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI, together with his collaborators and students, will develop new \r\nmodels and numerical algorithms for the solution of a number of \r\nfundamental problems in image processing and computer vision. The \r\nmodels will be based on the calculus of variations and partial \r\ndifferential equations (PDE) that describe curve and surface \r\nevolutions. A main goal of the project will be to devise new models \r\nthat incorporate prior shape information into existing variational \r\nimage segmentation techniques such as the Mumford-Shah model and its \r\nvariants. The new models will be designed to find in given images \r\nobjects resembling a specified shape regardless of the objects' \r\nlocation and orientation in the image. In addition, they will have \r\nconvenient numerical implementations using techniques that have already \r\nproven their utility in related vision applications, such as the level \r\nset method. A second area of research will be to develop novel, \r\nefficient numerical algorithms for the solution of PDE that arise in a \r\nnumber of computer vision models and in other fields such as material \r\nscience. Specifically, the investigator will explore new computational \r\ntechniques for the solution of high order PDE that describe geometric \r\nmotion of interfaces, such as the Willmore flow and motion by surface \r\ndiffusion. These evolutions are computationally very expensive using \r\ncurrent techniques. The new approach will be to reduce the computation \r\nof these motions to alternating simple operations for which efficient \r\nalgorithms are already available. Also in this vein, the project will \r\ndevelop new numerical algorithms inspired by models and techniques in \r\nimage processing for the computation of energy driven dynamics of \r\nmultiple phases and junctions.\r\n\r\nImage segmentation is a fundamental procedure of computer vision. It is \r\na necessary preliminary step whenever useful information is to be \r\nextracted from digital images automatically. Its goal is to identify \r\nparts of the image that belong to distinct objects, often without \r\nknowing what objects might be present in the image. In many practical \r\napplications, however, a specific object of known shape is sought in \r\nthe images. For example, in aerial imagery, the object of interest \r\nmight be a certain vehicle that has a distinctive outline. Or, in a \r\nmedical application, it might be desired to identify automatically the \r\nindividual vertebrae in x-ray images of the spine. It such settings, it \r\nwould help the success rate of the segmentation procedure if the \r\nalgorithms could be made aware of what is being sought. This project \r\nwill develop models and numerical techniques that incorporate prior \r\nshape information about objects of interest into the segmentation \r\nprocess, thereby leading to better segmentation methods.\r\n",
