 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests funds for a gas-chromatograph time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a preparatory fraction collector and a liquid chromatograph-linear ion trap mass spectrometer with multiple sample ionization modes and an analytical fraction collector.  The instrumentation will be used by the PI and her students to characterize and purify biomolecules from complex environmental samples for chemical, biological and geological research efforts.  The facility will be used to support existing and proposed research efforts at SIO, including identification of membrane lipid and protein modifications associated with temperature and pressure tolerance of deep-ocean bacteria, and genomics enabled studies of membrane lipid biosynthesis.  The facility will also be used to develop new analytical methods, and train graduate students in instrumentation operation and use.  Use of the facility by outside users is by invitation.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\nThe PI has a strong record of enhancing the participation of women in science by hosting female high school students.  The proposed instrumentation will complement and expand the capabilities of SIO researchers, as well as invited outside researchers.  Seminars will be held for either the Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry or Marine Biology seminar series demonstrating the facility capabilities and results to the larger SIO populace\r\n",
