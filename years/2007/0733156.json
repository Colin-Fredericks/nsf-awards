 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides NSF support for student travel for a workshop, specifically for women, to be held in conjunction with the 21st ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2007) will be held at Skamania Lodge in Stevenson, WA, October 14 - 17, 2007.   \r\n\r\nSOSP has been the premier forum for operating systems research. Held every two years, and accepting only 20-25 papers, the conference is highly selective.  The SOSP meeting occurs every two years, focused on theories, principles, and practice in operating systems research.  The Systers electronic community was formed at the 1987 SOSP. Participation by women has not increased in the interim.  In recognition of this anniversary and addressing the continuing need to encourage greater diversity in the discipline, this workshop for women graduate and undergraduate students is held prior to the conference. The workshop is designed as a community building event, serving both to educate more women about the opportunities in systems research and to support women who have started working in the field.  \r\n",
