The specific aims are: (1) Determine that microparticles can be incorporated within EBs (2) Determine the spatial distribution of delivered pharmaceuticals within an EB, and (3) Compare particle-released RA to exogenous RA on ES cell differentiation.\r\n\r\nThe research will develop a general strategy for increasing differentiation of embryonic stem cells (within embryoid bodies) into a particular lineage.  Based on evidence that pharmaceutical agents do not freely diffuse into EBs, the investigator proposes that this barrier may be overcome if drug-releasing microparticles are incorporated into EBs.  This fundamental approach can have broad applicability to the directed differentiation of ES cells. In the long term this project has the potential to provide significant new information in work toward using stem cells for multiple therapies that require their controlled differentiation.\r\n\r\nThe project includes training of high school and undergraduate students through established mechanisms at Georgia Institute of Technology.\r\n",
