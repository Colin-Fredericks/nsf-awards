Banerjee  INC3: CONFERENCE PROPOSAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to request travel funds from NSF to enable faculty from the US to attend the Third International Nanotechnology Conference on Communications and Cooperation (http://www.imec.be/inc3/about.html) from April 16-19, 2007 in Brussels, Belgium.  In addition, we plan to invite some of the younger members of the faculty, who will present posters highlighting their work.\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis conference is being sponsored by SRC-SIA, NSF, IMEC, JEITA-JSI, and several European and Asian companies It will feature invited speakers and poster presenters from industry, academia, and government who will describe how to \"foster communication and cooperation on nanotechnology subjects among the organizers, sponsors and the world scientific community to stimulate and support economic growth in the 21st century.\"\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe conference will help address issues related to ITRS technology roadmap and how nanotechnology can play an important role in continuing the growth of the Electronics beyond the limits envisioned by the ITRS roadmap.  It is of fundamental importance that these limits are overcome in the next 10 years, perhaps through the use of nanotechnology. Global senior researchers, industry leaders and policy makers from North America, Europe and Asia will hold discussions on a variety of efforts in nanoscience, along with opportunities for collaboration \r\n\r\n\r\n",
