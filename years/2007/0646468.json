 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to the University of Texas at Austin under the direction of Dr. Ann Molineux to conserve, re-house, and produce digital records of the Non-vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory (NPL) type and figured collections. Fossils that are degenerating due to a condition known as Bynes Disease will be cleaned and repaired.  The project will upgrade housing of the entire type collection used in preparing the original figures for species new to science.  Multiple digital images will be made of each specimen, and these will be integrated with other relevant data from field notebooks, thin sections, and surface peels.  A graduate student and two undergraduates will assist with project activities, gaining knowledge and experience in specimen conservation techniques, digital imaging, and georeferencing.  In addition, volunteers associated with the laboratory will learn about curation and conservation practices, as well as assisting in digital imaging and other aspects of data dissemination for the collection.  The project will be publicized on the internet, including a website called PaleoPortal, which contains a wealth of information usable by the nonscientist.",
