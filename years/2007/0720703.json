 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are those computer-based systems that have an intimate coupling with the physical world, which range from the nano-world to systems of systems.  Envisioned CPS are complex systems that are composed of hardware components and software components and that must interact with a dynamically changing environment.  Many CPS applications are safety critical and thus it is important to ensure they work safely and reliably.\r\n\r\nComponent-based engineering has been widely accepted as an approach to facilitate the design of complex systems.  It is based on the premise that a complex system can be designed by decomposing it into simpler components and then by composing the components using interfaces that abstract component complexities.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed work is to develop a compositional framework of components that serve as building blocks of CPS.  The approach is to define the notion of a component that includes physical components (sensors and actuators) and computation tasks mapped to hardware platforms.  The component is abstracted by a resource interface.  Based on this notion, the project aims at the development of compositional analysis techniques for CPS based on compositional analysis of concurrent systems and hierarchical real-time scheduling\r\n\r\n\r\n",
