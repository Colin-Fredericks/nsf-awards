 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cornell University proposes a project, called BPC-DP: Worlds for Information Technology and Science (WITS), that will broaden the participation of women and minorities in computing through the use of service learning. Service learning has been shown to appeal to higher percentages of women and underrepresented minorities by providing contextualized learning and community building that enhances self confidence. The proposed project includes the development of a new three-credit course, Computing in Context, which integrates concepts of computer and information science into a curriculum that includes undergraduate mentoring of middle school students as an outreach component. As the undergraduates guide middle school student teams in the building of virtual computer and information science fair exhibits in a cyber-based science museum of online virtual worlds, called CyCentr, the undergraduates apply their own learning of design concepts for collaborative environments, including working knowledge of networks, file systems and formats, communication protocols, and security. To ensure scalability and adaptability, the approach will be tested at three geographically dispersed university institutions providing different higher education and middle school environments.",
