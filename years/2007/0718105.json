This project is developing a five-course curriculum in indigenous science focused on the needs of Native American and Alaska Native students seeking careers in STEM disciplines, especially biology and environmental science. Courses at three of the mainstream institutions with the highest number of Native American undergraduate and graduate students in the country are being enhanced by the development of web-based interactive applications, which are helping to compensate for the lack of published textbooks in the field, as well as by distance-delivery technology that is allowing faculty to provide lectures and discussions for courses offered at other institutions. Assessment of student progress and evaluation of project objectives is addressing course content as well as cultural context and sensitivity. A long-term goal is to disseminate the curricular materials to programs at tribal colleges and universities and at mainstream institutions with interest in Indigenous science, as well as to programs training tribal environmental professionals, resource management agency personnel, and communities.",
