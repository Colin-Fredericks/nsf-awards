 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop will be convened to provide a forum for Education and Outreach (E&O) managers from NSF-funded facilities, centers, and large projects to discuss present programs, potential future collaborations, issues of common interest, and the importance/relevance of E&O programs in these NSF funded initiatives. A white-paper summarizing the discussion will provide various NSF GEO programs with input for future priorities.\r\n\r\nThe leads for Education and Outreach programs will meet at NSF headquarters in Arlington, VA, on March 13-14, 2007. UNAVCO will provide logistics and leadership for the meeting organization. A Steering Committee will help define points of discussion and finalize the agenda for the meeting. Funding from NSF will provide expenses for approximately 24 participants.\r\n\r\nTopics will include but not be limited to\r\n. Overview of present programs (provided in written form by participants)\r\n. Potential collaborations\r\n. Importance of the synergy, stability, and expertise provided by long term programs\r\n. Evaluation of large projects, expectations from NSF; do we have model programs for this?\r\n. Diversity\r\n. Future meetings\r\n\r\nSpecific outcomes will include:\r\n. a well articulated statement regarding the current roles that these organizations play in achieving the mission of NSF;\r\n. a list of needs from these projects and organizations relevant to how they can better serve their constituencies;\r\n. how these organizations can provide scaffolding for the support of broader impact of scientific research; and\r\n. input to NSF program officers in preparation for a cohesive strategic plan for GEO and its divisions.",
