 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to create a coordinate measuring machine that enables rapid acquisition of three-dimensional coordinate data of engineered devices consisting of geometrically complicated micro/nano features. The approach consists of three technological innovations. The first one is the design of a novel multi-axis probing system, which can simultaneously control the tip position and tip orientation, and which enables rapid surface digitization of three-dimensional structures. It can regulate the orientation of the tip according to the surface normal of the sample, and thus precisely control the tip-sample interaction point when digitizing surfaces that have large geometric variations. The second innovation is a dual-actuator tip-motion control scheme which achieves high bandwidth tip-motion control. It aims to make the entire cantilever bandwidth of the probe available for rapid coordinate acquisition. The third innovation is to integrate the multi-axis probing system with an ultra precision six-axis motion control stage to realize a multi-axis coordinate machine.\r\n\r\nUpon successful completion, the technological innovations will have significant impact on advanced instrumentation and modern manufacturing technology. It will add a new dimension to scanning probe microscopy in general and enable three-dimensional coordinate metrology of micro devices in particular. The acquired coordinate data will facilitate the design and production of three-dimensional engineered devices in terms of dimensional control, tolerancing, and uncertainty analysis.",
