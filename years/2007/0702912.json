 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Center for Rapid Prototyping and Additive Manufacturing Technologies (RAPIDTech) is a nationwide consortium of community colleges, universities, and industry. The lead community college has the unusual distinction of leading the rapid prototyping industry and keeping technician education in rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing on the cutting edge of industry. Rapid prototyping is an enabling technology that supports design, development, and manufacturing of numerous products across many industries and academic disciplines. \r\n\r\nThe center is making key alliances with industry partners, professional organizations, and NSF projects and centers throughout the United States. These alliances are forming the foundation for growth and sustainability of the RAPIDTech Center. A strong consultant base is guiding the research into how these technologies can be utilized by various programs within the educational community.\r\n \r\nThe center is providing faculty development workshops on the latest rapid prototyping technologies and introducing faculty to project-based curriculum materials that demonstrate proper deployment of rapid prototyping throughout the product evolution process. Thus, the center is creating curriculum of varying size and content in both text and digital formats using national standards. Learning objects, mini-modules, full modules and case studies are being used to assist faculty members with introducing rapid prototyping into a variety of STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nFinally, the center is helping industry and schools select rapid prototyping equipment and advancing technicians who can maintain that equipment. The center is leveraging the intrinsic interest and excitement of rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing to engage a broader audience of students particularly underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
