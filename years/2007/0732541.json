 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will permit the University of Hawaii (UH) to purchase a new, state-of-the-art electron microprobe (EMP) to support research and education in a broad range of terrestrial, submarine and extraterrestrial topics. Our current Cameca SX-50 is 15 years old and lacks important features (e.g., auto focus and large area crystals) that are needed to improve the quality and quantity of our work, and to expand the nature of the problems we can explore volcanology, experimental petrology, marine geology, planetary sciences, oceanography and material science. A modern EMP is an essential component to our micro-analytical facilities (a new Cameca ims 1280 ion probe, SEM with EBSD and laser ablation ICPMS). The synergy between the researchers using these instruments will enhance the operation of these labs.\r\n\r\nThe funding package for this proposal involves joint support by EAR-IF and OCE-MGG programs, $300,000 in matching funds from UH, and a $400,000 request to NASA for planetary research. In order to maintain a long-term fiscal stability for the facility, UH is providing 50% of the manager's salary. User fees will cover 25% of the manager's salary (other 25% from grants) and cover costs for supplies and a preventive maintenance contract with the EMP vendor. The University of Hawaii has a 27-year record of successfully operating an EMP facility.\r\n\r\nThis new EMP will be a research tool for undergraduate and graduate students. They will be taught the theory and practical aspects of this sophisticated instrument. The EMP will be introduced to other students in UH courses and at demonstrations for local public school students via the internet and during on-campus visits, especially at our open house.",
