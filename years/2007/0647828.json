 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF is one of the participating federal agencies that makes use of the existing fleet nuclear submarienes (SSN's)in order to support Arctic marine science research from a unique research platform in the northern polar regions.  This has been successfully demonstrated during the Submarine Arctic Science Cruises (SCICEXs) Phase 1 conducted from 1993 to 1999.  The SCICEX program continues to capitalize on the exixting submarine platforms with Phase 2 goals to improve the understanding of Arctic Ocean processes and their role in the Earth's climate system.\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation has agreed to support the ost o under ince probes (CTD's) for the SCICEX Phase 2 submarine scientific cruises in the Arctic.  An MOA was developed (and is attached) that outlines how the costs for conductiong the cruises would be split among the sponsoring scientific agencies including NSF.  It was determined that NSF's share would be $60,000.  The determination of the costs are outlined in the 2005 SCICEX Accommodation MOA.",
