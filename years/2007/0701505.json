 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interconnected Molecular Devices with patterned Polymeric Contact Layers\r\nN. Swami, L. Harriott, Electrical Engineering, University of Virginia (UVA)\r\n\r\nThe interconnection of molecular device layers presents a major challenge to the realization of circuits based on molecular electronics. The objectives of this research are to develop strategies for the construction of high-yield interconnected polymer-molecular device junctions through controlled deposition and patterning of contact layers, and devise pathways for the vertical integration of molecular devices into useful circuits. The approach to pattern contact layers is through selective deposition on molecular device layers or selective removal from layers without active device layers, thereby enabling molecular devices with independently addressable arrays of top and bottom contacts that may be integrated vertically to form high-density circuits.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nIntellectual merits of the work include the enabling of better interconnection strategies through the improvement of device yield; the capability to conduct studies on chemical stability, electromigration, and molecular conformation changes within a device junction; and the development of device structures that are compatible with vertical integration. Since molecular electronics is seen as a viable alternative to next-generation CMOS-compatible nanoelectronic circuits, the development of interconnection strategies is crucial to its adoption. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nBroader educational impacts include an understanding of the limits of electronic coupling to molecular device layers from stable polymer contacts, and addressing signal integration of molecular devices with CMOS circuits. One Ph.D. student will be supported for this work, and educational content from this research will be integrated into distance education courses on Nanoelectronics, Nanofabrication and Nano-device characterization.\r\n",
