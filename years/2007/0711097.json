Being able to predict SOA formation is a needed step forward to more accurate air-shed and air quality models, to predicting the health consequences of small aerosol particles and also their radiative impacts in climate models.  This work will continue development of a semi-explicit kinetic model to predict SOA formation in complex mixtures of biogenic and anthropogenic hydrocarbons, ambient oxidants and also existing aerosols under specified atmospheric conditions, as studied in a smog chamber facility at University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill).",

We have also made advancements in developing a new isoprene gas kinetics model. 3. In associated studies we  tracked the reactive oxidant species (ROS) associated with different SOA forming systems. ROS is associated with health impacts from particle exposures. We found the aromatic and a-pinene systems in the presence of an urban hydrocarbon mixture tended to yield the greatest ROS. Isoprene was among the lowest. We also observed that aging dilute diesel exhaust in sunlight more than doubles the ROS over a period of 4 to 6 hours This suggests that as diesel particles age in the in the atmospher..."
