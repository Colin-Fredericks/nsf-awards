 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to the University of Nebraska under the direction of Dr. Scott L. Gardner to expand access to the Harold W. Manter Laboratory of Parasitology collections.  The collections include specimens of parasites of mammals from Brazil and Mexico, nematode parasites from forest insects (Coleoptera) that include many that were new to science at the time of collection.  The specimens will be identified, repaired, and digitally photographed for incorporation into an online database of parasites at the university.  This web-accessible database will be valuable to researchers and the public.  Undergraduates and graduate students will be trained in parasite collection management and work on the database.  At-risk middle school girls will be part of a summer science camp at the university during each year of the three year project.",
