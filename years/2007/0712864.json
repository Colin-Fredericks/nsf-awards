 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER funds a seismic and geodetic experiment to capture the\r\ncharacteristics of an anticipated slow earthquake (SE) predicted to occur on the flanks of\r\nKilauea volcano on March 17, 2007. The experiment would temporarily densify the seismic and geodetic networks at Kilauea in order to clarify the relationship between SE deformation and triggered seismicity during the next Kilauea SE. In the past decade, Kilauea\r\nvolcano's south flank has been the site of at least 7 slow (or 'silent') earthquakes (SEs)\r\nidentified with continuous GPS (CGPS) data. The SEs can be divided into 'Western' and 'Eastern' families defined by similar\r\npatterns of horizontal motions and, of these, the\r\nWestern family are periodic and separated by 774 +/-7 day periods (Brooks et al., 2006). A\r\ndistinct swarm of micoearthquakes is triggered in the same place by the periodic SEs. There is currently some disagreement about whether\r\nmicroearthquakes occur on the regional decollement or\r\npotentially at shallower structural levels. Resolving the discrepancy is\r\nimportant because the location of the microseismicity could be used to help constrain the\r\nlocation and further our mechanistic understanding of the SEs themselves.The physical processes giving rise to the slow slip and associated tremor are the subject of\r\nintensive ongoing research by the community of earthquake scientists. The observations and\r\nsearch for theoretical explanations have stimulated some provocative and potentially\r\nimportant hypotheses. This work would add vital data that may help to distinguish between mechanisms.",
