 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\n\r\nThis project supports a workshop on cyberinfrastructure and engineering education.  The workshop planning committee is organizing a highly interactive, two-day workshop bringing together approximately 40 diverse researchers in engineering education from across the nation. The workshop is striving to build a set of potential applications of cyberinfrastructure for engineering education research and innovation, identify barriers that would hinder engineering education applications of cyberinfrastructure, prepare approaches to reduce negative influences of these barriers, and increase the likelihood of productive collaboration among participants. Workshop participants are exploring challenges facing integration of engineering education and cyberinfrastructure, to expand possibilities posed by the emerging cyberinfrastructure for engineering education research and innovation, and to create a set of recommendations for future action.  In order to disseminate the results of the workshop, the planning committee and interested researchers are using the existing cyberinfrastructure to collaborate to prepare a synthesis and submit it to a journal on research in engineering education.  The effectiveness of the workshop in achieving its expected outcomes is being monitored by an expert, experienced evaluator through the use of qualitative observations at the meeting and various surveys.  The broader impacts include the dissemination of the workshop results and the introduction of the use of cyberinfrastructure into engineering education research \r\n",
