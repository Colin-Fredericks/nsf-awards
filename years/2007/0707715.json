A common thread\r\nrunning through these problems is the following mathematical\r\nstructure: a non-convex potential energy in the lower-order\r\nterms, which includes the loading, in addition to a small,\r\nhigher-order regularization (or singular perturbation),\r\ncharacterized by a small parameter e > 0.  The main goals of this\r\nwork are: (1) to provide classes of rational models --\r\nparticularly in the case of multi-phase lipid-bilayer membranes\r\n-- for understanding the often exotic behavior of such\r\nstructures; (2) to systematically find equilibria corresponding\r\nto local minima of the total potential energy or meta-stable\r\nsolutions.  In addressing (1), observe that mechanical\r\nexperiments on real materials often begin with a homogeneous\r\nspecimen that progressively develops increasingly complex\r\npatterns or micro-structure under steady, quasi-static changes in\r\nloading.  The investigator employs rational continuum models,\r\ncharacterized by general constitutive functions, and looks for\r\nthresholds of bifurcation and exchange of stability to compare\r\nwith experiment.  In particular, meta-stable solutions are the\r\nones presumably observed in quasi-static experiments. \r\nAccordingly for (2) he considers a new methodology based upon:\r\n(a) rigorous existence of solutions for arbitrarily small e > 0\r\nvia symmetry-breaking global bifurcation methods and a-priori\r\nbounds; (b) efficient and reliable global numerical\r\npath-following to find meta-stable states. \r\n\r\n     The project focuses on fundamental modeling and predictive\r\nmathematical analysis for the quantitative characterization of\r\nshape and deformation patterns of certain micron-scale structures\r\nunder applied loading, namely, lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles,\r\nshape-memory alloys and thin films.  Each of these has direct and\r\nimportant connections to basic science and technology. \r\nLipid-bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in bio-molecular systems;\r\nunderstanding and predicting their mechanical behavior is crucial\r\nfor understanding cell function.  The project focuses on simple,\r\nman-made membranes or liposomes.  The future promise of liposome\r\nvesicles (closed membranes) as vehicles for drug delivery demands\r\na fundamental understanding of their mechanical behavior under\r\nloading.  Likewise for phase transitions in shape-memory alloys\r\nand wrinkling/blistering of thin films -- a fundamental\r\nunderstanding and the mathematical prediction of their behavior\r\nare important for characterizing the mechanical properties of\r\nnovel materials and for potential sensing and actuation at the\r\nmicron scale.\r\n",
