 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nTo improve and modernize its instruction in chemistry, the Department of Biological and\r\nPhysical Sciences is adapting a series of discovery-based laboratory experiments to gradually and systematically integrate Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy into the chemistry curriculum. These experiments, which are being incorporated into seven existing courses (General Chemistry I and II, Organic Chemistry I and II, Physical Chemistry I and II and Biochemistry I) as well as a new spectroscopy course, focus on the use of NMR spectroscopy to answer questions, solve problems, or discover new concepts. These types of inquiry-based activities have been shown to improve student learning and increase student interest in and enthusiasm for the study of science.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nStudents are being introduced to 13C NMR spectroscopy by using a new 90 MHz Anasazi NMR spectrometer in general chemistry in an experiment that examines the concept of isomers and another where they investigate the structure of aspirin. Students are learning 1H and 13C NMR in organic chemistry and are using both 1H and 13C NMR in experiments to identify reaction products and study reaction mechanisms. They also are introduced to two dimensional NMR through a HETCOR experiment. Students in the new spectroscopy course use various NMR experiments and techniques including two dimensional NMR to determine the structures of organic and inorganic unknowns. They also visit the NMR and mass spectrometry laboratories at the University of South Carolina to as part of this course.  Students in the biochemistry course use 19F NMR to study enzyme kinetics, and in physical chemistry students use NMR spectroscopy to study reaction kinetics, determine equilibrium constants and to probe spin relaxation effects. With the aid of a local high school teacher, the experiments for general chemistry are being adapted for a high school audience, and high school chemistry classes are invited to Columbia College to carry out these experiments.\r\nAn Advisory Panel that consists of three faculty members from other predominately\r\nundergraduate institutions in South Carolina and the Columbia College's Director of Assessment are helping to evaluate this project. Student learning outcomes have been established for each class in which new discovery-based experiments are being introduced.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThrough this project more than 70 women science majors (44% minority) a year are being\r\nexposed to a series of discovery-based labs and are having hand-on experience with the\r\ninstrumentation used most routinely for structure determination in modern chemistry laboratories. These students also are developing skills that are enabling them to carry out undergraduate research projects.  Through this endeavor, students and faculty at Columbia College are collaborating with faculty at a large research institution and at several other predominately undergraduate institutions within the state. The Columbia College faculty also are broadening their interactions with local high school teachers and students. Results of this project will be disseminated into the chemical education community through conferences and meetings, peer-reviewed journals and through the formation of a South Carolina Anasazi Instrument User's Group.\r\n",
