 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-0730469  Fauchet     The development of rapid, sensitive and easy-to-use biosensors for the detection of a wide range of pathogens continues to be of national importance. Traditional diagnostic methods for the detection of viruses are complex and require operation by a highly trained technician. This level of complexity and cost is obviously undesirable, as it significantly lengthens the time necessary to make a diagnosis in a clinical setting, and severely limits the deployment of sensors and diagnostics to locations where both fully equipped laboratories and trained personnel are available. The development of optical label-free biosensor platforms, which promise to simplify the system complexity while exhibiting desirable performance, is a high priority. \r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nA novel platform for single bioparticle detection is proposed, which is based on two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities fabricated on silicon-on-insulator substrates using microelectronic fabrication steps. Capture of bioparticles in these devices locally increases the refractive index, which can be detected as a shift of the wavelength of light propagation. The photonic crystal microcavities will be designed, fabricated, tested, and optimized for maximum light transmission, and for sensitivity and selectivity to the targets of interest. They will be integrated with microfluidics including a novel ultrathin membrane filter made of silicon that will be used to pre-concentrate the targets. The combination of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and 2-D PhC microcavities will be explored to make identification unambiguous and eliminate false positive responses. \r\nBroader Impact \r\nThe proposed work responds to mounting concern over the rapid rise of new viral pathogens (including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, and the H5N1 \"bird flu\"), as well as continuing concern over the possible use of viral pathogens such as smallpox as biowarfare agents, in response to which the global research community has targeted the development of label-free biosensors capable of detecting single virus particles as a major goal. The proposed research will provide strategies for the detection of not only dangerous viruses but also a wide range of biological targets. \r\n",
