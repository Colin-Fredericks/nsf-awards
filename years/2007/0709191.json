Indeed the spike in semi-major axis distribution of observed new comets is due to the more significant torquing of more distant comets by passing stars and the Galactic tide as a whole. Given this connection, changes in the Galactic environment due to the orbit of the Sun in the Galaxy and drifting of the Sun from its formation environment will have significant effect on the distribution of comets in the Oort cloud and the subsequent delivery of those comets to the inner Solar System.\r\n\r\nIn this research program, Dr. Thomas Quinn and colleagues will first study the formation and evolution of the Oort Cloud over the 4.5 billion years of the Solar System's history assuming a number of different star forming environments.  It is quite likely that the Sun formed in a dense stellar cluster, but the actual densities and timescale for leaving the cluster are uncertain. The work will consider a number of stellar densities and cluster dissipation timescales and compare the resulting Oort Cloud and subsequent comet shower strength with a control case with no cluster environment. The Solar System, however, does not occupy a static place within the Galaxy. The research will therefore go on to incorporate changes in Galactic perturbations as the orbit of the Sun in the Galaxy evolves. This will be accomplished in the context of a cosmologically motivated model of the Galaxy formed via hierarchical merging in a Cold Dark Matter (CDM) Universe. This model has been calculated using the research group's massively parallel cosmological code, GASOLINE, and the model has been shown to produce many observed characteristics of spiral galaxies. The evolution of the Oort Cloud will be calculated as it feels the perturbations of the gas, stars, and dark matter from the disk, spiral arms and other substructure that exists in the galaxy model. The study will pay particular attention to the subsequent changes to the comet flux into the inner Solar System and possible consequences for impact rates on the Earth.\r\n\r\nEver since the connection was made between the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous and a comet impact, a strong connection has been made between comets and the disciplines of Paleontology and Geology. Both Dr. Quinn and the graduate student supported on this award are part of the University of Washington's Astrobiology program and therefore, will be connecting their research to work done by biologists and geologists in that program. The connection between orbital dynamics and comets also engages the public at large. The issues of the origin of our planetary system, how it fits into the galaxy as a whole and the implications for life are issues that draw the public into the results of dynamical research. Dr. Quinn and the graduate student will incorporate their results into their undergraduate classes and public lectures.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Solar System is surrounded by a large number of comets, referred\nto as the Oort cloud, whose orbits extend to 1/3 the distance to the\nnearest stars.  The existence of this cloud is inferred by the orbital\ndistribution of ``new'' comets (like comet Ison), which are produced\nby the perturbation of this cloud by passing stars or the gravity of\nthe Galaxy as a whole.  Because of this connection between the orbits\nof Oort cloud comets and the Galactic environment, this project was\nable to search for evidence of a changing environment of the Sun\nduring the 4.5 billion years of the Solar System's history.\n\nThis work first studied the formation and evolution of the\nOort Cloud over the 4.5 Gyrs of the Solar System's history assuming a\nnumber of different star-forming environments.  It is quite likely\nthat the Sun formed in a dense stellar cluster, but the actual\ndensities and timescale for leaving the cluster are uncertain.  The\nwork considered a number of stellar densities and cluster\ndissipation timescales and compare the resulting Oort cloud and\nsubsequent comet shower strength with a control case with no cluster\nenvironment.\n\nFurthermore, recent work on Galaxy formation and dynamics indicates\nthat, contrary to a long established paradigm, stars like our Sun may\nhave migrated large distances toward or away from the Galactic\ncenter.   This large scale change in the Sun's orbit around the Galaxy\nwould result in differences in the number of encounters with passing\nstars, and the overall gravitational force of the Galaxy.  This study\nfollowed the effect of such changes on the orbits of Oort cloud comets\nby numerically simulating their gravitational effects.  It was found\nthat the inner and outer edges of the Oort Cloud can vary by an order\nof magnitude, and their radial extent from the Sun tends to be\noverestimated when it is assumed that the Oort cloud formed and\nevolved in a static Galactic context.  A very intriguing result is\nthat extreme cases of Solar migration in the Galaxy can produce\ncomets in orbits similar to the object ``Sedna'', which has a closest\napproach to the Sun well outside the planetary region, but is too\nclose to the Sun to be significantly perturbed by passing stars in the\ncurrent Galactic environment.  Hence Sedna may be evidence that our\nSun did indeed undergo significant radial migration within the Galaxy.\n\nFurther confirmation of this idea will require more observations.\nThis project modeled the observed orbital distribution of outer Solar\nSystem comets as they are observed by recent surveys, such as the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and future surveys, such as the Large Scale Synoptic Telescope survey (LSST).  This work suggests that an object\ndiscovered by the SDSS may be the most distant Oort Cloud object ever\ndiscovered.  Deeper outer Solar System surveys like the LSST could\ndiscover a number of similar objects, the distribution of which will\nhelp constrain the most likely Solar System formation and migration\nscenarios.\n\nMost of the work performed here was by two graduate students.  Both\nstudents were trained in techniques for performing large numerical\nsimulations using high throughput computing systems, both on\nUniversity of Washington computing resources, and on national\nfacilities provided by the National Science Foundation.  Both students\nwere also mentored through the production of refereed papers and the\npreparation of conference presentations.  A significant amount of work\nwas also performed by an undergraduate student.  The participation of\nthe undergraduate was a direct result of the involvement of this\nproject in the University of Washington Astronomy Pre-MAP (Pre-Majors\nin Astronomy Program).  Pre-MAP is a program to increase diversity in\nundergraduate Astronomy majors by reaching out to entering UW\nstudents who are interested in math and science and who are\ntraditionally underrepresented in astronomy (women, African Americans,\nLatinos, Native Americans, Asians/Pacific Islanders, low-in..."
