 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor John Dorsey and his group at Florida State University are studying superheated water as a chromatographic mobile phase and reaction medium.   Thorough thermodynamic and salvatochromic investigation of retention in superheated water chromatography, they aim to elucidate the retention mechanism and improve predictability and understanding of the technique.  Because chromatography is such a widely used separation technique, and because the chromatography experiment is often used as a model for a variety of partitioning processes, such an understanding is highly desirable.  Use of superheated water chromatography is currently limited to the academic laboratory; better fundamental understanding is necessary before the technique can be accepted in the analytical laboratory.  \r\n\r\nThere are a variety of advantages that are associated with using superheated water as a mobile phase, such as a reduction in cost, increase in analysis speed, and improvements in analyte detection.  These advantages could be especially important for furthering the goals of \"green\" chemistry, and for the recent drive for Process Analytical Technology (PAT) by the pharmaceutical industry.  Information learned here will also impact the use of this solvent as a reaction medium.   Students associated with this program gain valuable insight into important multidisciplinary areas.\r\n",
