 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genetic basis of the speciation process is a difficult issue in evolutionary biology.  The proposed project will identify genes related to reproductive isolation and phenotypic differentiation in a highly diverse group of marine fishes, the rockfish (genus Sebastes).  Genes that play a role in pigmentation will be targeted. These include genes for gamete recognition and sperm competition.  In other species similar genes display signals of natural selection and evolve in a rapid manner.  Genes expressed in the gonads and skin of selected rockfish species will be sequenced to generate large sequence databases.  This DNA sequence information will be analyzed in a comparative genomic framework to identify genes that are rapidly evolving and subject to selection.  Further analysis of genes across a larger set of rockfish species will elucidate the mode and timing of selective events.\r\n\r\nLittle is known about genes that are important in reproductive isolation in fishes, and this project will generate a suite of candidate genes to study the functional aspects of reproduction in rockfish and other fishes, as well as provide a framework to study speciation in the marine environment.  Funding will be used to train undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in genomics and evolutionary analysis.\r\n",
