 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project revolves around the idea that learning physics is the most effective in an interactive learning environment involving two related components that are usually kept separate: a real-world experiment and a computer-based visualization. In this project, we will create a learning environment that combines microcomputer-based laboratories (MBLs) with immersive virtual-reality technology. While MBLs will provide students with the possibility of real-world experimenting and data collection, supported by real-time graphing tools, virtual reality technology will be used to support the visualization of both visible and invisible physical processes and abstract concepts (e.g., vectors of forces, field lines or energy levels) underlying the same experiment students observe in MBLs. The research objective of the current project is to investigate how different aspects of computer-based visualization, supported by immersive virtual reality and MBLs, affect and interact with student-generated visual/spatial representations and students' qualitative understanding of abstract physics phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, the project will bring new insights as to how to use visualization to facilitate student' conceptual understanding. In addition, the project will give a theoretical basis for design and evaluation of educational materials involving different visual/spatial representations. Tools and materials we develop in the project will make it easier for faculty around the country to develop students' visualization skills and qualitative reasoning in introductory physics classes.\r\n\r\nThe educational objective of the proposal is to develop educational software and curriculum materials in the area of introductory mechanics with a focus on visualization processes, which allow students to participate actively in their own learning and to construct scientific models.\r\n",
