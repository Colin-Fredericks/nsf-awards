This research places its \r\nemphasis on dark matter and black holes. Whereas recent studies have made \r\nprogress on the evolution of their stellar populations, empirical data \r\non the co-evolution of stars, dark halos, and black holes are needed to \r\nunderstand the formation of spheroids in a cosmological context.  The \r\nnew observations made under this award will provide an empirical benchmark \r\nfor the next generation of theoretical models of galaxy formation.  \r\n\r\nDr. Treu will also work on several educational/public outreach components\r\nas a part of this award.  The general public and K-12 student efforts, \r\nbased on a collaboration with the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural history \r\n(SBMNH) and the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCOGT), will consist of a series \r\nof public lectures in the Museum auditorium.  In addition, the LCOGT is \r\ndonating a 32\" telescope to the UC-operated Sedgwick Natural Reserve. \r\nDr. Treu will work with K-12 teachers and the SBMNH to establish an \r\nastronomy curriculum at Sedgwick.   At the undergraduate non-science major \r\nlevel, Dr. Treu is developing, in collaboration with the UCSB Religious \r\nStudies (RS) and History (H) departments, a course entitled \"Origins\", \r\nwhich will be organized around questions such as \"What's the Universe \r\nmade of?\". For each question, students will be exposed to the distinct \r\nmethodologies employed by scientists, philosophers, theologians, so as to \r\nappreciate the essence and the importance of the scientific method.  \r\n\r\nThis award is funded by the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences",
