New protocols for multiscale materials assembly and patterning, model microfluidic devices and chemical actuators, and fundamental understanding of novel ways to fabricate sensors are the focus of this research program. Surface chemistries to promote molecular recognition, to inhibit non-specific protein binding, and to respond to environmental stimuli are being developed.  The result of this research is the development of useful design rules for the construction of improved analytical sensors and devices. \r\n\r\nUsing a systematic approach to multiscale soft patterning of polymer materials, decal transfer lithography, and contact printing methods, Professor Nuzzo and his coworkers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are developing novel methods for the fabrication of analytical devices.  A combination of materials and surface chemistry approaches are being used to develop the fundamental understanding that leads to design rules for the fabrication of complex multiscale sensors and actuators.  This fundamental information has impact across a broad range of disciplines. \r\n",
