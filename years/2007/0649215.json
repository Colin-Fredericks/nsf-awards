The program will provide a comprehensive research experience to 25 undergraduates each year for three years at NNIN's 13 university sites.  The focus of the NNIN REU program is to stimulate and excite undergraduates, especially underrepresented students, with advanced research projects involving nanoscale across many disciplines by leveraging advanced facilities, outstanding faculty, and strong mentoring and training.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the program are to: (1) provide undergraduate students with advanced nanotechnology research project experience, and training on advanced equipment; (2) promote student excitement towards graduate level research and careers in nanoscale science; (3) recruit and provide opportunities for women, minorities, and students from non-research institutions; and (4) enhance student 's presentation skills and expose them to a breath of nanotechnology research topics.\r\n\r\nThis REU program will significantly contribute to the pool of scientists and engineers trained in nanotechnology.  The students will benefit from dissemination of their research through the website, which will include a webcast of their final oral presentations and the written NNIN REU Research Accomplishments publication.\r\n",
