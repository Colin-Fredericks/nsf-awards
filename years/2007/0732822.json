 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of molecular tools to polar phytoplankton and biogeochemical studies has been hindered thus far by the lack of sequence data. The research project will create a foundation for polar marine phytoplankton genomics and proteomics, by surveying three major taxa common to Antarctic waters using primarily expressed sequence tags libraries (EST).  These expressed sequence tag libraries will be developed under environmentally relevant conditions, in particular under iron limitation, to improve gene models of key genes involved in important polar biogeochemical processes. In addition, the investigators will use this extensive sequencing project to begin to address important and timely research questions related to the interactions of phytoplankton with the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and iron. The PIs include a molecular biologist and an environmental bioinorganic chemist/biochemist, both with recent field experience in the Ross Sea.  Their collaboration will place genomics tools in a polar region that is undergoing rapid change and plays an important role in global carbon cycling  The P.I.'s will work with a freelance journalist and National Public Radio reporter to develop a series of stories for distribution in local and national radio markets, with content focused on polar research and genomic tools. In addition, a high school teacher will be hosted at one of the participating institutions.  A polar genomics module will be developed for the Venter Institute's mobile outreach laboratory: DISCOVER GENOMICS!  Finally, the proposed EST sequencing and bioinformatic data management program will be synergistic and collaborative with the European Union funded functional genomics DIATOMICS project that involves laboratories from 5 European countries and Israel.  \r\n",
