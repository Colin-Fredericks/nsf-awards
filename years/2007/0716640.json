This project instead seeks to reap significantly greater utility by considering a more restricted scope: a system for coordinated security analysis based on exchanging information between a set of sites who have explicitly decided to work with each other.  This more limited scope optimizes for the common case that in such an environment the participating sites will usually (but not always) act in a responsible manner.\r\n\r\nA key focus of the project concerns automating the steps commonly involved in security monitoring and forensic analysis while still keeping an analyst \"in the loop\" for significant decisions.  As security problems arise, a site detecting an incident codifies a description of the attack in an \"analysis script\" to export to other sites.  Analysts receiving such scripts inspect them to determine whether they are of interest.  If so, they can instruct the system to conduct both a retrospective search for the activity in the past, and refine the site's monitoring configurations to detect future instances.\r\n\r\nAs validating such an approach requires operational deployment, the project seeks to demonstrate a working system for coordinating analysis between the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, and the University of California at Berkeley.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
