 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this conference is to have research workers in aspects of classical analysis (e.g. function theory, operators arising in the theory of functions, harmonic analysis, etc.) to attend to discuss and present their work. It will have a focus on the work of X. Tolsa. \r\n\r\nSeveral experts will discuss their new results which use the tools and results of some of his material. There will be a presentation of some of his results and the techniques he uses to establish his results. In addition to this material we are encouraging other research workers in the areas (noted above) to come and present their work. In particular we hope to attract newer workers (i.e. recent Ph.Ds) to attend and give talks on their works. We will have principal (one hour) speakers from Europe and the United States ( Nicolau, Richter, Seip and Sundberg).",
