 "awd_abstract_narration": "FETCH is a new PBS television series with accompanying Web and outreach activities targeted to 6- to 10-year olds.  The program brings science learning to young children by uniquely blending live-action with animation, game show convention with reality programming, and humor with academics.  The intended impacts are to: 1) reach the target audience about what it means to be a scientist and encourage them to pursue a science career; 2) provide outreach partners with curriculum that supports content-rich ISE activities and career explorations in varied settings; and 3) demonstrate how media can be used to teach substantive science and share the results of project evaluation with others in the field.  The requested funds will allow the project to expand the science curriculum with 20 new half-hour episodes and expand the Web site, focusing on three new science themes that highlight a range of careers: habitats, structures, and chemistry.  In addition, funds will support new educational resources for libraries and other youth-serving organizations.  FETCH is produced by WGBH; content and outreach partners include the Association for Library Service to Children, the National Wildlife Federation, and the American Chemical Society in addition to outreach partners in 3,200 youth-serving organizations.  American Institute for Research will conduct formative evaluation for the project; Goodman Research Group will conduct summative evaluation of both the television show and the FETCH Future Scientist Guide.\r\n",
