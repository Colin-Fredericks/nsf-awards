 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis award will provide funds for several graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty to attend an international conference on plant growth and development to be held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico from July 21-25, 2007. The conference is the 19th in a series sponsored by the International Plant Growth Substances Association (IPGSA). These meetings are held every three years and the last three were convened in Japan (1998), the Czech Republic (2001) and Australia (2004). In the 70-year history of IPGSA, the triennial conference has never before been held in Latin America. \r\n\r\n\tPlant growth substances (also referred to as plant hormones) regulate almost all aspects of growth and development, beginning with seed germination through the growth of the parent plant to the development of the flower and the formation of seeds. The scientific program includes 80 invited speakers from 18 countries, each a leader in his or her respective field, together with additional investigators who were selected as speakers after the submission of Scientific Abstracts.  Over 500 poster presentations will be made. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit.\r\n\tThis important conference in Mexico will be an opportunity for young US investigators working in the area of plant hormones to be exposed to the latest, ground-breaking research in the field. This is the only international meeting of its kind, devoted entirely to plant hormones, and it will stimulate research on plant growth substances in the USA. These molecules have long been established as important for U.S. agriculture, and our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of their action is essential for the long-term sustainability of agriculture. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.\r\n\tThe 19th IPGSA Conference in Mexico offers a unique opportunity for US scientists to establish meaningful relationships with their counterparts from elsewhere in the world, but especially from Latin America.  These interactions could include the setting up of collaborative research programs, and the initiation of educational exchange visits between research groups in the US and Mexico. Funds will help defray the costs of travel and registration for junior scientists from the US. Applications from individuals from minority-serving institutions and those with disadvantaged status are especially encouraged. A committee of three IPGSA Council members will be responsible for evaluating applicants.\t \r\n\r\n",
