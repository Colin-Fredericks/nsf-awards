 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Photonically Strongly Coupled Organic/Inorganic Nanocomposites for Light\r\nEmitter and Photovoltaic Applications\" (ECCS-0725740)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this research, fundamental photonic phenomena are combined with new types of organic/inorganic intercalated media on the nanoscale, with the aim to derive exceptionally strong light-matter interaction for applications ranging from compact light emitters to novel photovoltaics. The intellectual merit of the work lies in creating organic-inorganic hybrid photonic materials whose electronic excitations couple beyond the perturbative regime for enhanced light- matter interaction, which exceeds that in present optical devices. This is accomplished by special combination of resonantly interacting materials, exploiting two classes of material which each possess significant optical oscillator strengths, but in a highly contrasting electronic environment. The organic subcomponent of the hybrid nanoscale media is formed from J-aggregate polymers which exhibit exceptional absorption and emission concentrated in narrow spectral ranges across the visible and near infrared. Spectrally matching the organic components are inorganic colloidal II-VI semiconductor quantum dots, which provide pathways via excitation and charge transfer to the organic and external electrical interfaces, respectively. The key physical feature of the intercalated hybrid medium is resonant electromagnetic excitation transfer, which can have near 100% efficiency as an electronic energy transfer channel within the two subsystems, at room temperature.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed work is the potential to insert exceptionally high performance entirely new active photonic material into functional optoelectronic devices, such as light emitters and photovoltaics, spread hyperspectrally across the visible into the near IR portions of the spectrum. The device goals aim to search for novel application spaces presently not accessible or enabled by conventional approaches to these technologies by inorganic and organic semiconductors, respectively, including visual arts. Scientifically, bridging the two rather separate branches of active optical technologies, based on inorganic and organic materials/devices, offers a new prism to view opportunities for synergy and vision to emerging photonics technologies, as well as training of interdisciplinary new generation of technologists. The subject matter of innovative, and structurally flexible and spatially extendable photonic materials offers also an excellent vehicle for outreach and connection to science, including lab experience for undergraduates and teaching aids for GK-12, the latter exploiting Brown University's excellent outreach infrastructure.\r\n",
