In just a few years, many exciting experimental and theoretical results have appeared in the literature. The main effort so far has been on carbon-based systems or isotropic molecules, where the interplay between conduction electrons and the molecular electronic states is expected to govern the behavior of future molecular electronic devices. In this context, this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will investigate the possibilities of using a special class of magnetic molecules, known as single-molecule magnets, to build molecular transistors in which the quantum magnetism intrinsic to the molecules employed will enhance and diversify the performance of future molecular devices. The project will focus in the generation of nanoscale transistors to probe the transport properties of individual molecular nanomagnets and to demonstrate that quantum properties shown by these molecules in their crystal form are preserved when placed on a transistor. These devices have great potential for ultra-high density integration and quantum information processing. Moreover, due to the high sensitivity of single-molecule magnets to magnetic fields, it is possible that they could also function as magnetic detectors. One graduate student will be trained in the frontiers of inorganic chemistry and physics within an environment that crosses the boundaries of these disciplines. In the summer months, research experience will be offered to local high school science teachers and their most promising students, as part as the ongoing outreach effort of the PI's group.\r\n\r\n********TECHNICAL ABSTRACT********\r\nThis Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project aims to investigate the transport properties of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) using single-electron transistor (SET) devices. SMMs are characterized by a large total spin and a strong intrinsic anisotropy. They have been extensively studied in crystalline form during the last ten years. SMMs exhibit steps in the magnetization curves at low temperature attributed to resonant quantum tunneling of the magnetization (QTM). This unique feature of SMMs is a consequence of the quantum superposition of high-spin states of the molecule. However, it has proven difficult to study the properties of an individual/isolated SMM. The ultimate goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using molecular SETs for the study of the interplay between localized high-spin states of an individual SMM and conduction electrons in a three terminal SET, with the specific objective to understand the effect of QTM on transport in the Coulomb blockade regime. Special attention will be placed on device fabrication and chemical functionalization of the molecules to prevent the SMM from degradation when placed on the transistor. The immediate goal of the SGER is to demonstrate for the first time the ability to reproducibly fabricate a SMM based SET in such a manner that the individual SMM maintains the characteristics observed in its solid state form (i.e. single crystal), such as QTM.  To date, despite the efforts of research groups worldwide, fabrication of such an SMM based SET has not been consistently and reproducibly successful.  The successful fabrication of such a device would provide the means to study the transport and quantum properties of an individual SMM.  A graduate student will be trained in the frontiers of inorganic chemistry and physics within an environment that crosses the boundaries of these disciplines. In the summer months, research experience will be offered to local high school science teachers and their most promising students, as part as the ongoing outreach effort of the PI's group.",
