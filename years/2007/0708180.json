 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antman\r\n0708180\r\n\r\n     S. S. Antman and his coworkers treat a variety of dynamical\r\nand steady-state nonlinear problems for deformable rods, shells,\r\nand three-dimensional solid bodies that can suffer large and\r\nrapid deformations.  The bodies are composed of nonlinearly\r\nelastic, viscoelastic, plastic, viscoplastic, or magnetoelastic\r\nmaterials.  In each case, properly invariant, geometrically exact\r\ntheories encompassing general nonlinear constitutive equations\r\nare used.  The goals of these studies are to (i) discover new\r\nnonlinear effects, (ii) determine thresholds in constitutive\r\nequations separating qualitatively different responses, (iii)\r\ndetermine general classes of constitutive equations that are both\r\nphysically and mathematically natural, (iv) examine and predict\r\nimportant kinds of instabilities, (v) determine how existence,\r\nregularity, and well-posedness of solutions of the governing\r\nquasilinear systems of partial differential equations depend on\r\nmaterial behavior, (vi) contribute to the theory of shocks and\r\ndissipative mechanisms in solids, and (vii) develop new methods\r\nof nonlinear analysis and of effective computation for problems\r\nof solid mechanics.  Antman is continuing to make carefully\r\nformulated physical theories accessible to mathematicians, and to\r\nmake modern techniques of applicable analysis accessible to\r\nscientists and engineers, with special attention to graduate\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n     S. S. Antman and his coworkers develop powerful new\r\nmathematical methods for analyzing the large and rapid\r\ndeformations of solid bodies.  This work has applications both to\r\nnew technological materials including \"smart\" materials and to\r\nold biological materials, such as living tissue.  (Although it\r\nhas been known for 50 years how to derive the equations governing\r\nsuch deformations cleanly from first principles without ad hoc\r\napproximations, the mathematical tools for treating these\r\nequations are only now being developed and refined.)  The\r\nspecific problems under study include (1) the deformation of thin\r\nshell-like bodies in a fluid flow, (2) the loss of stability of\r\nsuch a shell subjected to pulsating pressures, (3) the swimming\r\nof eels, (4) the rigorous justification of useful approximations\r\nfor the motions of the body when the loads it bears are applied\r\nslowly or when the loads are very large or when the body is of\r\nlight weight, (5) the buckling of shells, (6) strange effects for\r\nspinning bodies, (7) the development and the preclusion of shocks\r\n(which are large and sudden discontinuities in velocity and\r\ndeformation), and (8) the construction of effective methods of\r\ncomputation.  Antman is continuing to make carefully formulated\r\nphysical theories accessible to mathematicians, and to make\r\nmodern techniques of applicable mathematics accessible to\r\nscientists and engineers, with special attention to graduate\r\nstudents.",
