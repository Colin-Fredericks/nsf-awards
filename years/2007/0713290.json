The proposal seeks to implement this collaborative classification system on a subset of the federated US Government Photographs and Multimedia Collection, and then to perform a series of comprehensive evaluation activities that look at various indicators of success for the project. The primary contributions of the project are expected to be  new user interfaces, open source tools, algorithms and schemes for automated classification.  These resources will be made available for use by others. \r\n",
