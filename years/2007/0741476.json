 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, An Interdisciplinary, Research-intensive Minor in Nanotechnology Studies, at SUNY at Stony Brook, under the direction of Dr. Gary P.Halada, will develop a research-intensive, interdisciplinary Minor in Nanotechnology Studies in the College of Engineering and Applied Science at Stony Brook University.  Key features of the program are 1) an interdisciplinary introductory course which exposes students to technological as well as social and ethical issues; 2) incorporation into existing engineering curricula through incorporation of departmental research experiences in areas of nanotechnology application utilizing co-mentorship and presentation at an annual symposium; and 3) a captsone experience rich in professional development and group learning opportunities. Recruitment to the Minor will leverage required first year seminar courses, and selected students from a nearby private university, Hofstra, will be provided the opportunity to join research teams at Stony Brook.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering Program Solicitation (NSF 07-554), and is being funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).",
