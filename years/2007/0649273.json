 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site is situated at the University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA) which is located in the lower Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas. The REU program will support six undergraduates per year. Students in the program conduct year-long biological research under the supervision of their mentors, focusing on the local environment and organisms. The program runs slightly more than a year for each cohort. Students begin their research programs in mid-summer, continue them through the academic year, and complete them at the end of the following summer. During the regular academic year, students in each cohort: (1) take courses in Biological Writing, Biology Seminar, Statistics, Professional Ethics, and GRE preparation together; (2) attend professional development workshops; (3) participate in two on-site symposia (one in Fall and one in Spring), one regional conference, and one national conference, and; (4) attend presentations by visiting mentors and associated social events. Students' families are invited to attend social events with students, mentors, and visiting mentors, to help educate families about opportunities in scientific careers. During their second summer, students live on-campus to facilitate their research. The last months in the program overlap with the first months of the new students in the incoming cohort. This arrangement provides continuity between projects during transition between cohorts, and allows the veteran students to gain mentoring experience by assisting their peers entering the program. More information is available by visiting http://www.utpa.edu/programs/nsf/ or by contacting Zen Faulkes by emailing zfaulkes@utpa.edu (preferred) or phoning (956) 381-2614.",
