 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWhile mobile embedded systems usually operate in a dynamic ecosystem that includes ambulatory users and changing network conditions, their ability to sense the physical world is limited. Leveraging findings from research in human factors and cost-effective, low-power sensors, this project seeks to enhance sensing capability and provide adequate system support for mobile sensing, and to explore energy-efficient system policies and novel applications that can benefit from this work. \r\n\r\nThis research project is building an open-source system framework that incorporates user information into system resource management. This user-aware framework will enable a mobile embedded system such as an enhanced cell phone or PDA to adapt processing, sensing, communicating in a coordinated fashion, and to support the manner in which these tasks interface for higher operational efficiency. To build this framework, this project investigates energy-efficient integration of low-power sensing, studies system mechanisms to accommodate user information, and provides open-source implementation and programming interfaces. This project applies the user-aware framework to the energy-efficient management of wireless data, particularly within the context of mobile healthcare. In collaboration with health scientists, the project seeks to devise system policies based on the user-aware framework and build prototypes from commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components for evaluation under realistic conditions and through field studies.   This project is expected to produce enabling technologies for new applications of mobile embedded systems. Through the global penetration of mobile phones, this research hopes to empower low-income populations with relevant applications that go well beyond voice communication, with particular emphasis in healthcare. The research results are being incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses in mobile embedded systems. Research tools, collected data, and educational content are made open-source and on-line.\r\n\r\n",
