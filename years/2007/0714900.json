 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances and innovations in biotechnology have promoted significant bioscience research and business in the economic development of North Carolina, and the east coast bioscience and biotechnology centers. Nationwide, the impact of biotechnology, especially on the mapping of the human genome and the applications of such technological advances, has played a significant role in the economic development of this nation. This creates an opportunity to expand the career options for chemistry majors, especially at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU), which is located in the Piedmont Triad region, a major player in bioscience. The goal of this targeted infusion project is to implement a Concentration in Biochemistry within the existing chemistry program at WSSU to enhance the undergraduate curriculum in biochemistry experience. The evident impact of bioscience in research and industry creates a need to offer this biochemistry option not only to ensure interdisciplinary instructions and research training for students, but also to attract more minority students to this scientific discipline. These efforts will also support current initiatives at this institution to fulfill its economic development role. The objectives of this targeted infusion project are; (i) to implement an ACS-Approved Chemistry degree program with a Biochemistry Track, (ii) to adapt and integrate advanced techniques in biotechnology into the biochemistry laboratory instructions, and (iii) to provide instrumentation to support advanced biochemistry techniques that will secure the necessary continuum in instruction, training, and research efforts, for preparing students to be more perceptive to techniques used in bioscience research and industry. The long term goal is to establish an interdisciplinary biochemistry degree offering at WSSU. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of this project include preparing students in response to recent trends in biochemical and biological research and industry, contribute to the research base at the Chemistry Department, and further expose students to the interdisciplinary nature of research. The proposed advanced biochemistry laboratory incorporating a unifying theme on the green fluorescent protein culminating in the structural and stability studies by Circular Dichroism is an innovative part of this project. The modular sequence of the implemented experiments will provide a unified learning experience in the advanced biochemistry laboratory. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include the promotion of economical development in quality students to meet the needs of our society, which is increasingly dependent on advances made in science and technology. The curricular enhancement developed in this project to strengthen the undergraduate biochemistry experience will be published in appropriate journals, disseminated at local and national meetings, and made freely available via websites of both departments to promote teaching, training, and learning. An anticipated outcome of this project on the STEM program at WSSU includes an increase in the number of graduates, including underrepresented minority students, in the chemical and biochemical sciences.",
