 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Doctoral Consortium at The Human Language Technology Conference -- North American chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics annual meeting (NAACL HLT) 2007 is a forum wherein PhD students in their final years of research present and receive feedback on their research from a panel of experts in the field of human language technologies, including computational linguistics, speech processing, information retrieval, and other related areas.\r\nParticipants submit an application containing an overview of their research and are selected based on a blind evaluation process involving established researchers in the area.  The participating students reflect the variety of research areas of the NAACL HLT conference and particularly include groups underrepresented in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe event provides an opportunity for senior PhD students to discuss their research and career objectives with a panel of established researchers in their field.  The event is also an opportunity for students to gain exposure for their work among the Human Language Technology research community, especially from professionals outside of their thesis committee.  Students also attend professional development sessions and present their work to a broader audience during a poster session held during the main NAACL HLT conference. The event is primarily organized and run by students -- providing all the students involved with invaluable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with senior researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference.\r\n",
