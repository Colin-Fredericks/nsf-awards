 "awd_abstract_narration": "A U.S. team of university and high school science educators is to convene a workshop in August 2007, with counterparts in Singapore to explore instructional approaches to the teaching and learning of inquiry-based science. In addition to increased understanding of adopted teaching methods, learning outcomes and the challenges science educators face in each country.  Additional goals of the workshop include: solidifying a network consisting of U.S. and Singaporean science educators, providing U.S. researchers and high school science educators the opportunity to experience first-hand and gain insights into science education at one of Singapore's premier high schools, establishing the ground-work for collaborative research projects to be undertaken by high school students in the United States and Singapore, and providing the foundation for a longer-term research project on inquiry-based science teaching and learning undertaken by researchers at the George Washington University (GWU).  \r\n\r\nThe August 2007, workshop will be hosted by the Hwa Chong Institution (HCI)?the premier Singaporean high school which accepts the top three percent of all students in Singapore. The U.S. workshop participants will include researchers from GWU's Graduate School of Education and Human Development and faculty from the Loudoun County Public Schools Academy of Science (AOS).\r\n",
