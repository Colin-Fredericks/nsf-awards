 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central notion of this project is the Haagerup property which, in recent years,\r\nhas found applications ranging from K-theory of C*-algebras, to rigidity theory,\r\nto geometric group theory. A group is said to have the Haagerup property if it\r\nadmits a proper affine action on a Hilbert space, and a deep result of Higson and\r\nKasparov asserts that a Haagerup group satisfies the Baum Connes conjecture.\r\nIn this project, Lp generalizations of this concept will be studied quantitatively,\r\ntogether with cohomological aspects of the theory. It is for instance planned to\r\nattack a Gromov conjecture about the vanishing of reduced Lp-cohomology on\r\namenable groups. More generally, it is proposed to determine for which amenable groups the first reduced cohomology with values in mixing (resp. weakly mixing) Lp-representation vanishes. In particular, this will produce new geometric invariants for a large class of groups.\r\n\r\nLooking for quantities that remain invariant under certain transformations\r\nis one the main objectives in mathematics as in many scientific fields like for\r\nexample, physics, information theory or finance. The principle behind geometric\r\ngroup theory is that many properties of a space, such as its topology or its\r\ngeometry, can be revealed by studying its set of symmetries. This set has a\r\nmathematical structure called a group structure. The wealth of this approach\r\nresults from the interactions between the algebraic properties of this structure\r\nand its geometric properties. In this project, it is proposed to study new geometric\r\ninvariants of groups, and to relate them with their algebraic structure. Groups\r\nof matrices, that appear as fundamental objects in physics, will have a central\r\nposition in this study.",
