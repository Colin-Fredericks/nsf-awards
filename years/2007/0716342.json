AIP retains much of the elegance and simplicity of  \r\nIP, but is far better equipped to thwart malicious adversaries. To  \r\nprovide this protection, AIP incorporates three kinds of  \r\naccountability: source accountability, control-plane accountability,  \r\nand dataplane accountability. Together, these three forms of  \r\naccountability ensure that any host, router, and autonomous network  \r\ncan identify misbehaving components.\r\n\r\nOperationally, this results in: an Internet in which any spoofing or  \r\nforgery of source addresses is detectable (from source  \r\naccountability); a partial defense against flooding attacks from  \r\ncompromised hosts (also from source accountability); an Internet  \r\nwhere route hijacking and other security compromises to inter-domain  \r\nrouting are impossible (from control-plane accountability); and the  \r\nability for end hosts and operators to pinpoint locations where  \r\npackets are being lost or excessively delayed even when the problems  \r\nare in other networks (from data-plane accountability).\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of AIP is its use of a self-certifying address  \r\nformat. All AIP addresses are of the form AD:EID, where AD is the  \r\nidentifier for the autonomous domain that the host belongs to, and  \r\nEID is a globally unique host identifier. Both address components are  \r\nderived from public keys held by the domain and host, respectively,  \r\nallowing other entities to verify the authenticity and provenance of  \r\npackets and messages. AIP's self-certifying addressing allows simple  \r\nprotocols to realize the above benefits.\r\n",
