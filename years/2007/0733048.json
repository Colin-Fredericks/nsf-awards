 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ice Stories proposed by the Exploratorium strives to create public awareness of the International Polar Year (IPY) and the multi-disciplinary range of IPY research, increase public understanding of the process of scientific research and stimulate an enhanced relationship between IPY research and public outreach activities. Primary project deliverables include: \r\n1) Two workshops for 16 Arctic (workshop 1) and 16 Antarctic scientists (workshop 2) to train them to effectively share their science with the general public. The workshops will cover narrative storytelling, use of video and audio equipment, rough-cut editing, and hands-on camera training. The Exploratorium will serve as an intermediary between the scientists and the public, clarifying content and posting material on the Web. \r\n2) Live Web casts from the Arctic and Antarctic eventually reach 5 a week during each field season. These involve additional scientists, with additional in-situ coverage by the Exploratorium team of Arctic and Antarctic events associated with science and IPY. \r\n3) Creation of a public access Web site where all materials will be posted and archived and updates will be undertaken 2-3 times each week. Materials will leverage existing resources and will include: background on major areas of IPY research, links to national learning standards in STEM, IPY history, biographies of scientists, repurposed material from past Exploratorium Antarctica projects, collected materials from research/production trips to the Arctic and Antarctic and from scientific collaborators, Pod casts, video, RSS feeds, and blogs. \r\n4) An IPY exhibit at the Exploratorium showcasing the materials and sharing of the materials with other museums. \r\n5) Outreach to specific after-school sites will reach underserved and underrepresented children.\r\nIndependent external evaluation of the project will be conducted by Knight-Williams Research Communications.\r\n",
