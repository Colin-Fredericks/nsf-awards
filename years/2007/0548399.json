The conference is an internationally recognized meeting for researchers in the areas of first and second language acquisition, bilingualism, language disorders, and literacy development.  It is attended by 500-600 researchers from around the world each year.  Its presentations are chosen by anonymous peer review, and its proceedings are published by Cascadilla Press.  Since 1976, the faculty and students of Boston University's Applied Linguistics Program have organized and run the conference.  Drs. Shanley Allen and M. Catherine O'Connor lead the team of organizers for the 2007 conference.\r\n",
