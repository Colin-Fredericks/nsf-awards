 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nThe potential role of well-defined polymeric materials in a range of advanced\r\ntechnologies is becoming increasing apparent. From microelectronics, sensors, drug\r\ndelivery systems, catalysts, agents for chemical warfare detection and destruction, smart\r\nsurfaces, to biodegradable tissue replacements, polymeric materials are the critical\r\ncomponents or enabling technologies for the successful implementation of these\r\napplications. This symposium will focus upon recent developments in the catalysts to\r\nproduce well-defined polymers, assembly of polymers into nanostructured materials,\r\nelectronically-functional polymers, polymers for holographic storage and fuel cell\r\ndevices, fundamental investigations of the interfaces between organic polymers and\r\ninorganic substrates, and a significant amount of discussion on the topics of biomaterials\r\nand polymers for biomedical applications. Improved understanding of these complex systems\r\nand their advancement toward new technologies are expected to be the outcomes from such\r\ndiscussions and exchanges of knowledge in these critical areas by world experts, as can\r\noccur uniquely in the framework of the Gordon Research Conferences.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe ability to gather experts within the framework of the Gordon Research Conferences\r\nprovides unique opportunities to exchange data and ideas that will accelerate the\r\ntranslation of polymer materials developments across laboratories and from research\r\nadvances to technological applications. Moreover, the agenda for this conference has been\r\ndesigned to assemble a significant number of speakers and discussion leaders who are new\r\nto this conference to bring new perspectives. Young scientists, postdoctoral associates\r\nand students will be encouraged to attend.",
