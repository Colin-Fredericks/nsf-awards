The goal of the project is to characterize the Egyptian asphalt mixes using modern advanced techniques that are part of the Superpave mix design system and are required to develop pavement design parameters that are needed for a new mechanistic-empirical (M-E) design method. The current flexible pavement design method is empirical and does not relate to the mechanical properties of the asphalt mixes. It relies primarily on the 1986-1993 AASHTO design guide, which is currently moving towards a new (M-E) pavement design system.  The project has two phases. First, to investigate and develop analytical relationships or models that relate the basic properties of asphalt binders and aggregates to the mix properties. Second, to perform dynamic characterization of asphalt mixtures and its materials. All dynamic testing will be conducted at the AUC laboratory in Egypt. Aggregates and mixtures testing using imaging techniques to determine micro structure parameters and its relation to the mix design parameters will be performed at UI. The PI and a graduate student from UI will travel to work with the AUC team on the recently developed pavement technologies. Dr. Khedr and a junior scientist from AUC will visit the UI to work on the project. In addition to reports and papers publication, research findings will be disseminated via a training workshop to be held in Cairo at the end of the project.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project will advance the pavement engineering science by seeking the development of analytical as well as empirical relationships and models that relate the dynamic properties of the hot-mix asphalt (HMA) to the properties of its constituents. Such relationships will enhance the current HMA mix design and evaluation using the Superpave techniques. Furthermore, the dynamic characterization of these mixes will allow for linking the mix design to the pavement structural design using the new mechanistic-empirical (M-E) pavement design method, which is soon to be implemented in the US and in many other countries.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: In addition to facilitating collaboration between the US and Egyptian institutions, this project should impact the advancement of pavement design and construction technologies not only in Egypt but also in the USA.  It will lead to a new pavement design code in Egypt.  One student from the University of Idaho will participate in the research in Egypt, and at least one junior scientist from Egypt will participate in the research at the University of Idaho. The training workshop at the end of the project will allow for practical implementation of the research findings and personnel professional development in pavement design and construction technologies.\r\n\r\nThis project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
