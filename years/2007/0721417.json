Their goal is to establish a collaborative project to investigate the effect of hydrogen and water vapor on the oxidation of chromia-forming alloys for use as interconnect materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).  This is an important scientific and practical issue, which is not completely understood.  In SOFC interconnects, the issue is particularly complicated as the alloys are simultaneously exposed to different atmospheres with different oxygen and hydrogen partial pressures.  The careful and systematic control and measurement of hydrogen during oxidation in the proposed work will improve understanding of this complicated phenomenon.  \r\n\r\nThere is sufficient overlap of interests between researchers at Auburn University and the Indonesian Institutions to indicate that they can successfully pursue the activities proposed, and that the interaction will benefit both sides.  Improved understanding of these interactions is an important scientific contribution that can also be used to address practical problems in the development of solid oxide fuel cells and other high-temperature applications of chromia-forming alloys.  In addition, the techniques developed can be applied to the evaluation of the effects of water vapor on the oxidation behavior of other alloy systems.  The visit will also provide support for two undergraduate students.  This global research experience will likely provide them many opportunities for continuing contacts with their Indonesian colleagues throughout their research careers.  This award is co-funded with the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
