 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the Departments of Computer and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) and Natural Sciences (NS) are working with up to ten students each year and placing them in projects which require training in the use of tools from mathematics and biology. These projects are taken from a variety of areas and include problems in ecology, evolutionary biology, biophysics, and developmental biology. The required mathematical and biological training is accomplished through a combination of tutorials, seminars, colloquia, and new courses. Substantial curricular changes are being made to institutionalize mathematical biology in both the CMS and NS departments. These changes include the development of a two semester calculus sequence for biology majors emphasizing applications to biological problems. A two semester introductory biology/chemistry course is being developed to help mathematics students move into biological applications at an early stage in their career. Mathematics students are able to enroll in upper level biology courses without having taken the prerequisite courses. These prerequisites are obtained through seminars and tutorials. Mathematical biology modules are being introduced into existing biology courses at all levels and new upper level courses in mathematical biology are being developed. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit in the project is that the scientific problems proposed for the students represent innovative research on a level in which undergraduates would not normally participate and if solved, would allow the publication in refereed journals. Each of the investigators is an active researcher equipped to deal with research problems in these areas and to guide students toward their solution. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project are in the work with students and in curriculum development. During the project 30-40 students will have engaged in investigative experiences and presented their work at annual undergraduate research conferences and hence, by example, will impact other students and departments. All biology majors are exposed to mathematical tools through the new required calculus courses. Mathematics students are given more opportunities to study biology through the streamlined access to upper level biology courses referred to above. The curriculum development referred to above, along with degree programs and minors, will provide more career choices for future Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) professionals. Since this institution has a large population of underrepresented minorities, it will encourage traditional underrepresented minority and women students to choose these careers.",
