 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RUI award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports a collaborative effort between Professor Rahina Mahtap at South Carolina State University (SCSU) and Professors Catherine Murphy and Melissa Moss at the University of South Carolina (USC) to integrate research and education in the area of nanobiotechnology.  This research focuses on: 1) the synthesis, surface derivatization, and characterization of gold nanoparticles; 2) spectroscopic studies to investigate whether these nanomaterials can bind to protein aggregates; 3) experiments to test whether the surface-engineered nanomaterials will inhibit protein aggregation; and 4) determining whether nanoparticle inhibitors of protein aggregation can also reduce the toxicity of the protein aggregates in vivo. \r\n\r\nThe project will provide cutting edge research opportunities to under-represented minorities and women at SCSU.  Undergraduate researchers will be trained in the use of spectroscopic equipment, as well as advanced modern instruments (scanning and transmission electron microscopes, Raman spectrophotometer, phase analysis light scattering, circular dichroism spectrophotometry) at SCSU and USC.  SCSU is an HBCU with a 93% African American student population.  The collaborative project includes nurturing of a chemistry culture at SCSU that will include poster and oral presentations at local and national chemistry society meetings and improvement of the SCSU research infrastructure. Existing ties between SCSU and USC will be strengthened, and expand the use of advanced equipment at USC by SCSU researchers. The creation of cutting edge research opportunities, coupled with extensive mentoring, will provide a research environment conductive to attracting underrepresented minorities and women and guide them towards careers in science and higher education. \r\n",
