 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intent of this research is to better understand the processes of technology transfer and adoption for e-medicine in developing countries. The importance and impact of these medical-support-at-a-distance technologies are well documented; what is not well understood is how these are adapted to fit national policies, available infrastructure, regional practices, and local culture. This project will longitudinally track e-medicine initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa, specifically in Ethiopia and Rwanda. The resulting technology transfer models should inform e-medicine efforts in general. \r\n\r\nTelemedicine initiatives have revolutionized medical care for people who live in remote communities traditionally underserved by health services. By allowing medical staff to interact with patients via videoconferencing, collect samples, run tests, and exchange data remotely, they are able to provide a more timely, high-quality level of service than otherwise possible. There is now a growing collection of case studies, documenting the successes and failures of adapting these technologies to particular communities. However, there is limited understanding about the factors that affect these implementations. Through field work, this research will examine a variety of factors (e.g., national policies, available infrastructure, regional medical practices, local culture) that impact specific telemedicine efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa, specifically in Ethiopia and Rwanda. These are regions with grave medical needs where interest in and funding for telemedicine efforts is increasing rapidly. \r\n\r\nThis is a five-year longitudinal study to be supported by a CAREER award. This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
