 "awd_abstract_narration": "Educational Broadcasting Corporation requests funds to develop and produce ten new episodes for a sixth season of Cyberchase.  The new season will introduce a new campaign, \"Get Active with Math\", that focuses on sports and builder's math.  Ancillary materials, outreach, and a highly popular Web site extend the learning and help make Cyberchase the sole mathematics media project available for the target age group.   Cyberchase's content spans the 3rd-5th grade standards of the National Council of Mathematics.   The new programs will enrich the series' content while keeping viewers tuning in to the current shows and bring non-traditional partners into the fold of informal education.  Plans for Season 6 include building the inventory of multi-media outreach activities, strengthening the show's presence in after-school programs and museums through a set of Builder's Math activity kits and a new Web Portal.    \r\n\r\nInnovation/Strategic Impact:  Cyberchase continues to build its effectiveness to inspire children to approach mathematics with confidence and enthusiasm by marrying its innovative content with strong partnerships and promotion.  The program maintains its unique position on broadcast television and the web.\r\n\r\nCollaborations:  Season 6 initiatives will strengthen existing partnerships and forge new collaborations. The number of museums working with Cyberchase is anticipated to grow to over 30.  Work with Girls Inc will include training and recruitment at three Girls Inc regional conferences.  Other outreach partners include EWeek, National Association for Girls and Women in Sports, National Association for Sport and Physical Education, the New York Mets and other sports organizations. \r\n\r\nMultimedia Research will conduct formative evaluation of the 3D Builder's Math game using an operational prototype working with a sample of students, establishing the ability to use the Cyberchase web site for assessment.  \r\n",
