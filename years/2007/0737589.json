 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eastern Michigan University (EMU), the City of Detroit Homeland Security and Emergency Management (CDHSEM), and Detroit Public Schools (DPS) are proposing the three-year Mayor's Youth Technology Corps (MYTC) Project in Detroit, MI. \r\n\r\nThe MYTC project offers a collaboration of resources, support, and opportunities for strengthening science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education efforts. The MYTC project will recruit 100 students from all high schools in Metropolitan Detroit.  They will receive about 250 hours training and hands-on experience in IT and geographic information system and technology (GIS/T) during a two-year period. They will also participate in a summer internship in a Detroit city department or contractor to work on a real-world project, through which they practice their skills. They will be supervised by distinguished GIS/T and IT researchers, technologists, and educators.  Moreover, 130 hours advanced training in Computer Forensics will be provided as an option for those students who want to gain in-depth knowledge and skill. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide informal STEM learning opportunities, and linkages to college experiences. Moreover, the collaboration involves university technology researchers, informal education agencies, after-school programs and parental connections, security-concerned agencies and industries, and public schools. The project is designed to provide academic foundations and cutting-edge technical skills for professional GIS/T and IT careers in law enforcement, fire fighting, emergency management, and homeland security. Upon completion of the program, the students will receive a Completion Certificate jointly issued by the Environmental System Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI), the world's leading GIS/T software designer and developer, and Eastern Michigan University. This certificate, which is recognized and respected by the GIS/T industry, will help students in seeking employment. \r\n\r\nIn addition to significantly strengthening STEM aptitudes, students will learn real-life skills in application development, communication, problem-solving and critical thinking, leadership and teamwork, ethics, and responsibility. EMU has begun discussions with the Detroit Public Schools about dual enrollment (EMU-DPS) for three IT-CSTM training modules. Upon completing these trainings, students will have an option to receive nine (9) hours of college credit toward advancing their higher education at the College of Technology, Eastern Michigan University. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
