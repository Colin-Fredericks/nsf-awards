It leads to new\r\nresults on the structure and representations of groupoid algebras associated\r\nto singular spaces and non-compact manifolds. It leads also\r\nto a new characterization of the Fredholm operators on non-compact\r\nand singular spaces based on representations of groupoid C_-algebras.\r\nUsing also methods from Noncommutative Geometry (cyclic homology,\r\nChern character, smooth subalgebras) the indices and relative indices\r\nof operators on singular and non-compact spaces will be computed.\r\nThese index theorems are non-local, so they will lead to spectral invariants,\r\ngeneralizing the eta-invariant, that will be investigated. The\r\nhomology, K-theory, and other invariants of the relevant operator algebras\r\nwill also be determined. The spectrum and the structure of the\r\ndistribution kernels of operators on singular spaces will be investigated.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will have applications to numerical\r\nmethods for polyhedral domains, which are important in Engineering\r\n(an example is the method of layer potentials), and to the analysis on\r\nnon-compact manifolds with nice ends, which arise in String Theory\r\nand General Relativity. This proposal will contribute to the development\r\nof the general techniques necessary to approach mathematical\r\nand computational problems from Biology, Chemistry, Engineering,\r\nand Physics. It will also contribute to applying mathematical results\r\nin practice by interactions with researchers from other fields, by organizing\r\nconferences, and by advising students, which will lead to the\r\ncreation of specialists able to use theoretical tools to handle practical\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n",
