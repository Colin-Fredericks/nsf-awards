 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large and sparse matrix computational problems are often solved by certain\r\nsubspace projection methods -- most commonly Krylov subspace type projections.\r\nThe basic idea is to project the original problems (matrices) of high dimensions\r\nonto certain subspaces to arrive at smaller and manageable ones, and the smaller\r\nreduced problems can then be solved by one of the dense matrix algorithms such as\r\nthose in LAPACK. Existing projection techniques often do not preserve structural\r\nproperties enjoyed by eigenproblems from various engineering applications, and\r\ntherefore the reduced problems do not necessarily reflect their practical\r\nbackgrounds in any meaningful ways. It is conceivable, as it is often the case,\r\nthat approximating a problem by one of its own kind would do better. Indeed there\r\nare cases where structural preserving methods are far superior to those that are\r\nblind to the inherent structures. The objective of this proposal is to exploit\r\nin depth structural properties of matrices from the standpoint of their application\r\nbackgrounds and to develop accurate and efficient structural preserving numerical\r\nmethods for eigenvalue and related problems of practical significance. A number of\r\ninteresting ideas will be pursued here, including a general framework for carrying\r\nout structural preserving subspace projections, an unifying convergence analysis\r\nfor all Krylov subspace type projections that connects moment matching properties\r\nin reduced order modeling and eigenvalue and eigenvector convergence theory, and a\r\nsub-orthogonalization process that will serve as the basis to devise efficient\r\nprojections.\r\n\r\nEigenproblems appear ubiquitously all across applied science and engineering,\r\nand their solutions are routinely sought and are critical in one way or another\r\nto various scientific computational tasks. Examples includes computational\r\nproblems from structural dynamics, control systems, circuit simulations,\r\ncomputational electromagnetics and microelectromechanical systems, data mining,\r\nand web search engine design, etc. This investigation shall advance significantly\r\nthe underlying engineering applications by making the involved matrix computations\r\nmuch less expensive, more accurate, and most importantly result in scientific\r\nsimulations that reflect better the underlying physics. Graduate students with\r\nemerging expertise in numerical eigenvalue computations will be involved.",
