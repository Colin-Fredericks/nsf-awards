 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this conference is to bring together a group of outstanding mathematicians\r\nloosely connected to combinatorics, understood in the widest sense. The meeting will give\r\na chance to mathematicians from the Mid-South to benefit not only from the lectures but\r\nalso from personal contacts with the speakers.\r\nThe main speaker at the conference is one of the most distinguished mathematicians today,\r\nPeter Lax of the Courant Institute in New York, the recipient of the National Medal of\r\nScience in 1986, the Wolf Prize in 1987, and the Abel Prize in 2005. Very accurately,\r\nhe has been described as the most versatile mathematician today. He started in pure\r\nmathematics, but his greatest contributions have been to to the theory and application\r\nof partial differential equations and to the computation of their solutions. In particular,\r\nhe constructed explicit solutions of nonlinear hyperbolic systems and identified classes of\r\nespecially well-behaved systems. Lax is also a wonderful expositor, the author of several\r\nsuccessful books, and a very approachable man.\r\nThere will be several other exciting speakers at the meeting; they have been chosen because\r\nthey are not only excellent mathematicians, but also wonderful expositors and very approachable\r\npeople. They include Vitaly Bergelson of Ohio State University, who has made\r\nmajor contributions to ergodic theory, especially to recurrence theory stemming from the\r\nwork of Furstenberg inspired by Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic progressions; Yuval\r\nPeres from Microsoft Research and UC Berkeley, one of the most notable people working\r\non combinatorial aspects of probability theory; Sasha Kostochka from the University of\r\nIllinois at Urbana-Champaign, a very powerful mathematician who is carrying the torch\r\nfor extremal combinatorics; Ralph Faudree from the University of Memphis, one of the\r\nmost frequent collaborators of Paul Erdos, an expert on Ramsey-type problems; Stephanie\r\nGerke of ETH in Zurich, who has done beautiful work on the interface of pure mathematics\r\nand computer science; Tom Trotter of Georgia Tech, one of the founders of the modern\r\ntheory of partially ordered sets; Boris Pittel from Ohio State University, one of the best\r\npeople working on probabilistic combinatorics; and Mark Walters from the University of\r\nCambridge, England, who has proved much about random bootstrap percolation and random\r\ngeometric graphs. Andr'as Gy'arf'as from Budapest will give a special 'public' lecture\r\naimed at a very wide audience, including some of the best high school students from the\r\narea.\r\nUnlike the East Coast or the Bay Area on the West Coast, the Mid-South cannot boast of\r\nmany high-level mathematical conferences; the Contemporary Combinatorics 2007 meeting\r\nin Memphis goes some way towards redressing the balance. The formula whereby personal\r\ncontacts between the lecturers and the other participants is greatly encouraged was found\r\nto be very successful a year ago, and this what we hope to do at the 2007 meeting as\r\nwell. There is no doubt that listening to lectures by Peter Lax, Vitaly Bergelson, Yuval\r\nPeres, and others, and, especially, talking to them during the conference will be very\r\ninspiring for young and established mathematicians alike. The NSF grant is absolutely\r\nvital for the success of the meeting; most of it will be used to help graduate students and\r\nsenior mathematicians come to Memphis so that they can benefit from the lectures and\r\nthe personal contact with the speakers.",
