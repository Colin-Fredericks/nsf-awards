 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our objective is to understand the conductivity switching processes in polymers, and to apply this phenomenon to the demonstration of reliable, and very high density write once read many times (WORM) memory devices in a hybrid organic/inorganic semiconductor architecture.   Recently, and in collaboration with our industrial partners, we have shown that the electrochromic polymer, PEDOT, undergoes an irreversible reduction in conductivity when a large current is passed through it.  When placed in series with a nonlinear electrical element (e.g. a Si p-n junction diode), the PEDOT behaves as a fuse in an active matrix array of cross-points, forming a WORM memory; a key component in any electronic technology.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit and Broader Impacts: This work will explore both the conductivity mechanisms in electrochromic polymers such as PEDOT, and the nature of organic/inorganic heterojunctions - both fundamental questions explore the nature of organic semiconductor materials. This work can lead to a range of electronic devices employing widely disparate hybrid semiconductor materials systems (i.e. organics with inorganic semiconductors) which can impact the functionalities of both materials systems.  The project will engage a diverse pool of students.  Coupled to courses already being taught at Princeton by Prof. Forrest in the field of organic thin film devices and materials, and by Prof. Register in polymer chemistry and physics, the team will provide an opportunity for learning in the rapidly expanding field of organic electronics.  Our collaboration with our industrial partner, Universal Display Corp., further ensures a rich experience for training students, while providing an immediate technology transfer pathway leading to rapid commercialization.  \r\n",
