 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: CMMI-: CMMI-0644047\r\n\r\nAsphalt pavements are susceptible to moisture induced-damage, which is caused by moisture interaction with asphalt-aggregate bonds. Although moisture-induced damage in asphalt concrete has been studied for over 70 years, two very fundamental questions remain unanswered: Can the conditions that cause moisture-induced damage be accurately predicted? How can moisture-induced damage be mitigated? The foremost difficulty lies in the fact that the moisture interaction with asphalt-aggregate bonds is a phenomenon that occurs at the atomic or nano-scale level. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) research and education proposal offers a novel approach to understanding and quantifying moisture interactions with asphalt-aggregate bonds at the nano-scale level, and relating these interactions to the moisture-induced damage at the \r\nMacro-scale level. The research objectives are to: capture microscopic images of the \r\nadhesive and cohesive forces in the asphalt-aggregate system under dry and wet conditions using an atomic force microscope (AFM), determine the microscopic work of adhesion from the AFM data; construct mathematical models and neural networks to determine the bond damage index from the microscopic work of adhesion; and conduct macro-scale testing and develop models to relate the bond damage index to the macro-scale moisture-induced damage in asphalt concrete. The broader impact of this study is that it may result in significant saving of financial and other resources that are currently used to combat pavement distresses originating from moisture-induced damages. The research activities proposed herein will be conducted through the research participation of graduate and undergraduate students. A summer educational event will be established that will focus on the participation of high school students. An advisory board consisting of individuals from academia, industries, government agencies and research institutions will be formed to ensure success of the proposed research, educational and outreach objectives.\r\n",

A neural network (NN) model was constructed to quantify adhesion using the data from AFM testing for use in higher scale finite element modeling (FEM). It is shown that adhesion force in wet sample is higher than that in dry sample. As adhesion force represents bond strength, this indicates that bond damage or weakening occurs in asphalt film due to water action. The research confirms the damage of moisture on asphalt binder even with the presence of antistripping agents, though lime showed better performances than other antistripping agents. Adhesion force or bond strength of asphalt sample does not depend on the binder performance grade but adhesion varies with polymer content.

One of the main outcomes of this project is that it has developed a methodology to measure bond energies in terms of adhesion force between asphalt functional groups such as Si3N4, -CH3, -OH, and -COOH. A quantification of bond strength is made using NN programing. The NN model is tested and found to have good predictive capability.
