 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests participant support for an International 3-day Workshop at LBL Berkeley, CA planned for September 20-22, 2007 with the title \"Search for Baryon and Lepton Number Violations\".\r\n\r\nBaryon and Lepton number violation has become an integral part of the current discussions of physics beyond the Standard Model, specifically in connection with understanding the nature of neutrinos, the origin of matter in the Universe, as well as possible Grand Unification of matter and forces. The goal of the Workshop is to have a comprehensive discussion of the Baryon (B) and Lepton (L) violating processes and particularly of (BL) violation as a probe of unification, baryo- and lepto-genesis, Left-Right symmetry restoration, matter-antimatter asymmetry, sterile matter, mirror matter, dark matter etc. These are related to the possible new experimental observations in particle physics: Majorana neutrinos (20), proton decays, neutron-antineutron oscillations, rare  (BaBar and Belle data) and hyperon (FNAL hyperon data) decays, -e transitions, relic neutrinos, mirror and sterile matter transitions, and possible new phenomena that can be revealed at LHC and ILC. Some of these new experimental opportunities might become available at the new DUSEL laboratory that is in the process of creation by NSF. New generation of the nucleon decay, neutron oscillations, and neutrinoless double beta decay high-sensitivity experiments, proposed in the framework of DUSEL, might help to throw light on the direction of new physics beyond the Standard Model and supplement the knowledge gained from imminent collider experiments.\r\n\r\nFor the Broader Impacts, the Workshop will address the multidisciplinary fields of particle and cosmology theory, particle astrophysics, underground experimental physics related to DUSEL, nuclear theory, and new physics with accelerator and collider data at the energy frontier. The Workshop will help to integrate the ideas of the present and future searches for physics beyond the Standard Model and will reveal new directions for experimental and theoretical developments in particle physics. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
