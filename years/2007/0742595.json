The National Society of Hispanic Physicists (NSHP) plans to organize Materials Research related symposia at the 2007 and 2008 SACNAS meetings to be held at Kansas City, MO and Salt Lake City, UT, respectively. The aim of these symposia is to introduce undergraduate and graduate students attending the SACNAS conference to technologically important research topics and professional opportunities in the field.  These symposia encourage underrepresented minority students to pursue advanced degrees and careers in engineering and the physical sciences, thereby contributing to the diversity our nation's science and engineering workforce.  This award from the Division of Materials Research would support the attendance of 10 graduate and undergraduate students, 4 invited speakers and one session chair and a travel grant for one student poster winner to present his/her research at a professional meeting during 2007 and 2008.",
