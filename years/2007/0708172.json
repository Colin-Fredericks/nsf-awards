In the United States alone, there are approximately 14 million cases per year and is likely to increase further as the average lifespan increases. Although the causes of these disorders are multiple and complex, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered to play a central role.  Rare earth metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have shown promise as a therapeutic agent to scavenge these ROS responsible for retinal degeneration. However the current understanding of the biological interaction of these NPs with cells and tissue is limited and the correlation of this with thematerial chemistry, size and surface properties is necessary to ensure safe clinical usage. The proposed collaborative research between University of Central Florida (UCF) and University of Oklahoma (OU) will address the basic scientific aspects involved in engineering active NPs for SOD mimetics and therapeutic applications and evaluate its effectiveness as novel antioxidants in preventing the death of photoreceptor cells in a living animal model. The results should lead to therapies which will prolong the functional life of neurons and tissues in multiple diseases which currently afflict many people.\r\n\r\n",
