 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop analytical methods (1) to estimate wind farm capacity credits (or capacity values) for all levels of wind power penetration, and (2) to increase with farm capacity credits using an appropriately sized of an energy storage system.  The sizing and scheduling of the energy storage operation take into account wind farm characteristics, local wind resource condition, and voltage stability behavior of the power system.  The approach for wind farm capacity credit estimation is based on the multi-state representation of a wind farm and the effective-load carrying capability technique.  The approach for sizing and scheduling the storage system is based on the statistical analysis of wind farm characteristics and capacity credit while considering the power system load demand and voltage stability behavior.  The voltage stability consideration will be based on V-Q curve, V-Q sensitivity, and V-Q modal analyses. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\n\r\nThe project will produce a series of analytical tools to estimate wind farm capacity credits and to size and schedule energy storage system charging and discharging operation.  These tools can be used by system planners and operators to regulate intermittent and variable wind power, and increase the wind farm capacity credits thereby firming wind power.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  \r\n\r\nThe project will ultimately help increase the penetration level of wind power and help lessen the dependency on fossil fuels and impacts on the environment.  The project also includes participation of underrepresented students from a non-PhD granting institution and infuses research activities into its energy system program.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
