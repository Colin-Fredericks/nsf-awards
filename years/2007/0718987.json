 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nDarwin proposed the theory of sexual selection to explain the extravagant traits that many animals use to obtain a mate. Sexual selection favors any trait that provides a competitive advantage in acquiring mates, even if it reduces the chance of survival, thus explaining these often bizarre courtship traits and rituals. But why should closely related species exhibit such a diversity of courtship traits? The diversification of courtship traits remains a central question in evolutionary biology. The proposed research uses modern genetic methods to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among species of darters, North American freshwater fish that exhibit striking nuptial coloration. Combined with detailed spectral analysis of these colors, this research establishes the necessary groundwork for explaining the diversification of coloration in this remarkable group of American fish.\r\n \r\nA central objective of this research is to increase participation of underrepresented groups in the biological sciences. UMBC is renowned for its recruitment, retention, and ultimate success of minority students in the STEM fields. By providing financial support, a close mentoring relationship, and a range of research experience in the biological sciences, the proposed project will provide critical opportunities for minority students who will constitute, in larger part, the next generation of professional biologists.\r\n",
