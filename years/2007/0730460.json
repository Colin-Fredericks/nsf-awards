 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research proposal focuses on developing a miniaturized analytical system, aiming to achieve rapid detection of ultratrace explosives with minimal false alarm rates. In this system, the explosive-absorbed or explosive particles will be collected and processed utilizing droplet-based microfluidic technologies. The explosive targets will then detected using two different immuno-sensors that are developed based on Au and quantum dot nanoparticles respectively.  Validation of the proposed system will be carried out using detection of trinitrotoluene (TNT) as a model assay. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit \r\n\r\nThe proposed system includes an unprecedented level of high sensitivity, minimal false alarm rates, and near real-time response. This system is automatic and re-usable, allowing continuous sensing with a low level of maintenance. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe project has high impact on homeland security and education. The detection system can be deployed as a standoff detection platform with a relatively low cost for monitoring of trace explosives in airports, security buildings and other infrastructures. The miniaturized system can be implemented as a portable system for tracing mobile explosive sources. Besides, high school and undergraduate students will be invited to participate in proposed research and a cross-disciplinary seminar in micro/nanotechnology will be created.  \r\n",
