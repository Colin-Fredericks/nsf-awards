 "awd_abstract_narration": "Staphylococcus aureus, a pathogen and common skin colonizing bacteria, is known to be responsible for significant infections in humans. Although S. aureus can be found as a comensual organism on human skin, it can cause a significant infection with only a small break on the skin?s surface. As shown in preliminary studies, the presence S. aureus populations in costal waters serves as a potential indicator of microbial contamination and indicates an increased risk of infection by these organisms to recreational bathers. \r\n\r\nIn this project, scientists from the University of Miami will conductin a study to establish the presence and prevalence of pathogenic S. aureus in the recreational marine waters along the coast of South Florida. Through a combination of standard genetic methods, including spa typing in combination with SCCmec typing, and the determination of the presence of selected toxin genes, the principle investigator aims to establish a link between the presence of S. aureus and infections reported from the recreational users of these waters. Determining the presence and genetic background of these pathogenic isolates will provide insight to the exposures and health risks for the local bathers and may support new recommendations regarding coastal water quality monitoring and hygiene practices at crowded beaches.\r\n",
