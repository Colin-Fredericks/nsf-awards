 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the development of a new process to deposit stress-free ta-C films to be used in microelectromechanical (MEMS) systems devices. Ta-C (tetragonal amorphous carbon) is of class of amorphous carbon materials consisting a network of carbon atoms connected primarily with sp3 bonds (sp3 content can be as high as 85%). Mechanical and tribological properties of Ta-C are greatly superior to those of silicon and silicon carbide. Ta-C can only be produced by processes involving energetic deposition, i.e. processes in which the precursors are C ions or species with hyper-thermal energies. The level of stresses in ta-C films resulting from growth make this materials unsuitable for use in MEMS devices, particularly when free standing membranes are needed. The process to be developed under this SBIR Project will produce large area stress-free ta-C films. The process developed here is fully compatible with other unit processes used in MEMS processing. \r\n\r\nIf successful the outcome of this project will have a significant impact on MEMS technology for harsh environment as well as numerous other applications. The success of this project will enable follow-on enabling technologies.\r\n",
