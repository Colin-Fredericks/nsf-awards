 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert Martin Chin of the University of Northern Iowa is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program to develop dinuclear transition metal complexes that will functionalize both ends of saturated hydrocarbons. This RUI project utilizes rhodium and iridium metals and pinacolborane and dipinacolborane as alkane functionalizing reagents.  The research strategy is based on synthesizing rigid doubly linked cyclopentadienyl ligands to position two metals for activating both ends of alkanes.  Metal, linker geometry, and alkane identity are being varied to test the hypothesis that double functionalization of alkanes can be realized. Theoretical input for guidelines to consider in constructing dinuclear metal reagents are provided by collaborative studies with Professor Michael Hall and his students at Texas A & M University.\r\n\r\nDouble functionalization of alkanes is an important new approach to monomer preparation, and the strategy here offers attractive opportunities for converting alkanes to monomers along the route to polymer products. A range of participants are engaged in this research program with lots of undergraduates involved and an outreach component for high school teachers. The broader impacts of this research project include both building the scientific knowledge base and expanding the range of STEM participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
