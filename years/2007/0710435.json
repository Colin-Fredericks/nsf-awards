 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis study will quantify the role of terrestrial Mollusca (snails and slugs) in the decomposition of litter and cycling of nutrients in Hawaiian rainforests.  The Mollusca are the second most diverse group of animals in terms of described species, after the arthropods. Terrestrial and freshwater mollusk faunas world-wide are under extreme threat, and have the dubious honor of having the highest number of documented extinctions of any major taxonomic group.  In addition, many non-indigenous mollusks are becoming established in areas outside their native range. This study offers splendid opportunities to address the ecological importance of terrestrial snails and slugs and how changes in species composition of a fauna, with rare endemics being replaced by widespread invasives, may be impacting the ecosystem services they provide. This study will apply experimental approaches to address two major questions: 1) What role do the most abundant land snail species (native and introduced) that occur in the rain forest play in litter decomposition and nutrient cycling?  2) How is population density related to the functional role of the remaining native snail species?\r\n\tThis study will be an important contribution to our understanding of the functioning of native Hawaiian ecosystems. It will also be of value to natural resource managers working in their preservation, including development of appropriate strategies for conservation of the few extant native snail species. The project involves a highly integrated and synergistic collaboration between UH Manoa and UH Hilo, and will support directly the research of a doctoral student.\r\n",
