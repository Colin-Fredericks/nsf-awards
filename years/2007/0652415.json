 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear structure research at the University of Kentucky is focussed on timely, related topics in nuclear spectroscopy, neutron-induced and neutron-emitting reactions, and neutron scattering.  The experimental program is designed to take advantage of the neutron production capabilities at the University's accelerator facility and the unique detection capabilities that have been developed in this laboratory.  Nuclear structure studies are primarily oriented toward exploring multiphonon vibrational excitations in nearly spherical nuclei, examining new types of nuclear excitations, defining the roles of protons and neutrons in collective modes, and understanding nuclear shell structure and the nature of nuclear shape transitions.  Nuclear level lifetime measurements with the Doppler-shift attenuation method and gamma-gamma coincidence measurements, for which the methodologies have been developed in our laboratory, will play crucial roles in many of these studies. Carefully selected experiments in other areas which are particularly appropriate to the capabilities and facilities at the accelerator laboratory will be pursued.  \r\nEducation at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels continues to be an integral part of all activities in our laboratory.  Providing a supportive professional experience for students is an ongoing, vital component of our program, and graduates emerge as well-prepared nuclear scientists.  For many years, the research facilities of our laboratory have been made available to students and faculty from non-doctoral-granting institutions, as well as to scientists from other research universities and national laboratories, and research collaborations are encouraged.  These colleagues frequently take advantage of our unique facilities to obtain information that may be crucial for the design of experiments at larger laboratories or in other areas of physics.  Research performed in our laboratory is directly applicable to problems of national interest and homeland security.  These applications are well represented by the activities of government and industrial partners who utilize our accelerator and research equipment.  \r\n\r\n",
