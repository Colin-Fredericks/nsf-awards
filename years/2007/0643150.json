 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER proposal is focused on the relations between various gauge theories and\r\nstring theory, i.e. gauge/string duality. The PI will use insights coming from and inspired\r\nby string theory to address long-standing problems in gauge theories with the eventual goal\r\nto solve QCD.\r\nThe project is devoted to exploring the rich structures of Yang-Mills perturbation theory,\r\nintegrable structures found in the AdS/CFT context, and relations between them. The\r\nfirst part of the proposal involves the study of nonperturbative Yang-Mills and AdS5 string\r\ntheory with the aim to make theoretical predictions for the experimentaly observed spectrum\r\nof strongly interacting particles. The second part of the proposal is concerned with the\r\napplication of methods inspired by twistor string theory to the calculation of perturbative\r\nQCD scattering amplitudes. Improvement in this area of QCD is especially urgent since\r\nQCD processes will be the dominant physics at the Large Hadron Collider experiment which\r\nis coming online in the near future.\r\nThe research will be integrated into outreach activities at Brown University, including\r\nparticipation in the Women in Science and Engineering Program and delivery of public\r\nlectures at local schools and science museums. The educational activities will consist of\r\ndeveloping new classes and establishing group meetings with graduate and undergraduate\r\nstudents.",
