 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ponte Castaneda\r\n0708271\r\n\r\n     Magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) are multi-phase,\r\nmulti-functional material systems consisting of magnetically\r\n\"hard\" or \"soft\" particles embedded in an elastomeric matrix\r\nphase.  Because of the magnetic interactions between the\r\nparticles, these materials are magnetostrictive and their\r\nmechanical response can be modified smoothly and reversibly in\r\nreal time.  Conversely, the presence of strain in these materials\r\ncan be detected by induced changes in the overall magnetization. \r\nAlthough \"macroscopic\" (continuum mechanics) approaches for MREs\r\nhave been in existence since the 1950s, more \"microscopic\"\r\ntheories with truly predictive capabilities are much more recent\r\nand so far have been restricted to the linear (infinitesimal\r\nstrain) regime.  The investigator develops nonlinear\r\nhomogenization techniques and applies them to generate\r\nconstitutive models for magnetorheological elastomers that are\r\nvalid in the finite-strain regime.  This builds on earlier work by\r\nthe investigator for reinforced elastomers and uses extensions of\r\nvariational \"linear comparison\" homogenization techniques that\r\nhave been developed previously.  At the theoretical level, the\r\nmodels account for: (i) the strongly nonlinear response of the\r\nconstituents, including nonlinear ferrolectric behavior for the\r\nparticles, as well as nonlinear mechanical response for the\r\nelastomeric matrix, (ii) microstructural information, such as\r\nparticle shape and orientation, as well as their spatial and\r\norientational distribution, (iii) coupled magnetoelastic\r\nconstitutive behavior, and (iv) finite deformations.  At the\r\napplications level, the methodology is used to optimally select\r\nthe constituent properties (e.g., magnetically hard vs. soft\r\nparticles, magnetically isotropic vs. anisotropic particles) and\r\nthe microstructural variables (e.g., particle shape and\r\nconcentration, aligned distribution of orientations vs. random\r\norientations, etc.) to enhance the magnetostrictive and sensing\r\ncapabilities of these materials. \r\n\r\n     Magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) are composite materials\r\nwith \"smart\" or \"intelligent\" properties.  As a consequence of\r\nthese special properties, MREs hold great promise for use as\r\nsensors and actuators in many industrial applications, including\r\nthe automotive, electronics, and robotic industries.  In addition,\r\nthey are lightweight, inexpensive and easily processed into a\r\nmyriad of shapes.  However, in order to achieve their full\r\npotential, a better mathematical understanding is necessary of\r\ntheir complex -- highly coupled and nonlinear -- macroscopic\r\nbehavior, especially in the large-deformation regime.  To aid in\r\nthis process, the investigator develops a homogenization-based\r\napproach to accurately model the macroscopic behavior of MREs,\r\nincorporating the dependence on the magnetic properties of the\r\nparticles, their initial distribution and orientation\r\n(microstructure), as well as the evolution of this microstructure\r\nunder large deformation.  Finally, because of their actuation\r\nproperties MREs provide an artificial analogue of human muscle,\r\nand the project has implications for other types of smart\r\nmaterials, including electroactive polymers (EAPs), which could\r\nfind applications in biotechnology and other areas of Federal\r\nstrategic interest.",
