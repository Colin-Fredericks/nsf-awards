 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide travel funds for graduate students and post-doctoral scholars to attend a worrkshop on Infectious Disease and subsequent the Annual Conference on the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases. The workshop and conference will be held at Cornell University on 29 May to 1 June 2007. The purpose of the workshop is to provide hands-on training in modeling disease systems, especially as they pertain to long-term data sets. The field of ecology and evolution of infectious disease is rapidly expanding. However, there is an acute shortage of people trained in disease modeling or biologists who are sufficiently quantitative to work with mathematicians. The workshop will address this shortage. The training of graduate students and post-docs is especially important as they represent the new wave of researchers in this area. The conference is the fifth focusing on these topics and is becoming the primary annual meeting for this topic. The understanding of the ecology of infectious disease has important implications for human health and the economics of agriculture.",
