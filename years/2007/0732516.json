The mission of the center is to solve integrated design and analysis problems in logistics and distribution via simulation and mathematical modeling, analysis, and the development and application of powerful, intelligent, real-time algorithms. By integrating resources at the multiple campuses, CELDi has promoted a fundamental paradigm shift from the traditional compartmentalized logistics and distribution research approach to an examination of the problem as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe I/UCRC expects to grow in regard to partner universities and member companies during this second phase of funding. Several member organizations are actively involved with the partner universities to provide real-life logistics and distribution problems to graduate and undergraduate classes. The center's research holds the promise of creating new practice based education models that can be used to augment this undergraduate and graduate instruction.",

This is a Phase II award (second 5-year cycle) made to Oklahoma State University to support the site\u00c6s activities as part of the existing multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi). The mission of CELDi is to solve integrated design and analysis problems in logistics and distribution via simulation and mathematical modeling, analysis, and the development and application of powerful, intelligent, real-time algorithms. In the following we briefly summarize the outcomes of representative projects supported by the site\u00c6s member companies and organizations as well center designated projects.\n\nI.   Freight Movement Model for Oklahoma\n\nIntellectual Merit: A multi-phase methodology to model and predict the freight flow volumes into, out of, through and within the state of Oklahoma was developed. This overall approach employed tools from statistics, optimization and visualization.\n\nBroader Impact: The overall methodology can be extended to other states, as well as to a global multi-modal transportation framework. The results of this project can help regional and national transportation infrastructure planning, help prioritize resource allocation for maintenance projects and aid in emergency preparedness and planning.\n\nII.   Data Reduction By Generalized Graph Domination\n\nIntellectual Merit: A member company dealt with massive multi-attribute data, which prescribed settings for a collection of engineering design parameters related to oil-field services. This project developed a novel clustering approach capable of producing robust solutions to this problem that reduced the number of designs to be evaluated to less than 20% of the original amount.\n\nBroader Impact: The results of this project can also help with robust facility location applications, including robust location coverage problems faced by emergency and other first responders.\n\nIII.   A DSS for Transportation Infrastructure and Supply Chain Planning\n\nIntellectual Merit: A web-based decision support system was developed to support critical decisions related to transportation infrastructure planning in the public sector and supply chain system planning in the private sector. The methodology integrates the key results of the aforementioned freight movement project with the design of the logistical infrastructure. A scenario-based optimization approach was also developed to design a biomass supply chain.\n\nBroader Impact: The DSS developed will make the results of the aforementioned FMM project more accessible to practitioners and transportation research professionals and hence enhance the impact on transportation, logistics and sustainability.\n\nIV.   Evaluation of RFID and Competing Technologies for Asset Tracking\n\nIntellectual Merit: This project developed a methodology to compare Automated Identification Technologies (including RFID) for individual and combined use in large-scale depot operations at a defense agency. The approach was implemented in a spreadsheet tool that facilitates economic analysis of alternatives adapted to specific operations and strategies at the member organization.\n\nBroader Impact: This overall approach can result in significant cost savings, not only at the member organization, but also at comparable defense agencies or other entities with similar logistical operations.\n\nV.   Advanced MRO Multi-Echelon Planning and Scheduling\n\nIntellectual Merit: This project developed effective meta-heuristic algorithms for job-shop scheduling problems at a defense logistics center that operates in a highly resource-constrained maintenance, repair and overhaul environment.\n\nBroader Impact: This overall approach can improve the efficiency of operations, not only at the member organization, but also at other aircraft fleet maintenance facilities.\n\nVI.
