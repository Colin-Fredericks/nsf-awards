 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project continues to address development of a novel packaging method for wafer-scale hermetic packaging of intelligent Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). Packaging of MEMS along with their requisite electronics is one of the main technical barriers to commercialization of these devices. Packaging methods are often expensive, have long development cycles, and may adversely affect device performance and reliability. In cases where direct media access is required and the MEMS device needs to operate in harsh environments, protecting the electronics from the media provides a huge challenge. The proposed packaging approach consists of extending the MEMS device and etching a deep cavity into the substrate to house the electronics. A wafer-level hermetic bonding method will then be used to cap the electronics while allowing electrical connection between the electronics and the device. This Phase II project will focus on development of hermetic lead transfer using buried metal layers, and expansion of the packaging method to include wireless applications. Wired and wireless pressure sensor/electronics testbeds will be fabricated to verify overall system integration and evaluated both internally and by external customers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe potential commercial value of this Small Business Innovation Research proposal will be in several areas. The most immediate area will be revenue from sale of foundry services for packaging and integration of MEMS and their associated electronics. Through its existing Foundry Services Division, ISSYS will provide a packaging platform for wired and wireless MEMS sensor/electronics subassemblies. The second source of revenue is product sales, where off-the-shelf MEMS pressure sensor subassemblies (wired and wireless) will be sold to customers in various medical and industrial fields. The long-term vision is use of this packaging platform for a variety of MEMS-based devices. According to Yole Development, the worldwide MEMS market is forecast to grow from $5.1 Billion in 2005 to $9.7 Billion in 2010. The main product families in this market are inkjet heads, pressure sensors, microphones, accelerometers, gyroscopes, optical MEMS, microfluidics, RF MEMS and micro-fuel cells. The proposed packaging technology will be highly beneficial to pressure sensors, microphones and microfluidic devices, with a combined market forecast of $2.5 Billion in 2010.",
