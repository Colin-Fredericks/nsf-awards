 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to develop a miniaturized system for detecting explosives based on odorant sensing using mammalian olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).  This will be achieved by fabricating an integrated microsystem on which OSNs are cultured and monitored.  By detecting the electrical signals produced by OSNs, it would be possible to achieve high-sensitivity, high-specificity, high-speed, stand-off detection of trace amounts of compounds present in explosives.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe research is expected to add biological components to traditional sensor microsystems, which will be transformative for many applications.  This research will identify and develop means for solving the technical challenges facing the realization of cell-based sensors.  In addition, it will provide a scientific tool to answer a number of outstanding questions about mammalian olfaction.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nOne of the broader impacts is that cell-based chemical sensors would have diverse applications, outside of IED detection: monitoring food and air, odor-based medical diagnosis, drug detection in airports, and screening of pharmaceuticals.  Other broader impacts will be the education of students in this area through new courses, and raising awareness about the cutting edge in the nano-micro-info-bio fields through workshops for middle-school teachers in a range of disciplines, including science, history, and art.\r\n",
