 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lou Abstract \r\nNEMS Fluid Sensors Based on Suspended Nanotubes and Nanowires-\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to explore the behaviors of Nanoelectro-mechanical system (NEMS) based sensors employing suspended single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) or metallic nanowires (MNW) in liquids. The approach is outlined as following: 1) Fabrication of NEMS sensors based on single suspended SWNT/MNW;  2) Systematic characterization of the important mechano-electrical behaviors (both resonant and non-resonant transient behaviors) of SWNT/MNW at a single-device level and 3) investigation of their dependence on various environments (in particular liquids). 4) Exploration of potential device applications, such as liquid characterization and molecules sensing. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The research proposed here represents a vital step toward fundamental physical understanding of SWNT/MNW behaviors in liquid environments, which has been largely unexplored but is of great scientific and technological interests. More importantly, the potential integration of nanomechanical suspensions/resonators and micro/nano fluidics (two previously largely disjoint fields) creates exciting opportunities to explore new phenomena and to breed new applications in fresh directions. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The versatile and robust NEMS fluid sensors proposed have great potentials to become a disruptive innovation with many critical applications in medicine, energy, environment and national security. In addition to research program, graduate and under-represented undergraduate students will be actively recruited to work on this cutting-edge research. Founded by the PI, the newly established Paslay Nanoscale Science and Engineering Educational Lab at Rice University will serve as a platform for outreach activities involving high school students and science teachers from the Houston Independent School District, and to also communicate findings from this research to the general public. \r\n",
