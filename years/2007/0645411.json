 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Johns Hopkins University is to explore new collagen modification technique and develop spatially functionalized collagen scaffolds for controlled microvasculature formation and artificial cornea fabrication. The modification technique is based on collagen's native ability to associate into triple-helical molecular architecture similar to DNA strand invasion and exchange. Using synthetic collagen mimetic peptide (CMP) as a collagen-specific \"hitch-hiker,\" Dr. Michael Yu will synthesize 3D collagen-based tissue scaffolds with exogenous bioactive components (growth factors, cell adhesion peptides, and antimicrobial peptides) in defined locations within the scaffolds and investigate their effectiveness for controlled tissue generation. Specific goals of the project are: a) design of collagen mimetic peptide analogues with enhanced collagen binding properties and perform fundamental study of CMP-collagen interactions; b) investigation in the use of CMPs in fabricating collagen surfaces and gels with controlled bioactivity; and c) testing the performance as tissue scaffolds for ordered microvasculature and functional artificial cornea. In addition to tissue engineering application, the modification technique may also lead to technological innovation in detection and treatment of diseases related to pathologic scar tissue and other abnormal extra cellular matrices.\r\n\r\nIn collaboration with National Federation of the Blind Jernigan Institute, based in Baltimore, the PI will develop a biomaterials laboratory session for blind high school students as part of the Blind Youth STEM Academy. Goals of this outreach program are:  a) expose blind youth to STEM through hands-on programs that powerfully demonstrate that they can play a major role in such fields; b) stimulate graduate students to pursue research projects, technology development and educational activities that address problems of full inclusion of persons with disabilities in STEM careers; and c) educate parents, teachers, and general public that STEM fields are open to blind youth. Within the Johns Hopkins community, the project will develop innovative materials biology curriculum to create new breed of material researchers who can work across traditional materials and biology disciplines. \r\n",
