Corliss\r\n\r\nThe proposal as submitted requested four Shipboard Scientific Support items for the R/V Cape Hatteras.  One of the four items is requested to improve the safety of the vessel for all users. One item was proposed to improve docking of the vessel and scientific moorings.  The second item was requested to improve communications from the vessel.  The third item was requested as back-up equipment for the work boat.  All requests had an element of safety in them.  Safety items benefit all users of the ship. The Hatteras will receive the requested major safety equipment through a group purchase being done by Harbor Branch Inst. of Ocean.  Duke University supports several educational and public outreach events during the year through use of ship operations, providing an open-house for the local community and student training outreach from K through 12.  Periodically the University holds open house on the ship and provides tours to students.  It should be noted the R/V Hatteras is not an inspected vessel since it is less than 300 tons and thus does not have to meet all the USCG and IMO regulations.  The Air Tugger Winches are commonly used to improve safety of personnel in mooring the vessel and deploying various coastal and deep sea moorings. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
