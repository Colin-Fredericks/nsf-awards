 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the development of a new class of materials, namely polymeric nanomaterials with a very high refractive index, which will closely match the refractive index of inorganic semiconductors. The encapsulant materials consist of titania-nanoparticle-loaded silicone and epoxy. Titania (TiO2) has a refractive index of 2.68 and the admixture of TiO2 with a polymer would result in an increase of the refractive index. The well-known problem of excessive optical scattering will be overcome by proper use of surfactants and an encapsulation structure that employs thin films, with a thickness that is less than the average distance between scattering events. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf successful the development of a new high-index encapsulant will have a tremendous impact on SSL technology because virtually all SSL devices made of inorganic semiconductors are packaged and encapsulated. A successful completion of the program will result in a worldwide paradigmatic shift in the packaging and encapsulation of optoelectronic devices. The broad deployment of efficient LED technology for general lighting applications would also result in electrical energy savings in the TWh range per year within the United States alone. \r\n",
