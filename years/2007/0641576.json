Klessig\r\nProposal No. IOS- 0641576\r\nTitle of the proposal: Genetic, molecular and biochemical basis of resistance to Turnip Crinkle \r\nVirus in Arabidopsis\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nPlant diseases have a devastating impact on agricultural production and food supply every year. Plant viruses are a major threat to the cultivation of many agricultural crops, causing serious economic losses worldwide. For many years, these pathogens have been controlled by conventional plant protection methods such as crop rotation, destruction of infected sources breeding for resistance, and chemical control of relevant insect vectors. This project will involve study of interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and Turnip Crinkle Virus (TCV), with an aim to elucidate mechanisms governing resistance of plants to viral infections. The overall goal of this research will be to dissect the molecular and biochemical basis of signaling required for hypersensitive response and resistance to TCV.  This will include determining the genetic basis of resistance to TCV by cloning and characterization of a putative suppressor of resistance to TCV. In addition, several TCV coat protein recognition defective mutants will be characterized further and molecular and biochemical basis of SA-mediated regulation of resistance gene expression will be studied. This work will provide novel and important insights into the complex defense signaling networks that facilitate communication between host and pathogen. By elucidating the mechanism(s) through which plants perceive and resist viral infection, successful strategies for engineering and/or manipulating disease resistance may be developed. Other broader impacts of this study include training of high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students. One important aim of this work will be to foster a community of undergraduate students, particularly those from traditionally underrepresented groups, by including them as members of the scientific team. In addition, attempts will be made to integrate research with the extension services available at the University of Kentucky to enhance awareness of the recent advances in crop resistance among farmers and agribusiness representatives.\r\n\r\n",
