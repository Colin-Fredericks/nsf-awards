 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eighth International Conference on Fundamentals of Fracture (ICFF VIII) will be held 3-7 January 2008 in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, and in Guangzhou, China. ICFF VIII will provide an international forum for presentation and discussion of the latest scientific and technological development in fundamentals of fracture. The general theme of ICFF VIII is to cover all aspects of fracture at a fundamental level, including contributions from those working in the disciplines of Continuum Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry, Bioscience, Metallurgy, Ceramics, Polymer Science, etc. The research areas are of vital interest to the United States. Participation of women and minority students will be particularly encouraged. \r\n\r\nAcademic and research institutions all over the world are studying various fundamentals issues of fracture. With the rapid development of life-science and nanotechnology, research on the failure behaviors of biomaterials, nanomaterials and nanostructures is of both academic and practical significance. ICFF VIII will be a timely forum for reviewing the progress, exchanging ideas among researchers, and providing industry with information concerning fundamentals of fracture. ICFF VIII will function as a vehicle for US scientists and educators to establish, promote and strengthen collaborations in the area of fundamentals of fracture with their Asia counterparts. This will also offer young researchers a broad perspective of the scholarly activity in their area, expose them to the diversity of perceptions and interests in the global research community and allow them to make personal contact with people sharing their research interests all over the world.  \r\n",
