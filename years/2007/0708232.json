A cluster of multi-core servers is constructed as a reconfigurable distributed virtual machine (DVM) to provide a shared computing resource in support of multi-disciplinary research at Wayne State University, including in particular, the following activities: (1) development of resource management technologies for high performance and energy efficient computing; (2) development of hybrid storage systems for data-intensive applications in server clusters; (3) development of bandwidth efficient resource management techniques for scalable streaming services; (4) development of algorithms for fast and accurate port placement and arm positioning in robotic surgery; and (5) real-time anesthesia planning, diagnosis, and decision support. \r\n\r\nThis project leverages the success of the targeted research activities.  The systems research develops novel resource management technologies with respect to processing power, memory/storage, network-I/O bandwidth, and energy efficiency. The medical engineering applications require intense computations and entail retrieving and processing of large amounts of data.  The research activities share the requirements of real-time and high assurance processing.  DVM facilitates experimental evaluation of new resource management technologies and make it possible to experiment with various design choices in applications and to study the impacts of and the interactions among many important factors in reasonable times. The DVM solution also advances medical information processing and patient treatments to a new level of timeliness and accuracy.\r\n",
