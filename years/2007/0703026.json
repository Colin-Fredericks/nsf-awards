 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research has shown that while employers may be supportive of two-year college information technology (IT) programs, they are more likely to hire four-year college graduates for IT positions.  At the same time, technician education programs in community colleges provide industry driven instruction including an emphasis on the employability skills.  To address this issue that affects U.S. innovation and competitiveness in global markets, the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET), the Career Center at Bellevue Community College, and the Community College Research Center at Columbia University (CCRC) partner to determine employers' IT requirements for the workforce and to communicate to them the qualities of two-year college educated IT technicians in a three pronged approach.  Two-year college students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines with an IT emphasis engage in workplace experiences with employer and faculty mentors.  Two-year college faculty also engage in exchanges with employers such as externships and job shadowing.  Research is done to document employer perceptions and receptivity to recruiting and retention of two-year college graduates.  A conference held at the beginning of the project is used to determine industry requirements as seen by personnel at various levels in business and industry and to make connections for the student mentoring and faculty exchanges.",
