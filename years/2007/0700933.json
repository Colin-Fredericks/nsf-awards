 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe subject of this proposal is research in the area of congruences, or\r\np-adic analysis, related to modular forms. The research area of this\r\nproposal combines and provides links between highly abstract and\r\nfundamental objects such as the Eigencurve recently discovered by Mazur\r\nand Coleman, which describes all the two-dimensional Galois\r\nrepresentations in p-adic families, and various elementary number\r\ntheoretic objects such as the partition function recently investigated\r\nusing the methods of the p-adic theory of modular forms by Ono and\r\nAhlgren. Some open problems in this area are fairly new. In particular, in\r\na recently published book \"The Web of Modularity:  Arithmetic of the\r\nCoefficients of Modular Forms and q-Series\" Ono provides many new insights\r\nand results along with a variety of open problems. There are also\r\nlong-standing conjectures, for example, those formulated by Atkin almost\r\nfour decades ago pertaining to certain congruences for the Fourier\r\ncoefficients of the modular invariant.  Sometimes the p-adic setting sheds\r\na new light on questions which come from the complex-analytic theory of\r\nmodular forms (e.g., a question about connections between Borcherds and\r\nShimura maps). This proposal consists of several distinct projects that\r\naddress problems of these kinds. These projects are at present in different \r\nstages of development.  In all cases the principal investigator has already \r\nobtained certain results, and there are reasons to expect further progress.\r\n\r\nPartly motivated by congruences found by Ramanujan and pioneered in works\r\nof Atkin, Serre, and Swinnerton-Dyer, this area of research has steadily\r\nproduced significant results during the last forty years. Many important\r\nachievements in theoretical and applied number theory in the last few decades, \r\nincluding the celebrated proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and elliptic curve \r\ncryptography, are closely related to this area of research. Results from this \r\nkind of number theory find their applications in various areas of mathematics \r\nsuch as elliptic genera, arithmetic geometry, finite fields, as well as certain \r\nareas of contemporary physics such as mirror symmetry, conformal invariance \r\nand string theory.  Sometimes the applications and connections are discovered \r\nyears after a result is obtained. Therefore, although no results of this scope or \r\nspecific connections to other fields are claimed in this proposal, contributions to\r\nthis area of research may well have future applications.\r\n",
