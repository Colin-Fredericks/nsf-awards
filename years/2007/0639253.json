 "awd_abstract_narration": "Islands with large populations of seabirds are important contributors to biodiversity worldwide because of their large populations of rare native plants and animals. Invasive predators such as rats and cats have eradicated seabird populations on most islands.  Such predators are now being eradicated from hundreds of islands as part of restoration plans. However, studies on how seabirds and their predators change island vegetation and functioning are generally limited to single island groups. This Research Coordination Network will bring together scientists from across the globe to compare impacts of seabirds, seabird predators, and predator removal from different systems, identify what crucial information is lacking, and develop strategies for improving island restoration. It will hold annual meetings, develop a website to facilitate data collation and analysis, and produce an edited book, a set of guidelines for island restoration, and a multi-lingual public education video.\r\n\r\nThis RCN will create a scientific framework for understanding impacts of seabirds and predators on island functioning. It will contribute to conservation of native diversity and restoration of islands by improving incorporation of ecological knowledge in restoration plans, and identifying additional actions needed for successful restoration.  Community involvement in science will be enhanced through participation of resource managers and members of the public in the development of restoration guidelines  The RCN will increase international collaboration and improve training of young scientists through site exchanges. \r\n",
