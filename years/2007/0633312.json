 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a low-cost, multi-purpose undergraduate micro-mechatronics laboratory based on the principles of a learner centered education.  The laboratory is utilizing inexpensive micro-controllers, a desktop maskless lithography tool and a wet bench allowing students to fabricate and test their own micro devices, without the need for access to a specialized clean room.  Four different experiments are being developed; (1) micro-cantilever experiment demonstrating surface stress and molecular adsorption; (2) thermal micro-actuator experiment demonstrating thermo-elasticity, Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and transient heat analysis in one dimension; (3) pressure sensor experiment demonstrating plate theory and piezo-resistivity; and (4) mechatronics experiment demonstrating system identification and closed loop control of a DC motor.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory development is part of a multi-departmental master plan for creating a college-wide undergraduate curriculum on micro- and nano-technologies addressing the needs not only of undergraduate engineering students but also of students from other sciences, such as bio-sciences, optics, and physics. The proposed laboratory experience is fostering interdisciplinary skills and improving the ability to motivate students to pursue advanced engineering degrees.\r\n",
