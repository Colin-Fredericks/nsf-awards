 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Early Faculty Career Development (CAREER) award is to explore the use of induced negative viscosities as a new degree of freedom in polymer nanomanufacturing processes such as electrospinning.  A novel method for precisely controlling the geometrical and magnetic distribution of nanoparticles inside a polymer matrix will be devised by controlling the particle size and chemistry of the nanoparticles as well as the frequency and amplitude of the oscillating magnetic fields employed to induce negative viscosity effects during the electrospinning process.   The use of induced negative viscosities in polymer nanomanufacturing will be studied by a combination of multiphysics-based modeling and customized experiments. The mathematical modeling section will attempt to develop algorithms to simultaneously couple electromagnetic and transport phenomena in viscoelastic media. The experimental approach will include the use of a customized electrospinning device as well as the implementation of analytical methods based on magnetic force microscopy and electrostatic force microscopy.  Even though the research is of fundamental nature, its discoveries can open an avenue for the manufacturing of novel composite structures not possible to achieve by any other method.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the findings could provide a competitive advantage to the American manufacturing and polymer processing industries as novel structures and materials could be produced at higher throughputs, lower costs and higher levels of control.  The ability of using induced negative viscosity effects to control the position of particles with nanoscale precision could potentially be expanded to develop novel anti-counterfeiting devices aimed at protecting intellectual property rights and curtailing the counterfeit of high value goods.  The education and outreach components of the plan seek to enhance the participation of underrepresented groups in research activities as well as to leverage prior investments of NSF in education and K-12 outreach programs.  The PI will continue involvement in community outreach programs through the Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America, and will develop training modules for workshops that reach teachers working in districts serving underrepresented ethnic minorities.  Furthermore, the PI will continue involvement with professional organizations to promote the pursuit of graduate education in sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics among Hispanic youth.",
