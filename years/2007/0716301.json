 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MRI proposal requests support for several university groups for the development of new components for the trigger of the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron antiproton-proton collider. This facility is at the energy frontier of experimental particle physics. The primary goal of the experiment is to search for the Higgs boson, the physical manifestation of the Higgs field. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs field provides a means of generating the particle masses and spontaneously breaking the symmetry of the electroweak interaction. There are many indications that the Tevatron collider could produce the Higgs boson, provided that enough antiproton-proton collisions are delivered to the experiments. \r\n\r\nThe planned luminosity upgrade of the Tevatron will require the experiments to be even more selective than in the past and thus an efficient trigger system is essential. Selection algorithms giving background rejection factors of more than 105 with high efficiency must be implemented in real time. This proposal would support the development of the hardware and algorithms necessary for the D0 experiment to cope with the higher interaction rates produced at the upgraded luminosities.\r\n",
