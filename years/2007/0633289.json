 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical sciences (21) This project is infusing examples of every day applications of calculus into the standard calculus curriculum by conducting student field trips to local businesses and industries. During each visit students attend a one to two hour presentation by a scientist at the organization on topics related to those they are currently studying. Following the field trip students complete a collaborative project with classmates based on the scientific application they learned about. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its use of experiential learning to help students make the connection between the classroom and workplaces in their local community, thus developing a focus and purpose for their academic studies. The project is also having a direct impact on the large and diverse student body many of whom belong to disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. Moreover, the project activities are having an impact on the local and academic community through the partnerships forged between the faculty and their scientific or engineering counterparts in industry.",
