Mr. Moore will work with Professor Kazuhiro Oiwa and his Biological ICT Group at the Kobe Advanced ICT Research Center of the National Institute of Information and Communication Technology (NICT). One objective of Mr. Moore's dissertation research is to develop a computer simulation model of an engineered molecular communication system based upon the intracellular transport of cells. His work at his home institution focuses on simulation of molecular motor communication designs, and at NICT he will performs in vitro experiments and computer simulations to determine the feasibility of the target communication system and to improve its design using the equipment and expertise of the Oiwa group. The research is part of a larger interdisciplinary collaboration between the PI and NICT in which molecules are used as communication carriers.\r\n\r\n",
