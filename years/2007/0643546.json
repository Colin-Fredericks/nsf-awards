Fisher\r\n\r\nThe main thrust of the proposed research is to introduce\r\nand develop new analytic techniques in group theory and\r\nthe study of group actions.  Major projects include:\r\n(a) studying quasi-isometries using a new notion of\r\ncoarse differentiation (introduced in recent joint work\r\nwith Eskin and Whyte)\r\n(b) developing harmonic map techniques in rigidity\r\ntheory, particularly in the context of infinite\r\ndimensional target spaces and\r\n(c) developing a normal form theory for group actions\r\nbased on new generalizations and variants of hard\r\nimplicit function theorems.\r\n\r\nAll research lies in the broad interdisciplinary area of\r\nrigidity in dynamics, geometry and topology. The grant\r\nwill also support summer schools devoted to new\r\ndevelopments in rigidity theory. The field is broad and\r\nnot entirely well defined, new developments frequently\r\ninvolve ideas from other areas of mathematics. These\r\nsummer schools will provide students and young\r\nscientists the opportunity to learn about new\r\ndevelopments quickly and to build the professional\r\nnetworks required to remain abreast of future new\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nIn the study of mathematical objects, a key role is\r\noften played by the symmetries of the object --\r\nparticularly when the object has many symmetries. The PI\r\ninvestigates ways of characterizing, describing and\r\nstudying spaces with many symmetries in various\r\ndynamical, geometric and topological settings. These\r\nquestions are interdisciplinary in nature and often\r\nrequire learning, adapting and applying ideas and\r\ntechniques from many areas of mathematics. The PI's work\r\nhas connections with diverse areas of mathematics: from\r\ncelestial mechanics (KAM theory and stability of the\r\nsolar system) to theoretical computer science (expander\r\ngraphs, Kazhdan's property (T) and coarse embedding\r\nproblems). Many proposed projects involve applying\r\nanalytic ideas and techniques to problems traditionally\r\nstudied by dynamical, geometric or topological methods.\r\n",
