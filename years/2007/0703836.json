 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college is completing an institution-level reform of its Engineering Technology Associate degree program in an effort to better meet the workforce demands of industry in central New Jersey.  The project brings together a consortium of secondary schools, a community college, a four-year university, workforce development professionals, and industry leaders. This project strengthens the ties within the technical education community and promotes industry participation in educating students and training technicians.  The goals of the project are to develop a comprehensive and detailed plan to transform the Engineering Technology curricula to meet the technical standards of industry, develop customized training opportunities for incumbent and displaced workers, integrate work-based activities and internship programs for students, develop initiatives to increase enrollment including underrepresented students, enhance faculty development opportunities with local industry partners, and promote a working relationship among interested industrial stakeholders.  The activities being completed to meet these goals include two planning conferences with industry and education partners and a week-long curriculum development retreat.  This project serves as a model for transforming a community college technical education program in collaboration with secondary schools and a four-year university, to create a seamless educational and work-entry pathway for future technicians.",
