 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Professor John R. Shapley at the University of Illinois to delve into the chemistry of a recently discovered heterogeneous catalyst system that promotes efficient reduction by hydrogen of the perchlorate ion in water, which is the first example of a non-biological catalyst potentially capable of being used to remediate perchlorate-contaminated drinking water.  The approach involves the preparation of catalysts with bifunctional properties tailored to address a targeted, difficult reaction. Further studies on the perchlorate system are intended to provide details at the level of molecular interactions that will elucidate the operation and importance of specific reaction steps. These results will guide future synthesis efforts to optimize the catalytic reaction centers for improved perchlorate reduction catalysts and will shed light on a fundamental reaction type that is a key component of the catalytic reduction of other oxyanion contaminants in water. \r\n\r\nThis research is to develop a practical system for perchlorate remediation of drinking water. The outcomes from the work will also have impact in infrastructure development through the education and training of the students involved in this research and through the outreach efforts of the University of Illinois Water Science and Technology center.\r\n",
