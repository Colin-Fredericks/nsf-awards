 "awd_abstract_narration": "Focusing on high achieving students, this project is providing scholarships to students pursuing degrees in Astronomy, Biological Sciences, Biotechnology, Chemistry, Computer and Information Science, Engineering, Geospatial Science, Geology, Mathematics, and Physics.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Utilizing intense academic and career support and associated activities for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) scholars, the project''s Learning Community approach is increasing enrollment, retention, and graduation rates in STEM-related programs by providing discipline specific academic and career support services to improve performance and retention. STEM scholars are assigned discipline specific faculty mentors who actively support their academic and employment success. Scholars also interface through an online support network via Blackboard and a STEM web-link and through regular mentoring sessions and multidisciplinary activities that are being promoted college-wide to attract additional candidates. Activities for scholars also include an introductory session for incoming scholars; a workshop on surviving the STEM experience; a panel discussion with industry professionals on STEM careers; a workshop on maximizing career and transfer opportunities; a panel discussion with student success professionals; and a closing session introducing senior STEM scholar achievements for the year.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: Supporting this project are over two-dozen faculty, staff, and administrators who are working collaboratively to assure implementation of best practices with STEM-related students. STEM scholars benefit from direct interaction with industry and university mentors who specialize in STEM disciplines. The fall 2007 opening of the Advanced Technology Center benefits STEM Scholars directly through the use of cutting-edge laboratory equipment and Instructional Delivery Systems.",
