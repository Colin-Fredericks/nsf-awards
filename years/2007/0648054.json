 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive approach to risk adjusted robust control,\r\nstarting with the use of experimental data to obtain and validate a plant description and ending with a closed\r\nloop system that has a prescribed risk of violating the performance specifications. Its conceptual backbone\r\nis a combination of operator theoretic and stochastic tools that emphasizes both computational complexity\r\nand practicality of the results.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The conventional robust control framework developed in the past two decades has\r\nproved to be very successful in addressing robustness and performance issues in systems subject to unstructured\r\nuncertainty. This is also true, to a lesser extent, in the case of structured uncertainty, provided\r\nthat the number of uncertainty blocks is small and the plant under consideration has moderate size, with the\r\nlimiting factor here being the computational and scaling properties of the resulting optimization problems.\r\nAn additional limitation stems from the fact that these approaches take a worst case approach both to stability\r\nand performance. While a very strong case can be made for the former, in many cases an equally\r\nstrong case can be made against the use of a worst case approach to performance, since it can lead to overly\r\nconservative systems. This proposal is motivated by the possibility (substantiated by the co PIs preliminary\r\nwork) of addressing these issues through the use of a risk adjusted approach, where the designer is willing\r\nto trade off a preassigned risk of violating a performance specification in return for a reduction, often\r\nsubstantial, in both the complexity of the resulting controller and its conservatism. Advantages offered by\r\nthe proposed framework over currently available techniques include the abilities to:\r\na.- Systematically synthesize low complexity, practically implementable robust systems.\r\nb.- Lead to tractable problems, and in cases where the underlying problem is intrinsically hard, to\r\nprovide for computationally tractable relaxations with risk adjusted certificates. Examples of these\r\ncases include model (in)validation under arbitrary uncertainty structures and fixer order controller\r\nsynthesis, both beyond the ability of hitherto available methods.\r\nc.- Indicate the intrinsic limits of performance of the plant, making unavoidable design tradeoffs clear\r\nand allowing the control engineer to explicitly make these tradeoffs, without trial and error iterations,\r\ngracefully degrading performance when some of the requirements cannot be met.\r\nBroader Impact: In addition to advancing the current state of the art in control theory, the proposed research\r\nwill bring closer to being practical several technologies currently at the proof of concept stage. Examples\r\nof these include active vision applications to aware environments and communication networks with improved\r\nrobustness and quality of service characteristics. Arguably one of the critical factors preventing the\r\ndeployment of these technologies beyond controlled lab environments is the lack of robustness of the resulting\r\nsystems. Addressing this fragility is beyond the ability of currently available robust control techniques\r\ndue to their poor computational and scaling properties.\r\nEducational Impact: In addition to benefiting graduate education, we plan to incorporate results from this\r\nresearch in an undergraduate introductory robust control course, that will expose students at an earlier stage\r\nto the issues of robustness and computational complexity. Typically this is done at the graduate level, and\r\nthus undergraduate students are unaware of these ideas, although it could be argued that they are some of\r\nmost powerful and better developed assets that our community has, with a potential that extend beyond\r\npure control. Risk adjusted ideas provide an ideal vehicle to accomplish this initial exposure, eliminating\r\nthe need to wait until students build the background in functional analysis required to tackle graduate level\r\nrobust control courses.",
