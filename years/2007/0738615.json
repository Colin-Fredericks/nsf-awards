 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nObjective:\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to request partial support from NSF for the participation of some of the attendees from the universities in North America.  This will enable some of the junior faculty to attend the 7th International Workshop on Future Information Processing Technologies (IWFIPT)\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe IWFIPT is designed to project long-term trends in information technologies across a wide spectrum of areas.  This forum typically examines underlying trends as well as emerging and evolving areas of application for the technologies: solid state technology; nanotechnology; devices; circuits; and system architectures. The participants will identify research opportunities at the frontiers of information processing that will catalyze progress into the 21st Century and beyond the ITRS roadmap.  One of the focus areas of the workshop is the anticipated end of scaling for charge-transport devices based on CMOS in the next 10 to 15 years and how to bridge into the next generation of nanoelectronics.  \r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThe conference will establish a global communication link and network between researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds in an international environment.  It will nurture a fruitful exchange of experiences and ideas.  The findings of the workshop will be made available as summaries through a final report to attendees and sponsors of the workshop\r\n\r\n\r\n",
