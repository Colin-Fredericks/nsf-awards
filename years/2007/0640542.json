 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous research by the Principal Investigator has derived, developed, and established quantitative biophysical equations (with inclusive biophysical variables) that describe expansive growth of the large cylindrical single-celled sporangiophores of Phycomyces blakesleeanus. The objective of the current research project is to employ these biophysical equations in the identification and elucidation of pathways between relevant genes and associated expansive growth characteristics of these sporangiophores. The research project consists of two related studies. First, the relationship between the biophysical variables and metabolism will be examined using anoxia to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Because the magnitude and behavior of the biophysical variables are regulated and controlled by the cell via metabolically dependent biological processes, the determination of the relationship between the biophysical variables and metabolism is of paramount importance. Second, pressure probe methods will be used to determine the magnitude and behavior of the biophysical variables in known mutant strains of the sporangiophores of P. blakesleeanus. The obtained results will be compared to those previously obtained for wild type sporangiophores. It is anticipated that this comparison will identify the biophysical variables responsible for abnormal growth characteristics in specific mutant strains. The affect of metabolism on the relevant biophysical variables will be investigated with the methods developed in the first study. The results can facilitate the identification of relevant pathways because each biophysical variable is associated with specific biological activities and organelles. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\nGraduate and undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the research project. Also, the PI and participating students will work with high school and middle school students in the Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Association (MESA). Every year the College of Engineering hosts the annual MESA Jubilee for high school and middle school students throughout the state. The graduate and undergraduate students working in the Bioengineering Laboratory will assist these high school and middle school students with their math, science, and engineering projects. Also, they will assist the PI in judging science competitions and giving tours of the laboratories.\r\n",
