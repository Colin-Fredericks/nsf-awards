 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to optimize the chemical mechanical planarization process using experimental evaluation of mechanical reliability of low dielectric constant materials. Extensive post surface metrology, mechanical and interfacial analysis of the materials, and consumables like pad and slurry used in polishing will be done to gain a fundamental analysis of the planarization process from different perspectives. The research will investigate the roles played by the consumables on surface defect generation at the fundamental level. This investigation will allow optimization of pad design, material selection, process pressure, orbital and linear speed, chemical solution, within wafer uniformity and local planarization. Modeling of interfacial adhesion will allow optimization of process conditions, pad physical properties, and chemical additives in order to reduce within uniformity and delamination of thin film stacks. Reliability issues related to dielectric materials will provide an optimal solution for improved yield without compromising the throughput.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the finding of this investigation will result in improved equipment and process designs as well as significant reduction in design cycle time and cost. The research will have a profound impact on integration, device yield, and consumables development resulting in a significant economic payoff. The research will be integrated into existing and new courses in the investigators program and other steps will be taken to stimulate the interest of undergraduates and minority student engineers in microelectronics industries. The results will be disseminated in a timely manner through presentation at national/international conferences and publications in archival journals.",
