Its aim was to explore the interaction between\r\nseveral directions in noncommutative geometry: index theorems,\r\nnoncommutative calculus and operads, relations to mathematical\r\nphysics, to number theory, and to the geometric Langlands\r\nprogram. An important objective was to highlight the subjects\r\nthat are strong in the Chicago area (algebraic geometry, motives,\r\nmicrolocal analysis, representation theory, geometric Langlands\r\nprogram, mirror symmetry) and investigate their links to the\r\nworks in what is more traditionally considered noncommutative\r\ngeometry, and vice versa. For example, an algebraic approach to\r\nloop spaces that is used in the geometric Langlands program and\r\nin representation theory of real groups was compared to the\r\ntopological string theory which is related to algebraic topology\r\nand mathematical physics, as well as to an approach to the\r\nrepresentation theory of p-adic groups. A relation was\r\nestablished between these subjects, in particular string\r\ntopology, and current research on motives. Several approaches to\r\na conjectural relationship between noncommutative geometry and\r\nmirror symmetry were presented.\r\n\r\nNoncommutative geometry is an extension of the classical geometry\r\nto \"spaces\" in which coordinates x, y, etc. no longer commute,\r\ni.e. where the identity xy=yx is not necessarily true. Such\r\n\"spaces\" abound in mathematics and physics. For example,\r\nnoncommutativity is the mathematical manifestation of the\r\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics: if x\r\nstands for a position of a particle and y for its momentum, you\r\ncannot know precise values of both x and y. In a more\r\nmathematical context, noncommutativity is an expression of the\r\nfact that, if you apply two transformations to an object, the\r\nresult depends on the order in which you do it. Mathematical\r\nsituations where noncommutativity occurs have been known for a\r\nlong time but the idea to treat them as \"noncommutative spaces\"\r\nand to study them by geometric methods is relatively recent. One\r\nof the successes of this approach is a radical simplification of\r\nthe standard model in quantum field theory by means of allowing\r\nthe space to be noncommutative. The aim of the conference was to\r\ncompare several approaches to noncommutative geometry, as well as\r\nits links to other areas of mathematics and physics.
