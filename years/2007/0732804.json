Bindschadler \r\nProposal Number: 0732906\r\nCollaborative With: McPhee 0732804, Holland 0732869, Truffer 0732730, Stanton 0732926, Anandakrishnan 0732844 \r\nTitle: Collaborative Research: IPY: Ocean-Ice Interaction in the Amundsen Sea Sector of West Antarctica\r\n\r\nThe Office of Polar Programs, Antarctic Integrated and System Science Program has made this award to support an interdisciplinary study of the effects of the ocean on the stability of glacial ice in the most dynamic region the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, namely the Pine Island Glacier in the Amundsen Sea Embayment.  The collaborative project builds on the knowledge gained by the highly successful West Antarctic Ice Sheet program and is being jointly sponsored with NASA.  Recent observations indicate a significant ice loss, equivalent to 10% of the ongoing increase in sea-level rise, in this region. These changes are largest along the coast and propagate rapidly inland, indicating the critical impact of the ocean on ice sheet stability in the region.  While a broad range of remote sensing and ground-based instrumentation is available to characterize changes of the ice surface and internal structure (deformation, ice motion, melt) and the shape of the underlying sediment and rock bed, instrumentation has yet to be successfully deployed for observing boundary layer processes of the ocean cavity which underlies the floating ice shelf and where rapid melting is apparently occurring.  Innovative, mini ocean sensors that can be lowered through boreholes in the ice shelf (about 500 m thick) will be developed and deployed to automatically provide ocean profiling information over at least three years.  Their data will be transmitted through a conducting cable frozen in the borehole to the surface where it will be further transmitted via satellite to a laboratory in the US.  Geophysical and remote sensing methods (seismic, GPS, altimetry, stereo imaging, radar profiling) will be applied to map the geometry of the ice shelf, the shape of the sub ice-shelf cavity, the ice surface geometry and deformations within the glacial ice.  To integrate the seismic, glaciological and oceanographic observations, a new 3-dimensional coupled ice-ocean model is being developed which will be the first of its kind. NASA is supporting satellite based research and the deployment of a robotic-camera system to explore the environment in the ocean cavity underlying the ice shelf and NSF is supporting all other aspects of this study.  \r\n \r\nBroader impacts:  This project is motivated by the potential societal impacts of rapid sea level rise and should result in critically needed improvements in characterizing and predicting the behavior of coupled ocean-ice systems.  It is a contribution to the International Polar Year and was endorsed by the International Council for Science as a component of the \"Multidisciplinary Study of the Amundsen Sea Embayment\" proposal #258 of the honeycomb of endorsed IPY activities.  The research involves substantial international partnerships with the British Antarctic Survey and the University of Bristol in the UK.  The investigators will partner with the previously funded \"Polar Palooza\" education and outreach program in addition to undertaking a diverse set of outreach activities of their own.  Eight graduate students and one undergraduate as well as one post doc will be integrated into this research project.   \r\n\r\n",

However, the data stream from PIG has been limited and I have had little chance to analyze those data directly.\nAt the invitation of New Zealand colleagues, I widened my scope of the PIG project by participating in field work measuring turbulence under fast ice near Erebus Glacier Tongue (EGT) in McMurdo Sound in 2010. In addition to providing \"ground truth\" for the PIG instrumentation tested at the same time, I explored a facet of ice-shelf/ocean interaction that contrasts with conditions at PIG; namely, exchanges associated with the \"ice pump\" mechanism, in which water cooled and freshened by melting near the grounding line rises as it circulates, eventually reaching lower pressures where it becomes supercooled  (i.e., at temperature below in situ freezing) and forms marine ice layers comprising consolidated frazil and platelet ice. The Ross Ice Shelf produces large quantities of supercooled water, enough to annually fill the upper part of McMurdo Sound.  A motivation for the EGT work was to measure the impact of supercooling on sea ice in a tidal regime as an analog for the deposition (marine ice) zone of a shelf cavity with an active ice pump.\nAt our measurement site near Erebus Glacier Tongue in Oct-Nov, 2010, the upper 15 m of the water column was below its pressure dependent freezing temperature.  We deployed turbulence measuring instrumentation a meter below fast (immobile) ice about 140 m from EGT in water that was approximately 10 mK below freezing. Although the data collection period was curtailed by nucleation of ice on the sensors, we were able to successfully measure turbulent exchange through about three diurnal tidal cycles.  Key findings from the EGT project are: (1) Platelet growth at the sea-ice base in supercooled water increases boundary-layer hydraulic roughness significantly (meaning higher skin friction drag); (2) There was consistently downward ocean heat flux, modulated by tidal flow, observed under ice growing by platelet nucleation; and (3) Platelet growth appeared to be rate limited by the capacity of the boundary layer to remove by turbulence latent heat released during crystal formation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miles G Mcphee"
