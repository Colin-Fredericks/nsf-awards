 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Summary\r\nWildfire, although a natural and periodic phenomena, has an immediate and sometimes devastating\r\neffect on watersheds. The impacts of wildfire can include high rates of overland flow, high\r\nsedimentation rates, decreased water quality, and destructive debris flows. Southern California is\r\nprone to widespread fires at the urban-wildland interface due to its Mediterranean climate (wet\r\nwinters, dry summers), prevalent Santa Anna winds during the fall season, and an ever-expanding\r\npopulation which is responsible for igniting many of the observed fires. The Day Fire, which\r\nrecently occurred north of Los Angeles, consumed nearly 254 square miles of National Forest and\r\ndesignated wilderness areas. Several major drinking water reservoirs for the metropolitan region are\r\nlocated downstream from the Day Fire burn area, presenting an immediate and serious concern for\r\nwater resource managers. One of these reservoirs, located on the eastern fringe of the burn, is\r\nPyramid Lake, which stores water from the California Aqueduct as well as natural inflows from the\r\nPiru Creek watershed. The objective of this proposal is to understand the physical and chemical\r\nmechanisms that control nutrient, metal and other contaminant fluxes in post-fire watersheds, with a\r\nfocus on the Pyramid Lake reservoir system. A SGER grant is critical to this objective as it allows an\r\nimmediate field campaign focused on the physical and chemical parameters related to likely primary\r\nproblems.\r\nIntellectual Merit. This work addresses fundamental questions on the impacts of fire on metal and\r\nnutrient transport and cycling in watershed systems. By enabling coordinated, spatiotemporally\r\ndense observations of multiple parameters in terrestrial, aqueous and sediment phases within one\r\nwatershed system, we will be able to elucidate complex transport relationships in post-fire\r\nwatersheds. While there has been considerable literature demonstrating the effects of fire on\r\nhydrologic processes, we do not fully understand the relationships between sediment flux and\r\nnutrient and metal transport in post-fire systems. Ultimately, we plan to use the collected data to\r\ndevelop mechanistic and watershed scale models of nutrients, metals and sediment transport in postfire\r\nwatershed systems.\r\nBroader Impacts. The proposed research represents a unique opportunity to understand a crucial water\r\nquality issue, while also synergizing with on-going hydrological and geomorphologic studies to\r\ndefine and address issues fundamental to response and recovery in burned watersheds. Our study\r\nwill be the first to investigate the potential effects of fire on nutrient and metal transport in a streamreservoir\r\nsystem which is an integral part of the regional water supply in a semi-arid region.\r\nEcosystem and water supply managers will be able to utilize information gathered in this study to\r\ndevelop mitigation and warning strategies for reducing the impacts from increased metal and\r\nnutrient fluxes in burned watersheds. This proposal will also contribute to the education of one\r\nPh.D. graduate student at UCLA, as well as undergraduate students at the University of the Pacific\r\nand UCLA. UCLA undergraduate students will develop undergraduate research projects (taken as\r\nCEE199) involving data collection and analysis, field surveys, and/or modeling studies, and Pacific\r\nundergraduate students will incorporate data collection and analysis into Senior Thesis projects.",
