 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alabama State University (ASU) proposes to establish a Center for Nanobiotechnology Research (CNBR) with the goal of strengthening and enhancing interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaborative research in the area of nanotechnology and biotechnology. In addition, the center will play a pivotal role in providing training and research resources to the new Ph.D. program in Environmental Microbiology. The center will facilitate four research themes: 1) Structural studies of RSV at nanoscale and viral inhibition by nanoparticles, 2) Carbon nanotube attached with ssDNA as nanosensor for detection of Salmonella typhimurium, 3) The development of nanobiomaterials for drug delivery, and 4) delivery of nanoparticle encapsuled anti-Chlamydial peptides in an animal model. These projects will be carried out in collaboration with the University of Louisville, University of South Florida, University of Alabama at Birmingham and Tulane National Primate Research Center. These collaborations will also provide an opportunity for minority students to pursue Ph.D. degrees at collaborating institutions. Other aspects of the center will include an international scientist exchange program, travel to scientific meetings, release-time to subproject PIs, summer research at collaborating institutions and an annual science symposium.",
