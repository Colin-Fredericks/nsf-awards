 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaborative effort between research groups from University of Louisville and Northwestern University. In order to assure high quality, and to avoid problems in the lifetime performance of the material, the study aims at investigating and understanding the fundamental relationships among evolving nano/micro-structures and mechanical properties during the setting period of advanced cement-based materials. First, the research will focus on characterizing evolving nano/micro-structures with various newly-developed measuring technologies on different scales. Second, in-situ techniques that can continuously monitor the corresponding material properties during this period will be developed. Third, a multi-scale model based on measuring and monitoring will be established to predict material behaviors such as initial setting time, viscosity, and chemical shrinkage, which are important quality control parameters for the construction of a concrete structure. The correlations between these macro-structural parameters and micro-structural parameters, such as particle packing, solid concentration, solid flocculation, solid percolation, and chemical hydration, will be investigated. Thus, the characterization of intrinsic material properties can be explicit.\r\n\r\nThis research presents an innovative approach to the identification of material properties from a primarily physical point of view. Techniques for measuring, monitoring, and modeling the nano/micro-structure of concrete will be examined to expand and improve the current state of knowledge of concrete's material properties during setting. The results of this research will facilitate the development of reliable quality control methods for monitoring concrete structures at very early ages, which should benefit ready-mix plants, contractors, cement plants, chemical admixture companies, and local and federal government agencies.\r\n\r\n",
