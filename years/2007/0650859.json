 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Thomas A. Gregor, will undertake research on an indigenous cultural system for sustaining peace and avoiding conflict as it exists among the Mehinauku who along the upper reaches of the Xingu river in central Brazil. The Mehinauku are one of fourteen indigenous communities who live in relative peace. Though speaking six mutually unintelligible languages, local groups intermarry, trade specialty goods, and attend one another's ceremonies.  Warfare among them is unknown.  The overarching question that this research addresses is what sustains the Xingu system?\r\n\r\nBecause previous research has indicated that the Xingu peace seems to emerge from \"ground up,\"   this project will focus on individuals and interpersonal relations using cognitive anthropological techniques. The researcher will reside in the village long house, do a genealogical mapping of local and intertribal kinship networks, and carry out in-depth interviews.  He will use cognitive anthropological techniques, such as free lists, triad sorts, and cultural consensus analysis to elicit social categories and explore cultural variability. Moral judgments and moral reasoning will be evoked during the research by presenting informants with hypothetical \"trouble cases\" that probe generosity, sharing, self-sacrifice and compassion.   The work will further document the villagers' capacity for empathy by exploring such practices as the tending of the sick and the bereaved and the sharing of food. The links of warmth between villagers enlarge the moral community and partially blur local ethnic affiliations.  But in some respects the Xingu peace is an uneasy one, in which egoistic motivation, fear of violence and witchcraft also seem to have a role.  The research will examine how fear of witchcraft deters aggression, how conflict is expressed within a generally anti-violent culture, and how children learn to contain emotions during adolescence.  \r\n\r\nThe research is important in that it is one of the last opportunities to understand a society that has successfully maintained peaceful relations with other societies. Peace is a profoundly important topic but the opportunity to observe it in the Upper Xingu is rapidly disappearing in the face of encroaching Brazilian society.  The research also will contribute to the development of anthropological theory that links interpersonal and institutional aspects of culture. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n From the Ground up:  The Interpersonal Politics of A Native American Peace System\n\nWe know a great deal about war, but very little about peace.  War is so common that it appears to be the normal human condition.  Peace is very rare.  This project focused on an exceptional case, the native peoples of the headwaters of Brazil\u00c6s Xingu River (one of the major tributaries of the Amazon).  In this region 19 culturally similar indigenous communities live together peacefully, although there are homicides related to beliefs in witchcraft. Warfare is unknown. The villagers participate in one another\u00c6s rituals, they intermarry, and they trade goods that are unique to each group.  They do so despite the fact that they speak four unrelated languages and many mutually unintelligible sub-dialects. \n\nThe National Science Foundation sponsored project focused on the system of peaceful relationships from the perspective of the Mehinaku, one of the area\u00c6s ethnic communities.  What sustains the system and motivates the villagers to participate?  The culture is \"anti-violent.\"  Violence is frightening, repugnant and contaminating.  The moral system reflects the same values more positively.  Generosity with possessions, caring for the sick and the elderly and above all sharing food define one\u00c6s public identity as a \"good person\".  Underlying these values is the capacity for empathy &ndash; awareness of and experiencing the feelings of others.   \n\nNegative sanctions as well as the positive values of peace also play a role.  Fear of witchcraft is widespread and may be very disruptive, leading to the formation of separate villages, which occurs regularly in lieu of violence.  At an interpersonal level fear of witchcraft enforces generosity, limits the power of chiefs, shamans and influential men, and constrains daily conduct so that antagonists maintain a veneer of courtesy.  Villagers have a highly developed sense of shame, which, in the public setting of a face-to face community, enforces social norms.\n\nRaising children instills both the positive values of peace and restrains aggression.  There is no fighting, and children who are too \"angry\" receive magical treatments from shamans.  Crucial to peace is the practice of \"seclusion,\" by which adolescents live behind a partition in their communal houses. The period of seclusion lasts from one to three years (an extraordinarily long period in comparison with other cultures) and is believed to be essential to becoming a successful adult.  While in seclusion the adolescents are watched over by an unseen spirit who observes their behavior and reads their thoughts, rewarding those who conform with strength and physical beauty.  Growing into adulthood thereby depends on self-monitoring and self-control: honoring food taboos and avoiding any form of sexual behavior, aggressive conduct or even forbidden thoughts.  Seclusion is said to be \"transformation,\" and the villagers who pass through it generally model the careful, circumspect and peaceful adult.\n\n A finding of the research is that peace in the region is generated \"from the ground up,\" from individuals and relationships.  This is the case in other peaceful small-scale societies, but mass societies must depend more heavily on institutions which directly restrain violence, such as codified legal systems, police and international organizations.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/18/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas A Gregor"
