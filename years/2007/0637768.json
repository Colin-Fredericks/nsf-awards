 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of a photochemical technique for destroying a highly toxic group of organic compounds known as dioxin-furans and consisting specifically of tetra- through octa-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans.  The photochemical technique is designed to destroy dioxin-furan compounds prior to their release to the environment from industrial facilities.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) believes that dioxin-furans are a serious threat to public health and has established stringent limitations applicable to dioxin-furan emissions from many types of industrial furnaces and kilns.  \r\n\tAir Control Techniques, P.C. has developed a photochemical technique for the destruction of dioxin-furans; however, more work is needed to confirm the effectiveness of this control approach.  During this SBIR Phase I research, Air Control Techniques, P.C. will perform computer kinetic modeling and pilot plant testing at two industrial facilities.  The results of this research work will allow Air Control Techniques, P.C. to determine the energy requirements, operating costs, and dioxin-furan destruction efficiency of the photochemical technique.\r\n\tThe broader impact of this research will be to prevent exposure of the public to toxic dioxin-furans and provide an economical means for industrial facilities to achieve stringent dioxin-furan emission limitations.  Air Control Techniques, P.C believes that photochemical treatment for dioxin-furans will simultaneously reduce emissions of other contaminants such as formaldehyde and ammonia also present in the effluent gas streams of industrial furnaces and kilns.\r\n",
