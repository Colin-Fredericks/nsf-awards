 "awd_abstract_narration": "0609791\r\nDuffy\r\nHydrologic Observatory: The Susquehanna River Basin (SRB) is the largest tributary\r\nto the Chesapeake Bay. Without this flow the estuary could not sustain its extraordinary\r\ndiversity and productivity of aquatic life. The dilemma of our water-resource legacy is to balance\r\nthe competing societal and environmental needs placed on the Susquehanna's freshwater\r\nresources. In 2002, Penn State took the leadership role in forming a consortium of scientists,\r\npolicy makers, and stakeholders drawn from 30 universities as well as from federal and state\r\nagencies to design and implement the Susquehanna River Basin Hydrologic Observing System\r\n(SRBHOS) (www.srbhos.psu.edu). SRBHOS has been initiated to address \"How do humans\r\nand climate impact the sustainability of the water resources within large river basins? What role\r\ndo large rivers play in the global climate system?\".\r\nOverview of Research: This proposed research plan will advance the SRBHOS\r\nscience agenda by investigating the three research themes: (1) Assessment of the significance\r\nof the regional water table, its role as a lower boundary condition to soil moisture, and the\r\nimpact of water table status on hydrologic extremes (floods, droughts). We propose to develop\r\nthe concept of a subsurface boundary layer (SBL), which we define as the depth beneath the\r\nland surface for which the local atmosphere and land-surface processes will affect the local flow\r\nof groundwater to streams. An algorithm will be developed to map the SBL using the SRBHOS\r\ndigital data. (2) Integrated models that include vegetation water and energy dynamics will\r\nimprove hydrologic forecasts at the basin-scale and are critical to resolving the relative\r\nimportance of recharge to the shallow groundwater table and transpiration of soil moisture (3)\r\nMacropores have a significant affect on the hydroclimatic performance of watersheds during\r\nwet and dry cycles. We intend to develop new parameterization strategies to correct the\r\nregional soils database for macropore flow based on the Shale Hills testbed. Currently soil\r\nclassification only considers \"matrix\" properties (conductivity and water holding capacity).\r\nFinally, this research will attempt to demonstrate how a unification of modeling, existing digital\r\ndata, and new data collection strategies will advance our understanding of river basin water\r\nresources and support the design of hydrologic observatories.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The present proposal will unify early SRBHOS science efforts and\r\naddress how a physical model and a-priori data can be used to promote scientific collaborations\r\nthat: (1) will aid the SRBHOS community in formulating hypotheses and potential scenarios for\r\nhydrologic change within the basin; (2) will promote the development of new data-driven\r\nalgorithms that enhance our ability to represent and predict water cycle dynamics; and (3) that\r\nwill support a scientifically-based design for the future observatory's sensor network. Addressing\r\nthese issues will aid SRBHOS scientists in assessing climate and human feedbacks across\r\nmultiple scales as well as physiographical and ecological conditions. The tools developed in\r\nthis research will contribute to improving our understanding of the roles of terrain, ecology, and\r\ngeology in partitioning water and energy across the complex environmental systems that make\r\nup the SRB.\r\nBroader Impacts: This proposed research will be disseminated broadly to the\r\nacademic, state, and federal SRBHOS partners through a Susquehanna Data and Modeling\r\nSymposium, which will be organized by the PIs in conjunction with the Chesapeake Research\r\nConsortium. Funds requested in this proposal for the symposium will be leveraged with others\r\nsources of funding to maximize our ability to invite national leaders in river basin modeling and\r\ndata systems to review the proposed tools developed in this research as well as contribute their\r\nown expertise and tools to the SRBHOS community modeling effort. All software and data\r\nresources developed in this project are dedicated to the \"open source\" framework and shared\r\nthrough the Chesapeake Community Modeling Program. Additionally, this research effort will\r\nexploit basin-wide collaborations such as the currently pending Susquehanna REU to promote\r\nundergraduate education and to recruit demographically and geographically diverse students\r\ncurrently underrepresented in hydrologic science.",
