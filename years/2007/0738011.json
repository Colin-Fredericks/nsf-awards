 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to support twenty graduate students from the U.S. to attend Stony Brook Modeling Week to be held at the State University of New York at Stony Brook during the week of June 2-6, 2008.  During the Stony Brook Modeling Week, two prestigious symposia will be held consecutively, namely, the annual ACM Solid and Physical Modeling Symposium and the annual IEEE International Conference on Shape Modeling and Applications. In addition, a one day workshop entitled New Research Frontiers in Shape, Solid, and Physical Modeling will be held. Students selected for support from this grant will be given the opportunity to attend the entire week of conferences.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will be to expose selected graduate students to current international research in the area of shape, solid, and physical modeling. Graduate students supported by this grant will have a superb opportunity to interact with internationally renowned experts, gain knowledge from various presentations, access engineering design industry, and network with people from academia and industry towards better career placement. This project will lead to significant impacts in both research and education for our nation's graduate program, especially in engineering and computational curricula. \r\n",
