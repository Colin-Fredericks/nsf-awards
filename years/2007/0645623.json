 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Shigeru Amemiya of the University of Pittsburgh has received a CAREER Award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to develop voltammetric ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) for biological polyions and other redox-inactive ions, which are ubiquitous and important in biological and environmental media. Double polymer membranes based on an ion-selective polymer and a conjugated conducting polymer will be created on a solid electrode. A current response will be controlled by ion transfer at the interface between the ion-selective membrane and the aqueous sample solution. The conducting polymer will serve as an intermediate layer to efficiently mediate charge transport between the ionically conductive membrane and the electronically conductive solid support. The ionic current response will be idealistic for monitoring biomedically important polyions such as anticoagulant/antithrombotic heparin and its antidote protamine in their narrow and low therapeutic concentration ranges. The chemical basis of selectivity, detection limit, and biocompatibility in these solid-supported voltammetric ISEs will be explored, as well as strategies for miniaturization and incorporation into microfluidic devices. The PI will integrate research and teaching programs by directly implementing research outcomes into teaching curricula. Voltammetric ISEs will be developed also as a shared educational tool to address the emerging environmental problem of perchlorate contamination in undergraduate laboratory. The PI will introduce COMSOL Multiphysics as a powerful simulation tool to enhance students' ability to understand computationally intense problems in chemistry.\r\n\r\nInformation obtained from the research will enhance our knowledge and understanding in the areas of chemical sensors, electrochemistry, molecular recognition, and polymer chemistry. The voltammetric ISEs have potential for wide use in biomedical, biological, and environmental analyses. The PI will take advantage of the interdisciplinary approach to widen research participation of undergraduates, women, and underrepresented minorities.\r\n",
