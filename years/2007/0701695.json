 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIntellectual Merit:  There are a number of potentially important applications that require electromagnetic energy in the terahertz region of the radio spectrum. These include very short range highly secure telecommunications and the subcutaneous imaging of skin cells. The terahertz region has been difficult to access  it is well above the range of transistors and well below that of lasers. One method for obtaining terahertz emission is to mix (heterodyne) two laser beams together in a photomixer. While this has been demonstrated with discrete lasers and bulk optical components in a laboratory, practical applications require a simple, compact, and robust source. The objective of this program is a terahertz frequency generator chip. The investigators will implement on a single substrate two tunable diode lasers, a photomixer, and a THz radiating element. The intellectual merit of this program includes development of a particularly useful optoelectronic integrated circuit for terahertz generation. This program also provides for a new collaborative research effort involving a senior professor, with experience in photonic devices, and a new young professor and her students, with experience in novel epitaxial growth processes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This research will benefit several facets of contemporary life and provide infrastructure for impacting the information age, future health care, and homeland security. In addition, it will provide inspiration and training for the next generation of scientists and engineers, particularly undergraduate students, who will be involved in day-to-day research along with a graduate student mentor. The participation of underrepresented groups will be enhanced by bringing optical materials science to younger people with a program to \"teach the teacher.\" A K-12 teacher will be involved in this program each year allowing them to learn first hand about research and these technologies. Their students will benefit from the inspiration of those who are already their role models.\r\n\r\n",
