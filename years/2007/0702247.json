Under the guidance of a Tribal College Steering Committee, the project provides one-on-one technical assistance to nine Tribal Colleges and develops an Environmental Fellows Institute for tribal college faculty, as well as for a limited number of high schools and 4-year colleges that have articulation agreements with Tribal Colleges. Additional deliverables include an expanded Best Practices Guidebook for environmental technology programs and online resources. Project outcomes are being disseminated to all 34 Tribal Colleges, as well as the 1,200 members of the American Association of Community Colleges. This project serves Tribal Colleges across the nation by making their environmental science and technology programs reflect the beliefs and contributions of Native people.",
