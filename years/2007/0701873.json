The most central questions for the\r\nproject are: uniqueness of best approximation by harmonic\r\nfunctions in the supremum norm in dimensions three and higher\r\n(the two-dimensional case has been recently settled by the PI\r\nand H.S.Shapiro), sharp estimates relating to multidimensional\r\nanalogs of H. Bohr's phenomenon for power series, counting\r\nzeros of complex-valued harmonic polynomials, Agler-Cole-Wermer\r\ninterpretation of Ando's theorem in C^2 and, finally,\r\nunderstanding the spectral picture of the celebrated double\r\nlayer potential operator -a topic going back to the pioneering\r\nwork of I. Fredholm.\r\n\r\nMost of the questions in the project are rather simply stated\r\nand, accordingly, will attract a fair number of graduate\r\nstudents and young researchers. The problems are also open-ended\r\nand suggest several new paths of investigation in these\r\nclassical areas away from the well traveled tracks. The\r\ninvestigations undertaken in the project have well-defined\r\napplications to Mathematical Physics (Potential Theory),\r\nApplied Mathematics (polynomials, special functions) and\r\nNumerical Analysis (explicit solutions of some of the most\r\nimportant boundary value problems). The project entails\r\nactive involvement of undergraduate and graduate students at\r\nall stages of the project and, via local network of workshops\r\nand seminars for teachers, to disseminate some of the more\r\nelementary off-beats of the proposed work among high school\r\nstudents interested in science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
