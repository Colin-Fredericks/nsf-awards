As this occurs, there is an increased likelihood of inbreeding (mating between relatives).  Recent research suggests that inbreeding may reduce the capability of animals' immune systems to fight disease.  This area is not well studied, but the possibility is worrisome given new diseases such as West Nile virus and avian influenza.  If inbreeding does lead to weakened immune systems, wildlife managers will need to be especially careful to protect inbred populations from exposure to new diseases.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will test whether inbred animals have weak immune systems, studying a seabird population in which previous work has shown variation in inbreeding and variation in immune response. The project will develop an improved genetic marker for measuring inbreeding and will use field- and lab-based assays to measure individuals' immune response.  \r\n\r\nA lasting benefit of the project is that the principle investigator will receive training in a new genetic technique which will have applications in future research and in undergraduate teaching, including a new undergraduate-centered collaborative project on the conservation genetics of frogs and salamanders.  The project will also have broad impacts in science education, through a combination of partnering with public high schools and integrating research with undergraduate teaching, to better train future citizens and future scientists.\r\n\r\n",
