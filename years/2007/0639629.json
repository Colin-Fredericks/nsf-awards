 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pascagoula School District in southern Mississippi is partnering with the National Audubon Society (Audubon Mississippi), Chevron-Texaco, Mississippi Naturalists, NASA and the University of Southern Mississippi to extend its existing science curriculum by involving 135 students and 9 teachers from three middle schools in grades 6-8 in out-of-school time scientific investigations of local coastal wetlands.  Approximately 50 percent of the students in the district are students of color and/or economically disadvantaged.  Project goals are to (1) increase students' understanding, appreciation, attraction and interest in STEM fields and prepare them for high school course work and post-secondary study in science, math and engineering; (2) improve teachers' \"content knowledge and pedagogical skills through collaborative experimentation and rich industrial and academic experiences with researchers in STEM fields;\" and (3) \"establish a sustainable and replicable model for development and implementation of an integrated in- and out-of-school curricular program.\"  The project is conducting research on the impact of the program on student and teacher learning and attitudes, parental involvement and partnership development.",

Based on quantitative and qualitative data, Project WetKids has significantly impacted these under privileged students\u00c6 understanding, appreciation, attraction, and interest in the science, engineering, and mathematics fields.  Further, and perhaps most important, it is expected that the long-term effects of this program will raise the proportion of students (minority included) entering advanced secondary science course work and consequently impact plans for pursuit of postsecondary study in the areas of chemistry, engineering, environmental sciences, mathematics, physics..."
