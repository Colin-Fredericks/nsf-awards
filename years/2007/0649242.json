 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will offer 8 week REU programs at the University of Georgia for two groups of 6-8 students during the summers of 2007, 2008, and 2009. Each group of students will work with a faculty mentor and graduate student during the summer. In addition, another faculty member will be available to work with students who need additional background material. The program will continue during the academic year with 5 students involved in undergraduate/graduate \"Vertical Research Groups\". Research topics will be selected from the expertise of the faculty of the University of Georgia, and will include continuing research projects in algebra and geometric knot theory. The program is anticipated to include an RET component. The objectives of the program are to provide undergraduate students with research experience, to encourage them to attend graduate school, and to prepare them to be successful in graduate study.\r\n\r\nThis REU/RET project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
