 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Michael Freeling (UC Berkeley)\r\nKey personnel:  Brian C. Thomas (UC Berkeley)\r\n\r\nThis is a Genome-Enabled Plant Research project that will provide databases of regulatory DNA sequences, mapping tools and software needed by the plant breeding and research community. The primary biological research activity is to align each gene in sorghum with its orthologous gene in rice, evaluate exon annotations, and then define and store those noncoding sequences that have been conserved over evolutionary time, called \"CNSs\".   These sequences are expected to comprise DNA sites that bind proteins and small RNAs that regulate gene availability or expression. When CNS discovery is complete, the plant community should have approximately 170,000 short (mean= 31 bps long) CNSs representing functional (conserved) noncoding regions sorted to particular genes. Noncoding sequences between CNSs that are not conserved will be used as control sequences. Many previously unknown functions will be discovered.  CNSs will be associated with motifs, expression patterns, methylation status and the like, with results displayed on the project web site (http://synteny.cnr.berkeley.edu/) and available to the community through a DAS server and PlantGDB.  Both the plant research community and this project need a comparative genomics software application that will compare - using static and on-the-fly procedures - any chromosomal region with any other from any plant. This project includes the design and description of this new software system, called CoGe. All results, databases, applications and code will be publicly available on this project's website, and in journal and community websites (http://sourceforge.net; http://plantgdb.org.\r\n\r\nThis project has broader impacts. The sorghum-rice CNS-discovery project generates pan-grass mapping markers.  Grasses without sequence databases, orphan grass commodities exemplified by foxtail millet, should benefit most directly. At least one graduate student and several undergraduate researchers are essential participants in this research.  This project includes summer internships for Bay Area high school students who are talented, underserved, and recommended to us by their biology teachers.",
