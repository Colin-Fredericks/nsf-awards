 "awd_abstract_narration": "The creative digital media exhibition Speculative Data and the Creative Imaginary:\r\nshared innovative visions between art and technology will be held at the National\r\nAcademy of Sciences Gallery in Washington D.C., June 3 to August 24, 2007, as part of\r\nthe program for the Association for Computer Machinery (ACM) Creativity and Cognition\r\nConference, to be held June 13 to 15, 2007 in Washington D.C.. The exhibition will be\r\nopen for almost 3 months and in the summer, allowing ample time for adult, children,\r\nand tourist visitors to view and interact with the exhibits. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit in this exhibition lies in the collection and dissemination of digital\r\nmedia projects that illustrate premises that information technology (IT) is forming a\r\npowerful alliance with creative practices in the arts and design to establish the exciting\r\nnew domain of information technology and creative practices (ITCP)set\r\nforth in the 2003 National Research Council experts meeting and report Beyond\r\nproductivity: Information Technology, Innovation and Creativity and the Rockefeller\r\nFoundation report New Media Arts | New Funding Models, (Mitchell, Inouye, and\r\nBlumenthal, 2003; Jennings, 2000) Creative digital media works to be presented\r\ndemonstrate the contemporary practice of the merging of the creative practitioner and\r\nthe engineer - sometimes as a single person and other times as interdisciplinary teams\r\nthat exhibition participant Donna Cox, Director of Visualization from the National Center\r\nof Supercomputing Application, calls renaissance teams. The term renaissance team is\r\ndescriptive of the CISE CreativeIT focus in supporting research that is done with groups\r\nof people from different backgrounds in which the creative synergy is focused on a\r\nspecific context, problem, or perceived need resulting in new products, models, and\r\nareas of research that transcend discipline specific methods of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this exhibition is in having the exhibits available in a public space\r\nfor children and adults to visit and interact with.\r\n\r\n",
