 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central question studied in theoretical computer science is: how efficiently (fast) can computational problems be solved?While many problems do have efficient algorithms, there is a wide  class of important problems (called NP-complete problems) which  are very unlikely to have efficient algorithms. In practice however,  it may suffice to solve these problems approximately. This research  investigates whether approximate solutions to NP-complete problems  can be found efficiently, and how good is the quality of approximation.\r\n The main contribution of this research is negative results, i.e. proving that for certain NP-complete problems, efficiently finding  even approximate solutions is very unlikely. To illustrate the  significance of proving such negative results, the investigator  proves that it is unlikely to break into a certain cryptosystem,  giving a guarantee of its security against malicious attacks. Another related aspect of this research is Proababilistically Checkable  Proofs, a method to specify proof formats for mathematical statements,  such that the validity of the proof can be checked very efficiently,  by looking at only a few places in the proof instead of reading  the entire proof. The research has a potential for broader impact  in terms of scientific workshops, collaboration between several  international researchers, developement of graduate courses, promoting  undergraduate research, and advising Ph.D. students.\r\n\r\n Many computational problems arising in theory and practice  are NP-complete. An extensively studied approach to cope with  NP-completeness is designing polynomial time algorithms that  compute approximately optimal solutions. However, it turns out  that for many problems, computing approximate solutions itself  is an NP-complete problem, a famous result known as the PCP Theorem,  discovered in 1992. In spite of the tremendous body of research  that followed this discovery, for many NP-complete problems,  there is a gap between the best known approximation result, and  the best known inapproximability result. This research focusses  on filling this gap by proving tight inapproximability results.\r\n The PCP Theorem can also be viewed as a result about proof checking  (and that is how it was discovered). It gives a way of specifying  proofs for NP-statements such that the validity of the proof can be  checked very efficiently. The research investigates constructions  of more efficient PCPs, with further applications to inapproximability  results. The techniques developed are likely to have new applications  to areas like metric embeddings and learning theory. The research  has a potential for broader impact in terms of scientific workshops,  collaboration between international researchers, developement of  graduate courses, promoting undergraduate research and advising Ph.D.\r\n students.\r\n",
