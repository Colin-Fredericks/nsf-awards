 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is the development of a novel framework for the design of a broad range of nanoengineered materials and devices. As macroscopic modeling and analysis methods are inaccurate, and existing nanoscale approaches are inadequate for design purposes, a new modeling approach based on kinetic theory will be explored. Computational analysis methods will be developed for predicting the performance of the nanostructures and their sensitivity with respect to design and uncertainty parameters. A stochastic formulation of the analysis and design problems will account for uncertainties due to imperfections of manufacturing techniques. A level-set based topology optimization approach will facilitate finding non-intuitive design solutions. To provide appropriate focus, this project will examine submicron thermal transport design problems. Enhanced by industry collaboration, two important technological drivers will be considered: (a) the design of novel thermoelectric materials for energy harvesting and conversion, and (b) the design of optimal thermal management systems for next-generation 3-D microchips. The technological significance of these drivers, coupled with the fact that nanoscale thermal transport differs significantly from macroscopic conduction, renders these problems excellent test beds.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research project will increase the ability to design, manipulate, and realize materials and devices at nanometer scales leading to advances across a wide spectrum of technologies. The proposed design framework will foster a push-pull interaction between scientists and engineers that will enable the rapid transfer of new scientific insight into novel engineering designs and products. In particular, the proposed design approach and computational tools will enable the development of novel energy-harvesting materials and optimal thermal management concepts for next-generation microchips. Introducing the proposed design methods into the curriculum will enhance the education of a new generation of engineers who will be able to translate fundamental scientific understanding into engineering design at nanoscale.\r\n",
