 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chalcidoidea are a megadiverse group of minute insects containing an estimated 500,000 species worldwide.  Most target species are less than 2 mm. long!  Researchers at the University of California, Riverside, and Texas A&M University will focus on training new researchers in both morphological and molecular methods for recognition of new species, and understanding phylogenetic relationships, through a series of worldwide monographic studies of five groups of related wasps. The research will emphasize novel electronic tools and resources for manipulation, sharing, and storage of taxonomic and host data, and development of new methods for electronic communication between collaborating laboratories worldwide.\r\n\r\nChalcidoidea are one of the most important groups for the natural or directed control of arthropod pest populations. Many of the target taxa are effective natural enemies of insect pests and they are widely used in agriculture and forestry for their control. Effective use of parasitoids in natural or manipulative biological control depends on a mature and sophisticated species-level taxonomy. Chalcidoidea also form a substantial, important, and under-appreciated component of terrestrial ecosystems. The electronic and monographic products of this research will be of great benefit to systematists, agricultural scientists, and all those that wish to understand and conserve terrestrial biodiversity.",
