 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site will support students recruited primarily from nine cooperating Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  Research will focus on materials science and nanomaterials.  The project includes a Research Experiences for Teachers component (two secondary science teachers per year) and an ethics component.  This REU Site is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  \r\nBy recruiting at HBCUs, the project will involve students from underrepresented groups, who are attending a primarily undergraduate institution with limited research opportunities. Enrichment activities such as ... will complement the research activities and provide important training on research related topics.  Participating teachers will work in research labs alongside undergraduate students and will participate in enrichment programs.  Teachers will attend a graduate course training them to incorporate research concepts into their teaching.  Following summer participation, teachers will introduce into their classrooms at least one new nanoscale science or materials science teaching module.  All participants will present an end of summer poster on their research.\r\n",
