A 2006 ITW will be held at the Chengdu International Exhibition\r\nand Convention Center, Chengdu, China, October 22 - 26, 2006,\r\nhttp://sist.swjtu.edu.cn/imc/itw06/.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests support for the travel expenses of junior participants from the U.\r\nS., such as graduate students, research associates, and new faculty hires. These\r\nparticipants will be individuals whose papers have been selected for presentation at the\r\nworkshop, but who lack funds and would not be able to attend without travel support. ITW\r\nhas a strong tradition of junior participation that has helped it to maintain its\r\nreputation as a leading forum for new ideas. It is proposed that the two U. S.-based\r\nco-chairs of the symposium, Shu Lin and Daniel Costello, make the awards. The total\r\namount requested is $15,000; this is based on 15 awards (averaging $1,000 apiece).\r\n\r\n",
