 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  goal of  this proposal  is to  study the  development of  new and\r\nefficient class  of parallel guaranteed  quality and three-dimensional\r\n(3D) mesh generation methods for real-time finite element computations\r\non  current  and emerging  parallel  architectures.  Specifically,  we\r\nwill:  (1) generalize  the point  insertion theory  for  3D guaranteed\r\nquality Delaunay  mesh generation, (2) develop  a parallel theoretical\r\nframework that  can deploy this method with  limited additional effort\r\nfrom sequential  to multicore/multithreaded processors  and eventually\r\non  clusters  of  multiprocessor  nodes  with  multicore/multithreaded\r\nprocessors, (3)  perform complexity analysis using  the practical LogP\r\nmodel and (4) finally implement  the first ever 3D parallel guaranteed\r\nquality mesh  generation method using  existing state-of-the-art fully\r\nfunctional  sequential software  and  the parallel  framework we  will\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\nThe  intellectual merit of  this proposal  is to  derive an  entire 3D\r\nregion inside  the circumscribed sphere, for the  selection of Steiner\r\npoint  insertion.  The novelty  of the  approach is  that we  have the\r\nflexibility to use many new  positions for point insertion of Delaunay\r\nmethods rather  than one  or two  choices were used  in the  past; the\r\nadditional   choices  create  more   opportunities  to   improve  size\r\noptimality  along with  other  application-centric criteria  (multiple\r\ntissues/materials).   In addition,  for the  first time  ever,  we can\r\nachieve code re-use for 3D  geometries.  The project will have broader\r\nimpact   on  several  scientific   computing  and engineering communities   \r\nlike  mesh generation and bioengineering.\r\n",
