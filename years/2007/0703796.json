 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this effort is to enhance geoscience literacy and appreciation of the relevance of the geosciences to society in the Hispanic community, and to develop interest in geoscience careers among youth and their parents in this population.  A community-based approach will engage 120 bilingual K-12 educators, and through their existing school-based infrastructures, thousands of students and hundreds of parents, in a unique partnership with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Office of Education and Outreach.  Project collaborators also include the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado MESA program, and Univision Colorado.  The program's objectives are to provide high-quality geoscience professional development to bilingual K-12 science educators, build collaborations among diverse organizations, increase awareness of the geosciences among parents and students, and identify strategies to sustain the partnership. Activities include a Bilingual Science Teachers Annual Resources Symposium in Fall 2007, Parent Nights, on-going online professional development, Winter and Spring day-long professional development extension workshops, and a Family Geoscience Fair in Spring 2008, as well as televised outreach through Univision Colorado. Activities will access NCAR's geoscience research content and diverse scientists who can serve as science career role models. Bilingual education resources will be disseminated locally and nationally through UCAR's Windows to the Universe web site.  CDE will encourage state-wide adoption of successful bilingual science education methodologies. Univision's national networks will broadcast aspects of this effort that will further interest the Hispanic community in science education.",
