The Doctoral Consortium aims to: (1) provide a setting for feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future research directions; (2) develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research; (3) support a new generation of researchers; and (4) contribute to the conference through interaction with other researchers at the conference. The Doctoral Consortium strives to recruit and include students from underrepresented groups (e.g., women and underrepresented minorities) and smaller schools or schools with less established programs in artificial intelligence. Each student will give a 25-minute presentation to be followed by 20 minutes of discussion guided by a faculty participant; there were also be a one-on-one meeting with the faculty mentor. There will also be opportunities to discuss career issues in both academic and other career pathways. A report on the Consortium will be published in the AI Magazine.\r\n",
