 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0709497\r\nLee\r\n\r\nThis project will carry out a deep blind survey for galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE), using the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope and a 320-element superconducting bolometer array.  This involves a close collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy (MPIfR, Bonn, Germany).  A high-quality catalog of SZE-selected clusters over a broad range of redshifts will provide deep insight into structure formation, high accuracy measurements of cosmological parameters, and a characterization of the dark energy equation of state.  This dark energy measurement is complementary in parameter degeneracies to other types, such as those using supernovae.  SZE surveys are expected to have a cleaner selection function that extends to higher redshift than optical and X-ray techniques.  Hundreds of galaxy clusters will be detected, with as many as one hundred at redshift one or greater.\r\n\r\nAPEX is a fully operational 12-meter diameter on-axis Cassegrain telescope sited at 16,700 ft on the Chajnantor plateau in Chile.  It was built by a consortium of the MPIfR, the European Southern Observatory (ESO), and the Swedish Onsala Space Observatory.  The SZE survey will use at least one month of telescope time per year, and this allotment may increase.  The receiver has had a successful engineering run and been upgraded to the observational configuration.  This program leverages the substantial investments in receiver development and deployment, in superconducting transition edge sensors (TES), and in construction and operation of the telescope, by NSF and by the various national and international partners.\r\n\r\nThe planned calibration of the mass to SZE flux relation by APEX in an early emphasis project will be critical for interpreting the large cluster samples expected from future surveys by other telescopes.  This will be carried out using multi-wavelength data from a variety of experiments all looking at the same patch of sky, and comparing the SZE data against measurements using optical weak lensing, optical galaxy counts, X-ray flux, and velocity dispersions.  The work will cement relations across a strong international team.  In addition, the detector development work has widespread implications for astronomy, other physics communities, and homeland security.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to advance our understanding of cosmology by the study of clusters of galaxies.  Galaxy clusters are collections of tens to hundreds of galaxies that are loosely bound together by gravity.  They are the largest bound objects formed in the Universe.  Therefore, we study them to learn about the history of structure formation and also about the fundamental cosmological parameters of the Universe such as the overall density of ordinary and Dark Matter and the behaviorof the mysterious Dark Energy.  \n\n\nIn addition to the galaxies, galaxy clusters contain a diffuse ionized hydrogen plasma which has been heated to more than ten million degrees Kelvin by the gravitational energy that was dissipated as the galaxies collected together.  The free electrons in this plasma scatter the photons of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation, the leftover 2.7 Kradiation from the Big Bang.  This scattering gives increased energy to the photons and they shift out of the range of sensitivityof our instrument creating a dark spot on the CMB sky at the location of a galaxy cluster.  This phenomenon is known as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovicheffect after the two Russian scientists who predicted it. \n\n\nIn earlier work, our group built a novel camera that is sensitive to radio waves at 150 GHz (2 mm wavelength).   The camera has 320 pixels cooled to 1/4 degree Kelvin above absolute zero temperature to obtain low thermal noise and high sensitivity.   This camerawas installed in the 12-meter diameter Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope at 16,800 ft altitude in Chile.  During the periodof this grant, we used the camera to complete survey of about 50 known galaxy clusters.  Due to its high sensitivity and good angular resolutionresolution, we were able to improve on previous galaxy cluster imaging especially in the area of the outer regions of the galaxy clusters.  \n\n\nWe made a high resolution map of the famous \"bullet\" galaxy cluster which is really a merger of two clusters.  The cluster shows theseparation of Dark Matter and the hydrogen plasma due to the collision giving some of the best evidence that Dark Matter exists.  Our mapconfirms the location of the hydrogen plasma as separated from the Dark Matter.  In other clusters, we were able to measure the distributionof mass inside the cluster and the temperature and entropy variation inside the cluster.  This information is very valuable as input to models of how galaxyclusters formed.\n\nFinally, we have used our survey of galaxy clusters to improve our knowledge of the relationship between the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signalat 150 GHz and the mass of the galaxy cluster by comparing our Sunyaev-Zel'dovich mass estimate with those from  X-ray data.   Understanding thisrelationship is the key to using galaxy cluster surveys to understand cosmology since the comparison of the measurements with cosmological modelsdepend very strongly on the accuracy of the inferred masses.  In the future, our data can also be combined with mass estimates from gravitational lensing to further improve the accuracy of the this galaxy cluster mass to Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal calibration.  Our measurements will help interpret the data from future larger galaxy cluster surveys which have the potential to greatly improve our understanding of how structure formed in the Universe and nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/18/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adrian T Lee"
