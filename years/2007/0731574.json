This Symposium will assemble scientists and engineers working in the fields related to radiative transfer at one venue for the purpose of technical exchange, identification of the state-of-the-art, and the projection of future needs and trends.  Increasingly, radiative transport influences directly the processing of many high technology materials and the assembly and fabrication of parts at all scales from silicon chips to steel girders.  Papers covering the diverse and contemporary research areas of remote sensing, laser-tissue interaction, in situ characterization of pollutants or aerosols, interaction of radiation with thin films, nano-scale transport phenomena, and others have been received.  Such breadth requires interaction across traditional disciplines, and as with past Symposia, this venue will bring together scientists and engineers from what were previously relatively non-communicating disciplines.  In short, the objective of the Radiation Transfer Symposia has been the cross-fertilization of ideas among the various industries and applications, accelerating progress in all areas.  \r\n\tThis proposal requests funds to partially support five emerging scientists for participation in the Symposium.  The emphasis will be on PhD students.  Supporting travel for emerging scientists to participate in such an interdisciplinary meeting early in their careers has the potential to propel their professional directions toward broader communication among related disciplines. \r\n\tThe impact of the Symposium is reflected in the novel interaction of scientists cutting across traditional disciplinary boundaries.  Further, the event will facilitate training of the next generation of radiation specialists who will tackle problems not yet conceived.  Finally, it is the objective under the proposed NSF support to broaden participation by under-represented groups in the discipline.  So far, one female PhD student has been identified for travel support, and others are being solicited.  The meeting will provide opportunity for close interaction between these new players from diverse technical backgrounds and established radiative transfer engineers.  Sponsoring a symposium with an international flavor is also critical. There are certain research areas which flourish in some countries more than in others. It is not always possible for US-based young researchers to be exposed to such a broad-based representation of radiative transfer problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
