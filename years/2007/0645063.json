The liquid-jet atomization process takes place in two major steps. Primary atomization occurs when oscillations in the jet are amplified under favorable conditions, causing the body of the jet to break up into drops. Secondary atomization occurs if the initial drops exceed a critical size, and it results in continued disintegration of drops until a sufficiently small size is reached. The break-up behavior, associated aerodynamics, and location of the initial drops is critical in determining the dispersion and disintegration characteristics of the resulting spray; however, limited quantitative droplet formation data is available because of diagnostic difficulties with interrogating the dense spray in this region.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on the science of atomization and sprays at the stage of primary atomization where a liquid jet first breaks into drops.  The breakup will be studied by multiple laser diagnostic techniques and by modeling, which in turn will be compared to data from commercial liquid injectors. This is a challenging and widely important problem, accompanied by a measure of risk but going directly to the key issue of determining droplet size distribution and its source.  Furthermore, the research will aid successful development of scientific and design models by providing both fundamental insights and a comprehensive database for testing.\r\n\r\nBroad Impacts: A key aspect of the CAREER grant is to create substantial societal impact through its education plan.  The awardee's proposed middle-school \"Saturday Science Laboratory\" has the potential to capture the interest of students at a key moment when they are open to the possibility and reality of using science.  The University of Maryland College Park is well situated to reach a large and diverse population of students and their instructors as well.  By particular outreach to underrepresented minorities, the award recipient intends to increase their potential for becoming scientists and engineers. \r\n",
