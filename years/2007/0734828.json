The purpose of this proposed Symposium is to gather approximately 100 leaders, researchers, and developers from academia, industry, and government for concept discussions and technical exchanges on emerging ideas and critical issues related to the NSF Cyber-Enabled Discover and Initiatives (CDI). It is anticipated that the Symposium program will consist of an exciting mix of invited keynote talks, technical paper presentations, panels, poster sessions, and a PhD. student forum. The proposed symposium is expected to have a broad impact on the computing research community, and will help energize the community to focus its research and development issues related to cyber-enabled discoveries and innovations, thereby improving the nation''s R&D productivity and increasing competitiveness.",
