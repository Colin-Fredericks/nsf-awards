 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past decade, wireless networks have undergone a remarkable evolution from primitive circuit-switched links to multiuser packet-switched networks with increasing levels of cooperation and sophistication. In the coming decade, a primary impediment to their further evolution is the lack of a descriptive theory for networks with interdependent links, most notably ad hoc and mesh networks. This problem has proven to be a daunting task due to (i) the dimensionality of the capacity region due to the node interactions, and (ii) the competing constraints of throughput, delay, energy efficiency, and connectivity.  Without discounting the significant progress that has been made, the lack of crisp results has handicapped the system design of ad hoc, mesh, and sensor networks, and therefore impeded their development and commercialization. \r\n\r\nThis research involves the development of a descriptive capacity theory for ad hoc networks that should be capable of the following:  (1) Accurate characterization of the effects from physical parameters and advanced radio technologies, (2) accurately accounting of the spatial interactions between the transmitters and receivers in the network, and  (3) providing a useful abstraction of the lower \"layers\".  This is accomplished using a novel approach based on stochastic geometry (motivated by information theory) that we term the transmission capacity.  The key theoretical milestones for this research are (i) substantial contributions in the application of stochastic geometry, random matrix theory, and information theory to ad hoc and hierarchical wireless networks, (ii) a useful theory that can be used to characterize the effect of any conceivable technology or scheme on ad hoc network capacity, and (iii) the derivation of specific results that will impact design principles of future wireless networking standards. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcomes for CAREER Award\n\n \n\nLarge wireless networks are notoriously difficult to model, analyze, design, and implement.  A major reason for this is that because they share the spectrum, the nodes (transmitters and receivers) all fundamentally interact through the interference they cause each other, and what one node does affects all the others. \n\n \n\nIn this project, we set out to develop a new descriptive theory and a set of tools for this problem, based on \"stochastic geometry\", which simply means we look at all the other nodes in the network as being randomly located according to some statistical distribution, and using properties of physics and that underlying node distribution, attempt to understand the key quantities governing the network performance.  In particular, we have tried to understand the \"transmission capacity\", a new metric we defined which tells us the number of successful transmissions (at some defined data rate and outage probability) that can be supported by the network in a unit area, for example a square mile.   Over the five years of the project, we have succeeded completely in this endeavor, developing not only a comprehensive body of work but arguably launching an entire new subfield of research.\n\n \n\nIn addition to our scholarly contributions, the results have now found their way into the modeling, analysis and design of commercial systems, namely cellular networks.  This was an unanticipated but particularly gratifying outcome from this research, and a great example of how NSF-sponsored basic research can wind up having many practical applications.  In particular, femtocells and other new types of small base stations (which are the dominant new deployment paradigm for cellular service providers) are located in a quite haphazard fashion which immediately makes the tools we have developed applicable.  Work resulting from this project include nearly all the most cited papers on femtocells, many of which have influenced industry a great deal.  In fact many of the citations to this work come from industry sources, who immediately recognized the importance and practicality of these random spatial models for the small cell application.  Further, the students trained on this project are now all out \"changing the world\", leading efforts on next-generation small cell architectures for major telecommunications companies like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and Nokia-Siemens (all in the USA).\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/04/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey G Andrews"
