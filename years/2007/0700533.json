 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports research by Buss and his graduate students on\r\ncomputational complexity, proof complexity, algorithms, and\r\nnumerical methods.  Buss investigates proof theory and proof\r\ncomplexity, especially aspects that are closely connected to open\r\nproblems in computational complexity including the P versus NP\r\nproblem.   The relevant proof systems include bounded arithmetics,\r\nwhich are first-order theories tailored to have logical strength\r\nrelated to feasible computability, and propositional proof systems,\r\nwhich have rich connections to bounded arithmetic and circuit\r\ncomplexity.  Buss will work to establish lower bounds on proof\r\ncomplexity based on complexity assumptions such as the existence of\r\nprovably secure cryptographic systems. He will work to prove new\r\nindependence results and separation results for weak proof systems.\r\nHe will investigate what kinds of computational content can be\r\nextracted from proofs. Buss will investigate the proof complexity of\r\npropositional systems such as Frege systems, cutting planes systems,\r\nNullstellensatz proof systems, counting axioms, the polynomial\r\ncalculus, and intuitionistic proof systems. Buss also works on\r\nnumerical and geometric algorithms arising from computer graphics.\r\nHe will work on simulation methods for rigid multibodies using\r\nhigher-order approximation methods over manifolds, on symplectic\r\nalgorithms and other energy-conserving algorithms for physical\r\nsimulations, and on collision response algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe project supports research by Buss and his students on problems\r\nthat le at the interface between mathematics and computer science,\r\nas motivated by open questions concerning the fundamental limits of\r\ncomputation. These open questions include the P versus NP problem,\r\nthe mathematical feasibility of secure cryptographic coding, and the\r\noptimality of particular algorithms and circuits for solving\r\ncombinatorial problems.  Busss addresses these questions by\r\ninvestigating computational complexity and proof complexity.  The\r\nproject studies questions about the tradeoffs between the strength\r\nof a formal proof system and the size of optimal proofs. Good bounds\r\non proof complexity are closely related to upper and lower bounds on\r\nthe hardness of computation, as well as to the mathematical\r\nunderpinnings of cryptography.  The project also supports Buss's\r\nwork on algorithms for simulation of dynamical systems\r\n",
