 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project investigates a novel concept and method to introduce intelligent word completion software based on ideas from the field of natural language processing and test its feasibility over multiple languages. This outcome of this research should enable the software to more accurately predict the intent of the user.  Data entry, broadly interpreted, is a ubiquitous task for all persons using electronic devices such as computers, handheld devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants, and special devices for the physically handicapped. \r\n\r\nThe software developed under this research project will add much value to ordinary users by increasing their productivity since the entry of data of all kinds, broadly construed, is very widespread. This software can also potentially benefit disabled persons whose need for such software is even greater than that of ordinary persons, as their disability makes data entry, a requirement for everyone in modern society, doubly difficult. It can also help other disadvantaged groups who may not be fully literate and may not be able to spell many words correctly and may yet have a need to create documents of various kinds. Beyond this, its use will add to our scientific understanding of the role of statistical intelligence in various natural language processing tasks and how it may be used to enhance performance of natural language software.\r\n",
