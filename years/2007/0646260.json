The Intellectual Merit of the symposium is that because it is focused on specific themes, the individual sessions in the symposium will together offer a synergistic picture of the transport behavior (electrical, thermal, mass), effects of unique microstructures, novel characterization and fabrication techniques of composites based on nano-scale inclusions in polymer matrices. For example, sessions focused on electrically conductive polymer composites will provide information about the influence of chemistry and microstructure on composite performance. This information will be valuable when designing polymer based EMI shielding, sensors, and/or electrostatic dissipation layers. Other sessions focused on thermal transport in polymer composites will provide information useful for creating special coatings with improved thermal conductivity for faster cooling of hot surfaces or making more efficient heat sinks for electronics. Sessions focused on mass transport will discuss gas barriers for packaging applications, heterogeneous fuel cell membranes and novel gas and liquid separation membranes. For example, it has been realized recently that interfacial phenomena in mixed matrix membranes play a key role in determining the membrane performance. No doubt, these effects are also crucial in other heterogeneous systems. In addition to sessions focused on experimental research, the symposium will also include sessions aimed at modeling of transport phenomena. For example, recent atomistic simulations have offered unique insights on transport in carbon nanotubes and propelled the development of novel carbon nanotube/polymer systems for separation applications.\r\n\r\nFrom a Broader Impacts perspective, top researchers in each of the areas just described will give invited talks that will act as anchors for each of the sessions. The invited talks will be followed by presentations that will couple to each other presenting a common theme. The ultimate goal of this symposium will be to capture the latest developments in the field of heterogeneous polymer materials research. It is hoped that given the strong interest from both the governmental, academic and industrial sectors, this symposium will be offered annually by MRS.\r\n\r\n",
