 "awd_abstract_narration": "The accelerated eutrophication of surface freshwater due to human activity is a well-documented, but complex and poorly understood phenomenon.  Freshwater eutrophication causes serious deterioration of ecosystem services and water quality worldwide and has been a persistent problem in central Wisconsin lakes since the late 1800's.  Increased amounts of limiting nutrients, especially phosphorus, are considered the primary trigger for accelerated eutrophication.  Microbes (primarily algae and bacteria) are thought to control the phosphorus cycle in lakes, yet a detailed understanding of the microbial participants driving this process is unknown.  In this proposal the researchers aim to identify the primary bacterial populations that are involved in phosphorus cycling within eutrophic Wisconsin lakes.  Identification of bacteria involved in both the uptake and breakdown of phosphorus containing compounds will aid in the identification of the mechanisms driving the phosphorus cycle in lakes and will lead to an improved ability to predict water quality in response to policy changes.",
