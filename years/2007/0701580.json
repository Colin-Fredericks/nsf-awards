 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Eisenbud will perform research on a number of\r\nareas in which algebraic geometry mixes with homological commutative\r\nalgebra. One of these is the study of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity\r\nof high powers of ideals. For an ideal in the homogeneous coordinate ring\r\nof a projective variety that is of finite colength and is generated by forms\r\nof a single degree, this \"assymptotic regularity\" is connected with the\r\nproperties of fibers of the corresponding map of varieties, and Eisenbud\r\nwill use this connection to investigate generic projections. A second\r\narea is the study of schemes that are 2-regular. This work builds on the classification\r\nfor reduced schemes that was recently completed by Eisenbud, Green, Hulek and\r\nPopescu. A third area has to do with the computation of higher direct images using\r\nexterior algebra methods. Eisenbud will study certain varieties that appear naturally\r\nin the deformation spaces of bundles in this way. All these areas are supported\r\nby computations based on Groebner basis methods. Eisenbud will collaborate\r\nwith Stillman and Grayson in the development of the Macaulay2 program, which\r\nis currently the best tool for computations in projective geometry. Finally, Eisenbud\r\nwill collaborate on a project with Diaconis, Holmes, and their students involving the\r\napplication of techniques in algebraic geometry to statistics.\r\n\r\nAn algebraic variety in complex n-space is a set defined by\r\nthe simultaneous vanishing of a collection of polynomial functions\r\nof n variables. Many of the important geometric objects that appear\r\nin mathematics can be defined this way. One way to study an algebraic\r\nvariety is to ask for the dimension of the vector space of polynomials\r\nof degree at most d that vanish on the variety, as a function of d. This\r\nis called the Hilbert function of the variety. David Hilbert showed how to\r\ncompute this function, and refine it, by computing something called a\r\nfree resolution of the variety. My work uses such free resolutions to study\r\nvarieties in many contexts. For example, if a variety of dimension n is embedded in\r\na vector space of dimension n+1,\r\nthen the variety is defined by just one equation, a relatively simple case.\r\nMost varieties of dimension n can not be embedded in this way, but any\r\nvariety of dimension n can be mapped linearly onto a variety of the\r\nsame dimension in an n+1 dimensional space. One of the questions I will\r\nstudy is the difference between the original variety and its image, for the\r\nbest possible embeddings.",
