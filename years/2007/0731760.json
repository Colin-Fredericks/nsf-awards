 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program  supports Professor Michl of the University of Colorado-Boulder in his work to examine the possibility that bulk materials with negative indices of refraction in the visible region could be prepared by chemical synthesis. Until now, such materials have only been prepared by lithographic techniques and operate at lower frequency regions of the spectrum. There has been much speculation concerning a chemical approach to nanoelectronics, but few actually performing materials. It is hoped that the proposed research will break new ground in contactless ultrahigh-frequency electronics anchored in bulk chemical synthesis of nano-scale active devices.\r\n\r\nThis research program is expected to have an impact in optics technology, and will also contribute to the interdisciplinary training of a post-doctoral fellow in areas ranging from organic synthesis to spectroscopy and other advanced physical measurements. Rich interactions among students and researchers in chemistry and physics are anticipated.",
