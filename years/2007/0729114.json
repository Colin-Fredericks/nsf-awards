 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated, collaborative project among the Ohio State University (OSU), Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and General Motors R&D (GM) will remove the principal obstacles to the adoption of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) for automotive application:  the inabilty to predict forming and springback and the identification of processing technologies to produce new materials with strength/ductility combinations superior to those available with current AHSS.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The project has three inter-related thrusts:\r\n1.\tProcess Development:  Formability and springback measurement and simulation of existing AHSS and candidate alloys and microstructures  devoloped in Thrust 2.\r\n2.\tMaterial Development:  Identification of new processing routes and microstructures upon which to base a 3rd generation of AHSS;  validation of application readiness with methodologies developed in Thrust 1.\r\n3.\tEducational Program:  Education of promising and diverse students in AHSS-related technical areas at undergraduate and graduate levels; incorporation of Thrust 1 and Thrust 2 technical results into existing curricula.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  Broader impacts in four principal areas are anticipated:  \r\n1.\tBenefits to Society: AHSS offer major improvement in automotive vehicle performance, cost, safety (personal security), energy savings, emissions, reliability, and durability.   Nonetheless, adoption is uncertain without fundamental understanding.\r\n2.\tLearning / Broadened Participation:  The technical research program will be integrated into existing and new educational activities at the two institutions \r\n3.\tDissemination of Results:  Project results will be widely disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and other avenues.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMaterials used in the manufacture of automobiles and other transportation vehicles continue to improve leading to the higher quality vehicles that are on the road today.  The property demands for materials used in automobiles continues to increase in order to meet future requirements for safer, more fuel efficient, longer lasting, and cost-effective products and steel remains as a primary material of choice.  This research project on advanced high strength sheet steels (AHSS) was a collaboration between researchers at the Colorado School of Mines, the Ohio State University, and General Motors, and was one of a group of projects funded at various universities participating in the NSF/DOE Steel Research Program coordinated by the American Iron and Steel Institute and the Auto/Steel Partnership (see http://www.autosteel.org).  To meet the critical challenge of fuel efficiency, one of the prime approaches has been to decrease the overall average vehicle weight. Strategies to reduce weight include decreasing vehicle size and utilizing lighter weight materials.  To meet the challenge of lighter weight materials, the steel industry has developed multiple different higher strength steel grades which when incorporated with modified designs lead to lighter weight components.  To optimize steel usage, different grades are selected for different vehicle components.  For example, the attached schematic drawing illustrates that required steel properties differ between different parts of a vehicle.  For example as illustrated in the red circle, steels for the passenger compartment must be high strength and resist deformation in a crash to protect the occupants.  In contrast, steels required for the parts in the yellow circles must be both high strength for light weight but must also deform to absorb energy in a crash.  The importance of energy absorbance is illustrated in the many crash tests performed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (see:  http://www.iihs.org/).\n\n \nOver the past 40 years, developments in steel alloy design and processing have led to commercialized AHSS grades, and these products are currently being applied in vehicle designs.  The growth in the use of AHSS in North American vehicles is illustrated in the attached figure which shows the amount (both actual and projected) of AHSS in vehicles for the period of 1975 to 2020.   The use of AHSS increased to approximately 8 % in 2011 and is projected to increase to approximately 15 % of the total vehicle weight by 2020.  The significant increase in the use of AHSS reflects economic design improvements to enhance both safety and fuel economy.  While multiple AHSS processing routes have been proposed, this research project and the related projects in the NSF/DOE Steel Research Program have concentrated on new novel approaches to produce even higher strength AHSS grades which still can be shaped during manufacturing and which will deform and absorb energy in a crash.  The significantly enhanced property goals for these new steels have been identified and steels which match those goals are referred to as the \"Third-Generation\" AHSS.\n \nWhile several different strategies have been considered leading to the production of Third-Generation AHSS, this research project which formed the basis for the PhD thesis entitled \"Design Considerations for the Third Generation Advanced High Strength Steel\" by Dr. P.J. Gibbs, concentrated on the use of specific alloy additions, primarily manganese (Mn), and processing histories to identify microstructural combinations resulting in steels with the desired mechanical properties.  The steels of interest are referred to as \"medium-Mn steels.\"  Based on fundamental thermodynamic predictions, novel processing histories were designed to thermally process the steel to redistribute the Mn to achieve localized regions of high and low Mn-contents in the steel microstructure where the presence of the high Mn regions resulted in unique deformation beh..."
