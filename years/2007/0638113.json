 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a low cost, high volume anodization process for magnesium alloys used in the automotive industry.  The project aims to reduce the time and cost to anodize magnesium using a unique electro-cleaning method that reduces the number of pretreatment steps prior to application of the coating, and using \"green chemistry\" to reduce environmental impact of the process. Magnesium alloys are used extensively in automotive applications because they are one-third lighter than aluminum alloys, but magnesium suffers from a high rate of corrosion when exposed to an aggressive environment and when coupled with dissimilar metals. Anodization offers the best protection; however, due to cost considerations the auto industry currently depends on chemical conversion coatings to protect magnesium which are not as environmentally friendly, and not robust enough to protect magnesium in future automotive applications.\r\n\r\n It is estimated that the use of the technology developed in this program will lead to a 10 % reduction in a vehicle weight, and 7% reduction in fuel use. In addition, this technology could accelerate the utilization of magnesium in areas such as consumer electronics, power tools and medical devices.",
