 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal 0725598\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop the next generation optical endoscopic imaging probes for early cancer detection. The approach is to use Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to make imaging probes small, inexpensive and scan fast. \r\n\r\nThis project addresses the challenges of endoscopic imaging from both device and system architecture level. A new class of fast-scanning optical microsystems will be developed. One of the micromirrors can scan vertically up to 3 mm with no lateral shift. These MEMS devices can form a compact free-space interferometer that fits into endoscopic catheters. This further enables a new endoscopic OCT architecture that does not need a reference optical fiber and thus completely eliminates the problems of fiber length matching, dispersion and polarization compensation. The PI has extensive experience in this field and has good facility access to carry out this project.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe proposed rapid scanning optical MEMS devices can also be applied to displays and optical telecommunications. The enabled single-fiber imaging probes can be used for early cancer diagnosis and real-time cancer surgery monitoring, which could potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives and improve their quality of life. The same technique is applicable to intravascular imaging for heart disease. Tiny laser scanning displays enabled by 2-D micromirrors will be demonstrated in nearby high schools to attract more youngsters interested in engineering and science. The PI will also participate in the STEP-UP program at University of Florida that is designed to promote academic and personal success among minority freshman engineering students. \r\n",
