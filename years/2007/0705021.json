It is expected that 50 to 80 participants will attend the meeting, including some 40 to 50 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.\r\n\r\nThis will be the fifth annual meeting of this conference series on operator algebras and non-commutative geometry, with applications to a wide range of areas from geometry to quantum physics. The first meeting in the series was held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, in the fall of 2003. Succeeding meetings have been held in the fall each year at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.\r\n\r\nIn addition to facilitating interaction between researchers in the field, the symposium will provide a forum for young researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the eastern part of the United States to hear of current work from those at the forefront of the field and to present their work and discuss it with senior mathematicians.\r\n",
