The planning visit will occur July 7-22, 2007 and the PI will meet with counterparts in China, South Korea and Japan.  The counterpart hosts are Professor LI, Shuhui, School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China; Professor OH, Soo-Ik, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Seoul National University, South Korea; and Professor DOHDA, Kuniaki, Department of Engineering Physics and Electronics at Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan.     \r\n\r\nThis planning visit has the strong potential to advance knowledge in the fields of lightweight and micro-manufacturing, alternative energy and biomedical device applications.  Both the PI and counterparts have identified emerging collaborations with a high likelihood of follow-up due to strong research synergies.  The planning visit has the potential to make U.S. and global manufacturing more nimble and to reduce the negative impact of pollutants on the global environment in East Asia, a critical region for deployment of sustainable manufacturing and engineering solutions.  \r\n \r\n",
