Both come with nontrivial modeling, theoretical,\r\nand computational challenges.  The first part of the project\r\ndeals with an extension of the stochastic programming and\r\nvariational analysis methodology to deal with a large class of\r\nvariational problems in a stochastic environment, which could be\r\ncalled stochastic equilibrium problems.  They include variational\r\ninequalities, cooperative and noncooperative games, Walras-type\r\nequilibria, solving inclusions, and fixed point problems, when\r\nsome of the components of the problem are stochastic.  The goal\r\nhere is to develop a theory that leads to implementable numerical\r\nprocedures.  The second part of the project deals with making the\r\nmethodology of stochastic programming more accessible to a wider\r\nrange of users, namely with the design of procedures that allow\r\nthe user to describe the uncertainty when only (very) limited\r\ndata are available about the random parameters.  This is\r\nparticularly critical when the uncertainty is to be revealed over\r\ntime (or space) and the decision maker can use this information\r\nto select recourse (adjusting) decisions. \r\n\r\n     Almost all important decision-making problems, except\r\npossibly a few that are purely technical in nature, involve some\r\nlevel of uncertainty about some of the parameters or components\r\nof the problem.  For example,\r\n (a) setting monetary or economic policy requires taking into\r\n account uncertainty in the economic and financial markets,\r\n (b) selecting a master scheduling plan in manufacturing requires\r\n taking into account uncertainty in the market's response,\r\n (c) the choice of an environmental protection plan needs to\r\n balance changing atmospheric conditions with sociological and\r\n economic impacts, all involving various uncertainties,\r\n (d) policies issues related to energy supply require taking\r\n into account world market price vagaries as well as potential\r\n technological innovations,\r\nand so on.  Deterministic models for such problems, even when\r\nincluding scenario \"analysis,\" lead to so-called optimal\r\ndecisions that almost never are robust, sometimes are even\r\nseriously misleading.  So it is crucial to take uncertainty into\r\naccount when setting up either optimization or equilibrium\r\nmodels.  Using tools of variational analysis, algorithmic\r\nprocedures developed for solving (nonconvex, finite-dimensional)\r\nvariational inequalities, and approximation schemes for\r\nstochastic optimization problems, the investigator develops\r\ntheoretical results and computational tools to solve such\r\nfundamental problems and to improve the modeling of the\r\nuncertainty components.  An important issue, both for stochastic\r\noptimization and for equilibrium problems in a stochastic\r\nenvironment, is the modeling of the uncertainty.  In practical\r\nsituations, sufficient data are not always available to justify\r\nthe use of classical statistical methods.  The investigator\r\nstudies \"lack of data\" issues, examining techniques that allow\r\nthe user to incorporate other information in the estimation of\r\nthe distribution of the unknown parameters. \r\n",
