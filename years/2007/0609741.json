 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Proposal: CUAHSI/CLEANER Demonstration and Development of a Test-bed\r\nDigital Observatory for the Susquehanna River Basin and Chesapeake Bay\r\nIntroduction: The proposed project will demonstrate the applicability and utility of a Environmental\r\nDigital Observatory (EDO) design whose components are currently being developed by the Hydrologic\r\nInformation System (HIS) group of CUAHSI for use by both the CLEANER and CUAHSI communities.\r\nWhile the 4 components of the EDO system have been identified (Environmental Digital Library (EDL),\r\nEnvironmental Observations Database (EOD), Digital Environment-Shed (DES), Environmental Analysis\r\nSystem (EAS)), only some of the components are currently in a state to be deployed in a beta-testing\r\nmode, most notably the EDL and to some extent the DES. Because of the complexity of the system\r\ncomponents it is impossible to produce a roll-out product that would meet all the expectations from the\r\nstart. Hence, it is crucial that these components are put to a test in a test-bed environment to investigate\r\nhow the components behave, what pieces are missing, what additional developments need to be carried\r\nout, and most importantly whether they are effective for the purpose they were designed. Because of the\r\nenvisioned scope in funding and time as well as the availability and current state of the developments, this\r\nproject will focus on the first of the components (the EDL), which constitutes the base layer upon which\r\nall of the other components rest.\r\nObjectives: The objectives are to: (1) test and demonstrate the usefulness of a EDL for inclusion in the\r\nEDO as applied to nutrient fluxes in both the Susquehanna River Basin (SRB) and Chesapeake Bay (CB)\r\nfor which a data gap analysis will be performed (2) demonstrate the feasibility of using existing CI\r\ncomponents (EDO from CUAHSI and CyberCollaboratory from CLEANER) to meet a merged and\r\noverlapping science agenda as demonstrated on the SRB/CB test-bed, and (3) further develop and extend\r\nexisting components as well as provide feedback on the design and functionality of CI components to the\r\ntechnology partners at SDSC and NCSA.\r\nMethodology: To accomplish these objectives an instance of the EDL will be installed at Drexel\r\nUniversity. Together with the project partners representing an upstream Hydrologic Observatory region\r\nand a downstream Environmental Observatory region, we will identify and collect as many nutrient data\r\nas is possible and currently available for these regions for inclusion in the EDL. While the population of\r\nthe EDL in the first step will require substantial effort to further develop current CI components\r\n(appropriate metadata tags and tools for creating instantiations) we will conduct a data gap analysis in the\r\nupstream region for missing or insufficient data. The gap analysis will be carried out using a statistical\r\nmodeling tool (SPARROW), which will yield predictions that can be compared to existing data sets. The\r\nquality or match of these comparisons will be an indicator for the overall quality of the data sets as far as\r\ntheir temporal and spatial coverage is concerned. This is an important step towards an improved\r\nknowledge on the fluxes, stores, and pathways of water as well as nutrients within the SRB and the\r\nreceiving waters of the CB.\r\nIntellectual merit: This project would be the first effort to investigate how hydrologists and\r\nenvironmental engineers can make use of the suite of technical support applications currently under\r\ndevelopment. This is a crucial step in further developing CI for the environmental and hydrology\r\ncommunities by providing feedback in a beta-testing mode. In addition, the use of the CyberCollaboratory\r\nprototype will allow the project team to test a collaboratory system while executing a research project as\r\nwell as generate valuable information on how well the system can be used for the purpose of supporting\r\nobservatory science and design. Both systems are IT cornerstones for a shared CI between and CUAHSI\r\nand CLEANER and as such must be evaluated before being released to the communities.\r\nBroader impacts: Besides the impact this project will have on the CI development for hydrologic and\r\nenvironmental engineering communities in identifying future research needs, it will also address the\r\neducational sector. One of the major goals of both communities is to bring water related data and tools\r\ninto the class room as well to i) better train the future workforce on issues related to water, and ii) to\r\nexpose them to aspects of information technology that could place future professionals at the interface of\r\nwater and IT, an educational goal that has been identified by the NSF Blue Ribbon Advisory Panel on\r\nCyberinfrastructure as being one of the most pressing educational needs of the future.",
