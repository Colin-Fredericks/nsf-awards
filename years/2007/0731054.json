 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal presents an integrated research and educational plan directed toward the production, detection, and identification of bacterial endospore taggants for explosive tracking.  While the most immediate application of the research is related to stemming the activities of bioterrorists, the anticipated fundamental advances in bioengineering and sensor science and engineering will have significant societal relevance to other applications, including first-responder activities, healthcare, food safety, and pollution avoidance and mitigation. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe investigators propose to combine bioengineering of Bacillus stearothermophilus endospores with microdevices for sample processing and taggant identification. A surface acoustic wave (SAW) microdroplet mixing/transport/incubator system will be coupled with molecular padlock probe technology for sensitive identification of bioengineered endospores. The specific research tasks are to: (i) Generate a number of different Bacillus spores, each with a unique DNA sequence or sequences spliced into its genome; (ii) Investigate and identify the optimal SAW device designs needed to germinate spores, lyse vegetative bacteria, transport, mix, and heat microdroplet samples; (iii) Design subsystems for DNA isolation; (iv) Develop a fluorescence-based molecular padlock probe system for DNA identification that can operate effectively in conjunction with the SAW fabrication microsystem platform; (v) Fabricate and test the proposed prototype identification system. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nBroader impacts will be achieved through the following programs and activities to: (i) Train and interact with high school audiences through two major ongoing programs at University of Maine (UMaine), NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) and the GK-12 Sensors; (ii) Involve undergraduates from Maine and other institutions directly into the research project under the umbrella of the ongoing NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the UMaine; (iii) Identify appropriate Capstone projects for undergraduates involving cross-disciplinary research and design projects; (iv) Enhance existing graduate level courses (1) Microscale Bioengineering and (2) Design and Fabrication of Acoustic Wave Devices by incorporating research results into each course; (v) Contribute to the interdisciplinary multi-institutional NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program in functional genomics, which involves UMaine, the Jackson Laboratory, and the Maine Medical Center Research Institute; (vi) Provide thesis topics for M.S. and Ph.D. students; (vii) Disseminate the research and educational material on a project website, and through conferences and printed literature. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
