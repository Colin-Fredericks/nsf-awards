 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UK-New Opportunities Yielding Classroom Excellence (UK-NOYCE) Mathematics and Science Fellows Program is recruiting senior science, mathematics, engineering, and technology  (STEM) majors and STEM professionals to become credentialed secondary mathematics and science teachers through a collaborative effort by the College of Education, College of Engineering, and College of Arts and Science at the University of Kentucky. UK-NOYCE recipients are expected to teach secondary mathematics and sciences in selected districts which meet high need criteria because they lack qualified mathematics and science teachers. The 52 targeted high need districts have long-standing partnerships with UK through the ongoing Appalachian Math Science Partnership and former Appalachian Rural Systemic Initiative. \r\n\r\nThe program objectives are to: (1) Attract students and practicing professionals in the STEM disciplines into Secondary Mathematics and Science Education; (2) Make available to these students an integrated range of support services designed to enhance academic success, for example, collaborative advising from the College of Education, College of Arts and Science, College of Engineering, and College of Agriculture; and (3) Increase the number of graduates in Secondary Science and Mathematics Education. Specific aims to achieve these objectives include: (a) Ensuring scholars are of high academic ability by requiring a GPA of 3.0, which is maintained throughout their participation in the program; (b) Making a strong effort to recruit traditionally underrepresented groups in the STEM disciplines (women, minorities, and disabled students) into the UK-NOYCE Scholarship Program; (c) Encouraging all UK-NOYCE scholars to complete their degrees within one calendar year of entering the Masters of Arts in Secondary Education with Initial Certification (MIC) program; and (d) Assisting UK-NOYCE scholars in obtaining Secondary teaching positions in the targeted regions of Kentucky (including Appalachia). \r\n\r\nIn total, 40 fellowships (minimum 25 new students) are being provided for both senior and graduate level students. The MIC program is an intensive one calendar-year program that leads to both a master's degree and initial Kentucky teacher certification (grades 8-12). Emphasis is on strong math/science background content. The UK-NOYCE Fellows are members of two, concurrent cohorts: a pedagogical foundations cohort and a math or science content cohort.  A cross-college team of faculty designs and supervises integrated experiences for students. Partner-schools provide apprenticeship experiences for MIC participants. In terms of the impact to the K-12 mathematics and science pipeline, if each UK-NOYCE Fellow has an average of 100 students, over 4000 secondary mathematics and science students will be educated each year by a highly qualified teacher trained in real-world applications of STEM through their content preparation and in effective pedagogy through their pre-service teacher training. \r\n",
