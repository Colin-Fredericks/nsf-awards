 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL: This planned two-day symposium has the following objectives: (1) To identify, analyze, and discuss the recent advances in the theory, experimental observation and technological exploitation of the ideal strength of materials. In particular, talks and discussions will review the fascinating properties of the recently discovered \"Gum metal\" that appears to attain ideal strength in bulk, and deform by a dislocation-free mechanism. (2) To recognize and discuss the role of ideal strength in a number of both new and familiar modes of behavior, including nano-indentation hardness, transformation-induced plasticity, strength/toughness limits on structural materials and behavior under shock loading. The conference will be held on March 28-29, 2008 at the campus of UC Berkeley. These dates are set to overlap the end of the MRS Spring Meeting in San Francisco to ensure maximum participation. The topics the symposium will cover will include (but will not necessarily be limited to) the following:\r\n1. The meaning of ideal strength and its role in mechanical behavior.\r\n2. The computation of ideal strength from first principles.\r\n3. The role of ideal strength in nano-indentation.\r\n4. Ideal strength in bulk: Gum metal and its possible cousins.\r\n5. The role of ideal strength in cleavage.\r\n6. Phase transformation at ideal strength: \"stress-induced\" transformation.\r\n7. The role of ideal strength in impact: \"mechanical melting\".\r\nNON-TECHNICAL: The workshop will bring together a number of researchers with overlapping interests in the ideal strength of materials in a congenial environment that will facilitate discussion, debate and the initiation of long-term collaborations. It is also aimed at encouraging the participation of young researchers and members of underrepresented groups in this new and exciting field of mechanical behavior. The activities have both scientific and technological merit. Scientifically, the symposium will focus on an important new area of mechanical behavior. It will serve to communicate the status of current research, stimulate discussion and new research ideas, and establish useful collaborations. Technologically, the conference discussions should provide new insight into how the limits of strength may be exploited in the creation of new materials. The broader impact of the symposium will also come from the ideas that it should stimulate and the collaborations it should generate. PI intend to actively encourage the attendance of underrepresented minorities, and have reserved travel funds to encourage and support such attendance. PI anticipates that approximately 25% of our total attendance will be women, and will seek to identify other underrepresented minorities that are interested in this area. Awareness of the workshop will be achieved through emails to researchers involved in the field, solicitation of suitable names, and announcement of workshop on available technical societies' websites.\r\n",
