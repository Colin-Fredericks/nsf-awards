The proposed research on controlling patterns\r\ninvestigates an autoadjusting feedback control scheme aimed at\r\nstabilizing oscillatory patterned-states. The feedback control method\r\nexploits symmetries of the targeted pattern in such a way that it\r\nbecomes noninvasive when control is achieved. Two related case studies\r\nwill be pursued: (A) stabilization of traveling plane wave solutions\r\nof the two-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in the\r\nBenjamin-Feir unstable regime, and (B) control of chemical traveling\r\nwave patterns of the photo-sensitive Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction in\r\nthe oscillatory regime. The mathematical relationship between these\r\ntwo case studies will be elucidated by the proposed analysis.  The\r\nproposed research on mathematical modeling of protein translation is\r\naimed at deriving, by systematic approximation, a delay equation model of\r\nprotein translation that could then be used as a component in simple\r\nmodels of synthetic gene networks involving more than one protein. The\r\ndelay model is obtained from a continuum description of the elongation\r\nprocess, which ultimately shows up as a delay time in the reduced\r\nmathematical model. The proposed research will extend the model to\r\nincorporate the degradation of mRNA. The fidelity of the delay model\r\nto the mechanistic one, in the case of simple gene switches and\r\noscillators will then be investigated using bifurcation theory, aided\r\nby a numerical continuation package that was developed for delay\r\ndifferential equations.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will contribute to the training of graduate\r\nstudents and postdoctoral fellows in interdisciplinary, applied\r\nmathematics research. It will aid the development of feedback control\r\nschemes for eliminating spatio-temporal chaos in chemical\r\nreaction-diffusion systems, as well as other pattern-forming systems.\r\nDelay differential equations frequently arise in the modeling of\r\nbiological processes, such as cellular protein translation, the\r\nprocess whereby ribosomes assemble proteins, one amino acid at a time,\r\nusing the information encoded in the messenger RNA (mRNA). The\r\nproposed research will contribute to the development of a systematic\r\nmathematical framework for deriving reduced delay models from complex,\r\nbiologically-detailed mechanistic models. The proposed projects\r\nrepresent important applications of delay differential equations and\r\ntheir analysis using bifurcation theory. The analysis of these\r\nproposed case studies are essential to the development of these\r\nmathematical and computational tools.\r\n",
