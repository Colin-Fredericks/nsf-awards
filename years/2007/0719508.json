 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops methodology for objective Bayesian analysis \r\nof spatial data, both geostatistical and lattice data, that arise in \r\nmany of the social and earth sciences, such as economy, epidemiology, \r\ngeography, geology and hydrology, as well as computationally efficient \r\nalgorithms to perform Bayesian analysis and prediction based on \r\nmoderate to large spatial datasets. \r\nOn the methodological side, the investigator derives new automatic \r\nprior distributions for the parameters of different kinds of Gaussian \r\nrandom fields, specified either by their covariance matrices or by \r\ntheir precision matrices. \r\nThe research explores the main statistical properties of Bayesian \r\ninferences based on these automatic priors, such as conditions for \r\nposterior propriety, frequentist properties of parameter and\r\npredictive inferences, and existence of predictive summaries.\r\nA point of particular interest is the study of the pros and cons of \r\nthe dependence of these automatic priors on the sampling design.\r\nOn the computational side, the investigator derives methods to \r\napproximate these automatic priors distributions, since evaluation \r\nof these priors is in most cases computationally expensive, and \r\ndevelops new computationally efficient algorithms for Bayesian \r\ninference and prediction of spatial data that would make feasible \r\nBayesian analysis based on moderate to large spatial datasets.\r\nThe methodology proposed in this project serves as an initial step \r\ntoward the development of objective Bayesian analysis for spatial \r\nhierarchical models used to describe non-Gaussian data, since most \r\nof these models use Gaussian random fields as building blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statistical methodology developed during this project has practical\r\nimpacts in many social and earth sciences, such as economy, epidemiology, \r\ngeography, geology and hydrology, where the collection and analysis of \r\nspatial data have become common tasks.\r\nA paradigm of statistics called the Bayesian approach possesses several \r\nconceptual and methodological advantages when compared to traditional \r\napproaches for the analysis of spatial data, but technical and \r\ncomputational difficulties that arise during implementation have \r\nhindered its more widespread use among practitioners.\r\nThis is particularly so for the analysis of some types large spatial \r\ndatasets where current implementations of the Bayesian approach \r\nare too cumbersome or unfeasible to be carried out.\r\nThe statistical methodology developed in this project would contribute \r\nto overcome some of these technical and computational hurdles, and\r\nconsequently to bridge the gap between methodology and practice for \r\nBayesian analysis of spatial data.\r\nGraduate students would be engaged in the project, contributing to \r\ntheir statistical training as well as the enhancement of the Statistics \r\nprogram at the University of Arkansas.\r\n",
