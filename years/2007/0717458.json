 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants, caterpillars, and parasitic wasps and flies that attack caterpillars (parasitoids) are important components of most terrestrial ecosystems and represent more than 20% of all described organisms in the world. ?Caterpillars and parasitoids in the Eastern Andes of Ecuador? is an intensive plant, caterpillar, and parasitoid inventory at the Yanayacu Biological Station (YBS) in the Ecuadorian Andes. The primary objectives of the project are to collect and catalog the diverse community of caterpillars and associated parasitoids at this site, to discover new species, to characterize diversity of the region, and to disseminate this information with a searchable database accessible to scientists and the public throughout the world. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity includes significant advances in insect classification as well as providing a critical inventory that can be used in conservation efforts in the equatorial Andes, a global hotspot of biodiversity. The data will also be used to address a variety of basic and applied questions, particularly those associated with climate change and biodiversity. The broader impacts of this project include direct involvement of four local field assistants, three Ecuadorian students, three Ecuadorian senior scientists, one postdoctoral researcher, at least twelve collaborating insect specialists, and various graduate and undergraduate students. The project will also include enhancements in science education and research experience programs for minorities.",

The \"Maquina\" (the Machine) is the insectary or caterpillar &ndash;rearing shed for the CAPEA project.  Literally a live caterpillar zoo &ndash; the \"maquina\" is the \"machine\" that produces specimens, data, and photographs for the CAPEA project.  Each live caterpillar must be kept clean and fed new leaves daily, all changes monitored and recorded, until the caterpillar either metamorphoses to an adult moth or butterfly, or until it is killed by an emerging parasitic wasp or fly.  Whatever the result - whether moth, butterfly, wasp, or fly - the emerging adult insect is preserved and labeled for museum research.  So far, more than 50,000 individual caterpillars have been raised and recorded!  A carnival-assortment of caterpillars can be viewed at the University of Nevada ecologist Lee Dyer\u2019s CAPEA website (www.caterpillars.org).            \n            Over the last three summers we increased student participation by teaching a study-abroad course: Cloud Forest Ecology in Ecuador.  The class provides students with a unique opportunity to live in the cloud forest, study and participate in on-going tropical research, and to experience for themselves the thrill of discovering new life forms.  Co-taught with UW botany professor Greg Brown, the experiential-learning class allows students to study forest ecology at a high-elevation cloud forest in the Andes Mountains.  The diverse experiences of students and teachers have been chronicled by RET science teacher Jennifer Donovan at our \"Experiential Science Education for Teachers\" website (http://yanayacu.weebly.com/). \nThe discovery of new insect species in Ecuador contributes to 'informing regulatory policy' by providing new knowledge of biological diversity in a cloud forest reserve.  Broad impacts are that this information may allow better management and conservation decisions relating to tropical forest preserves in Ecuador (and elsewhere in the tropics).  Increased knowledge of Neotropical insect biodiversity is essential to forest conservation.  It is difficult to preserve and understand organisms until they are discovered, named, and their biology studied.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott R Shaw"
