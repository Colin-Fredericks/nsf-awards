 "awd_abstract_narration": "Life Science Biological (61) This project is developing a multi-representational visual learning environment for Animal Cell Biology and Anatomy of Plant Development laboratories using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker for gene and protein expression in strains of Arabidopsis and C. elegans from the research communities. Four faculty members from Biology and Education are developing the new courses to combine descriptive aspects of plant anatomy and cell biology with the modern molecular techniques needed for analysis of gene expression in living organisms. Gene and protein expression at the sub-cellular, cellular, and tissue level are emphasized in order to help students acquire rich contextual information using current research technologies. As part of these combined lab and lecture courses, students work on long-term continuous projects, hold frequent collaborative discussions, and present their work to one another. The courses promote students' development into skilled observers who can translate between their own observations and the products from the larger research community. Microscopy is the basis for these interactive laboratory experiences at both introductory (sophomore) and advanced (senior) levels where students conduct cutting edge, inquiry-based, cellular and molecular experiments.  Evaluation of the results of this project will indicate to what degree research with live transgenic model organisms that express a GFP helps students interpret professional research materials, including illustrations, diagrams, and images. Information on the most useful GFP strains for subcellular and cellular identifications is disseminated through presentations at cell biology, plant biology, and instructional technology meetings and to the Arabidopsis and C. elegans research communities.",
