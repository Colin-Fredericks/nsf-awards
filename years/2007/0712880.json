 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing and offering two workshops to faculty members from minority serving institutions. The goals of the workshop are to enhance the proposal writing skills of the participants and to enable them to explore collaborations between their institutions. In the first workshop, attendees are participating in guided inquiry-based activities designed to assist them in developing competitive proposals.  The second workshop is bringing attendees from a 2006 proposal writing workshop back together, enabling them to further explore and fine-tune their proposal concepts.  Faculty from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Native American Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities are participating.  These workshops enhance NSF's efforts to build a more inclusive, knowledgeable, and globally engaged workforce that fully reflects the strength of the Nation's diverse population.",
