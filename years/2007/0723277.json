 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed research seeks to acquire an acquisition for a new control system for the nation's largest coastal wave flume to enable precise, large-scale simulation of hurricane waves, tsunamis, and other coastal hazards under controlled conditions in a hydraulic laboratory wave flume.  This new capability will allow the research community to study a range of engineering and scientific problems in constructed and natural coastal environments, including wave impacts on coastal infrastructure; development of wave energy systems; advances in numerical modeling of fluid-structure interaction with application to coastal systems, cross-shore sediment suspension and transport related to coastal erosion and recovery after storms; dune erosion and overtopping; tsunami propagation over reefs; and environmental fluid-sediment dynamics.   The high performance, large-stroke piston-type wavemaker will address both scale effects and laboratory effects by providing hurricane and tsunami waves in coastal waters at large scale with a dynamic feedback control to absorb unwanted reflected waves and tank seiche.  The high performance wavemaker will provide a national asset for precision, large-scale studies enabling safer and more cost effective design of coastal infrastructure including bridges, levees, buildings and lifelines.  This will lead to better practices for the repair and retrofit of existing structures and improved design codes for new construction.\r\n\r\nThere is over $3T in civil infrastructure along the East and Gulf coasts of the United States vulnerable to coastal storms, and the economic and societal impacts of extreme events such as hurricanes are expected to escalate as reported by the National Science Board (NSB, 2007).  More than half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of the coast, and more than 60% will live there by 2010. Concurrently, most of the nation's sandy coasts suffer chronic erosion due to continued sea level rise. As erosion trends continue and as population projections are realized, the Nation's coastal margins will experience significant development pressures (US Commission on Ocean Policy, 2004). At present time there is no coastal research facilities anywhere in the United States that simulate hurricane and other large storms at scales large enough to minimize scale effects.  Data from this facility are archived and available to other researchers to validate numerical models and guide future development.  The senior personnel encourage the shared-use of the facility through open workshops at the site.  This project enhances the training of graduate students in the areas of coastal structures and coastal erosion. Research and education is integrated at the undergraduate level through a Research Experience for Undergraduates Program established at the laboratory.  Education and Outreach activities are targeted to the recruitment and retention of women and minorities in engineering at the undergraduate level and to inspire K-12 students at the 3rd through 5th grade level through tours and hands-on activities.  \r\n",
