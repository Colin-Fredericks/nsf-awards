 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I Project focuses on the development of a monitor for volatile organic compounds released during wood processing.  A MEMS detector system that can continuously monitor pollutants during wood processing will be developed. The program proposed here will provide a real time continuous monitor with an overall significant cost reduction when compared to traditional monitoring methods. \r\n\r\nPlywood and composite wood products release major sources of hazardous air pollutants during processing, including, acetaldehyde, acrolein, formaldehyde, methanol, phenol, propionaldehyde and others. These pollutants are associated with a variety of adverse health effects including damage to nasal membranes, gastrointestinal irritation, irritation of eyes, throat, and mucous membranes, dizziness, headache, and nausea. The chemicapacitive sensor technology being developed has a broad relevance in the wood processing as well as a number of commercial applications. These sensors are ideal for monitoring a variety of chemical and physical targets in a distributed system where a premium is placed on early detection of problems.  \r\n",
