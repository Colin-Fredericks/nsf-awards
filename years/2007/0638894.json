 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radio Lab will produce 20 hour-long interdisciplinary science programs and 30 shorter features to be aired on NPR news magazine programs on a wide range of core STEM topics exploring how research is done as well as what the scientific results mean to the listener.  The programs are co-hosted by Robert Krulwich, science reporter for NPR, and Jared Abumrad, WNYC radio producer and music composer.  The programs are using a new, unorthodox format with music, live sounds and conversations between the hosts designed to appeal to young adult listeners who previously thought they did not like science.  Each episode is crafted around a scientific finding and aims to connect the scientific inquiry to philosophical and universal implications.  Program topics will include biology and neuroscience as well as physics, genetics, chemistry, math and engineering. The program carriage goal is to have the hour-long programs airing on 100 stations reaching three to four million listeners by the end of the project.  The shorter segments will be distributed by NPR in its regular news magazine programs.  Programs will also be podcast on NPR and WNYC's web sites, as well as through iTunes.  The project will also train NPR science reporters on this new approach to science news content.\r\n",
