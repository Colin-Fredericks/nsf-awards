 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) 2007 Conference on Genetic Recombination and Genome Rearrangements to be held July 28-August 2, 2007, in Snowmass, Colorado. This will be the twelfth in a series of highly successful bi-annual conferences devoted to these topics. Genetic recombination plays a key role in molding genome structure in all living organisms and is required to maintain genome integrity. Chromosomal breaks produced by environmental agents or endogenous processes are repaired by both homologous and non-homologous recombination. The outcome of these repair events may or may not involve genetic change. For reproductive cells, homologous recombination ensures proper chromosome disjunction during meiosis, in addition to generation of diversity. \r\n\r\nThis conference will bring together 185 investigators studying many diverse aspects of genetic recombination, in a range of biological systems, and with different experimental approaches. Presentations will introduce new and unpublished work on timely questions in the field and will include discussion from all participants. A book will be prepared to provide abstracts and contact information of all participants.  The support from NSF will help postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and new faculty members attend the conference.",
