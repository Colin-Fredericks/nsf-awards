The project will build on the recent discovery that adsorption of certain molecules (e.g., n-hexane, n-octane) in MFI zeolite membranes swells the MFI crystals slightly (~1% linear expansion), and this expansion shrinks the size of the non-zeolitic pores (defects) sufficiently to dramatically decrease permeation through non-zeolitic pores. The successful completion of this research will result in new understanding of the micro-structure of zeolite membranes, will indicate directions for improved zeolite membrane preparation, and will potentially result in new methods of zeolite membrane separations by addition of certain molecules to mixtures. It will identify molecules that can cause improved selectivity by shrinking the size of non-zeolitic pores. Comparing membranes prepared in different laboratories is difficult, and characterization methods that measure flux through non-zeolitic pores and measure their pore sizes will be developed.  MFI membranes with different fractions of their flow through non-zeolitic pores will be used. Methods to measure changes due to adsorption, for crystals or membranes, include XRD, TPD, and confocal microscopy. Permeation methods include pervaporation to obtain high adsorbed loadings, which are more representative of industrial applications, vapor permeation as a function of pressure (and capillary condensation in non-zeolitic pores), permporosimetry, and transient permeation of mixtures with mass spectrometer detection. Separations will be carried out by pervaporation for binary and ternary mixtures. \r\n\r\nSeparations use a significant fraction of the energy in the US, and membrane separations have the potential to significantly reduce that usage. Understanding adsorbed-induced microstructural changes in zeolite membranes will impact how zeolite membranes are prepared and utilized. Zeolite membranes have the potential to separate organic isomers (structural and stereo isomers), and azeotropes, and these abilities combined with their high temperature stability give them significant advantages over polymer membranes. Zeolite layers have potential applications for hydrogen storage and in micro devices. Continuation of membrane technology patents having the potential to rapidly and directly benefiting society through commercialization is anticipated.  It is anticipated that at least one student will be supported by a GAANN fellowship, which has K-12 and community outreach as one of the required aspects. Undergraduate students will be supported, and one high school student will be involved in this research each summer. \r\n",
