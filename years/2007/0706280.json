 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This project addresses growth and further understanding of rutile heterostructures for spin-electronic applications. Objectives are to gain understanding and control over the synthesis and processing of CrO2 and related rutile materials into heterostructures using a combined experiment/theory approach. Pulsed laser deposition and laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) will be used for the growth of the heterostructures. In LCVD, energy from a laser is used to photochemically decompose a gas precursor to provide epitaxial CrO2 growth at low pressure with in-situ electron diffraction crystal growth monitoring to obtain spin transport quality CrO2 films and interfaces. Both Meservey- Tedrow and inelastic tunneling spectroscopy will be performed, as well as basic magneto-transport to characterize prototype device structures. \r\nNon-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science with high technological relevance. Research and educational activities will be integrated with involvement of both graduate and undergraduates in the research program. Collaborations with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and international collaborations provide added benefits and special opportunities to assist integration of research and education. The project includes collaborations with minority faculty members from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). \r\n",
