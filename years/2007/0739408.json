 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel and subsistence for participants in the fourth annual Southeastern Atlantic Mathematical Sciences (SEAMS) Workshop, to be held in September 2007 at the National Institute of Aerospace in Hampton, Virginia.  The two-day meeting is part of an ongoing conference series, centered on participation of junior researchers, previously held at the College of Charleston and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Speakers will be primarily advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  There also will be opportunities for contributed presentations in a poster session.  The meeting encourages and supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. \r\n\r\nThe research topics of the workshop reflect the main active research programs at the organizing institutions, and include\r\n-- Scientific Computing; Computational Fluid Dynamics\r\n-- Integrable Systems; Nonlinear Dynamics; Nonlinear Evolution Equations\r\n-- Control; Optimization\r\n-- Bio-mathematics; Molecular Transport and Motors; Stochastic Differential Equations\r\n-- Turbulent Transport; Mixing; Simulations of Turbulent Flows \r\n-- Fluid Dynamics; Geophysical Fluid Flows; Averaging and Homogenization\r\n-- Materials; Polymers; Non-Newtonian Fluids; Molecular Dynamics Simulations\r\n-- Nonlinear Optics; Laser Propagation in Random Media; Porous Media Flows\r\n-- Numerical Linear Algebra; Markov Processes; Approximation Theory\r\nElectronic files for talks and posters are collected after each workshop and posted on the workshop web site http://www.chachadays.org\r\n",
