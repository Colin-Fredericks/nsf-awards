 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a combined experimental and theoretical project to investigate the role of geometry, thermal photons and their interplay in the electromagnetic Casimir force.  H.B.G. Casimir, calculated an extraordinary property that two parallel uncharged metallic plates placed in empty space would be attracted to each other.  This force and the corresponding effect, now known as the Casimir effect, results from the alteration by the plates (boundaries) of the zero point electromagnetic energy that pervades all of space as predicted by quantum field theory. Unique to the Casimir force is its strong dependence on shape, switching from attractive to repulsive as a function of the size, geometry and topology of the boundary.  This study will build on the rapid theoretical advances in the area of simple geometry dependencies in the last two years.  Investigations into the geometry dependence of the lateral Casimir force for surfaces with periodic corrugation on nanometer length scales, which will incorporate cooperative diffraction like effects for the zero-point photons will be carried out.  Additionally, the role of thermal photons in the Casimir effect will be explored.  The role of thermal photons is not completely understood due to problems effectively incorporating the dielectric losses of the material and interesting predictions of non-trivial geometry dependence have also been advanced for thermal photons. Finally a preliminary investigation of the role of negative index of refraction materials in the Casimir force will be launched.  The results of this complete study will also allow the setting of stringent limits on modern unification theories which predict the presence of new forces or  compactified extra dimensions. \r\nEven  though the Casimir effect originates from quantum fluctuations, it results in large forces on macroscopic objects separated by distances less than a micron. The role of Casimir forces in the fabrication, function and yield of micromechanical devices has recently become well recognized.  This investigation will lead to improved nano-electromechanical devices such as nano actuators, micro mirrors for optical communication and nano tweezers.  The research program also involves the training of a graduate student and a minority undergraduate student in laboratory research and nanotechnology. \r\n",
