Central to this vision is the need to improve activity discovery and representation of user behavior. This will necessitate the development of novel machine learning algorithms for building models of that activity. (An extension of the ABL agent language with support for looping prediction suffix trees is proposed.) This approach will be applied to two innovative domains, user interactions with smart appliances and semi-autonomous agents in online gaming environments.",
