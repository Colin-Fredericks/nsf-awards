 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and scale-up an industrially robust and low cost chemical mechanical smoothening\r\n(CMS) process to produce atomically polished gallium nitride (GaN) on silicon substrates for high power and high frequency applications. As GaN is mechanically hard and\r\nchemically inert, traditional surface polishing processes have resulted in significant\r\nsurface damage which negatively affects the electrical performance. In contrast, the CMS\r\nprocess forms a soft layer on GaN surface which can be removed by nanoparticles. In the\r\nPhase II of this project, the company plans to further optimize and scale-up the CMS\r\nprocess. In conjunction with the compound semiconductor chip manufacturers and\r\nacademic partners, the company's plan is to further validate the polishing technology by\r\nfabricating and testing the performance of high electron mobility transistors. The research\r\nteam members are internationally recognized experts and are in an excellent position to\r\nexecute the research plan and attain the project goals.\r\n\r\nThe commercialization of the proposed polishing technology is expected to significantly\r\nimpact GaN based semiconductor technology used for high frequency, high power\r\nmicrowave devices in wireless mobile communication and radar defense systems. This\r\nprocess will accelerate commercialization of GaN on silicon technology by increasing\r\nyield and reducing manufacturing costs. \r\n",
