 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shaw University's HBCU-UP project, Academic Excellence through Research and Mentoring, is aimed at enhancing the quality of STEM majors for admission to graduate schools, increase the flow of minority students from high schools and community colleges into STEM programs at Shaw University, build technology infrastructure including a testing/tutorial center and provide faculty development activities to increase grant capability and undergraduate research involvement.\r\n\r\nShaw University has outlined an aggressive recruitment plan which includes family support activities, mentoring, tracking, and providing enrichment to the academic program such as internships, field trips, and conference attendance.\r\n\r\nThe academic component of the project will focus on strengthening the technology infrastructure and the traditional gatekeeper courses in mathematics and physics.  Funds will be used to equip a testing and tutorial center, as well as classrooms, and enhancing the living environment to support STEM student living-learning communities.  The technology enhancement will be closely linked to the curriculum initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe classroom instruction will be enhanced with the use of the computerized learning system developed at Clark Atlanta University.  This delivery system includes multimedia lecture notes, and online testing and management.  Other curriculum enhancements will include discovery approach for general chemistry courses, as well as innovative physics experiments.\r\n\r\nFaculty development activities in this implementation project will focus on strengthening faculty ability to obtain and manage grant funds, as well as increase faculty involvement in undergraduate research activities.\r\n",
