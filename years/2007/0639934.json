 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microtubules are ubiquitous eukaryotic structures, built of dimers of alpha- and beta tubulin.  They form the framework of many essential organelles, including centrioles, cilia, and the mitotic spindle.  Not much is known about how cells build and maintain complex organelles made of microtubules.  In this project, Dr. Gaertig and his colleagues will explore the hypothesis that cells use a set of post-translational tubulin modifications (PTMs) to mark the surface of microtubules.  The idea is that these marks represent the \"microtubule code,\" a set of structural signals that direct binding and activity of proteins to microtubules.  Dr. Gaertig has been studying the function of the so-called polymodification PTMs (tubulin glutamylation and glycylation), using the ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena, as a model.  These PTMs are evolutionarily conserved and abundant in vital organelles such as cilia and centrioles. The Tetrahymena model offers a powerful combination of genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches.\r\n\r\nBased on genetic data, Dr. Gaertig has identified a known microtubule severing factor, katanin, as a potential major effector protein that can \"read\" the polymodification marks on microtubules.  A mutation in the catalytic subunit of katanin phenocopied the mutation of the polymodification region on beta-tubulin.  Both types of mutants are nearly indistinguishable from each other.  They have excessively long cortical microtubules that obstruct the cleavage furrow, and they assemble only short paralyzed cilia which lack the central pair. Dr. Gaertig hypothesizes that in the cell body, polymodified cortical microtubules are preferentially severed by katanin to maintain their proper length via treadmilling, and that katanin participates in the production or assembly of ciliary tubulin precursors.  This research project seeks to determine the function, mutual interactions and localizations of two catalytic and a single noncatalytic subunit of katanin in Tetrahymena. Gene knockouts and conditional alleles will be used to evaluate the role of katanin at multiple stages of ciliogenesis.   Biochemical methods will be used to purify katanin complexes and to discover novel katanin-binding proteins. Purified katanin will be used to test whether its activity can be affected by the levels of glutamylation in an in vitro microtubule severing assay.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This project will study the role of a conserved microtubule severing factor, katanin, in the formation and maintenance of important eukaryotic organelles, cilia. The results should shed new light on whether and how tubulin glutamylation regulates katanin.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  This project will provide a training platform for 3 graduate Ph.D. students and a group of undergraduate students working on projects in Dr. Gaertig's  laboratory, including some who are members of groups that are under-represented in science.\r\n\r\n",
