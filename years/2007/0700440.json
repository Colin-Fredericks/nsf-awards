 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to develop a mechanics theory for the emerging field of stretchable electronics, i.e., electronics devices can be fully flexed and stretched while function, which will revolutionize many aspects of daily life, from artificial muscle to wearable computers.  To make brittle semiconductor materials (e.g., silicon) stretchable, mechanics plays an indispensable role.  The theory to be developed investigates the mechanics issues associated with stretchable electronics and eventually aids in realizing the function of full stretchability.  It is different from existing thin film studies in the following two aspects: (1) finite deformation effect since stretchable electronics may experience large deformation (more than 50% strain); and (2) extremely large thin film/substrate elastic mismatch, about 5 orders of magnitude difference in the elastic moduli of compliant substrate and stiff thin film in stretchable electronics.  The comprehensive investigation of these issues will provide the core knowledge needed for the successful development of stretchable electronics.\r\n\r\nThis work will result in new methodologies for the design and processing of thin film/substrate system for electronics with extremely high stretchability.  The proposed program also includes strong and active education programs.  Besides new course development based on the state-of-the-art knowledge of this field, on- and off-campus programs with specific emphasis on women and American Indian students, such as Summer Rotation for American Indians Students, will be developed to promote the involvement of underrepresented groups in the development of stretchable electronics.\r\n",
