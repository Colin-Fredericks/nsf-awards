The program focuses on computational neuroscience and technology and will engage 10 undergraduate students each year in an 8-week summer research program.  The goals of the site are to provide students with meaningful, computational neuroscience research experiences that: 1) improve the student's skills in applying the scientific method to hands-on research and train each student in modern research techniques in an inter-disciplinary environment; 2) develop student's skills in presentation and communication of their research work; 3) lead students to greater independence in pursuing their research interests; 4) encourage students to enter graduate programs in science or engineering; 5) contribute to an increased number of women, Hispanic and Native American students, and those from other underrepresented groups who enter and complete graduate programs in science and engineering; and 6) develop awareness of ethical issues in research and neuroscience.\r\n\r\nThis program will concentrate recruitment efforts on students from small institutions lacking significant research opportunities for undergraduates, women, Hispanic, Native Americans, other ethnic minorities, and groups historically underrepresented in the sciences and engineering.     . \r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
