 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of electrodynamic coupling between lightning discharges and the overlying ionosphere and radiation belts is explored by using (and expanding) an array of very-low-frequency (VLF) receivers known as the Holographic Array for Ionospheric/Lightning research (HAIL).  That array provides high-resolution measurements of local VLF disturbances generated in the ionosphere from the receivers distributed across the continental United States at rural high schools and community colleges.  The VLF disturbances are correlated with lightning data from the national Lightning Detection Network and with extremely low frequency (ELF) and VLF data from a broadband receiver in Indiana.  Specific objectives include development of a physical description of thunderstorm coupling to the radiation belts, a description of electrodynamic coupling between the troposphere, mesosphere, lower ionosphere and magnetosphere, and the effect of geomagnetic storms on ionospheric variability.  In addition, correlation of the HAIL VLF data with satellite measurements is used to quantify the influence of geomagnetic conditions on the loss of radiation belt electrons due to lightning generated whistler waves.",
