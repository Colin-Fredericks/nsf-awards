 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe proposed biosensing microsystem is intended for detecting biochemicals and pathogens using integrated microfluidics with ultra-low sample volume. Despite substantial research in microfluidics in past years,  the design and integration of resonant sensors ? which can offer very high sensitivity and resolution ? into the microfluidic systems has remained a challenge. The proposed approach offers a label-free detector that utilizes a bulk acoustic wave resonator in direct contact with the liquid sample; however it minimizes the drop in quality factor (Q) caused by liquid damping, which is essential to measure common the concentration range of proteins in typical biochemical samples (ca. 0.7 femtomol).  Decoupling of sensing and actuation mechanisms for the resonator helps to maximize Q, enabling the measurement minute frequency changes modulated by the mass of target analyte due to specific bindings between molecular probes (immobilizers) and target analytes in a liquid sample (eg. albumin, IgG, insulin, etc.).  This project is expected to lead to a collaborative research program with the participation of investigators from several departments and centers.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe outcome of the proposed research is expected to have significant impact in analytical instruments for biochemical applications. Due to inherent batch fabrication of MEMS, the biosensor can be arrayed to offer a series of detectors in a very small form factor. The applications include DNA analysis, toxic chemical detection, semi- or fully automated early diagnosis, therapeutic deployment, and early cancer detection. The ultra-small sample volume requirement can provide drastic time and cost reduction on general biochemical analysis.  Arizona State University and Fulton School of Engineering benefit from a state-wide population with large fraction of underrepresented minorities. In particular, among major engineering schools, it has the largest percent Hispanic (more than 10%) and American Indian (nearly 3%) undergraduate enrollment with an overall minority enrollment exceeding 25%. This project will engage targeted undergraduates in this research. \r\n\r\n",
