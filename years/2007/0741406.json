 "awd_abstract_narration": "ALGORITHMS, COMBINATORICS AND GEOMETRY\r\n\r\nKnowledge of mathematics and combinatorics is crucial to the design of combinatorial algo-\r\nrithms. Conversely, questions or concepts arising in the applications sometimes give rise to\r\ninteresting mathematical problems, or can be used to solve mathematical problems. Hence,\r\nany type of interaction between the discrete mathematics and the computer science commu-\r\nnities is beneficial to both groups and must be encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe University of North Texas in Denton will host a workshop focusing on algorithms, com-\r\nbinatorics and geometry. The workshop would focus on the mathematical and algorithmic\r\nproblems arising from combinatorial and geometric structures.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that the talks would introduce a broad range of fundamental and recent re-\r\nsults which would be of interest to the advanced and beginning researchers in combinatorics,\r\ncombinatorial and computational geometry, computational biology, geometric graph theory,\r\ntopology, theoretical computer science and graph drawing. It is further anticipated that the\r\nworkshop would bring together advanced researchers, as well as graduate students in many\r\nareas of discrete mathematics and computer science and engineering, and hence foster and\r\nfacilitate collaboration and joint research among different communities. To disseminate the\r\nknowledge presented at the workshop and to assess its impact, a special issue of a journal\r\nwill be selected for possible publication of a collection of the papers that relate to the main\r\ntheme of the workshop.\r\n",
