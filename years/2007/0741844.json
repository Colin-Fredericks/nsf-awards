The travel support is for students who might not otherwise be able to attend the workshop.  This workshop has emerged as an important workshop on underwater communication and networking, which is an increasingly important topic area due to a growing need for underwater monitoring for environmental and security applications.  The workshop seeks to encourage the participation of graduate students from electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science, and other related disciplines.  Students present their work in technical presentations, posters, and demonstrations and also participate in workshop organization and logistics.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The travel support can improve the education of graduate students through participation in the workshop and associated interaction with leading researchers and other students.  The selection process emphasizes support for those students who might not otherwise be able to attend the workshop.  The selection process also considers the student's research activity in underwater communication and networking.  Preference will be given to women and other students from underrepresented groups, thus addressing the need for increased diversity in research.\r\n",
