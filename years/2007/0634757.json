 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nAttaining broadcast channel capacity relies on dirty paper coding using nested lattice codes and quantization\r\nto codewords from a given coset; this in turn can be reduced to nearest-neighbor or maximum likelihood\r\ndecoding, solved in principle by the Viterbi algorithm applied to trellis codes. Capacity-approaching codes,\r\nhowever, have trellis descriptions with prohibitive complexities, restricting this technique to (lower performance)convolutional codes. Code word quantization via iterative decoding, which has links to constrained maximum likelihood sequence estimation, regrettably fails here as well, as documented within.\r\nTo overcome these limitations, we investigate successive code word quantization in two forms: the\r\nfirst draws on the rich structure of reduced-order Hankel-norm approximation from system theory, and\r\npursues its adaptation to trellis descriptions of capacity-approaching codes over finite fields. The goal is to\r\nobtain a reduced order (hence, lower complexity) trellis description amenable to Viterbi decoding, which in\r\nturn serves as the initial point for finer code word quantization. A parallel approach studies quantization\r\ndecoding\" using the variable code rate structure innate to nested codes; quantization is first performed using\r\na higher rate code, which rate is progressively reduced to the target rate.\r\nThe second problem concerns code book generation for multiple access channels. This draws on pseudorandom\r\ninterleaver design using modular arithmetic over prime factor fields, in order to parametrically generate\r\ndistinct user codes with minimal overlap. Unlike direct-sequence CDMA, whose spreading sequences\r\nare repetition codes devoid of coding gain, users are distinguished by their channel codes without additional\r\nrate loss from spreading sequences. The proposed technique generalizes the recently introduced interleaver\r\ndivision multiple access (IDMA) scheme, and preliminary results indicate improved performance in specific\r\nscenarios. In addition, by recasting interleavers as decryption keys, relations to secrecy systems will likewise be developed. The proposed framework accommodates secrecy suitable for mobile wireless systems,\r\noffering negligible overhead and freedom from export restrictions that may accompany strong encryption,\r\nas a first-line defense that must accompany the ubiquity of wireless network expanstion.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nIn addition to the direct benefits to multi-user communications from the expected results, many of the\r\ncoding/decoding configurations to be studied in the proposed research will be integrated into senior and\r\ngraduate level courses taught at the Catholic University of America, in the form of design projects that enhance students' abilities to master the interaction between information theory and reliable communications.\r\nIn addition, Hankel norm approximation tools, which have traditionally been better developed in the control\r\nfield, may serve to bridge some traditional divides between systems and communications researchers.",
