 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to CRA to coordinate a Principle Investigator (PI) meeting in November 2006 for the awardees of the NSF FIND (Future Internet Network Design) portion of the NSF NeTS program. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe PI meeting is a chance to bring FIND researchers together to learn about each others' proposed work and to provide a forum to discuss new ideas and future directions. In addition it will facilitate information sharing, community building, and the generation of research directions for participants in the FIND programs. \r\n\r\nCRA will be responsible for a number of tasks both prior to and during the workshop such as registering participants, distributing handouts, and arranging and staffing the meeting site. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe FIND initiative promises to have a long term impact on networking innovation and the NeTS vision.  During this community development meeting, attendees have the opportunity to associate with other researchers in their field, discuss forming research collaborations and present new ideas for future research directions within the programmatic area. \r\n",
