 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Igor B. Jouline of the Georgia Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Dr. Andrew Paterson of the University of Georgia and Dr. Mattheos Koffas of the University at Buffalo and with participation of several laboratories from Australia, Canada, Belgium, France, Germany and Israel to sequence the complete genome of the plant-associated bacterium Azospirillum brasilense. This bacterium has a potential to be developed as an organic fertilizer for important crops, such as wheat, rice, corn and sorghum. Azospirillum brasilense possesses unique biological characteristics that can also be used in the industrial production of important biological molecules, such as anti-oxidants. In order to fully uncover the biological, agronomical and industrial potential of this organism, its whole genome will be sequenced using the state-of-the-art high-throughput technology. Biological information will be derived from the genomic sequence using modern bioinformatic techniques and displayed to the entire academic community and general public in a user-friendly database on the Internet.\r\n\r\nThis grant will enable researchers and students in three public US universities to gain a unique experience in both experimental and biological science on the forefront of the genome technology. It will serve a purpose of promoting collaboration and communication between scientists in the United States and many foreign countries in cross-disciplinary areas: from agronomy to genetics to metabolic engineering. The future use of Azospirillum-based biological fertilizers will significantly decrease the danger of health problems associated with the current use of chemical fertilizers and will promote sustainable agriculture. Genomic sequence of Azospirillum obtained under this grant will enable metabolic engineers to develop a new generation of environmentally friendly biotechnological products.\r\n",
