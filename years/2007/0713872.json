 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Zhou, the principal investigator, proposes to develop computational \r\ntheory and methods for finding multiple unstable solutions to PDE \r\n(eigen) systems. Multiple unstable solutions, lowly or highly, singly or \r\nmultiply excited, to many nonlinear systems have been observed with very \r\ndifferent instabilities, maneuverabilities and configurations. Hence they \r\nimply a variety of applications. When multi-bodies (particles, molecules, \r\nspecies, etc.) are involved in a system, they may interact with each other \r\nin many different ways, such as strongly coupled vs. weakly coupled, \r\ncooperative vs. non-cooperative, definite vs. strongly indefinite, \r\nvariational vs. non-variational, etc. Thus mathematically systems can be \r\nclassified into many different types. Based on the results obtained from the \r\nprevious NSF funded project and several successful preliminary \r\ninvestigations, the PI proposes a new game theory methodology that treats \r\neach body in a system as a player. According to the interactions among all \r\nbodies, two-level local optimization methods will be developed to solve \r\nproposed problems and mathematical justification of those methods will be \r\nestablished. Several important model problems in Bose-Einstein condensates, \r\nnonlinear optics, biology and non-Darcian/Newtonian fluids/materials are \r\nproposed to solve for testing the new theory and methods. The instability \r\nindex of unstable solutions is important information for application and \r\nthus will be analyzed.\r\n\r\nUnstable solutions appear only in a short time period, but may have much \r\nhigher performance index. They used to be considered too hard to catch by \r\ntraditional technologies or numerical algorithms and thus too difficult to \r\napply. Thanks to new technologies (synchrotronic, laser), scientists are now \r\nable to induce or reach various unstable solutions and search for NEW \r\napplications, in particular, in system design and control of EMERGENCY \r\nmachineries for MISSION CRITICAL SITUATIONS. So far, understanding of such \r\nsolutions is still quite limited and analytic solutions are too difficult to \r\nobtain. Thus, development of efficient and reliable numerical methods to \r\nsolve such problems for multiple solutions in an order becomes very \r\nimportant to both research and applications. However, there is no theory in \r\nliterature to devise such a method. The outcome of this project will (1) \r\ngreatly enhance understanding of unstable solutions by mathematical \r\ncharacterizations and lay a solid foundation for future study, (2) provide \r\nefficient and reliable algorithms to compute multiple solutions so that \r\npeople can compare and then select the best one, and (3) promote new \r\napplications with new solution configurations.\r\n",
