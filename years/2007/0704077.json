 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Track 1 OEDG project will test the effectiveness of the Buffalo Geosciences Program model, developed with OEDG funding for Buffalo, New York, when modified and applied in Eastern Tennessee through the East Tennessee Geosciences Program (ETGP).  The project has three main activities. First, efforts will be made to integrate several existing diversity programs developed and implemented by the Univ. of Tennessee Center for Environmental Biotechnology (UT), the Chattanooga Creek Initiative (CCI), the Environmental Health and Justice Collaborative (EHJC) at Chattanooga Creek, the Tennessee Water Resources Research Center (WRRC), the Univ. of Tennessee Institute for a Secure and Sustainable Environment (ISSE), and the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences (EPS) GK-12 Partnerships. The project will also help to develop a regional presence for the geosciences, through its subprogram entitled ''Geoscience Opportunities for Learning and Discovery'' (aka ''GOLD'').  The ETGP GOLD component will represent an umbrella within the organization that includes the earth science education and community outreach efforts.  Organizations for targeted education and outreach in East Tennessee include higher education institutions [East Tennessee State University; Pellissippi State Technical Community College; University of Tennessee], more than 10 participating Knox County high schools, middle-schools and grade schools, and museums [ETSU Museum of Natural History and Visitors Center (Gray Fossil Site), American Museum of Science and Energy (Oak Ridge), Frank H. McClung Museum (Knoxville)]. Students from underrepresented populations will have the opportunity to participate in research projects, outreach presentations, seminars, field trips, international geoscience conferences, and tutoring/mentoring programs.  These opportunities are being facilitated by providing paid student internships to 6-12 minority students.",
