 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi User  program (CRIF:MU), the Chemistry Department at Tufts University will acquire a cryogenic stopped-flow instrument for rapid kinetic measurements.  The primary users of this instrument will be: (1) Elena Rybak-Akimova (Tufts University) whose research includes mechanism-based design of selective, efficient, switchable receptors and catalysts for oxidations and small-molecule activation reactions; (2) Daniel Nocera (MIT) whose research interests include developing chemical systems for solar energy conversion, and fundamental understanding of complicated oxidation-reduction mechanisms; (3) William Armstrong (Boston College) whose research interests include understanding and modeling of the active site of the water-oxidizing complex in Photosystem II; (4) John Caradonna (Boston University) who is developing catalysts for green  alkane oxidations; (5) Richard Holm (Harvard) whose research is centered around understanding nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase, and oxygen atom transfers by molybdenum- and tungsten oxidative enzymes; (6) Christopher Cummins (MIT) whose research focuses on utilization of atmospheric nitrogen and other pnictogens, understanding the mechanisms of atom and group transfer, and timing and taming radical chemistry through coordination to metal centers.\r\n\r\nA stopped flow instrument is used to investigate the speed of chemical reactions, often very fast reactions.  This cryogenic instrument will operate over a broad temperature range and reach temperatures as low as -90 degrees C.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be trained in this specialized methodology.  They will learn to use a rational, mechanism-based approach in chemical research, and will be exposed to research ideas, culture, and methodologies from several groups. Rapid kinetics methodology will be incorporated in upper-level undergraduate courses.  The remote access to data acquisition and processing will advance cyber-infrastructure for chemistry research.  \r\n",
