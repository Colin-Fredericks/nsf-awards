 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports theoretical and computational research on\r\nthermoelectric materials.  In these materials, the flow of heat and\r\nelectric charge are linked in a way that makes it possible to convert\r\nelectrical current into heat flow for cooling purposes, or to convert\r\nheat flow into electrical current for power generation. Thermoelectric\r\ndevices are already used in specialized applications, but improved\r\nmaterials that allow more efficient device operation are needed. This\r\nproject will use theory and computation to search for novel materials\r\nwith improved thermoelectric properties for cooling applications.  The\r\nresearch will address the roles of both electrons and lattice vibrations\r\nin the transport of heat and electric charge in thermoelectric\r\nmaterials.  Materials with strong electron-electron interactions will be\r\ninvestigated, both in bulk form, as well as in artificially engineered\r\nnanostructures.  The goal is to develop efficient and accurate\r\ncomputational methods that can be used to identify promising classes of\r\nmaterials that optimize competing factors relevant for cooling and to\r\nelucidate ways in which nanostructures can be used to modify both charge\r\nand heat flow to improve thermoelectric performance.\r\n\r\nThis project supports the training of graduate students, both in the\r\nacademic research environment and in the industrial R&D context.  The\r\nproject also provides research experiences for undergraduate students,\r\nand supports the continued development and assessment of a course in\r\nquantum mechanics and materials science for non-science students.  A\r\nrelated outreach program will introduce the wonders of the quantum world\r\nto elementary-school students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
