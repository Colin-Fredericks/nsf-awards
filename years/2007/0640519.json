 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural hybridization among primates is relatively rare, and most known cases occur among Old World species. In New World primates, natural hybridization has only been observed in very closely related small-bodied monkeys. Dr. Cortes Ortiz will investigate a recently described primate hybrid system that involves two large-bodied species of Neotropical monkeys, mantled and black howler monkeys from Mesoamerica. These species have been separated for about three million years and possess distinct social and mating systems and some degree of reproductive isolation. They are currently hybridizing in southern Mexico where fieldwork for this research will take place.\r\n\r\nDr. Cortes Ortiz will collect various molecular genetic data from pure and hybrid individuals to genetically characterize the extent of hybridization and the degree of gene introgression. Analyses of morphological and morphometric data of individuals genetically characterized as pure and hybrids will also permit evaluation of the role of selection in the hybridization of primate species with complex and distinct social systems. Results from this work will illuminate the origins of reproductive incompatibility in primates as well as enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which primate species, including our own, may have arisen.  This work provides international research experiences for US undergraduate students in Mexico, fosters international scientific collaboration, and will make available new genetic information to the scientific community.\r\n\r\n",
