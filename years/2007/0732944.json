The Polaris Project is engaging students and early career scientists in a multifaceted effort that includes: a field course and research experience for undergraduate students in the Siberian Arctic; several new arctic-focused undergraduate courses taught by project Co-PIs at their respective colleges across the United States and in Russia; the opportunity for Co-PIs to initiate research programs in the Siberian Arctic; and a wide range of outreach activities. The unifying scientific theme for the project is the transport and transformations of carbon and nutrients as they move with water from terrestrial uplands to the Arctic Ocean. Given the rapid changes underway in the Arctic, the broader impact of this project is found in the availability of project related materials; its training of future leaders in arctic research and education as well as its education of the public through student and faculty visits to K-12 classrooms; student generated and maintained blogs on their research and experiences; and inclusion in the GoNorth curriculum (www.polarhusky.com) which is used in thousands of K-12 schools worldwide. \r\n",

This is a central issue in arctic system science, and the project scientists were selected in part because of their potential to bring fresh insights to this complex topic. \n\nPolaris Project research has already led to 5 journal articles and more than 40 published abstracts, many of which had undergraduates as lead authors.  At the recent State of the Arctic conference (March 2010), 9 Polaris Project students presented their research.  Four of these were among the 25 students receiving grants to support their conference travel (out of 81 total applications), and they were the only undergraduates to receive awards.  At the American Geophysical Meeting in San Francisco (Dec. 2010), a total of 17 Polaris Project presentations were given.  Several of these students have already entered graduate school.  We anticipate that the number of Polaris alumni entering graduate school will continue to grow, and that one of the greatest legacies of the project will be the development of a generation of arctic scientists with broad interdisciplinary and international research experience. \n\nThe affiliated on-campus courses were also highly successful in advancing undergraduate learning about arctic ecosystem science and awareness of human-accelerated changes in the Arctic.
