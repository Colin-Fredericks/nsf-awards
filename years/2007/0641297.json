 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project supports basic taxonomic studies on North American truffle fungi belonging in the genus Tuber (Fungi, Ascomycota, Pezizales).  Truffles produce underground mushrooms that are widely sought as edible fungi by humans and foraging animals;  as mycorrhizal fungi, truffles are also important components of healthy forest ecosystems. The primary aims of this project are: 1) To establish an authoritative phylogenetic classification system for Tuber species based on DNA evidence; 2) To define taxonomic groupings within several species complexes and widely distributed taxa;  3) To integrate and assign unidentified Tuber species from environmental samples (mycorrhiza and soil samples); 4) To establish a database for North American, European and Asian species with descriptions, digital images, and tools for web-based identification of unknown truffle species.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first study to summarize our knowledge of global truffle diversity based on modern methods using DNA sequences combined with classic taxonomic approaches.  This research project will also provide training in mycology and molecular ecology for several graduate and undergraduate students. Outreach activities include workshops and partnerships with amateur and commercial truffling groups, including development of online resources.\r\n",
