Freeman, U of Texas Austin\r\n\r\nIn this NIRT proposal, the University of Texas researchers (PIs) will explore and develop new nano-composite membranes, based on polymers containing a new family of active nano-particles (NPs) that synergistically enhance the membrane's gas separation and catalytic capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit focuses on preparation of previously synthetically inaccessible, tailor-made NPs, dispersing them into polymers and characterizing the influence of these novel particles on permeation, transport, and catalytic reaction of gas molecules in the nanocomposites. The PIs employ a synergistic combination of both theoretical and experimental components: 1) developing the theory and numerical models describing molecular binding and dissociation on alloy NP surfaces to guide the selection of suitable alloy materials, and 2) designing monomer and polymer \"hooks\" into the matrices to assist in NP dispersion, thereby increasing the membrane's separation and catalytic properties. A key feature of the project is understanding the conformation of monomer and polymer molecules on the NP surface and how the structures are assembled into membranes.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project encompass a wide range of anticipated outcomes that benefit society. The research will integrate Master K-12 science and math teachers and students from the Texas School for the Deaf. The project in cooperation with UTEACH, a summer MA in Science and Mathematics Education program designed to produce the next generation of Master Teacher leaders, will yield cohorts of individuals who return to their classrooms and districts as highly qualified content and instructional specialists. This activity has great potential impact because it targets the future leaders and opinion makers in K-12 science education. A second unique program will bring high school students from the Texas School for the Deaf into the University of Texas labs each year for a 4-6 week summer research experience. TSD is eager to be involved; deaf students are frequently ignored in outreach programs. They will provide an on-site ASL translator and other support to ensure a successful experience. \r\n\r\nFinally, the PIs will reach families and children from all backgrounds through presentations at the popular Science Sundays at the Austin Children's Museum. These no-cost Sunday afternoon programs translate sophisticated concepts into hands-on activities that make science and engineering accessible to all.\r\n\r\nGeneral applications of nano-structured membranes include separating different gas molecules and chemically changing specie using a catalytic reaction. We will investigate two key applications: olefin-paraffin separation, and the purification of H2 gas by elimination of CO, a contaminant. Olefin-paraffin separations process more than 160 billion kg/yr of ethylene and propylene worldwide, and H2 production in the U.S. is about 1 billion kg/yr. The PIs project significant energy savings if nano-composite membranes reduce the energy costs of these applications alone. Because the science the PIs develop will be broadly applicable to other separations and catalytic reactions, the benefit will be compounded. The project primarily addresses the NIRT theme of Hierarchical Nano-manufacturing through the multiscale nature of the nano-composite membranes and the scale up of the required nano-particle manufacturing processes, and secondarily the theme Active Nanostructures through the University of Texas nano-structured catalysts and novel separation systems with molecular resolution.\r\n",
