 "awd_abstract_narration": "New concepts will be developed for sensing and control of noise and vibration in structures. Sensing of individual strain components in a plane requires three independent measurements, typically using a strain Rosette.  The concept of the strain Rosette to piezoelectric materials that can be used for both directional sensing and directional actuation will be extended.  This will be accomplished through designed anisotropy, an approach in which a combination of the physical structure, the crystallographic orientation, and the domain structure of the sensor/actuator element are concurrently designed to obtain desired couplings to the host structure.  Research will involve feedback and control, optimal sensor/actuator location and spatial distribution, as well as exploration of feedback techniques based on negative capacitance amplifiers.  New design and analysis tools will be developed for these sensor/actuator components.  Student involvement will include undergraduate (UG) research helpers, MS students, and PhD students.  An international component will bring in multicultural interactions and experience.  Research results will be carried through to the classroom and UG instructional laboratories.  Results will be broadly disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations, and collaborations with other research groups.",
