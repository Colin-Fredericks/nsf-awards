 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the central events in particle physics will be the turning on of the Large Hadron\r\nCollider (LHC) at CERN in 2007. Together with the Tevatron, this machine promises to\r\nexplore the energies relevant to electroweak symmetry breaking, the source of which\r\nremains one of the great mysteries of the field. Solving this mystery will shed light on\r\nthe origin of mass for fundamental particles (such as the electron), and on the reason\r\nthe weak force is short ranged. Electroweak physics might also hold the key to the\r\nidentity of the dark matter of the universe, and its discovery at the LHC is an extremely\r\nexciting possibility. However, it might not be easy to disentangle the signals that we see\r\nat the accelerator. Even though a weakly coupled supersymmetric Standard Model\r\nextension remains an attractive option, recently there have been several interesting\r\nproposals for non-supersymmetric scenarios. These utilize non-perturbative dynamics\r\nboth in 4D field theory and in holographically related 5D versions of 4D field theory.\r\nSuch extensions of the Standard Model (SM) might result in fairly similar experimental\r\nsignatures both to each other and to certain types of supersymmetry. It is therefore very\r\nimportant that theorists who are familiar with a variety of different mechanisms for\r\nelectroweak symmetry breaking continue developing both novel theoretical frameworks,\r\nas well as study possible signatures with close communication with experimentalists. It\r\nwill thus be more likely that we shall be prepared for the surprises that nature has in\r\nstore for us at the LHC. The PI hence intends to explore options for electroweak\r\nphysics with emphasis on models which include forms of strong dynamics, and on ways\r\nto distinguish their experimental signatures at the LHC. In terms of broader impact, the\r\nPI has an established relationship with Needham High School, where he has made\r\narrangements to give a series of lectures about particle physics, the science lifestyle,\r\nand the opportunities it offers for exploration and communication. The idea is to\r\nencourage young people, and especially women to get excited about theoretical\r\nphysics, both through conversation about the experiences of being a theorist, as well as\r\ndiscussion of new developments in theory research, emphasizing the current\r\nexcitement in the field concerning the LHC.",
