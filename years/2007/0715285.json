 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Americas Program award will support a joint U.S./Mexico workshop on Holomorphic Dynamics to be held from May 23 to May 26, 2007 in Zacatecas, Mexico. The workshop will be organized on the U.S. side by Rodrigo A. Perez of Indiana University-Purdue University (IUPUI) and Araceli Medina-Bonifant of the University of Rhode Island (URI), and, and on the Mexican side, by Monica Moreno-Rocha of  the Center for Mathematical Research (CIMAT) in Guanajuato, Mexico. The workshop will take place within the context of a joint meeting of the American Mathematical Society and the Sociedad Matematica Mexicana.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will be dedicated to the memory of Adrien Douady, a pioneer in the field,\r\nand will bring together many of his closest collaborators, students, and friends from both countries. Holomorphic Dynamics brings together diverse areas of mathematics such as complex analysis, algebraic geometry, combinatorics and probability. The field blossomed in the early 1980s with the work of A. Douady and J. Hubbard on polynomial dynamics, and has been an active area of research ever since.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will involve discussions of new research directions stemming from the recent solution of some long-standing problems proposed by Douady and Hubbard. Publication of a problem list compiled during the workshop will be a direct outcome of the meeting.  In addition, the workshop will expose U.S. graduate students to current research in holomorphic dynamics. This workshop is being jointly supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering of NSF. \r\n",
