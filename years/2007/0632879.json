It is also implementing formative assessment tools that give the graduate teaching assistants opportunities to reflect upon their teaching and their implementation of effective learning science principles within engineering laboratories.  Using the \"How People Learn\" (HPL) framework, the PIs are guiding the development of course materials and a classroom environment, providing opportunities for graduate teaching assistants within an innovative first-year engineering laboratory course to reflect deeply upon their pedagogical practices.  By creating professional development opportunities for graduate teaching assistants that focus on understanding the science and principles of learning and teaching, they are attaining HPL environments in engineering laboratories that promote all students' higher level learning and retention.\r\n",
