Mathematically, the problem is equivalent to the\r\nrelaxation of a multivariable variational problem with a\r\npiece-wise quadratic multiwell Lagrangian.  The investigator\r\nstudies new sufficient conditions (bounds) and special minimizing\r\nsequences (microstructures).  A new technique called localized\r\npolyconvexification is explored that refines the known\r\npolyconvexification procedure by deriving and accounting for new\r\npointwise constraints on minimizers.  A complementary technique\r\nis considered for determining complicated minimizing\r\nlaminate-based sequences.  Several examples of optimal conducting\r\nand elastic multimaterial structures are worked out; there could\r\nbe used for optimal design of multimaterial structures. \r\n\r\n     The investigator studies how to place several materials of\r\ndifferent conductivity or stiffness in a periodic composite\r\nstructure in order to maximize its overall conductivity or\r\nstiffness.  In a sense, the problem remains a jigsaw puzzle that\r\nasks to build an optimal mosaic from pieces of different physical\r\nproperties.  The mosaic can be two- or three-dimensional.  Work\r\non this problem was started in 1963 by the famous paper by Hashin\r\nand Shtrikman.  The problem is solved for two mixing materials,\r\nand the suggested novel approach allows to extend the results to\r\nmore than two materials.  The obtained optimal microstructures\r\nare diverse and unpredictable.  The best possible composites from\r\ngiven components can be used in manufacturing of artificial\r\nmaterials and structural design.  The underlying mathematics,\r\nwhen developed, should also help to better understand and control\r\nsmart materials and phase transitions in solids and similar\r\nphenomena of self-organization in heterogeneous materials. \r\n",
