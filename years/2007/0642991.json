Dr. Speck will use a range of techniques including \r\nspectroscopy, imaging and modeling, incorporating new laboratory data and taking \r\ninto account theoretical models and meteoritic studies to provide knowledge of \r\nthe nature of dust forming around LIMS.  This study will also assess \r\nhow dust formation changes with stellar evolution. In this way, the effect of \r\nchemistry and density on dust formation can be determined, allowing testing \r\nand refinement of existing models for dust formation and evolution and which \r\ncan be applied to many astrophysical environments.\r\n\r\nOne of the major problems in investigating circumstellar dust is that it \r\nincorporates so many apparently disparate aspects of the physical sciences \r\n(physics, astronomy, geology, and chemistry).  In order to provide a background \r\nand framework for such knowledge, Dr. Speck will introduce an \r\nupper level/graduate astrophysics course in cosmochemistry that will be open to \r\nstudents from other departments as well.  Dr. Speck's research is specifically \r\ndesigned to involve students at all levels (undergraduate, masters and doctoral) \r\nand therefore breaks down into modular chunks. In this way the research \r\nundertaken also allows for training of students at these various levels.  \r\nDr. Speck will continue her effort to recruit and mentor female graduate \r\nstudents as well as students from other underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded by the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences",
