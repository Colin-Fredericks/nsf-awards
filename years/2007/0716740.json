 "awd_abstract_narration": "Society is dependent on many engineered systems whose increasing\r\ncomplexity and inter-connectedness have, in turn, increased their\r\nvulnerability to adversarial attacks.  In many of these systems,\r\nprotecting the execution of their computations is as crucial as\r\nensuring the security of their data.  This research investigates how\r\nto maintain survivable operation of such systems, even in the face of\r\ninvasive attacks where computations are intentionally subverted to\r\ninterfere with other computations' execution constraints.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to develop new techniques for isolating\r\nthe effects of interactions among computations through specific\r\nresources in these systems, including: flexible specification and\r\nrigorous enforcement of computations' execution constraints; explicit\r\ncontrol of all OS kernel components under a single scheduler; detailed\r\non-line monitoring of computations and their supporting OS kernel\r\ncomponents; automated learning to discover previously unknown\r\ninteractions among computations; and formal modeling and verification\r\nof computations, execution constraints, and system components and\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nThe expected benefits of this project include: a novel approach to\r\nnon-bypassable isolation of computations from the effects of\r\nadversarial attack in which isolation can be enforced flexibly\r\naccording to the system-specific execution constraints that must be\r\nsatisfied; a high quality open-source software implementation of\r\nkernel-level scheduling and monitoring services that provide and\r\nmeasure such non-bypassable isolation; new formal models, analyses,\r\nand methodologies for verifiably correct configuration and management\r\nof those services; and empirical studies of the services' ability to\r\nprotect computations from interference under a wide range of\r\nadversarial attacks.",
