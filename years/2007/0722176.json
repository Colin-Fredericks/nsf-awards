Partners include the University of Washington-Bothell computer science/information technology (IT) program as well as IT computer science/transfer programs at Bellevue, Shoreline, and Cascadia Community Colleges. The Society for Information Management will provide industry-based validation. \r\n\r\nThe project will focus on redesigning the first year of a computer science program to retain and support community college students in computer science transfer programs, thereby addressing attrition and promoting more computer science degree holders. The team will:\r\n\r\nadapt existing curricula in first-year math, science, and computer science courses to enhance learning for students;\r\n\r\ninvestigate and create learning experiences wherein students complete difficult technical requirements in an integrated format; and\r\n\r\nresearch the effectiveness of alternative pedagogical methodologies, mentorship by advanced students, and the establishment of learning communities.\r\n\r\nThe technology-rich Seattle area provides an excellent test-bed for evaluating new computing pathway models. The project team will collaborate with community colleges locally and ATE centers nationally to develop pilot sites for the new models.\r\n\r\n",
