 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project pursues the vision of a community that shares resources in an open\r\nmanner. Similar to today's web publication and discovery of documents, computer\r\napplications, machine cycles, and databases can be announced openly and used by\r\nothers worldwide.\r\n\r\nA big issue in realizing this vision is to create facilities that help manage\r\nthe diversity of available resources and adapt them to the users' needs. Thus,\r\npublished software modules may be adapted to compose new application programs;\r\ndiscovered programs may be tuned to the user's platform; distributed\r\napplications may run at high performance, as they adapt to changing bandwidth\r\nand latency characteristics of the target environment. This project develops\r\nsuch facilities. Building on results of prior NSF support, an adaptive\r\nengine will dynamically improve the performance of distributed computer\r\napplications; it will adaptively compose software modules from components; and\r\nit will support computer applications that roam across discovered machine\r\nplatforms. These components are being integrated in the iShare Internet sharing\r\nsystem, which provides the environment for resource publication, discovery, and\r\nremote use.\r\n\r\nComponents of this system are being created in related NSF projects, which synergistically complement the present project.\r\n\r\nThis work addresses a fundamental problem in computer system and software\r\ndesign: optimal design decisions are often impossible because insufficient\r\ninformation is available at design-time. The adaptive engine moves design\r\ndecisions to the time application software executes, when this information becomes\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThe project is expected to yield significant performance improvements of the\r\ninvolved compilers, composers, and application software, substantially facilitating the way the involved resources can be shared by the global community.\r\n\r\n",
