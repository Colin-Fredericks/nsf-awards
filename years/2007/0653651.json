 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to synthesize necklace-shaped boron and boride nanowires to realize the interlocking mechanism in polymer nanocomposites. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method will be employed to produce large quantities of necklace-shaped boron and boride nanowires. Research and educational activities will feature a systems-level focus spanning synthesis, structural characterization, and mechanical property measurement of necklace-shaped boron-based nanowires, and fabrication of boron-polymer nanocomposites. Guided by theory and experiment, the proposed research will seek an in-depth understanding of the synthesis mechanisms of necklace-shaped boron and boride nanowires as well as the interlocking strengthening mechanism in the proposed boron-polymer composites.  The project will accelerate the development of a new family of one-dimensional nanomaterials  necklace-shaped boron and boride nanowires by directly targeting lightweight, high strength polymer nanocomposites of major technological and economic interest. \r\n\r\nThe outcomes of this research are anticipated to impact a broad range of fields related to the development of nanomanufacturing techniques and nanocomposites. The proposed work will open up opportunities for the fabrication of boron-polymer composites with mechanical properties surpassing those of carbon nanotube-polymer composites. The boron-polymer nanocomposites may exhibit new functionalities, for instance, superconductivity from MgB2 nanowires. The interwoven structure of the proposed program",
