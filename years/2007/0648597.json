 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry supports the renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Harvey Mudd College (HMC).  Adam Johnson is the site's Program Director.  Eight REU students will be supported for a ten-week research program with additional students being supported by institutional funds and faculty research grants.  The major focus is on individual research in a range of chemical disciplines in close collaboration with HMC faculty mentors. Research activities will be supplemented by workshops in ethics, chemical safety, and information retrieval, and students will present their work in at least two public forums during the program.  Many students also will present their research results at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society.  This site will continue to recruit women and also will encourage participation of underrepresented students from local institutions (two- and four-year institutions located in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties) with limited summer research opportunities.  The evaluation and assessment of the research experience at HMC will be administered by the HMC Offices of Assessment and of the Dean of Faculty.  An anonymous program evaluation form will provide feedback on students' research experiences.  HMC also participates in a long-term study on the impact of research on science undergraduates, carried out in collaboration with Hope, Grinnell and Wellesley Colleges.",
