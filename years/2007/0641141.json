 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project illustrates plans for the continued development of a high level research program in membrane excitability and ion channel research, and its incorporation into an educational plan that involves junior undergraduate and high school minority student exposure and participation in scientific research. The intellectual merit of this research centers on understanding the role that the novel cytoskeletal protein Kelch-like 1 (KLHL1) plays in the modulation of voltage-gated calcium channel function. Calcium channel function is critical for intracellular communication, and is particularly important in the electrical activity of the brain. This research will expand knowledge of the role that structural proteins play in calcium channel function in general and in brain functions such as learning and cognition, when bursts of electrical activity occur. The specific aims are to: 1) Map the molecular regions that are involved in modulation of a1H T-type channels by the actin-binding protein KLHL1. 2) Determine the physiological impact of the genetic elimination of KLHL1 in neurons from a mouse model. 3) Recruit minority undergraduate students to science as a career and involve them in hypothesis-driven, high-caliber basic scientific research. Activities to encourage participation of junior undergraduate minority students in research and in careers in science will be organized, such as Outreach Science Seminars, and the involvement of minority undergraduate students in full-time hands-on summer research. Students will be actively involved in research, seminar attendance and data presentation which will enable them to learn new techniques, develop scientific ideas and critical thinking, and be exposed to the thrill of science. The broader impacts of this project are primarily to inspire minority students into considering the possibility of future careers in science, using the P.I.'s career path as a role model; and to expose students interested in science to all aspects of high caliber, hands-on scientific research in the laboratory.",
