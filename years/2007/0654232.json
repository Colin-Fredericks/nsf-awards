 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE) is a rapidly growing area that has demonstrated the potential to revolutionize a wide range of significant applications. The goal of this project is to promote a more comprehensive understanding of the NSE domain by:  (1) developing the NSE patent analysis framework to analyze patents filed in multiple international patent offices;\r\n(2) providing assessments of worldwide NSE development status represented in multiple patent offices' patents based on bibliographic and content analysis; and (3) performing in-depth co-invention and citation analysis to study the collaboration and knowledge diffusion between countries/institutions. The proposed work will comprise three major\r\ncomponents: data acquisition, cleaning, and indexing; NSE patent landscape analysis; and collaboration and knowledge diffusion analysis.  \r\n\r\nIf successful, this work will support monitoring of future global NSE development, and help potential sponsors, government agencies, business entities and others understand the status of research and development in NSE as well as the collaborations and interactions between countries in the NSE field.  The methodology and tools developed for this research are extensible to other fields for similar research.\r\n",
