 "awd_abstract_narration": "Burns will be continuing his studies of partially hyperbolic dynamical \r\nsystems. This area has seen great progress in the last decade after the \r\nbreakthrough work of Pugh and Shub, who established ergodicity for volume \r\npreserving perturbations of the time one map of the geodesic flow of a \r\nsurface of constant negative curvature. A series of papers, culminating in \r\nrecent work of Burns and Wilkinson, has established ergodicity for a very \r\ngeneral class of volume preserving partially hyperbolic systems. This work \r\nappears to have pushed current techniques to their limit, but still falls \r\nshort of a complete understanding of when volume preserving partially \r\nhyperbolic systems are ergodic; new ideas are needed. Burns will continue \r\nto study this question as well as various special examples of partially \r\nhyperbolic dynamical systems, in particular compact group extensions of \r\nhyperbolic basic sets. He will also consider geometrical questions about \r\nthe geodesic which are closely related to the work on partial \r\nhyperbolicity.\r\n\r\nPartially hyperbolic dynamical systems are important because they model \r\nphenomena which occur in nature and because, at least in some examples, it \r\nis possible to completely understand the mechanisms which create the \r\nobserved phenomena. Partial hyperbolicity is to be expected in systems \r\nwhich have a fast-slow dynamics in which one aspect of the systems \r\noperates on a short time scale and other aspects operate on a longer time \r\nscale. There is now a good understanding of how partial hyperbolicity \r\ngives rise to highly chaotic behaviour in many situations.\r\n",
