 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the third FASEB Summer Conference on Ion Channel Regulation to be held June 9-14, 2007 in Snowmass, Colorado. Unlike many other meetings, this conference is designed to be integrative and interdisciplinary in nature, bringing together investigators from the fields of biophysics, biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, physiology and neuroscience. The scientific goal of this meeting is to explore complex regulation of ion channel expression, trafficking, \"secondary\"  activities (e.g., enzymatic) and biological functions by a variety of signaling mechanisms involving G protein cascades, second messengers, protein phosphorylation, cytoskeleton and membrane lipids.  The conference is expected to bring together ~120 ion channel investigators in an environment that permits free interdisciplinary exchange of information and ideas via oral presentations, posters and informal interactions between senior and junior investigators from different fields. Special efforts will be made to facilitate the active participation of junior investigators, women and other under-represented groups. Fourteen female speakers are currently on the agenda, and eight more speakers will be selected for short talks based on the submitted abstracts, with preference given to junior investigators (new PIs, outstanding postdoctoral fellows and senior graduate students). To attract investigators from underrepresented groups, financial support in the form of \"Conference Fellowships\" will be provided.  Support from NSF will be used exclusively for fellowships to assist 12 junior investigators or investigators who are members of under-represented groups to attend the meeting and present a poster or short talk.",
