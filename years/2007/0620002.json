 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary \r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is to argue for a new solution to the measurement\r\nproblem (MP): a solution under the idealization of macroscopic limit (ML). MP is one of the main\r\nproblems, if not the problem, at the foundations of physics. Because this is the last, and the most\r\nimportant, part of my multi-stage effort that in the past six or so years has produced works on the\r\nnature of idealization and approximation, of model-building, of thermodynamic limit, of phase\r\ntransitions and critical phenomena, of laws of nature, and of classical and quantum spontaneous\r\nsymmetry breaking (SSB), some of which are supported by a previous NSF grant (No. SES-\r\n9910889), its results, apart from their own merit, will validate and improve on results in those areas.\r\nThis final project may be seen as a test and showcase of my previous contributions to philosophy of\r\nscience. The difficulty of MP centers on an apparent contradiction between what theories\r\nhypothesize happens at the micro-level and what happens at the macro-level. All existing attempts to\r\nsolve the problem make what seems to be an inescapable assumption that all systems involved are of\r\nfinite number of degrees of freedom (or finite). But finite quantum systems harbor ineliminatable\r\nsuperpositional effects, just as all finite thermo-systems harbor fluctuations; and such effects seem to\r\nmake a rigorous solution of MP impossible. I propose that we drop the assumption. There is a\r\nsound and rigorous mathematical way (the algebraic approach) to imagine, with properly taken limits,\r\nthat the systems involved are of infinite number of degrees of freedom (or infinite). Moreover, SSB\r\nis only possible under ML, and it can be used to replace the notion of the 'collapse' of wave functions\r\nin the orthodox formulation. The broader impacts of this project are many-fold. Given its nature,\r\nthis project will mainly produce research papers (and possibly a monograph) and lectures or talks to\r\naudiences of both experts and general public interested in philosophy and physics. Because the\r\nproject tackles MP, the arguably single most important problems in the foundations of physics, the\r\nreverberation of its results is far-reaching. Historians of quantum physics and of the revolution of\r\nmodern physics will find the spirit of the proposed solution closer to the views of the founders of\r\nquantum physics (Bohr et al and the Copenhagen school). Researchers interested in the symbiotic\r\nrelationships between disciplines of science will find it interesting to see how a recalcitrant orthodox\r\nposition in quantum physics -- the Hilbert-space approach -- is unseated (if I am right) by results in\r\nsolid state physics; or how the 'foundation' of quantum physics is shaken by models in solid state (a\r\nmuch less fundamental and hence neglected area in foundational studies). A solution to MP that\r\nchallenges the prevailing bias in the conception of quantum physics should open the door for new\r\npossibilities in the field, which should get the attention of theoretical physicists and mathematicians.\r\nEvery effort will be made to incorporate the results into my teaching, to give talks at the community\r\ncollege at Jacksonville and at nearby universities of north and central Florida, as well as at\r\nprofessional meetings and colloquia here and abroad.",
