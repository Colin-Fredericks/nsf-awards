 "awd_abstract_narration": "Very small 19-25 nucleotide RNAs, termed microRNA (miRNA) and silencing RNA (siRNA), have emerged in recent years as key components of major genetic regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.  While there are similarities between animals and plants both in the small RNA regulatory mechanisms and in their biogenesis, the details differ markedly. In plants, both miRNAs and siRNAs primarily target complementary RNAs for destruction, while in animals miRNAs largely modulate translation. The 21-22 nt miRNAs of plants are important in meristem function, leaf polarity, floral identity and timing, as well as root and vascular development. The longer 24-25 nt siRNAs are involved in viral and pathogen resistance, transgene and transposon silencing, and heterochromatin formation.  \r\n\r\nMiRNAs are derived from short stem-loop segments of precursors (pri-miRNAs) encoded in the genome either as separate genes or within the transcripts of conventional genes, sometimes in introns.  SiRNAs are derived from longer, largely double-stranded RNA molecules that are either produced endogenously or introduced exogenously.  Although originally thought to be separate systems, regulatory mechanisms have been described that involve both miRNA and siRNA.  The biogenesis of miRNAs in Arabidopsis involves an RNAseIII-family enzyme called Dicerlike1 (DCL1), a dsRNA-binding protein called Hyponastic Leaves1 (HYL1) and an RNA methyl transferase called HUA enchancer1 (HEN1).  It may also require a protein encoded by the recently identified SERRATE (SE) gene.\r\n\r\nPrevious work in this laboratory established that the HYL1 protein is required for processing pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA. The overall goal of this project is to understand the function of the HYL1 protein in miRNA biogenesis through the following specific 3 objectives: 1) characterizing the HYL1 complex, 2) reconstituting miRNA processing in vitro, and 3) investigating the mechanism of pri-miRNA processing and regulation of miRNA genes.  Recent progress in the laboratory has allowed an expansion in possible approaches to identifying the proteins involved in miRNA precursor processing.  By co-expressing GFP fusion proteins, it was established that DCL1 and HYL1 co-localize to small perinucleolar bodies that are distinct from the similar Cajal bodies that contain the RNA silencing machinery, designated  Microprocessor centers. The recent construction of a number of molecular tools puts the project in a good position to reconstitute miRNA processing in vitro, to rapidly analyze the RNA structural requirements for correct miRNA processing and to define the functions of various proteins in pri-miRNA processing.  Finally, the regulation of genes encoding the miRNAs themselves will be investigated.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. This project will enlarge our understanding of an extremely important aspect of gene regulation involving small RNAs in plants.  Studies on the HYL1 protein will enhance our basic understanding of miRNA biogenesis in plants, while the regulatory studies will deepen our understanding of the miRNA regulatory hierarchy. \r\n\r\nBroader impact. Viral resistance based on small RNA-mediated mechanisms has already proven valuable in agriculture.  Greater understanding of small RNA mechanisms is likely to generate beneficial applications, facilitating the development of inducible small RNA-based mechanisms that may allow plants to withstand more extreme environmental conditions than they can at present without compromising their productivity.    \r\n",
