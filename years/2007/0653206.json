A two-tiered cohort program is in place with students enrolled in either a pre-STEM cohort or a STEM cohort based on their prior level of math preparation. The students in the cohorts are being supported through expanded student recruitment, learning communities, faculty and peer mentoring, field experiences, career explorations, financial scholarship incentives, and a systemic change in mathematics instruction. The mathematics instruction is being improved campus-wide through the development of the Math Emporium as a mathematics laboratory where students work with mathematics faculty and student tutors to enrich their educational experiences in developmental and other math courses. The Math Emporium serves the needs of the student cohorts by providing access to online interactive support as well as enhanced faculty/student interactions.",
