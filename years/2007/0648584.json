The primary goal of CREATE is to encourage participants to pursue advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines by providing an engaging experience in cutting-edge research.  The program will establish a rich and diverse environment of engineering innovation and creation for undergraduate students in which their intellectual contribution is valued as an important component of the research process.\r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will be targeted to women, underrepresented minorities, and students from institutions that do not currently have advanced degree programs or opportunities for undergraduate research.  The results of this program will be disseminated in relevant conference and journal publications for the educational community.  Also, it is expected that participants who are motivated to pursue advanced degrees will offer a greater contribution to the technological advancement of society. \r\n\r\n",
