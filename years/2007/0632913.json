The module is addressing the important aspects of modeling, control and design of smart actuator-based systems through a collection of specially designed lectures and laboratory experiments.  In this way, the students are being provided the knowledge, understanding and skills for nano/bio related professional fields.  \r\n\r\nThe project is building on the research expertise of the PIs, leveraging their experiences and collaborative efforts in this area.  The PIs are designing, implementing and assessing the modules which are being included in a junior level course on mechanical systems and controls, a senior level mechatronics course and a capstone design course, each course at a different institution.  After completing the module, the students can understand the fundamental concepts of modeling/control of piezoactuators, transfer the knowledge to solve engineering problems at higher levels of abstraction and recognize mechanical concepts in nano/bio technologies.\r\n",
