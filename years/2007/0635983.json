The continued funding of the CNA from\r\nthe RTG program will allow it to recruit strong US graduate students and\r\npostdocs and expose them to the wealth of expertise in nonlinear\r\nanalysis, computation, and interdisciplinary activity\r\nthat exists across Carnegie Mellon research units.  The goals of the CNA\r\ninclude:\r\n-- To identify  cutting-edge mathematical questions in science and\r\n    engineering, including materials science and biotechnology, to\r\nhighlight emerging and\r\nnew areas in mathematics deriving from applications, and to develop new\r\napplications of mathematical sciences;\r\n-- To maintain and sustain its leadership in the areas of Calculus of\r\n    Variations and PDEs;\r\n-- To promote collaborations between applied mathematicians and\r\nallied scientists;\r\n-- To continue to develop international partnerships\r\n   and cooperation agreements, which play a vital part in\r\nthe CNA program and in the enhancement of the\r\nscientific  training and research activities of the Center;\r\n-- To maintain its position as a worldwide asset in the education\r\nof young investigators cognizant of research opportunities at the broad\r\ninterface between mathematics and physical sciences and engineering;\r\n-- To continue the valuable work of the Summer Undergraduate Applied\r\nMathematics Institute (SUAMI), which targets minorities and women with\r\nthe goal of recruiting them to pursue graduate study in applied mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the past 15 years the CNA has trained more than 52 postdoctoral\r\nfellows. The CNA is very proud of its trainees: Several former CNA\r\npostdocs are now scientific leaders in their own right at research\r\ninstitutions in the US and abroad, and many others are ripe to assume\r\nleadership roles in the near future. The imprint of the CNA in the\r\nmathematical and scientific community is large and growing.  The\r\ncollaborations of CNA members with experimentalists, theorists,\r\nphysical scientists, and bioscientists, render this group one of the\r\nstrongest research and training groups in applied mathematics in the\r\nUS and in the world. Investigators associated with the CNA have been in\r\nthe front ranks in integrating the discovery of new mathematics and\r\nmathematical ways of understanding with other modes of scientific\r\ninvestigation, particularly in materials science.\r\nThe aim is to develop first-rate mathematical science in\r\nways that have a healthy and exciting relation to emerging areas of\r\nimportance in the physical and biological sciences.\r\n",
