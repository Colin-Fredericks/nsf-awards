 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-0651649  Simaan  The specific aim of this proposal is to study and improve cochlear electrode array insertion through the use of a robotic insertion module.  The use of novel active-steering electrodes will be explored to reduce trauma to the structure of the cochlea.  The low rate of atraumatic deep insertions of cochlear implants using manual insertions currently prevent surgeons from treating individuals with presbycusis who still have some residual hearing. These individuals are usually older, and due to their conditions, can not benefit from hearing aids or from the current cochlear implants due to the traumatic nature of the surgery. The proposed work provides a crucial enabling technology for new robot-assisted surgical approaches to cochlear implant surgery. It is hypothesized that active steering electrode arrays combined with a force controlled robotic insertion device can significantly reduce the insertion forces and trauma to the scala tympani. The proposed robotic insertion module will also provide a stable and repeatable experimental setup to assess the performance of both passive and active-bending electrode arrays.\r\nThe proposed research may also be applicable to different areas of surgery such as deep brain electrode stimulation placement, minimally invasive resection of tumors inside a variety of organs such as the lungs and liver, safe exploration of the meningeal space of the spinal cord for micro-endoscopic surgery and all other applications requiring a flexible snake-like device to navigate tight channels with minimum contact with the walls of the channels while actuated by a limited number of actuators smaller then the constraints imposed by the task. \r\n",
