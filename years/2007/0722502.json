 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed computer cluster will be dedicated to the following four cutting-edge research projects: (i) Numerical Simulations of Multiphase Monolayer Dynamics; (ii) Stochastic Simulations of Blood Flow in Stenosed Arteries; (iii) Simulations of Vortex Induced Vibrations and of Blood Flow in 3-D Human Arterial Tree; and (iv) Numerical Simulations of Wave Propagation in Geophysical Applications. The monolayer project will provide valuable and reliable information for the development of designer surfactants---monolayer forming materials for emerging technologies such as lab-on-a-chip for parallel, low-cost DNA sequencing.  The stochastic simulations of blood flow in stenosed arteries will lead to quantifications of valid regimes for deterministic analysis and a better understanding of the fluid dynamics of stenotic flows with input uncertainties.  The proposed parametric study for vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of structures using an efficient lift suppression flow-control scheme will enable reduction and suppression of vortex-induced vibrations in many situations.  Realistic simulations of wave propagations in fluid-saturated porous media will lead to a better understanding on the role played by local heterogeneities in fluid pressure and\r\nsaturation,  permeability, porosity  and other petrophysical properties at the mesoscopic scale. \r\n\r\nThe four  projects are aimed at challenging scientific problems that will lead to innovative computational algorithms, new discoveries in complex physical and mathematical properties related to the multiscale inter-facial dynamics, fundamental dynamics of blood flow in stenosed arteries and in the entire human arterial tree, the attenuation and dispersion phenomena suffered by seismic waves traveling in hydrocarbon reservoir formations.  The proposed activities will also have significant impact on education through involvement of undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers directly in the proposedresearch, and incorporation of parallel computing into advanced graduate courses at Purdue University.",
