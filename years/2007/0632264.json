The observatories will be established\r\nat two existing sites of research on landscape-level carbon, water, and energy balance - Toolik Lake (Alaska) and Cherskii (Siberia) - and the network of observatories across the Arctic where similar long-term observations of carbon, water and energy variables are made or proposed as part of IPY will include Toolik, Cherskii, Abisko (Sweden, the main site of the ABACUS project), Zackenberg (Greenland), and several sites in Arctic Canada.\r\n\r\nFunds are specifically provided for instruments and personnel at Toolik and Cherskii, as well as international workshops and visits among the sites to ensure that data and instrumentation are easily comparable.  Rather than studying one process at a time, this effort focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water, and energy fluxes of the Arctic terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal, and multiyear time scales. These are major\r\nregulatory drivers of the Arctic System, forming key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere, and the oceans. \r\n\r\nThe data collected will become a legacy by using measurement and data archiving approaches that are comparable among observatories.  The data management protocols and archives used for nearly 20 years by the NSF Arctic Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project (based at Toolik Lake) will be used; data will be archived in the Arctic LTER database and, through links to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), will be generally available to the community.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  Arctic lands and freshwaters affect the global and regional climate by exchanging carbon dioxide, methane, water, and energy with the atmosphere.  Understanding how these exchanges are regulated and how they change is a key goal of the US Climate Change Research Program, the US Study of Environmental Arctic Change and the NSF Arctic Observatory Network.  This project has helped to meet this goal by (1) establishing a program of year round monitoring of carbon, water, and energy balance at two arctic sites, Imnavait Creek in Alaska and Cherskii in Siberia, and (2) establishing a data base containing this information for use by climate change researchers and modelers.  In addition the project helped to establish a program of monitoring changes in carbon and energy balance following a major wildfire in Northern Alaska in 2007, it developed methods for assimilating complex data sets into simulation models, it initiated a program of comparisons of carbon and energy exchange among sites throughout the Arctic, and helped support a synthesis of pan-arctic methane ebullition from lakes.  The work was accomplished as a collaboration among researchers from the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Northeast Science Station, Chersky, Russia.  The longer this work continues the more valuable it will become, as carbon, water, and energy balance continue to change in response to climate.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts: Research and education infrastructure has been enhanced by making all of the data easily available online.  This has already led to numerous uses of the data by collaborators, for model development and testing, for comparisons with similar work within and outside the Arctic, and for linking finer-scale studies of individual processes to these whole-ecosystem measurements.  Broader impacts also include contributions to education, including the teaching of a field course in Arctic Ecology for undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Other educational activities included participation in the Marine Biological Laboratory\u00c6s Logan Science Journalism program, the Arctic LTER Schoolyard program, and outreach to Native Alaskan communities.  Benefits to society include improved understanding of the impacts of climate change, especially in Alaska where the local residents are closely tied to the land through traditional, subsistence lifestyles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marion S Bret-Harte"
