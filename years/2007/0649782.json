 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 41st Annual Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference (STDC) will be hosted by the Mathematics and Statistics Department of the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR), March 29-31, 2007.  This will be the first time the conference has been held in the American Midwest. Leading researchers, both nationally and internationally, will be invited to present their latest research results in either 50 minute plenary or 25 minute semi-plenary talks.  Conference steering committees are charged with inviting not only established researchers in the various subfields of Topology and Topological Dynamical Systems but also emerging young mathematicians with particular attention to underrepresented minorities and female members of the community. In addition to the invited speakers there will be four parallel session for contributed papers in the areas of Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, General and Set-Theoretic Topology, and Geometric and Geometric Group Theory.  Approximately 200 participants are expected to attend.\r\n\r\nIdeas and concepts of topology and dynamical systems are ubiquitous in not only modern mathematics but also increasingly in many other fields.  To cite just two examples, topoisomerases in molecular biology are so named because they change the topological structure of biologically active macromolecules, and chaotic attractors, which are a focus of study in dynamical systems, find applications in such areas as ecosystem analysis and weather prediction.  The UMR hosted forty-first meeting of the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference will help propel research in Topology and Dynamical Systems into the coming years with renewed vigor helping to make certain the mathematical and scientific knowledge is available to solve problems facing the nation and the world.\r\n",
