 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the currently accepted theory of\r\nthe strong nuclear force which binds quarks and gluons together to form\r\nhadrons, such as the proton and neutron.  Understanding hadron formation\r\nis a long standing problem in nuclear/particle physics.  A major objective\r\nof this proposal is to use large-scale computer simulations with QCD\r\nformulated on a space-time lattice to carry out ab initio determinations\r\nof the mass spectrum of hadrons expected from the QCD theory.  The novel\r\nfeature of the proposed activities is the use of large sets of spatially\r\nextended hadron operators in order to study more-massive excited hadron states,\r\nnot just the lightest states.  These states are currently of great interest \r\nto experimentalists, exemplified by the Hall B N-star program and the GlueX\r\nexperimental program in the proposed Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National\r\nAccelerator Facility, as well as the CLEO-c project at Cornell.  Understanding\r\nthe physics of quark confinement within hadrons is also an important \r\nintellectual challenge; in fact, the Yang-Mills mass gap is one of the \r\nseven so-called Millenium Prize problems announced by the Clay Mathematics \r\nInstitute of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The proposed research incorporates \r\nthe participation of two graduate students, and possibly one or more \r\nundergraduate students, whose educations will be enhanced not only\r\nby involvement in scientific projects at the forefront of nuclear theory,\r\nbut also with high-technology training in the use of state-of-the-art\r\nparallel computing resources.  Students will be funded to participate in\r\ninternational conferences.  The broader impacts of the proposed activities\r\nwill be strengthened through articles in popular publications and by posting\r\nresults with simplified background information on publicly accessible web pages.\r\n",
