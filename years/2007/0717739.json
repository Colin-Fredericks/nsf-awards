 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nThis project is building on the success of an existing software laboratory to support a computer science course on Electronic Commerce Technologies developed under a prior NSF award (DUE 0127300) to expand e-commerce education by developing and disseminating materials that focus on a key element of e-commerce technology: security. The goal of this project is disseminate materials from the previous project and to respond to one of the grand challenges in the field of computer science - writing secure software. The prior project was devoted to developing materials to be used in training students to program components of e-commerce stores. This project is developing, testing, and refining teaching materials that emphasize the security requirements of e-commerce software. The PIs are developing coordinated lecture materials and supporting software laboratory exercises (\"virtual labs\"), in the following critical areas: \r\n\r\n(1) Cryptography - the mathematics of security; \r\n(2) Professional ethics - a sense of responsibility should precede knowledge and empowerment; \r\n(3) Detecting and defending against attacks - the technology of hacking; \r\n(4) Wireless access - the enabler for mobile commerce; \r\n(5) Web services - a new approach to e-commerce security; \r\n(6) Authentication, authorization, and federation - the crucial web service components that facilitate identity management and trust sharing among disparate systems. \r\n\r\nThis technical approach differs markedly from the business/legal approach taken in many extant e-commerce courses. Project emphasis areas include: \r\n\r\n- security and on secure coding philosophies, strategies, tools, and techniques; \r\n- collaboration between a computer scientist and philosopher (ethicist) leading to an emphasis on professional ethics; \r\n- use and evaluation of six types of interactive staff support: office hours, email, NetMeeting, IM, FAQs, and student-operated message boards; \r\n- a \"teach-the-teachers\" workshop for 20-25 faculty in the three summers, to include faculty from community colleges, liberal arts colleges, and science and engineering programs; \r\n- a well-designed effort to recruit women and minorities in every aspect of the proposed work; \r\n- an emphasis on \"programming in context\" in which students can see the practical application and social value of their artifacts; \r\n- providing staff to support faculty at other schools with their adoption, implementation, use, and evaluation of these materials; and \r\n- a multi-institution qualitative and quantitative evaluation of whether and how these materials changed learning outcomes for the students. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
