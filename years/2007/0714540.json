 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF funding is requested for a three-day workshop on nanometer and sub-micrometer scale effects on strength and plasticity of metals.  The workshop will highlight dramatic increases in plastic strength as sample size and/or microstructural scale decreases to sub-micron and even nanometer scales.  This includes experimental and computational investigations of sub-micron compression samples, bulk samples with nanometer-scale grain size, and multilayer thin film composite materials with nanometer-scale phases.  The reported phenomena are not explained by crystal or strain gradient plasticity theories.  Thus, an objective of the workshop is to assess and critically evaluate these observations and the corresponding theories and computational approaches to understand them.\r\n\r\nThe societal benefits are international in scope, involve both junior and senior participants in the materials/mechanics communities, and extend to nanotechnology developers and users.  Specifically, this workshop provides a needed forum to guide and advance the international research community at a scope not possible in a traditional conference.  The requested funding will enable US participation by 4 senior and 4 junior (Ph.D. received within the last 6 years) researchers of the highest caliber, plus 3 to 4 highly capable graduate students and/or under-represented individuals.  Up to 70 participants will be accommodated. Results will be disseminated through written summaries provided by workshop moderators, web-based streaming of presentations and/or capture of presentation slides, and workshop discussion groups hosted by graduate students at their home institutions.\r\n",
