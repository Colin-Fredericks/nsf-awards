 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing new techniques for programming \"irregular\"\r\nparallel applications on high-performance highly parallel platforms,\r\nin collaboration with the Chapel programming language team at Cray,\r\nInc.  The project addresses several core issues for such applications.\r\nFirst, the work is extending Chapel's existing support for\r\nuser-defined irregular data distributions by adding general language\r\nfeatures for specifying optimized handling of special cases, which are\r\nusually essential for adequate performance.  Second, the project is\r\ndesigning and evaluating software transactional memory (STM)\r\nalgorithms that scale to very large scale systems (e.g.,\r\ndistributed-memory clusters), in contrast to previous STM work that\r\nhas focused on smaller-scale (cache coherent) systems.  Third, a\r\n(separately funded) component of the overall research project is\r\ndeveloping deterministic language mechanisms for parallel computations\r\non pointer-based data using a type and effect system for expressing\r\nparallelism and proving noninterference.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will improve ease of programming and\r\ndeliver high performance for a wide range of applications that are\r\nespecially challenging for programmers today, namely, \"irregular\"\r\napplications.  Further, the work aims to achieve two kinds of direct\r\ntechnology transfer to industry: contributions to the Chapel language\r\nand compiler effort at Cray, and contributions to the joint language\r\ndesign effort in the DARPA HPCS program.  The major research\r\nartifacts, including the language specification and compiler\r\nprototype, will be made available as free, open source software for\r\nthe research community to use.  The dynamic compiler infrastructure\r\nfor high-performance parallel programs should be a particularly\r\nvaluable tool for further research in this area.\r\n\r\n",
