 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Tulsa Cyber Corps Program is producing skilled information assurance and forensics professionals with strong leadership skills, integrity of character and a deep commitment to service. Through this initiative students are engaging in intense, yet flexible, programs of study to prepare them for careers in intelligence, research and development, operations, project management, enterprise security or law enforcement. All participants spend a summer term as interns with federal agencies and, upon graduation, assume fulltime positions with the federal government.\r\n\r\nThe program components are carefully designed to train students in the theory and practice of information assurance and forensics; while providing an environment that fosters teamwork, strengthens motivation, and instills the ideals of duty and service. Innovative features of this program include several joint programs that provide an opportunity for students to earn a B.S., M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Computer Science, an M.B.A., or a J.D. In addition, students can earn at least five CNSS information assurance certifications. Participants may select from several tracks incorporating courses and program components that prepare them for specialized careers with the federal government. Among the most innovative offering is the \"MacGyver Track\" that imparts hardware, software and foreign language skills to students intending to join the intelligence community.  \r\n",
