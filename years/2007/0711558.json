 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brittle fault zones undergo continual wear of fault surfaces during slip, which\r\nleads to a continuous variation in fault surface roughness and a progressive increase in\r\nthe thickness of the fault gouge zone with net slip. The dynamic changes in gouge zone\r\nfeatures may affect fault frictional strength, stability, and earthquake characteristics.\r\nAlthough previous field, laboratory, and numerical studies have made significant\r\nprogress in investigating the geometrical and physical properties of fault gouge zones and\r\ntheir effects on fault zone frictional and mechanical behavior, these results still provide\r\nlimited understanding of the complete process of gouge zone development under a wide\r\nrange of geological settings, and how these materials might affect the earthquake cycle.\r\nRecent modifications to the Distinct Element Method (DEM), including addition\r\nof interparticle bonding and breakage, allows us to model the fracture process of cohesive\r\nrocks, and makes it possible to directly observe gouge accumulation and modification,\r\nmimicking natural fault zone deformation. 2-D DEM simulations of gouge evolution\r\nhave successfully reproduced many observations in the field and laboratory, yielding\r\ninteresting findings that have not been reported in previous gouge zone studies. These\r\ninclude stages of gouge zone development and their dependence on shear displacement,\r\nnormal stress, and rock strength. These encouraging results suggest the feasibility,\r\nnecessity, and importance of improving numerical models and extending the current\r\nstudies into the future.\r\nThis proposal describes a program to simulate the dynamic processes of gouge\r\nzone evolution, focused on constraining the relationships between gouge thickness, grain\r\nsize distribution, shear zone strength, and surface roughness. We will use much larger\r\nassemblages that will allow a wider range of surface and particles sizes and geometries,\r\nand conduct these simulations in parallel on the new Rice Cray XD1 supercomputer.\r\nResults of these numerical experiments will help in interpreting observations of more\r\ncomplex natural faults, leading to an improved understanding of fault zone processes.\r\nThe work will support training of a postdoctural associate, undergraduates, and provide \r\nenhanced 3D codes of fault gouge evolution to the community. Understanding how fault zones\r\ndeform can help improve understanding of how faults slip and thus earthquake hazards.",
