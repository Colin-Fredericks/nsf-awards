 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe proposed research is to develop feedback control theoretic methods for learning and adaptation in\r\nmultiagent systems and to investigate their potential as analysis and design tools for distributed adaptive\r\nsystems. The proposed work stems from recent innovations at UCLA on the role of feedback control in the\r\ngame theoretic framework of distributed learning. This recent work has overcome long standing perceived\r\nobstacles in game theoretic learning and opens new opportunities for distributed system design.\r\nThe proposed research will emphasize underlying mathematical models of multiagent learning. The\r\nresearch directions to be explored are:\r\nAdvanced analysis of feedback control based learning in games: The introduction of feedback control\r\nmethods in learning in games is very recent, and there are many important unresolved issues. Proposed\r\ntopics of interest include strategic advantage of feedback control based methods, analysis of systems with\r\nheterogeneous learning algorithms, dynamic network interconnections, and supervised switching for learning.\r\nContinuum action spaces: The learning in games framework currently applies to learning among a finite\r\nset of choices. This direction involves learning with decisions over a continuum, such as dynamic resource\r\nallocation problems. Issues include new feedback control based approaches to distributed optimization,\r\nseverely limited information structures, and complementary sharing of information structures.\r\nMultiagent games with state evolution: The learning in games framework uses a static game setup.\r\nThe state variable is the state of learning, but not inherent states of subsystems or the environment. This\r\ndirection considers learning for games with internal states, also known as Markov or stochastic games. Issues\r\ninclude changes of time-scale for expert selection, feedback control based Q-learning, and integrator action.\r\nApplication to Evolvable Hardware: Evolvable hardware is an emerging area that uses notions inspired\r\nby biological evolution for the design of reconfigurable, self-organizing hardware. The proposed concepts on\r\nmultiagent may be viewed as an engineered evolution with its blending of feedback control and multiagent\r\nlearning. This project will use the evolvable hardware paradigm to illustrate and motivate the proposed\r\nresearch.\r\nIntellectual Merit: There is an extensive body of research in the area of multiple player games. In the case\r\nof non-zero-sum games, the concept of mixed strategy (i.e, randomized) Nash equilibrium, despite its central\r\nrole, has received considerable scrutiny as to how players, through repeated interactions, would ever converge\r\nto a Nash equilibrium. Indeed there are long standing examples to the contrary. The innovative basis of\r\nthe proposed research establishes that simple notions from feedback control can enable such convergence.\r\nConsequentially, this research opens many new possibilities into how to design distributed adaptive systems\r\nfrom a game theoretic viewpoint.\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed research will have a broader impact on societal applications and undergraduate\r\nstudent eduction.\r\nSocietal: The distributed systems concept is relevant in a multitude of domains, both engineered and\r\nsocial. These include data networks, distributed robotics, traffic networks, distributed design, power grid\r\ninfrastructure, and distributed computation, as well as economic exchange, social exchange, and political\r\ncoalition dynamics. The proposed work addresses a fundamental component of the mathematical models of\r\nsuch systems and has potential implications in a variety of areas.\r\nEducational: Key activities to be undertaken are 1) Introducing 1-unit freshman courses on the concept\r\nof distributed systems and feedback control and their applications. This is through UCLA's Fiat Lux\r\nfreshman seminar series, and 2) Developing an research test-bed based on evolvable hardware as a venue to\r\nincorporate undergraduate research-level participation through directed study electives. Of course, these activities\r\nare in addition to the usual education and training of graduate student researchers and dissemination\r\nof results to the research community.\r\n",
