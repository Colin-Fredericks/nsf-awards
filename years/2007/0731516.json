 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the shortage of specialists capable of identifying nematodes (roundworms) by training new scientists to discover and describe roundworms using traditional and molecular methods. This research focuses on a natural group of nematodes that includes the most economically damaging plant parasites, certain animal parasites, and species feeding on soil microbes. The main problem to be addressed is the need for comprehensive understanding of genealogical relationships among these nematodes so that comparative studies can determine how these organisms have parasitized plants and animals. Involvement of a worldwide network of experts provides knowledge transfer essential for training new scientists.\r\n \r\nThe key role of nematodes in ecosystems, agriculture, veterinary science, and medicine contrasts starkly with the shortage of nematode taxonomists and the corresponding lack of information about nematode natural history. The main research objective is to narrow this gap by providing professional training in methods essential for identifying nematodes and assessing their relationships. This includes advanced microscopy and imaging techniques, standards for describing new species, procedures for obtaining and sequencing DNA, and methods for evaluating nematode relationships. This training will be focused on a nematode group (Tylenchina) that is pivotal to understanding mechanisms of parasitism. The broader impact of this research is through strengthening access of scientists to value-added products including nematode cultures, identification aids (morphological and molecular) and genealogies that will support advances in basic biology, ecology, agriculture, parasitology, and medicine.",
