 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volatility in the global coffee market has deeply impacted the world's 25 million coffee producers, most of whom are smallholders in developing nations.  In Veracruz, Mexico, where the national coffee agency had been headquartered since the 1960s, smallholders were doubly impacted by market collapse and the dismantling of state programs during the 1980s.  Coffee producers developed unique strategies to weather the impacts of economic transformation, ranging from alternative crops to outright political activism.  State agencies recently developed programs that attempt to directly control rural producers and environmental management in the manner of traditional, top-down resource politics.  State actors now must accommodate more heterogeneous configurations of power that developed in the post-1980s Veracruz countryside, however.  While recent studies have examined how forms of social organization contest the more egregious effects of economic and institutional restructuring, such analyses have not given much attention to coffee, especially in Mexico.  In addition, relatively few studies have examined how the state itself responds to, co-opts, and/or integrates these socioecological changes.  This doctoral dissertation research project seeks answers to the following questions:  How have small-scale coffee producers developed new social networks and environmental strategies to mediate the impacts of socioeconomic change?  Are changes in land use resulting from these new social relationships?  How have these socioecological practices shaped the state's role in regulating coffee landscapes?  The doctoral candidate will test answers to these questions using a multi-method approach, including a combination of ethnographic techniques, including semi-structured interviews with coffee producers and officials from producer organizations and government agencies.  The relationships between social organization and land-use change will be measured through local mapping projects and through time series analysis of remotely sensed LANDSAT images.\r\n\r\nThis research will bridge a gap in the literature by explaining how coffee producers at the household level are active agents of global economic and social change rather than merely passive victims.  A deeper sense of the connections between social organization and farm-level practices also has material implications for the ecologically diverse shade-grown coffee landscape.  Scholarly discussion on land-cover change has identified the need for case studies and theoretically robust analyses that directly relate actual land-cover transformations to economic, institutional, and political change.  This project will address this need by articulating quantitative data with interviews and discourse analysis of official documents and programs.  Because this project will link socioeconomic transformation to actual changes in rural livelihoods and land use, it will help identify the types of social relationships and environmental practices that are most sustainable for both the shade-grown coffee agro-ecosystems and the families they sustain.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\n",
