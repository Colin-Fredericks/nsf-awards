 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposed research is to address the current problem that the deployment of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the developing world sometimes fails due to problems with the usability and utility of those systems. This research hypothesizes that Human Computer Interaction (HCI) has much to offer ICT for development (ICT4D), but the methods and techniques also require customization to address the unique challenges of the developing world. The result of this proposed research will be an explanation of the methods and techniques of Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D), highlighting similarities and differences to HCI. It will do so through establishing a relationship with a partner institution in Africa, identified through a survey of tertiary Computing education in Africa. Joint with this institution, an HCI4D project intervention will be identified.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost this proposed research seeks to begin the process of creating an awareness of and a research agenda around the methods necessary to conduct HCI4D. Successful HCI4D interventions have the possibility of broadening the global Information Society to include those least served by ICTs. By making it possible for more people to interact with computers, this proposed research seeks to change technologically mediated human-human interaction, bringing an increasingly diverse population into the global society?supporting an increased range of interactions and cultures online. By examining the methods, and identifying differences between HCI4D and HCI, this proposed research also supports introspection of the values and assumptions held in techniques generated by and in use in the developed world.\r\n\r\nThis research expands the discipline of HCI into a new domain, the developing world. Results have much to contribute to the understanding of the values and assumptions built into existing methods. The effort will provide new and unusual examples of HCI research, those conducted in the developing world, not typically the source of examples for HCI, which will broaden student education. \r\n",
