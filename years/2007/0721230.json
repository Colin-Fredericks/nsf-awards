 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies three fundamental problems to improve the performance of wireless mesh networks. \r\n\r\n(1) Managing delay and jitter. One fundamental problem affecting the performance of current mesh networks is the hop-by-hop relaying of data, resulting in significant per-hop and per-packet delay and/or jitter. This project designs a new MAC paradigm and a distributed method of scheduling data transmissions in a path-aware manner, to eliminate per-packet delay and jitter while minimizing per-hop delays. \r\n\r\n(2) Capacity analysis and utility optimization. As an augmentation to the large amount of simulation studies on multi-channel\r\nmulti-radio mesh networks, this project develops a general theoretical model to analyze both unicast and broadcast capacities of mesh networks, and applies the model to optimally assign channels to maximize capacity, as well as optimizing application-specific utility functions relevant to user-perceived network performance. \r\n\r\n(3) Channel assignment for dynamic spectrum access mesh networks. Recent advancement in cognitive radio technology and regulatory reform in spectrum policy offer dynamic spectrum access (DSA) capability to mesh networks via providing dynamically available channels. This project adopts a cross-layer and path-centric approach for assigning dynamic channels in\r\nDSA mesh networks to achieve high spectrum utilization and traffic throughput.  \r\n\r\nThrough developing innovative protocols, analysis and optimization models, this project promotes development of high-performance multi-radio, multi-channel, and DSA-capable mesh networks. The research on DSA mesh networks potentially facilitates the communication among different emergency management divisions in disaster rescues operations. This project also benefits the underrepresented minority students through education and research.\r\n",
