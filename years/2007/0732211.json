 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe proposed research tests the hypothesis that sediment transport dynamics play a role in\r\ncontrolling the topographic patterning that is crucial to the ecology of the ridge and slough landscape in\r\nthe Florida Everglades. Namely, under historical flow conditions, it is hypothesized that sediment\r\nredistribution from open-water slough to vegetated ridge regulated ridge width but that, with drainage and\r\ncompartmentalization of the Everglades, the magnitude of redistribution has decreased, permitting\r\nexpansion of ridges into open-water sloughs and loss of topographic heterogeneity.\r\nProject hypotheses will be tested through a combination of field and laboratory experimentation\r\nand numerical modeling of the mass and momentum balance equations governing flocculent sediment\r\ntransport dynamics and flow in vegetated environments. Experimental analysis of floc transport\r\nmechanics will describe the critical shear stresses and turbulence intensities that entrain size classes of\r\nfloc in a deposited bed, equilibrium aggregate size distributions and concentrations resulting from flow\r\nwith different shear parameters, aggregate settling velocities, and changes in turbulence and flow profiles\r\nthat occur across a ridge/slough cross-section as a result of vegetation and microtopography. To this end,\r\nflow monitoring and a series of transport experiments and tracer tests using natural floc will be performed\r\nin laboratory and field flumes. Funds will also sponsor the execution of complementary science fair\r\nprojects by Forest Hill High School environmental science magnet program students, which will focus on\r\nusing a rapid-assessment optical technique for developing an organic matter mixing model across a\r\nridge/slough transect (which can be used as a validation measure for the sediment transport model) and on\r\nelucidating the effects of ambient water quality on flocculent organic sediment transport properties.\r\nIntellectual merit. The proposed research builds upon previous research showing the existence of\r\nsediment redistribution from open-water channels to vegetated environments by producing a model to\r\npredict the magnitude and spatial distribution of sedimentation as a function of flow velocity and water\r\nlevel. In the Everglades, sediment occurs primarily in the form of organic floccules, the mechanics of\r\nwhich are not well understood. Similarly, although flocculation plays a dominant role in the suspended\r\nsediment dynamics of rivers, wetlands, and estuaries throughout the world, studies on the impacts of flow\r\nthrough vegetated environments on sedimentation and transport of floccules and predictive models of floc\r\ndynamics on landscape morphology and evolution are nonexistent. This research develops a set of\r\nlaboratory and field experiments designed to address the critical questions about floc transport mechanics\r\nrequired for model development and an original model of how these mechanics influence landscape\r\nevolution. Thus, the proposed research will set a precedent for improved predictions of sediment\r\ntransport and landscape dynamics that will have implications for estuarine science, fluvial\r\ngeomorphology, wetlands science, and contaminant transport.\r\nBroader impacts - Results of this project will be broadly disseminated to (1) researchers in the field,\r\nthrough organization of a special session at an ASLO meeting on implications of flocculant sediment\r\ntransport for landscape dynamics and subsequent publication of a special journal issue, to (2) policy\r\nmakers involved in implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan through regular\r\nparticipation of the PIs in Landscape Subteam meetings and the Greater Everglades Ecosystem\r\nRestoration conference, and to (3) the general public, through publication of a popular science article on\r\nEverglades landscape dynamics. Further, model results will impact policy and society by leading to\r\nimproved recommendations of flow velocities and hydroperiods that should be implemented to restore the\r\nridge and slough landscape. Enhanced infrastructure resulting from the purchase of a laser diffraction\r\nparticle size analyzer will benefit classroom demonstrations, laboratory, and field research at the K-12,\r\nundergraduate, and graduate levels. Research efforts will also enhance collaborative efforts between the\r\nUSGS, University of Colorado, and K-12 education and will synergistically complement an existing\r\nUSGS project on biogeochemical feedback mechanisms and nutrient transport within the ridge and slough\r\nlandscape. Finally, this research enhances the knowledge transfer to future generations of scientists\r\nthrough a committed partnership with the environmental science magnet program at Forest Hill High\r\nSchool in West Palm Beach, Florida and by providing research support to a current Ph.D student.",
