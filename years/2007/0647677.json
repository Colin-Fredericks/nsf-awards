This program will engage undergraduate students in a 10-week summer full-time in-residence research training and professional seminar program in cross-cutting, interdisciplinary technology and applications of membrane science.  The weekly research seminar program will include such topics as laboratory safety (chemical, biological, fire, radioactive materials), emphasis on ethics in science and engineering, experimental design and statistics, laboratory methods and techniques, intellectual property and technology transfer, and a half-day team-based problem solving cooperative workshop.  This seminar series will provide students with an orientation to the University of Cincinnati's graduate science and engineering doctoral program opportunities.  Students will participate in longitudinal writing assignments, oral presentations, and a juried poster competition.  In addition, a social program will expose undergraduates to points of interest in Cincinnati.  Participants in the program will be encouraged to engage in discovery research leading to co-authored presentations and publications that make significant contributions to the field of membrane science.  \r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will be focused on women and underrepresented minorities. This program will increase the number, quality, and skills of research-exposed undergraduates who aspire to and enroll in graduate degree programs in engineering and science as to assure global competitiveness and innovation by the next generation of US scientific and academic leaders. \r\n",
