 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shortly after fertilization, cells of the vertebrate embryo undergo substantial movement and rearrangement. This dramatic restructuring of embryo morphology involves epiboly, a process by which the embryonic cell mass spreads over the surface of the yolk. Epiboly is followed by gastrulation, a large-scale rearrangement of tissues leading to formation of germ layers that ultimately give rise to all the organs and tissues of the body.  An important focus of developmental biology research is to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling epiboly and gastrulation. Using molecular genetic approaches, Dr Garrity's and Dr Horne's laboratories recently identified the calcium channel beta subunit as essential for normal epiboly in zebrafish. Classically, the beta subunit is thought to function as a critical auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), multi-protein complexes that mediate calcium entry into the cell. The auxiliary beta subunits (beta1- beta4) help transport the pore-forming alpha1 subunit to the cell membrane and modulate the electrophysiological properties of the calcium channel. However, recent research suggests that beta subunits may have additional functions in the cell independent of their roles in VGCCs. Mutations in the beta subunit lead to uncoordinated, lethargic behavior and seizures in mice, and have been associated with epilepsy in humans. Ongoing research in Dr Garrity's and Dr Horne's laboratories will use a combination of molecular genetic and biochemical approaches to test potential roles for the beta subunit in interacting with cytoskeletal components or in cell division or differentiation. The proposed research in zebrafish is expected to define new cellular roles for the beta subunit family, which could extend to other cell types in different physiological contexts, and may lead to a better understanding of disease phenotypes in mice and humans. The research will also contribute to our basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving epiboly. This collaboration will provide training and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students on two campuses, utilizing video conferencing. It will also provide summer internship opportunities for minority undergraduate students enrolled at Colorado State University-Pueblo, an affiliated Hispanic Serving Institution.",

Understanding how cells move during gastrulation is critical to science, since these cell rearrangements will: 1) establish the germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) that give rise to subsequent body organs, and 2) determine body axes of the embryo (anterior/posterior, dorsal/ventral, left/right). In this project, we explored the function of a gene called &beta;4 during &lsquo;epiboly&rsquo;, the earliest movement of zebrafish gastrulation. During epiboly, about 1000 embryonic cells in a pile atop the large yolk cell will spread out, rearranging into thin layers, until they eventually completely surround the yolk cell. A main goal of our project was to understand how &beta;4 protein function contributes to movements of epiboly. The calcium channel beta [CACNB4 or &beta;4] gene encodes a protein that serves as an auxiliary subunit in voltage-gated calcium channels, binding to a large pore-forming subunit called CACNA.

Both genes were active during epiboly, and were translated into mRNA in both embryonic cells and in extra-embryonic tissue. In zebrafish, an important extra-embryonic tissue is the yolk cell, which contains multiple nuclei in a thin layer of cytoplasm spread on top of the large yolk mass. The layer of cytoplasm is called the &lsquo;yolk syncytial layer&rsquo; or YSL. To discover the normal function of &beta;4 in the embryo, we analyzed embryos that lacked this protein. Using genetic techniques (morpholinos), we specifically depleted &beta;4.1 or &beta;4.2 protein throughout the embryo. As a consequence, epiboly was halted or delayed, and embryos died, telling us that embryos absolutely required &beta;4.1 and &beta;4.2 to complete epiboly and survive. If we removed &beta;4.1 or &beta;4.2 protein only within the YSL, epiboly was still delayed and embryos died, indicating that &beta;4 protein function in the YSL in particular was important. To discover whether the &beta;4 proteins were acting in the YSL as auxiliary subunits for calcium channels, we created a mutant version of human &beta;4, in which three amino acids were changed, making the mutant protein unable to bind to the calcium channel. In control experiments, when wildtype human &beta;4 mRNA was added back to &beta;4-depleted zebrafish embryos, they now survived. If mutant human &beta;4 mRNA was added back to &beta;4-depleted zebrafish embryos, these also survived, telling us that the function of &beta;4 in the context of epiboly did not involve its &ldquo;classical&rdquo; role as a calcium channel subunit &ndash; instead &beta;4 functioned in a channel-independent fashion.</p>\n<p>We next tested which portions of the &beta;4 protein were the most critical for its function during epiboly.
