First principles density functional theory in conjunction with the non-equilibrium Green's function approach will be used to understand the controlled electron transport in this device for assessing its potential application. \r\nIntellectual merit The proposed supra-molecular architecture that will be investigated consists of a channel unit which provides pathways for current between source and drain, and a controlling gate involving a throttle, which will modulate the current in the channel. The role of molecular throttle and channel will be systematically explored and quantum transport calculations will be carried out to optimize the design of the transistor for a significant current modulation with the application of a local electrostatic field at the gate.  \r\nBroader Impact-This research will: (a) identify an innovative mono-molecular field effect transistor architecture for applications in molecular computing far beyond the projected Technology Roadmap for the year 2015; (b) discover the physical mechanism behind the operational principle of this device, which is essential for its practical realization; (c) stimulate collaboration both at the national and international level; (d) provide avenues for involving undergraduate students in research; organizing workshop for the high school students to educate them about the broader prospects of molecular electronics through the development of video animation; disseminating the results to broader audience. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
