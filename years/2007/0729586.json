 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program undertakes a broad research agenda centered around the design and analysis  of ``Flow-based Networks''. A flow is a collection of packets that belong to the same  ``transaction'', such as a datagram, an ftp transfer, or a web download. It is the  fundamental unit of data that a user cares about. Current packet-switched networks,  like the Internet and Gigabit Ethernet, are designed to process packets; they are unaware  of the flow to which a packet belongs. This is because flow-recognition is widely  considered to be too expensive to implement. However, a switch or a router's ability  to recognize flows can lead to a marked improvement in its performance, to a better  use of its resources, and to much more secure networks. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe first major aim of this program is to design novel algorithms and data structures  for high-speed, \"flow-aware\" networks. Such algorithms could heavily influence the  design of commercial switches and routers. A second major thrust concerns the  development of flow-level models of networks: models which capture the impact of  packet-level decisions on flow-level bandwidth allocation and flow processing times. An important component of the modeling work is the unification and generalization of  two researce enterprises: Stochastic Network Theory, and Large Random Networks. The  former studies the performance of a, typically non-random, queueing network subject  to \"random inputs\". The latter concerns the study of \"random networks\", usually subject  to deterministic inputs. A successful outcome of these efforts can help answer questions  such as the throughput and flow delay of a particular bandwidth allocation scheme, and the effect of routing topology on end-to-end performance. In other words, the  modeling effort aims to develop a realistic, simple and usable class of models for network flows.",
