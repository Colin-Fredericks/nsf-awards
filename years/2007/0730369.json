The investigators in this collaborative research program will study flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) numerically as a means of manufacturing doped metal-oxide nanoparticles, developing a predictive modeling tool.  \r\n\r\nThe project involves several elements - turbulent flame, spray dynamics, pyrolysis reaction and their mutual interactions and five institutions  the University of Texas Austin, Iowa State University, Ames Research Laboratory, Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, Inc., and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich). Five sub-tasks (chemical mechanism, particle evolution, flame/particle interaction, model validation and data access tool) are divided among the three lead investigators.  The participants will interact through a cyberinfrastructure collaboratory that has intellectually interesting elements in itself.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed model will use a unified Large Eddy Simulation / Filtered Density Function approach with a goal of optimizing FSP production routes for manufacture of doped zirconia and titanium dioxide nanoparticles, specifically prediction of final particle size distribution in FSP reactors. The filtered density function concept is a very promising approach to combustion LES, and the proposed work is an excellent example of complementary studies.\r\n\r\nThe success of this project is also expected to have a significant impact on combustion-turbulence modeling, applicable to fields such as fire dynamics and soot modeling, and to expand understanding in an area where the research can benefit many diverse technological disciplines. \r\n\r\nResearch results will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate curricula, and the project will train graduate and undergraduate research students. Recruitment of women and under-represented minority is a goal in both institutions, leveraging university assets for recruitment and employment of students from traditionally underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
