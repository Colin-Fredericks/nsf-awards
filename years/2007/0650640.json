 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial support for a Summit on Hurricanes and Climate Change, to be held in the spring of 2007 on the island of Crete that will bring together leading academics and researchers on both sides of the scientific debate about hurricane climatology in a warming world to discuss new research and express opinions about what is happening or will happen in the future with regard to hurricane activity.  The goal is to frame the debate and address what research is needed to advance the science of hurricane climate.  The meeting will include students and encourage their interactions with leaders in the field.  The intellectual merit of the summit is the likelihood of a significant advance in understanding of climate processes associated with tropical cyclone activity.  The broader impacts will be a better understanding of the future hurricane threat to the United States and elsewhere.",
