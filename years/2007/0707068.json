These advances support the belief of\r\nthe principal investigator that he and Peter Teichner have found\r\nthe right way to incorporate `super symmetry' and `locality' in\r\nGraeme Segal's definition of quantum field theory. The principal\r\ninvestigator is optimistic that this might be the crucial step\r\nnecessary to solve the two decade old problem of how to relate\r\nfield theories and elliptic cohomology. A particularly\r\ninteresting aspect is that the `push forward' maps in these\r\ncohomology theories seem to correspond to physicists'\r\nquantization procedures via functional integrals, which are\r\nmathematically not well understood.\r\n\r\nThe last two decades have seen very fruitful interactions between\r\ntheoretical physics and topology. On a philosophical level this\r\nis not surprising since topology can be understood broadly as the\r\nstudy of `qualitative' aspects in mathematics, and it is to be\r\nexpected that it is the QUALITATIVE aspects of a complicated\r\nquantum system (i.e., the aspects that don't change when varying\r\nthe parameters of the theory) that should be easiest to\r\nanalyze. This interaction has deeply influenced both areas with\r\nphysicists using sophisticated tools from topology, and\r\ntopologists incorporating ideas from quantum field theory. The\r\nprincipal investigator hopes that relating super symmetric\r\nquantum field theories of dimension 0,1 and 2 to well- studied\r\nobjects in topology, namely `generalized cohomology theories'\r\nwill significantly strengthen that interaction by bringing the\r\ncalculational power of algebraic topology to physics and the\r\nphysical/ geometric meaning of these cohomology classes to\r\ntopology.\r\n",
