This workshop is organized by the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR). The institute will include: 1) one-on-one work with a mentor; 2) small groups discussions; 3) writing and critiquing of proposals, including mentor and peer assessment of proposals; 4) plenary sessions about effective proposal writing; 5) a meeting with an NSF biology program officer. The workshop aims to undertake a follow-up  of the proposal draft the biology faculty will develop. In summary, the workshop provides focused training in writing successful proposals as an essential skill for a research-active professor.",
