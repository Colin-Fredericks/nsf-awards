In addition, these institutions have documented success in meeting AGEP goals in the STEM (science, technology engineering and mathematics) fields. CUNY is currently part of a MAGNET/STEM AGEP alliance partnered with the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Polytechnic University and Stevens Institute of Technology. U-M, MSU and WSU partner with Western Michigan University to form the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA). CUNY and the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA), consisting of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University combined efforts and formed a new regional alliance to advance the production of underrepresented minorities (i.e., African American, Hispanics, American Indians, Asian/Pacific Islanders) in the social, behavioral and economic sciences (SBE) at the B.S. through Ph.D. and early career levels. Alliance institutions are both sharing resources and best practices across the alliance and including SBE fields in existing AGEP programs. The CUNY/MAA Alliance for the SBE sciences has increased participation in summer research programs, expanded recruitment and research opportunities for social sciences students, further developed targeted relationships with minority-serving institutions, provided across the alliance student mentoring and mentoring training for faculty, coordinated skill building workshops to help ensure graduate study success and enhanced fellowship support. It has also expanded student support groups, teaching opportunities, teacher training workshops, students' attendance at professional workshops, and postdoctoral and early career education. This grant funds a continuation of these efforts. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\n\r\nProject broader impacts will be through the institutionalization of a larger pool of individuals studying and conducting research in the SEE disciplines through the utilization of effective strategies that will attract, motivate, and train domestic talent, especially among underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities. The result of these activities will be to advance understanding of the role of the social and behavioral sciences in the nation, as well as to strengthen the national workforce. \r\n",
