The subject's roots concern\r\nlinear representations of lattices, but developments in the past\r\ntwo decades have established strong connections with a variety of\r\nother topics, including ergodic theory, dynamics of group actions\r\non compact manifolds, differential geometry, spaces of\r\nnon-positive curvature, geometric group theory, symplectic\r\ngeometry, algebraic groups, unitary representation theory,\r\noperator algebras, and group cohomology. Our lectures will\r\ninclude contributions from all of these areas.  We are holding\r\nthe conference on the occasion of Robert J. Zimmer's 60th\r\nbirthday, in recognition of his work's dramatic impact on the\r\ngrowth of this area.\r\n\r\nThe speaker list of this conference cuts across a variety of\r\nclosely related areas of mathematics, and will present\r\nparticipants with the opportunity to learn about recent\r\ndevelopments, important open questions, and the wide variety of\r\nsuccessful techniques that are being applied.  New developments\r\nare emerging rapidly and involve ideas from disparate areas of\r\nmathematics, so conferences of this type are necessary to keep\r\nestablished researchers up to date, and are even more valuable\r\nfor young researchers who are entering this fast-paced,\r\ninterdisciplinary research area. A Sunday-afternoon workshop will\r\nprovide younger scholars with an opportunity to present their\r\nwork and discuss it with other conference participants.\r\nAdditional information is available from the conference web site\r\nat http://www.math.uchicago.edu/zimmer60/\r\n\r\n",
