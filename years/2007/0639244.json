 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department at the University of California- Irvine  will acquire a gas chromatograph time-of-flight (GC-TOF) mass spectrometer with this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi User program (CRIF:MU).  The mass spectrometer will facilitate a diverse range of research including mechanistic studies on formation of non-polar polymers promulgated through lanthanide chemistry and lanthanide mediated C-H activation; design,and synthesis of nonpolar polymers with new structures utilizing transition metal catalysis; asymmetric cyclopropanation and natural product synthesis; polyhomologation reactions for synthesis of hydrocarbon polymers with precisely controlled chain length, polydispersity and chemical composition; synthesis of ant recognition hydrocarbons; new synthetic methods particularly assessing stereoselectivity; natural product synthesis involving the otellione family, indole alkaloids and atrope isomerism of nitrogen containing compounds; synthetic probes for rhodoquinone biosynthesis and for monitoring oxidative metabolism; emerging pollutants in water intended for reuse; synthetic polychlorinated alkane chemistry; environmental contaminant identification associated with receptor activation. \r\n\r\nMass spectroscopy is one of the basic tools used by physical scientists to identify and characterize materials and chemical species by accurate measurement of their mass as they are vaporized and fragmented in the instrument.  It is an essential tool in the training of young scientists. Almost 200 graduate and postdoctoral researchers as well as undergraduates in research programs use the mass spectrometry facility at UC-Irvine. The facility is also used by undergraduate classes in Honors Chemistry as a component of their training in organic chemistry.  The new instrument will be used by students and faculty at California State University - Northridge and Gonzaga University who will analyze data with cyber enabling software at their home institution.\r\n",
