 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Andrei G. Kutateladze of the University of Denver.  This research will involve the design and development of a new generation of photolabile systems that are capable of efficient photoinduced fragmentation.  They will be reacted using molecular recognition events, and will contain groups which will allow incorporation of these systems into certain polymer assemblies. Utilizing these systems, several fundamentally novel bioanalytical methodologies will be developed.  Further, a variety of studies will be undertaken to obtain a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanism of the photoinduced fragmentations.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.   A major broader impact of this research will be in the fundamental understanding of the principles governing these photoreactions since the findings will have broader implications in several fields, including high throughput screening, bio-analytical techniques and biophotonics. The research will provide broad and extensive training for the students (including female and minority students) since it involves an extensive variety of techniques.  It will help develop in these students a comprehensive set of experimental and theoretical skills needed in order to carry out productive work in an academic or industrial setting.  \r\n",
