 "awd_abstract_narration": "Necrotrophic pathogens are fungal and bacterial species that cause diseases by inducing cell death (necrosis) in their plant hosts. In this project, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate host response to necrotrophic pathogens will be studied. The Botrytis-induced kinase (BIK1) gene of Arabidopsis was identified as an important regulator of plant defense responses. Plants lacking BIK1 show increase susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria brassicicola but show increased resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. These findings suggest that BIK1 controls defense responses to biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens culminating in distinct responses, making BIK1 an ideal target for investigating the interactions between defense pathways. Antagonistic interactions between defense pathways mediating resistance to biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens have been established. However, the molecular mechanisms and the genetic control of these antagonistic interactions are still poorly understood. By studying BIK1 function and its signaling intermediates, this project provides new knowledge on cellular factors required to fight infections and how different disease resistance mechanisms interact. The specific objectives in this project are designed to elucidate the functions of BIK1. The genetic interactions between BIK1 and other components of the Arabidopsis defense will be studied to determine the overall role BIK1 in disease resistance. In addition, the components of the BIK1 regulated defense pathway will be identified and their function determined. Knowledge will be generated on plant molecular factors that signal necrotrophic pathogen borne signals and how these signals reach molecular targets to activate or repress disease resistance. This project provides training opportunity at the undergraduate, graduate and post graduate levels to enhance technical skills in the plant sciences. Activities designed to increase public awareness on the role of biotechnology in crop improvement will be presented at community forums. The project will also train students from groups underrepresented in science.",
