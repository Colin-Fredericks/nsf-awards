 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support from this grant will be used to continue a program of nuclear physics\r\nresearch focused on the fundamental properties of the nucleon.  The program is\r\nbased at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) and is\r\nfocused on two objectives.  The primary goal of this program will be to\r\ncomplete the construction of a tracking system for the Qweak experiment with\r\nthe involvment of two students. The second objective will be to prepare a\r\nphysics program as well as design and construct instrumentation for the JLab\r\n12 GeV upgrade. The Qweak experiment is a parity-violating electron scattering\r\nexperiment designed to measure the weak charge of the proton.  A measurement\r\nof the proton's weak charge can be used to extract a fundamental quantity\r\nknown as the weak mixing angle.  The current description of particle interactions,\r\ncommonly referred to as the \"\"Standard Model\"\", predicts how the weak mixing\r\nangle changes with the amount of momentum that is transferred during an\r\ninteraction.  As a result, a measurement of the proton's weak charge will evaluate\r\nthe veracity of the Standard Model as well as be sensitive to competing theoretical\r\ndescriptions involving new physics should the Standard Model fall short.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this NSF-supported program will primarily construct a tracking system critical to\r\nthe Qweak experiment, it will also continue to play a major role developing a physics\r\nprogram and instrumentation for the JLab 12 GeV upgrade.  The principal investigator\r\nis a co-spokesperson for a physics program to measure polarization observables of the\r\nnucleon at an energy upgraded JLab.  The measurements made will constrain the stark\r\ntheoretical predictions describing these distributions at kinematic regions where\r\nthe probed quark carries most of the nucleons momentum.  The PI is also supervising\r\nthe design of a tracking system for the JLab energy upgrade.  The development of particle\r\ntracking systems for Qweak and the JLab 12 GeV upgrade is the means through which this program\r\neducates both graduate and undergraduate students thereby enhancing the intellectual\r\ninfrastructure of our technology driven society.\r\n",
