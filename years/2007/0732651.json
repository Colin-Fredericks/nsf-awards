This award supports the cryospheric and oceano-graphic components of an integrated multi-disciplinary program to address these rapid and fundamental changes now taking place in Antarctic Peninsula (AP). By making use of a marine research platform (the RV NB Palmer and on-board helicopters) and additional logistical support from the Argentine Antarctic program, the project will bring glaciologists, oceanographers, marine geologists and biologists together, working collaboratively to address fundamentally interdisciplinary questions regarding climate change.   The project will include gathering a new, high-resolution paleoclimate record from the Bruce Plateau of Graham Land, and using it to compare Holocene- and possibly glacial-epoch climate to the modern period; investigating the stability of the remaining Larsen Ice Shelf and rapid post-breakup glacier response ? in particular, the roles of surface melt and ice-ocean interactions in the speed-up and retreat; observing the contribution of, and response of, oceanographic systems to ice shelf disintegration and ice-glacier interactions.  Helicopter support on board will allow access to a wide range of glacial and geological areas of interest adjacent to the Larsen embayment. At these locations, long-term in situ glacial monitoring, isostatic uplift, and ice flow GPS sites will be established, and high-resolution ice core records will be obtained using previously tested lightweight drilling equipment. Long-term monitoring of deep water outflow will, for the first time, be integrated into changes in ice shelf extent and thickness, bottom water formation, and multi-level circulation by linking near-source observations to distal sites of concentrated outflow.  The broader impacts of this international, multidisciplinary effort are that it will significantly advance our understanding of linkages amongst the earth's systems in the Polar Regions, and are proposed with international participation (UK, Spain, Belgium, Germany and Argentina) and interdisciplinary engagement in the true spirit of the International Polar Year (IPY). It will also provide a means of engaging and educating the public in virtually all aspects of polar science and the effects of ongoing climate change. The research team has a long record of involving undergraduates in research, educating high-performing graduate students, and providing innovative and engaging outreach products to the K-12 education and public media forums. Moreover, forging the new links both in science and international Antarctic programs will provide a continuing legacy, beyond IPY, of improved understanding and cooperation in Antarctica.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe interplay among ocean, atmosphere, and ice  in Antarctica is a key component in the global climate system, and can determine in large part significant aspects of local ecosystems where ocean, atmosphere and ice come together at the continental margins of Antarctica.  The Antarctic Peninsula provides a natural laboratory for exploring this important interplay, with numerous deeply-incised  glacial fjords on the western side, and broad continental shelves with wide, glacier-fed embayments on the eastern, Weddell Sea side.  The collapse of the Larsen B Ice shelf presented an opportunity to explore the physics of ocean-cryosphere interaction, water column and benthic ecology, and the recent geological history of ice-covered continental shelves, focusing on the newly-uncovered ocean and ocean-bottom in the Larsen B embayment remaining after the ice shelf collapse.\n\nThe LARISSA  program was conceived as a collaboration among investigators from US and international research institutions to learn more about the recent past and present of the Larsen B system, viewing it as a paradigm for ocean-cryosphere-biosphere-geosphere interaction occurring along the margins of many parts of Antarctica.  Measurements were carried out during research cruises and on-ice field campaigns over 4 years, based primarily on the US research ice breaker Nathaniel B Palmer (NBP), operated by the US National Science Foundation Division of Polar Programs.\n\nIntellectual Merit as Proposed\n\nLARISSA comprises three, tightly coordinated research projects:  Marine Ecosystems, Ocean-Cryosphere, and Marine and Quaternery Geosciences.  The research reported on here falls under the Ocean-Cryosphere topic, focused on the physical oceanographic measurements required by all three research areas, and on seeking to clarify the contribution and response of the ocean to ice shelf disintegration and ice-glacier interactions. Monitoring deep water outflow using oceanographic moorings would, for the first time, be integrated into observations of changes in ice shelf extent and thickness.\n\nThe Expeditions\n\nThe field work was planned for two cruises on board NBP to the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula, with the first in 2010, and the last in 2012. The first was planned to enter the Larsen B embayment, free of ice since the collapse of the ice shelf there in 2002, to collect oceanographic data, fly helicopter missions to the glaciers and surrounding exposed rock ashore, and to put in place a series of oceanographic instruments, moored to the ocean bottom to collect data for two years until their recovery. Extreme sea ice conditions prevailing early in 2010 and continuing to the present prevented the NBP from entering the Larsen B embayment.  A backup plan was implemented, moving the study sites to the western peninsula to allow helicopter deployments and oceanographic work in the fjords and adjoining waters. We returned to the eastern side of the peninsula in 2012, but were prevented by sea ice from entering the Larsen B embayment.  Backup for 2012 was to deploy our moorings in the Larsen A embayment north of the Larsen B, accessible but with mobility limited by sea ice.  We deployed 5 moorings, planning to retrieve them the following year with our Korean collaborators on their vessel Araon.  \n\nIn 2013, a brief opening in the sea ice allowed Araon to sail to the eastern side, recovering one of our moorings, and collecting oceanographic data in the Larsen A and along the growing fast ice front in the Larsen B.  The opening persisted for only a short time, and Araon was compelled to beat a hasty retreat as the lead closed behind us.  \n\nThe attached figures show the cruise tracks of all of the LARISSA cruises, and the location of oceanography moorings in the Larsen A, superimposed on a radar image of sea ice in 2013 when we recovered the one accessible mooring (site J). The other moorings remain in place, perhaps to be recovered in coming years.  Oceanographic data from the..."
