 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to workforce needs in central Florida, this project is developing and implementing a cybersecurity specialization within an AS degree program in Computer Engineering Technology (CET).  Project objectives include increasing the number of full-time entering students declaring a major in CET by 5% each year, increasing retention rates for targeted CET students by 5% by the end of the project period, and increasing placement rates for targeted CET completers by 5% by the end of the project period.\r\n\r\nThe project is undertaking a number of activities related to curriculum and program development, faculty development, and articulation, including:\r\n\r\n* establishing qualifications for cybersecurity professionals;\r\n* establishing strong partnerships between two-year and four-year institutions, business, industry, and government;\r\n* developing articulation agreements between local institutions (especially between Valencia Community College and the University of Central Florida);\r\n* integrating certification requirements into courses and programs;\r\n* aligning and adapting courses and course content;\r\n* preparing students for immediate employment and continued career advancement;\r\n* using the National Security Agency categorization of security positions as a framework for developing program requirements;\r\n* developing collaborative activities across institutions to promote cybersecurity careers; and\r\n* providing faculty with training on the most effective instructional methods for maximizing student learning.\r\n\r\nData being collected as indicators of success include course enrollment, retention, and completion; declared majors; program completion; placements; participation of underrepresented groups; and timely completion of project activities.",
