 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to examine the impact of increased doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind generation on power system dynamic performance.  The approach in this project deals with examining the following issues:\r\n1.\tAnalysis of increased penetration of DFIG wind turbine units on transient stability\r\n2.\tDesign of power electronics based control to mimic effect of inertia and enhance transient stability performance\r\n3.\tVerification of the performance of the proposed controller in improving transient stability performance\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project consists of a novel approach to increase the potential for penetration of a valuable renewable resource which could have a significant impact on reducing environmental concerns and the nation's reliance on foreign energy resources.    This is a core issue for the US in order to maintain it global leadership and productivity.  Providing advanced controls to maintain the reliability of the transmission grid will guarantee electric energy delivery and economic viability.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts the project brings together two investigators from two different areas of research expertise in a well integrated project that combines the complementary expertise of each investigator.  An important aim of this project is to expose the excitement of our discipline to high school students.  The results from this project will be widely disseminated through the various meetings of this center and also through Internet seminars that are held every week to provide industry and university members exposure to research activities in the center.\r\n\r\n",
