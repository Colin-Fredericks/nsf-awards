 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the advances in imaging technology for medicine and science, an increasing number of volume datasets (3D arrays of scalar values) are being generated, producing an overwhelming flood of raw 3D data that must be processed, viewed and analyzed.  In computer graphics several laser scan reconstruction algorithms generate volumetric, implicit representations.  Many of the advanced special effects in movies utilize physical simulation to produce computer-generated floods and fluid flows.  The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations for these effects are usually performed on a regular 3D grid and produce dynamic volume datasets.  Given these multiple sources of volumetric datasets, there is a great need for powerful implicit model editing capabilities.  To address this need the PIs are developing techniques and algorithms for interactive freeform editing of large-scale, multiresolution level set models.  Level set models combine a low-level volumetric representation, the mathematics of deformable implicit surfaces, and robust numerical techniques to provide a powerful approach to geometric modeling.\r\n\r\nThis research is developing the mathematics, algorithms and techniques needed to implement numerous level set modeling capabilities.  Those capabilities include: freeform manipulation, topology control, large-scale representations, multiresolution editing, and interactive response times.  Level set speed functions based on a variety of user input data, as well as surface features and properties provide the foundation for the freeform editing operators. Recent advances in efficient representations for large-scale level set surfaces (DT-Grids) are employed for representing detailed high resolution objects.  A hierarchical, multiresolution volumetric data structure is utilized along with associated algorithms for decomposition, reconstruction and inter-level movement transfer.  Algorithms from point-based surfaces are being extended to provide topology control, local parameterizations and interactive display.\r\n",
