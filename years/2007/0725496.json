 "awd_abstract_narration": "MEMS Device for Molecular Sorting and Pumping with Moving Boundaries\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to design, fabricate, and optimize an active MEMS device for microfluidic pumping and molecular sorting.  The approach is to use cascaded moving boundaries coupled with a specific geometric design of nozzle and diffuser elements to create a highly efficient unidirectional flow.  For filtering, a surface acoustic wave generator will be integrated in the device to actively modulate the transport and surface adhesion of specific compounds. Microfabrication of the device will be performed using polydimethylsiloxane polymer, electrostatic actuation, and piezoelectric technology, based on computational simulations of the design.  The prototype device will be used to validate the initial numerical design and the computational model will then be used to further optimize the device.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed research will contribute to basic developments through coupled fluid-structure simulations and prototype fabrication in the design and synthesis of MEMS devices with moving boundaries for effective pumping and molecular sorting.  The proposed device will significantly improve existing technology by creating unidirectional flow from a microfluidic moving boundary system.  This research will extend the current state-of-the-art in the areas of computational simulations, MEMS device design and fabrication, and optimization.\r\nBroader Impacts:  Development of a MEMS device aided by computational simulations will lead to the design of micro-/nanoscale systems for on-chip biological fluid diagnostic systems, targeted drug delivery, and immunoisolation of bio-artificial organs. Lab-on-a-chip systems that will benefit from this work will ultimately provide inexpensive and fast laboratory diagnostic and assessment tools to medical, environmental, and military personnel in clinical settings or in remote, rural, and poorly served locations.  Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this research will acquire multidisciplinary training in the fields of computational modeling, micro-device fabrication, and biological applications.\r\n\r\n",
