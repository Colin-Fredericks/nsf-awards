 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project uses the resources of the UC Davis Department of Mathematics to attract more US citizens to careers in the mathematical sciences, with special attention paid to women and underrepresented groups.  The main tool for this is the Research Focus Group (RFG), a construct created in the prior VIGRE grant, which has been wildly successful.  An RFG is a group of faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students, who collaborate in a year-long intense exploration of a particular research area.  Through RFG activities, members are exposed to cutting-edge research, and they participate in all its aspects: exploration, discovery, leadership, exposition, and lecturing.  In particular, graduate students develop strong communication skills, both written and verbal.  Every year, four RFGs are selected and funded.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the RFGs are activities new to this project: A Mini-Grant Program through which students can apply not just for summer stipends but for conference travel funds, or even to organize workshops, to run outreach activities, or to host visiting mathematicians.  Writing a mini-grant is not only a valuable challenge that forces the students to plan and organize a research project, but it also unleashes the creativity of the graduate students and postdocs.\r\n\r\nMathematics majors are recruited aggressively using several tools: The EXPLORE Math program is an outreach program for high school and undergraduate students that was created by VIGRE graduate students.  The project supports local student organizations, Math Club and Math Cafe, to promote peer-based recruitment and retention of mathematics majors.  Mathematics fairs for senior high school students are held in geographic proximity (which includes large communities of underrepresented minorities) to attract incoming freshmen to major in math and promote career paths that use mathematics.  VIGRE-funded students and postdocs are required to participate in at least two of the many outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThe increased focus on particular research areas leads to increased research productivity among students and postdocs.  It may also lead to new developments and results obtained by RFG participants (e.g., theses, publications, and lecture notes).  Attending conferences increases the exposure of graduate students to new ideas and to the dissemination of research.\r\n\r\nThe impact on creating a larger and better group of U.S. citizens and permanent residents working in mathematics will be significant.  The project directly affects the surrounding geographic area of Northern and Central California.  In the recruitment plan special attention is given to attracting and retaining minorities currently underrepresented in mathematics but abundant in this geographic area.",
