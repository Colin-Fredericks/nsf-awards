 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will permit the acquisition of an ion chromatograph for the Department of Geology at Ball State University (BSU).  This new instrument is important for PI-based research, and undergraduate as well as graduate education.  The ion chromatograph is essential in achieving the research goals actively pursued by the PI's and their students (e.g., water quality studies in Indiana, hydrothermal systems in Idaho and abroad) and will enhance the department's teaching on environmental and geochemical topics.  The ion chromatograph will be fully integrated in teaching and education activities at BSU, including the NSF-sponsored GLOBE program, the Indiana Space Grant Consortium, and the training of teachers and/or education majors (i.e., future science teachers).  Students will be trained on a modern instrument and learn analytical techniques, which will ultimately increase student research in the form of student-led abstracts, presentations, and publications.  These student-led projects will encourage more in-depth research activities for both faculty and students and will provide important initial data for faculty to develop proposals for external funding.  The ion chromatograph will complement existing instrumentation and be available for faculty and students in other departments at BSU.",
