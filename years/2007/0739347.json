 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile computing and wireless telephony are increasing converging, with many\r\nhandheld devices (e.g., PALM Treos and RIM Blackberries) able to assume roles as\r\neither cellular telephones or as computers. A key research question that arises as a\r\nconsequence of this convergence is whether the strategies such as virtualization used for\r\nisolation and resource sharing in larger cabled computers will be applicable to machines\r\nthat are limited by size, computational power and battery life. This question also has great\r\nbearing on the extent to which NSF's proposed GENI initiative will impact the most\r\nnumerous network endpoints (there are more than 2 billion GSM mobile phones in use,\r\nfor example).\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on an experimental effort to anticipate this need and provide a definitive\r\nanswer to the question of resource division and isolation in handheld devices. Our\r\ncandidate devices are HP iPaq handhelds, although if time permits we will also\r\ninvestigate a cellphone platform that uses a reduced version of the Linux operating\r\nsystem. The experiment will be to demonstrate virtualization of a handheld node that\r\nallows it to be used as a MANET (i.e., as a packet relay) concurrently with its use as a\r\nVoIP edge device. The performance will be evaluated using the e-Model for voice\r\nquality. Maintaining voice quality will demonstrate the effectiveness of the resource\r\nmanagement and isolation.\r\n",
