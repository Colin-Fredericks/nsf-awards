 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II research project will develop a robust, commercial ready sensor that enables the first viable implementation of real-time control for plasma spray, reducing the cost for existing spray applications and enabling advanced coating applications that require tighter tolerances. The sensing scheme, based on a high speed solid state array, is superior to existing sensors because it can sense individual particles across the entire plume and can filter out non-molten particles that don't contribute to the coating. For the first time, a sensor will provide the basis for real-time, closed loop control for coating thickness of plasma sprayed parts. The Phase II research will develop production models of the sensor and the related closed loop control module, as well as establish proof of concept for advanced versions of the sensor. \r\n\r\nPlasma spray is a high-throughput, economical, low environmental impact process that can be used to custom engineer coating microstructures to meet specific performance requirements, primarily in the form of thermal barrier coatings for gas turbines used in power generation and aircraft engine applications as well as emerging applications such as the electrolyte coating for fuel cells. Currently, the plasma spray process is run open-loop with respect to the critical deposition physics that determine coating quality and is characterized by large variations in coating thickness and structure. \r\n",
