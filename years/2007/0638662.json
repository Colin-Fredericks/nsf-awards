Chamely-Wiik\r\nINSTITUTION: Florida Atlantic University\r\nTITLE: Project ChemBOND: The Next Generation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project, which is a partnership between the Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and the Palm Beach County School District (PBCSD), will focus on incorporating Project ChemBOND into the high school science classes (grades 9-12) through the GK-12 program. The ChemBOND initiative has been successful at the university level. The project will develop, adapt, and adopt conceptually based, hands-on chemistry activities (ChemBOND Modules) in both the classroom and laboratory, to create a seamless environment that fosters learning and understanding. Each year the project will recruit 8 STEM graduate fellows and 8 teachers. Together they will serve approximately 40 classes in 4 PBCSD schools. Modules for chemistry and related sciences will be developed and implemented collaboratively by graduate fellows and teachers. Relationships established between the PBCSD and FAU will result in permanent positive changes at all institutions and foster sustainable interactions. The principal investigators will work with external evaluators to evaluate the effectiveness of the project. The intellectual merit includes implementation of ChemBOND at the high school level. The broader impacts include providing the opportunity to a diverse population of high school students and teachers to increase their science content knowledge and engage in scientific inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
