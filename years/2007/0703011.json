 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaborative effort netween the Center for 21st Century Skills at Education Connection and Connecticut's College of Technology as part of their NSF ATE Regional Center for Next Generation Manufacturing. The project also involves creating strategic partnerships with other NSF-ATE centers, such as the Boston Area Advanced Technology Education Center (BATEC), and industrial partners. \r\n\r\nA number of workforce surveys conducted by business associations and state agencies document a persistent need for technology personnel in advanced manufacturing, biomedicine, and information technology. In Connecticut, only five percent of urban high school graduates currently qualify for entrance to postsecondary Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programs. Therefore, an effective effort is needed to provide educational opportunities that engage underrepresented students in the inner cities. Without access to engaging STEM experiences and exposure to role models who have succeeded in STEM related careers, it is unlikely that a significant number of underrepresented students will consider preparing for technical fields. The project addresses workforce, pedagogical, and underrepresented student recruitment issues. A mature and proven intervention method is used that has been successfully implemented over the last five years that involves the creation of Research and Development Challenges. This annual contest requires teams of students with guidance from mentors to research, develop, design, and present solutions to technical challenges. These solutions are evaluated by industry and community college judges. \r\n\r\nThe educational experiences are specifically designed to increase the number of underrepresented students pursuing associate degrees. The project strengthens the relationships between the high school and the community college educators. It provides an educational continuum of articulated courses and experiential learning activities, which help (a) assure successful transition into Connecticut's College of Technology and (b) produce the next generation of students who can support and sustain Connecticut's technical workforce and ultimately the economy.\r\n",
