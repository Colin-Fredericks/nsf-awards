Cassava foods must be processed to remove cyanogens prior to consumption as exposure to lower levels of cyanide causes vomiting, nausea, palpitations, headaches and impaired vision. The long-term ingestion of large quantities of poorly processed cassava has also been shown to be associated with chronic cyanide-associated health disorders in several areas of Africa. Recent findings have also demonstrated an involvement of cyanogens in both amino acid content and post-harvest deterioration complementing its herbivore deterrent capabilities. The gene for beta-cyanoalanine synthase (beta-CAS), a mitochondrial enzyme that detoxifies cyanide to asparagine has been identified. The research proposed here plans to further characterize the cassava beta-CAS DNA sequence as well as clarify the function of this enzyme by introducing the gene into model plant Arabidopsis. Furthermore transgenic cassava over-expressing beta-CAS gene in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria will be produced. The expression of beta-CAS in the cytoplasm would divert cyanogens from root storage to the synthesis of amino acids, producing a cassava variety with enhanced amino acid pool and thus higher protein nutrition. In addition, roots over-expressing beta-CAS will be analyzed for post-harvest deterioration since the affinity of beta-CAS for cyanide should lead to a reduction in the available reactive-oxygen species, and thus to a longer shelf-life. The broader impact of this project is to develop a more nutritious food source for 600 million people world-wide while educating undergraduate and graduate students attending the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, all of whom belong to an underrepresented group (Hispanic) in biology. \r\n",
