 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the limits to the performance of tightly-coupled heterogeneous supercomputing within the field of high-performance computing (HPC).  The proposed project will develop accurate models to predict the performance of heterogeneous systems.  The development of accurate models to predict the performance of heterogeneous systems will impose a scientific rigor on this field and will be of great\r\nbenefit to potential users of these systems.  The proposed work is multidisciplinary across the areas of computer sciences and applications, and will be driven by real world high performance applications expected to run on such systems, drawn from the fields of biology and medicine.   Formal dissemination of this research will take place through presentations and publication in the major conferences and journals, and through interactions between academia and industry thus enhancing the potential impact of this work to emerging commercial products.\r\n\r\n",
