 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative project involving California Polytechnic State University, Colorado School of Mines, Purdue University, United States Air Force Academy, University of Pittsburgh, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.  It is building upon and extending model-eliciting activities (MEAs), a proven methodology developed in mathematics education research and recently introduced to engineering education. MEAs use open-ended case studies to simulate authentic, real-world problems that small teams of students address. MEA were developed to observe the development of student problem-solving competencies and the growth of mathematical cognition. However, it has been increasingly documented as a methodology to help students become better problem solvers, as well as a tool to help both instructors and researchers better design situations to engage learners in productive mathematical thinking. The investigators are taking the theoretical framework from mathematics education and research results from a series of NSF funded studies and creating a strategic, scalable approach for addressing crucial goals in engineering education. These goals include developing effective, transferable competencies in problem-solving and creativity; more effectively learning and retaining important concepts; and more effectively identifying misconceptions and nurturing positive ethical frameworks. They also are investigating and extending a suite of assessment approaches that have been developed and tested in recent MEA research.  Their specific objectives are: (1) to expand the MEA methodology and application, (2) to study students' problem solving strategies and extend the use of MEAs to specific aspects of undergraduate reasoning and problem-solving, (3) to determine solution paths first-year engineering students use in solving MEAs, (4) to execute a comprehensive dissemination and infusion effort, and (5) to develop a comprehensive research agenda for models and modeling in undergraduate education. In particular, they are deepening the implementation of MEAs and related student and faculty assessment in undergraduate curriculum across the six partner institutions; broadening the libraries of usable MEAs to different engineering disciplines; and extending the MEA approach to misconceptions, innovation, and ethical decision-making in engineering.  They are disseminating their material and results through papers at conferences and in achieved journals, through CD and web formats with links to the NSDL, through a number of workshops for both engineering educators and K-12 teachers, and through special programs for pre-service teachers at several participating institutions.  The evaluation effort, which is led by an outside independent evaluator, is monitoring progress on all five objectives.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the materials and results, the workshops for other faculty, the K-12 teacher outreach, and the positive effects of this engaging approach on students from underrepresented populations.",
