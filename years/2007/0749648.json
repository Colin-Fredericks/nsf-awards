It has been suggested that NSF create a   GCC in the area of computer security.  Working with NSF and other agencies, the PI identifies some of the difficulties attendant to such a competition on computer security, including the need to ensure the interest of the community, to develop a fair and credible rule set for judging entries, to ensure that any competition both presents an effective public face and will produce useful results.\r\n\r\nBased on these insights, the PI is developing rules for an initial and scaled-down competition to be held in conjunction with a few universities or at a workshop or conference.  If successful, the full GCC would be designed and offered on a large scale.  \r\n\r\nA key issue is the competition example.  The PI is designing the competition based on a self-defending network, wherein the competitors would be given a reference system which their automated tools (the defense) must attempt to discover and remove vulnerabilities without human intervention.\r\n",
