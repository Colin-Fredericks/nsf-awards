 "awd_abstract_narration": "This immersion program is designed to provide a broad foundational knowledge in neurobiology, as well as depth in the particular field of lamprey locomotion.  Professor Avis Cohen, a distinguished neurobiologist and professor at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP), has agreed to host the PI for the course of this immersion program and has worked with the PI to develop a strategy to achieve these objectives.  The PI will spend the academic year, including two summers in Professor Cohen's neurophysiology lab, observing experiments and interacting with her students, postdocs, and collaborators.  She will also attend research meetings, in which she will be expected to interact with the group by participating in the discussions, presenting papers, and when appropriate presenting recent results.  In the Fall of 2006, the PI will attend a graduate class in neurophysiology to develop foundational knowledge and broad perspective of the field.  The PI will participate in two on-going research projects in the area of locomotion.  This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).\r\n",
