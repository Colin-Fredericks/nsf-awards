 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rust College will update the Computer Science Curriculum to reflect advances in the field of Computer Science and meet industry standards with a HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project.  The project will create six courses in the Computer Science Degree Program and create a Unix/Linux Laboratory.  These changes will make the Rust College Computer Science Degree Program more competitive for students with other institutions.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Updating the curriculum will increase the skills and knowledge of Rust College graduates and prepare them to be more competitive in the job market and more prepared for graduate school. Our plan will update our curriculum by developing a new Unix/Linux Operating System Programming course,  and a new Programming Logic and Design course (students will develop programming solutions to real world problems). These courses will help to hold the attention of students and help them realize that their work can have a meaningful effect. Two new advanced programming courses (Advanced Programming in JAVA and Algorithm Design and Analysis) will give our students the needed skills for being more competitive nationally and globally in the job market. Computer Science Capstone and Computer Science Seminar Courses will also be created and implemented within the funded period.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The project will successfully prepare Rust graduates for graduate school and industry.  The updates for our Computer Science Curriculum will enhance our program and promote discovery and understanding of the programming procedures of in-demand operating systems and programming languages. The curriculum modification will attract more students to Rust College since the new program will be comparable to other available degree programs in the area. The new degree should also be a more enticing major for freshmen who have not yet chosen a major field of study.",
