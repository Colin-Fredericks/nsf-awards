 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the development of novel plasma technologies for creating highly efficient, short-wavelength radiation sources for use in next-generation semiconductor chip manufacturing.  The development of radiation sources that efficiently emit light at wavelengths near 13.5 nm is crucial to the expected emergence of EUV lithography as the primary technique used in manufacturing integrated circuits and DRAM near the end of this decade.  Laser-produced plasma experiments will be conducted to validate and refine the novel high-efficiency, low-debris EUV light source designs developed in our previous work.  Comparisons between experimental data and simulations performed using state-of-the-art simulation tools will facilitate the development of light sources with high 13.5 nm conversion efficiencies.  This project will lead to lower cost, more efficient, and more robust EUV lithography light sources for use in the manufacturing of next-generation semiconductor chips.  \r\n\r\nShort-wavelength radiation sources are applicable to a wide variety of research areas, and have significant value in commercial applications, basic research, and defense research and technology.  Such sources are valued not only for use in EUV lithography, but also in medical research, instrumentation, and technology.  While this project will focus on the development of plasma-based technologies for creating highly efficient light sources for EUV lithography, it is likely that techniques and capabilities developed under this project will further the development of plasma light sources applicable to other major areas of research and technology.\r\n",
