 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Geoscience Research at Storm Peak (GRASP) program will create an exceptional field research experience for a diverse group of nine undergraduate students. Students four institutions will gain hands-on experiences in atmospheric science at the Desert Research Institute's Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL) in June 2008. Participating institutions include Howard University, Tennessee State University, Colorado State University at Pueblo, and the University of Nevada, Reno. Offering a unique experience of scientific exchange, SPL on the summit of Mt. Werner near Steamboat Springs, Colorado, allows students to work and live within its facilities. While at SPL, students will work in small groups measuring cloud properties and trace gases with the guidance of an individual instructor. The data collected will be the basis for continuing student research projects. Such projects will address climate change, pollution measurements, and cloud formation. Upon leaving SPL, students will travel to the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) for a tour and to meet with student participants of the Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research (SOARS) program. All GRASP participants will meet at the campus of Howard University the following winter for a reunion workshop. Extensive atmospheric science facilities available at Howard University will enable experience with remote sensing instrumentation. Evaluation of the students'comprehension from the GRASP program will be documented and published.",
