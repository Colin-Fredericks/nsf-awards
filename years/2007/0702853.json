 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advancing Technological Literacy and Skills (ATLAS) focuses on preservice instruction in technological literacy and the preparation of future elementary teachers to integrate technology and engineering concepts and activities into their elementary classrooms in accordance with the Massachusetts K-12 technology and engineering standards. The goals of the ATLAS project are to: 1) enrich community college elementary education courses with technology and engineering; 2) strengthen elementary educators' knowledge of and capabilities to teach technology, engineering, and science; 3) develop articulation pathways related to elementary technology/engineering between high schools, community colleges, and four-year institutions; 4) create a cadre of community college and four-year faculty that disseminate capabilities and curricular models to colleagues in the region and state; and 5) increase awareness among stakeholders about the importance of effective technology and engineering elementary education programs. ATLAS partners include the Museum of Science, Boston; Northern Essex Community College; Holyoke Community College; Westfield State College; Fitchburg State College; the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; several high schools; two industry partners; the Massachusetts Executive Office of Community Colleges; and three Tech Prep consortia. Education faculty from the community colleges are participating in professional development institutes offered by engineering/technology faculty and Museum of Science staff to bolster their understanding of content and pedagogical techniques for teaching elementary technology and engineering and of career options and pathways in technical fields.  In turn, the faculty work with ATLAS staff to develop and implement 1) elementary education course syllabi and sequences that include technology and engineering and 2) professional development workshops for their colleagues and other educators focused on technology and engineering elementary education. Industry externships are offered to community college faculty and preservice students to expand their understanding of the technological world.  ATLAS is defining coursework for elementary teacher preparation pathways leading from high school through community college to four-year institution to include Standards for Technological Literacy and Massachusetts Science and Technology/Engineering Frameworks integrated into coursework at all three levels. The project is also working to raise awareness among stakeholders regarding the need to incorporate technology and engineering into elementary education. \r\n",
