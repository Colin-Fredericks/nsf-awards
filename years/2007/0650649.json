The IEEE CDC is the premier annual international conference on systems and automatic control research. The 45th CDC now has an expected level of participation over 1500. The technical merit of proposed effort project is that it will enable US graduate students to participate in a high quality, rigorously peer reviewed event attended by many of the world leaders in systems and control.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nWith around 1000 research presentations, including several plenary lectures by renowned researchers, together with numerous tutorial presentations, workshops and exhibits the CDC provides exposure to the state-of-the-art in emerging areas of control research and technology. The broader impact of the project is that it will help train the next generation of control researchers and practitioners. The future security and well-being of the United States relies on maintaining a pools of trained scientists and engineers in critical areas such as control technology. The students supported under the present project represent the future technological leaders of the IEEE Control Systems Society, which is the world's premier professional society in systems and control.\r\n\r\n",
