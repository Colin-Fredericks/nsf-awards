The first summer internship will be carried out in a research program at the University of Central Florida (UCF) or Clemson under the mentorship of a European graduate/post-doc as part of a US/European collaborative research program.  Their second summer internship will be performed in a collaborating European research institution, continuing research in the same research discipline, thereby providing the students with a solid research foundation preparatory to graduate study.\r\n\r\nThis site is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), Europe and Eurasia Program.\r\n",
