Wojciechowski, Slawomir Klimek\r\n\r\nWe propose to organize a conference on applications of Dirac\r\noperators in geometry, topology and quantum field theory at the\r\nDepartment of Mathematical Sciences of the Indiana University -\r\nPurdue University at Indianapolis from Friday to Saturday, March\r\n2-3, 2007.  The main purpose of the conference is to create an\r\nopportunity to present and discuss some of the most recent and\r\nimportant results in the aforementioned area of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe tentative list of speakers includes\r\n1. W. Muller (Bonn University) who will talk about the relation\r\nbetween the spectral analysis of Dirac operators and the Selberg\r\nProgram.\r\n2. A. Carey (ANU Canberra) is expected to talk about his recent\r\nwork on spectral flow and the spectral shift function.\r\n3. J. Dodziuk (CUNY New York) will talk about Laplacians on\r\ngraphs.\r\n4. M. Braverman (NEU) will talk about generalized analytic\r\ntorsion and eta-invariant.\r\n5. S. Stolz (Notre Dame) will talk about applications of Dirac\r\noperators in algebraic topology.\r\n6. L. Nicolaescu (Notre Dame) will talk about his research on\r\nsingularities.\r\n7. P. Kirk (IU at Bloomington) will talk about applications of\r\neta invariant and spectral flow to the study of the topology of\r\n3-manifolds.\r\nWe have also scheduled several talks by graduate students who are\r\nabout to complete their PhD theses on related topics.\r\n\r\nThis meeting has a long and outstanding tradition dating back to\r\n1994. It is well-advertised within the Indiana math community. It\r\nis recognized as an event having a unique atmosphere with a\r\nmixture of presentations of new results and a lot of interaction\r\nbetween older and younger generations of mathematicians. The list\r\nof speakers includes many famous mathematicians whose work is\r\nrelated to Dirac operators. Previous meetings have resulted in\r\nseveral important collaborations by the participants published in\r\njournals of the highest quality .  This year we are going to make\r\nan extra effort in order to bring the Conference to the attention\r\nof the math community on a national level and we are going\r\nactively pursue graduate students with research interest related\r\nto the Conference.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the conference Web site,\r\nhttp://www.math.iupui.edu/dirac2007.",
