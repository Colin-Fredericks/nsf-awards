 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the REU site in Spectroscopy at Coe College, sponsored jointly by the Physics and Chemistry departments, which continues a tradition of strong interaction with undergraduate students pursuing high-level, publishable research. The REU students will carry out high-level research in glass science, optics, environmental chemistry, organic synthesis, acoustics, atmospheric chemistry and biomaterials, all under the common focus of spectroscopy.   They will be exposed and trained in a variety of techniques, including FTIR, Raman, NMR, time of flight mass spectrometry, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, scanning probe microscopy, x-ray fluorescence, thermal calorimetry, and others. The projects in each area are designed to be suitable for undergraduates, but also challenging and leading to results of interest to external researchers.   Training in spectroscopy has become more important as issues of national security have arisen, and it is expected that a cadre of scientists well-trained in a variety of spectroscopic techniques is likely to be a necessity in many government agencies.  Additional educational activities provide participating students with a well-rounded exposure to different spectroscopic techniques. The site is especially interested in students from rural backgrounds who attend small colleges offering little or no opportunities for research.  \r\nThis site is funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program in the Division of Physics and the Division of Chemistry.",
