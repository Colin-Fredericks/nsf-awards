 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to establish the NSF Summer Institute on Nano-Mechanics, Nano-Materials and Micro/Nano-Manufacturing. The major activity of the Institute is to offer short courses on fundamental concepts and tools in nano-mechanics, nano-materials, and micro/nano-manufacturing, typically two per summer.  Additional courses may be offered in collaboration with professional societies.  In addition, the principal investigator and his coworkers will select specific modules from these short courses and develop them into web-based courses suitable for self-learning and integration into existing university curriculum.  A secondary objective is to provide networking opportunities among participants, researchers and leaders in the field to promote collaborative educational and research endeavors.\r\n\r\nOne important impact of the proposed summer institute is the multiplying effect.  It is expected that participants trained in these areas will in short order launch their own initiatives in the subject areas, such as new research programs, products or processes, curriculum development or enhancement, etc.  These will in turn spur other ideas and activities.  Further, nano-mechanics, nano-materials and micro/nano-manufacturing will undoubtedly have a broad impact on medicine, electronics, and materials in the next two decades.  These short courses provide the much-needed training for practicing scientists and engineers.  As such, the proposed summer institute will facilitate the realization of practical nano-sciences and nano-engineering by turning these new technologies into real-world products.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
