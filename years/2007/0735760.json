This award will permit an upgrade to the computer and EDS/imaging electronics and associated software for the instrument. The upgrade will allow us to continue to offer reliable, non-destructive, in situ chemical microanalysis by electron microprobe for the earth and materials sciences at Duke and UNC.  In addition, it will improve our ability to acquire large area element composition maps. The upgraded regional facility will be a cost-effective method to support a wide range of research interest at Duke and the University of North Carolina, as well as other colleges and universities in North Carolina.  It will also allow continued teaching of both undergraduate and graduate students in modern electron microbeam techniques.",
