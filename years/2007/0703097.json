The Center focuses on pedagogical transformation to assist educators in the successful adaptation, enhancement, and implementation of \"BATEC stamped\" curriculum and other best practice materials that provide an articulated sequence of courses in high schools, two-year colleges, and the University of Massachusetts/Boston.",
