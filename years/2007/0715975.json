 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This project expands the development, evaluation and dissemination of educational devices, software and curriculum materials that focus on the nature of light, optics, color and visual perception. The project has two core strategies: (1) to empower students to use personal computers as actual light and optics experimental laboratories by providing them with software that controls the optical emission of computer screens and by developing materials and devices that can be used to probe light with computers; and (2) to provide students with intellectually exciting and pedagogically sound laboratory exercises that help guide them in an inquiry based manner to explore with their own eyes and at their own pace the most important ideas about light. The laboratory experiences take advantage of the optical properties of computer screens that can be controlled by software the project is developing. Students can manipulate and explore this light source with the materials in an inexpensive optics kit and other apparatus developed by the project. \r\n\r\nThe project is developing computer-interfaced hardware such as a USB-based PC spectrophotometer and a USB-based photometer. It is also developing a powerful JAVA-based program called the Spectrum Explorer (SPEX). At present, it gives students the means to examine blackbody radiation, Kirchhoff's laws, the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, emission and absorption line spectra and to Doppler shift any spectrum and examine the spectra of stars in an H-R diagram. SPEX is being expanded by adding to it the ability to apply Rayleigh scattering, interstellar reddening, the Zeeman effect and various other physical effects and filters to spectra, and to be able to easily import spectra from numerous spectroscopic databases and from many spectrophotometers. SPEX is also being integrated with the National Virtual Observatory to facilitate student access to the enormous NVO database of the spectra of most observed astronomical objects. This expansion of SPEX helps empower students to do original scientific research as well as more realistic laboratory exercises. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Along with the expanded development and testing of Project LITE materials, national impact of all of the LITE educational outcomes is being expanded by implementing them in astronomy classes at other universities, community colleges, and standards-based high schools. Appropriate LITE components are being tested in physics, chemistry and psychology courses, as well as in science courses for pre-service teachers. The LITE materials are also being tested in distance education, home-learning and adult continuing education environments. Evaluation and assessment of learning gains, including the national dissemination of the \"Light and Spectroscopy Concept Inventory\" about the quantum aspects of light and a new light concept inventory dealing with the geometrical and physical aspects of light,  parallels the expanded development of software, hardware and associated laboratory exercises. National dissemination is occurring through publications, teacher-training workshops, meeting presentations, commercial manufacture, and collaborations with national science organizations including the OSA and ASP.",
