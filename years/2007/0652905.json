The project objectives are to 1) simulate nanoscale local light enhancement by nanodevices; 2) detect near-field-enhanced photochemistry; 3) deposit diamond-like carbon (DLC) films on nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) devices using laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition; and 4) characterize tribological performance of DLC-coated NEMS.\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\nThe proposed research is to utilize optical near-fields as local energy sources for chemical reactions. It is a controllable surface process which extends surface coating to 3-D nanostructures. Fundamental understanding of nanoscale material deposition by highly spatially confined EM wave is of major scientific interests. It is a technique directly addressing the needs for coatings on sharp tips and edges of nanostructures, especially as self-lubricating and protective coatings for extensive wear applications at nanometric levels. \r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThis research will benefit the society by revolutionizing the efficiency, cost, and positioning accuracy of coating functional thin films on 3-D nanostructures which have wide applications such as semiconductor, photonics, electronics, and consumer products. Research outputs will be disseminated via a website and through different conferences. Students from underrepresented groups will work on the proposed project. The research results will be integrated into an existing undergraduate/graduate course \"Introduction to Nanotechnology.\" An animation kit showing the applications of NEMS and basic ideas on the thin film deposition at the nanoscale will be developed and distributed to K-12 teachers and students in annual public seminars. \r\n\r\n",
