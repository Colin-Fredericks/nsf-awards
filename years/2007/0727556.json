 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  This project is supporting 19-20 students through a biology major as excellent preparation for meaningful scientific careers. To qualify for BFF scholarships, students must demonstrate significant financial need and show promise for success in biology. Preference is given to students from underrepresented groups. The goals are to increase the number and improve the academic outcomes of this cohort of students.  The project is building on the college's interdisciplinary and research-focused biology program and its existing federally funded TRiO/Student Support Services (SSS) program. It is also building on an existing pre-matriculation biology course and Supplemental Instruction (SI) offered to all SSS students taking introductory biology. The college's Center for Experiential Learning is helping to provide career exploration and support. The Offices of Admissions and Financial Aid are helping recruit qualified students. A new initiative is an optional summer reading and writing skills course using biological literature. Other activities include optional career-oriented field trips, additional peer SI leaders and tutors, seminars and workshops, social gatherings with visiting speakers, and involvement in summer research and internships. \r\nBroader Impacts: The primary impact of this program is on the students themselves. The freedom to study deeply and broadly, permitted by these scholarships, helps prepare them well as biologists and gives them time to take steps to realize future careers in biology. Their impact on society will have the broadest resonance. \r\nThere will be impact beyond the grant period. Many of the proposed program elements will be sustained if effective (e.g., additional tutors and supplemental instruction, the proposed course). The newly identified mentors and intern hosts will continue to work with the College. The entire faculty will benefit from the scholarship of teaching activities.",
