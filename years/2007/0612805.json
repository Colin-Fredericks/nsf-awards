 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of CMS Experiment is to realize the physics discoveries made possible by the U.S. investment\r\nof the NSF and the DOE in building the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron\r\nCollider (LHC) at CERN. This is a multi-year program to maintain and operate the U.S.-supplied systems\r\nof the CMS detector and to maintain and continue to strengthen the software, computing and collaborative\r\ninfrastructure of U.S. universities working on the CMS experiment.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The LHC will open a new regime in particle physics up to and beyond the TeV\r\nenergy scale, made accessible for the first time by a combination of high luminosity of 1034cm 2s 1 and\r\nthe proton-proton center of mass energy of 14 TeV. The unprecedented energy range and luminosity of\r\nthis new particle accelerator, combined with the special capabilities of the CMS experiment for particle\r\ndetection and measurement, are expected to lead to discoveries of new elementary particles and novel\r\nbehaviors of the fundamental forces. Such discoveries could have revolutionary effects on our\r\nunderstanding of the unification of forces, the origin and stability of matter, the ultimate underpinnings of\r\nthe observable universe, and the nature of space-time itself. The LHC, which is now being constructed by\r\na global collaboration of thousands of physicists and engineers, will commence operation in 2007 with a\r\nscientific program that will continue for many years.\r\n     U.S. physicists, who constitute approximately 30% of collaborating CMS physicists from 38 countries,\r\nare mostly based at U.S. universities. This fact underlies the basis of our proposal, namely that in order to\r\nexploit fully the ambitious and rich scientific program at the LHC, researchers at U.S. universities,\r\nincluding graduate students excited by the prospects of major discoveries, must have the resources\r\nrequired for full participation in all phases of the scientific program during the LHC operational period.\r\n     This enabling effort provides for crucial university infrastructure beyond that available from each\r\nagency's core high energy physics programs, while building on the proven successes of the U.S. CMS\r\nConstruction Project. There are two main categories, Detector Maintenance and Operations (M&O) and\r\nSoftware and Computing (S&C). Also included in M&O are detector upgrade research and development\r\n(R&D), and education and outreach (E&O), both critical parts of the long-term exploitation of the CMS\r\ndetector.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impact of the LHC research includes advances in technology in several areas, support for\r\nuniversity scientific infrastructure, and the opportunity to attract students and the general public to\r\nexciting frontier science. Numerous outreach and education possibilities exist that are already being\r\nimplemented in programs such as QuarkNet. Extensive computer networks are being built as\r\ncollaborative tools for the LHC, and they can also be used to share the excitement of discovery with noncollaborators.  The CMS detector contains a variety of subsystems with numerous technological\r\nchallenges in areas such as radiation hardness of materials and circuits, precision measurement of ionizing\r\nradiation, precision alignment, large high-density crystal growing, high-density inter-connecting of\r\nelectrical signals, large high-magnetic field volumes, and many aspects of computing and data transfer.\r\nCMS institutions, often working with industry, have made or implemented innovations in these areas and\r\nR&D continues as part of this program. As a result of the international nature of LHC research, many of\r\nthese advances are developed and shared with collaborators from other countries to mutual benefit,\r\nincluding less developed countries in Latin America and elsewhere.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Project Outcome Report for the U.S. CMS Cooperative Agreement Award January 1, 2007 &ndash; December 31, 2011\n\n The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is one of two large general-purpose detectors currently operating at CERN\u00c6s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) outside Geneva, Switzerland.   CMS was constructed over several years by an international team comprising several thousand scientists, engineers, and technicians, roughly one third of whom come from U.S. institutions.    During the five-year period of support, the construction of CMS was completed and the CMS detector was installed in a cavern some 90 m (300 ft) underground. The detector was successfully commissioned and used to measure events from proton-proton collisions produced by the LHC during calendar years 2009, 2010, and 2011.     \n\n U.S. contributions to the operation of CMS are jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.  Funds from this award were used to pay the salaries and/or travel costs of individuals who were responsible for the technical work needed to bring CMS into operation and to keep it functioning smoothly.  Award funds were also used to purchase computer equipment needed to analyze the large data samples produced by CMS, and to support the operations at seven special-purpose computer centers at U.S. universities where CMS data analysis was performed.   (Support of people performing the physics analyses used to extract scientific results from the data were funded through other awards.)  \n\n Performance of the CMS detector met or exceeded essentially all of its design goals and CMS has proven to be a superb scientific instrument.    The CMS collaboration used data from the detector to rapidly make measurements on a diverse set of particle phenomena known to exist from previous experiments, and went on to conduct searches for new phenomena.      Two of the most important search topics were the Higgs boson and Supersymmetry.  \n\n The Higgs boson is a massive new particle predicted by the so-called \"Standard Model\" of particle physics in an attempt to explain the origin of mass.    Prior to this work, it was the only major element of the Standard Model that had not been experimentally observed.    At the conclusion of the 2011 LHC campaign, data from CMS provided hints of a Higgs signal at a mass of about 125 GeV/c2 (about 130 times more massive than the proton).    Although the statistical significance of this putative signal was insufficient to claim a discovery, the CMS result and a similar result from ATLAS, the other large LHC experiment, fueled widespread speculation that a major discovery was just around the corner.     CMS and the LHC resumed operation in 2012 and were able to double the data sample, which was sufficient to establish that a discovery of a Higgs-like particle had indeed been made.   Data taking and analysis efforts are continuing with the goal of ascertaining whether this newly discovered particle conforms to the expectations for the Standard Model Higgs or is a closely related variant.    Either way, this new discovery represents a crowning achievement in humankind\u00c6s understanding of the subatomic world.     \n\nSupersymmetric (or \"SUSY\") models resolve some subtle but important conceptual problems in the underlying theory in a natural and elegant way.    In doing so, they introduce a new particle, called a \"superpartner,\" for each of the currently known particles.  In most variants of SUSY, at least one of these superpartners must be stable and is thought to be the leading candidate for the \"dark matter\" that cosmological measurements indicate makes up most of the mass of the universe.  Thus far, none of these superpartners has been observed, but the theory is sufficiently compelling that searching for SUSY particles is an extremely active area of research.    Since the LHC offers the highest available collision energies, it is seen as the most fertile hunting ground for SUSY.   The excellent performance o..."
