 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Differential Equations in Classical and Quantum Physics\" is an interdisciplinary program betweeen the departments of Physics and Math at the University of Central Florida which has a strong focus on various theoretical, computational, and experimental aspects of differential equations. Classical, as well Quantum Mechanical applications applications in the domain of physics and engineering will be studied. There are a variety of specific, well-formulated projects available for well-trained and motivated undergraduate students at all levels, many of which are likely to lead to publications in research journals. Students early in their careers and minorities are stongly encouranged to apply.\r\n\r\nThe REU site currently involves four Physics faculty, four Mathematics faculty, and 12 participants (undergraduate students). The program has a duration of 10 weeks and it is enriched by a wide array of cultural, social, and educational activities.  In particular, visits to the NASA Kennedy Space Center at Cape Caneveral and the nationally known CREOL optics facilities at UCF are planned as part of the activities. Cultural visits will include the nationally known Salvador Dali Museum in St.Petersburg, the Charles Hosmer Museum of Louis Tiffany's Art Glass in Winter Park, and the nation's oldest city St. Augustine.\r\n\r\nUCF (www.ucf.edu) is one of the two fastest growing institutions of higher education in the USA. The Orlando Metropolitan Region is also one of the fastest developing cities in the nation, having also been named one of the most diverse in many recent surveys.\r\n\r\nFor further information about the REU program, please contact Dr Costas Efthimiou, Department of Physics, University of Central Florida, FL 32816, telephone number (407) 823-0179, fax (407) 823-5112, email costas@physics.ucf.edu.
