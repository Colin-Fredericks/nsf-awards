 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research and education project is developing protocols and algorithms required to build high-confidence networks of embedded sensors, actuators, and controllers. At essentially every layer of the protocol stack, the protocols needed for such systems are fundamentally different than those needed for bulk data transfer or even for other ?real-time? applications such as voice-over-IP or live video streaming. In view of this, fundamental research is needed to solve multiple open problems in the area of networked embedded systems. Ad-hoc solutions without a strong theoretical underpinning will fail to find appropriate solutions to these problems.  This research is expected to make significant contributions to the area of networked embedded systems. In particular, the research focuses on the following fundamental areas: (1) formal methods to model the dynamics of networks of embedded systems; (2) formal tools for the analysis and design of impulsive systems; and (3) high-confidence algorithms and protocols for the interconnection of sensing, actuation, and control nodes.   The project has a strong theoretical component, but also is driven by two application areas.  These are: networked embedded systems arising in automotive applications, and networks of autonomous vehicles.  The activities also enable a strong educational component aimed at motivating undergraduate students to pursue advanced degrees in the engineering sciences through the introduction of research content into undergraduate courses and through a summer internships program.\r\n\r\n",
