 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase II of the Biotechnology Education and Training Sequence Investment (BETSI) project is preparing high school students in southern San Diego County for postsecondary education and careers in biotechnology. The project is continuing high-impact phase I education and teacher professional development activities, focusing recruiting efforts on students who have responded positively to classroom outreach, and improving parental awareness of biotech educational opportunities. Project outcomes include (1) increased community awareness of and interest in biotechnology education, (2) continued implementation of a high school outreach program, (3) expanded career options and educational opportunities for community college students, and (4) enhanced economic development for students and the biotechnology industry. The project is solidifying the college's collaboration with the Sweetwater Union High School District, strengthening the pipeline with four-year colleges and industry, and supporting a biotechnology education and training cascade that involves high schools, a community college, universities, and industry.",
