The program will engage 10 undergraduates each year for three years in a 10-week summer research experience.  This REU site will leverage a focus area represented by the newly established University of Maine Forest Bio-products Research Institute (FBRI). Undergraduate students will conduct research advancing their knowledge of sustainable forest bio-products and will gain a detailed understanding of one of the thematic elements of the research effort as well as a broad understanding of all areas, specifically: 1) sustainable and life cycle analysis; 2) solids extraction/modification; 3) process control and sensing; 4) nanocellulose production and utilization; and 5) new project development.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the hands-on research experience, undergraduate students will participate in a seminar series, field trips to gain practical knowledge of various aspects of sustainable forest bio-products, and a series of evening and weekend recreational activities.\r\n\r\nParticipants will develop and utilize new knowledge to address sustainable energy issues impacting society.  The REU site program will specifically target recruitment efforts towards women, minorities and students from undergraduate only institutions.  Results of the research will be disseminated via campus presentations, and more broadly through journal articles and symposia.  \r\n",
