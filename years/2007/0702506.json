The proposed work offers a systematic method to perform behavioral transformation of the initial description of designs specified at the algorithmic level using standard programming languages, such as C or C++. Optimization of design specification at the functional or behavioral level, rather than on the register-transfer or gate level, has been shown to have the greatest impact on the quality of synthesized hardware.\r\n\r\nThe proposed method is based on a novel canonical representation of the computation, called Taylor Expansion Diagram (TED). As a canonical functional representation, TED represents a class of structural representations, from which one optimized for a particular design objective can be selected. TED will serve as a vehicle to transform initial, \"un-timed\" algorithmic design specification into a data flow description that will produce architecture optimized for a particular design cost, such as area, latency, power, or performance. The modified data flow graph can be synthesized by a standard high-level synthesis tool to produce an RTL net-list. \r\n\r\nAn important aspect of this work is that it performs synthesis in a verification-aware fashion. This is accomplished by favoring those behavioral transformations that are ``verification-friendly'' and by maintaining a record of behavioral transformation history to be used by a formal verification engine. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will culminate in the development of a CAD system for fast architectural exploration for signal processing and algorithm-oriented designs. The prototype system will be distributed on the world-wide web. \r\n",
