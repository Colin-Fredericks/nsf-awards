 "awd_abstract_narration": "Li\r\n0703532\r\n\r\n     This CSUMS project links faculty from the departments of\r\nmathematics, computer science, and applied science at William and\r\nMary to create a computational mathematics component in the\r\nundergraduate program.  Project personnel modify freshman and\r\nsophomore courses to place greater emphasis on computational\r\nissues, thereby preparing undergraduates for special upper\r\ndivision courses and eventual participation in undergraduate\r\nresearch.  Students do research projects on theoretical and\r\npractical problems from numerical linear algebra, quantum\r\ncomputing, optimization, dynamical systems, and mathematical\r\nbiology.  Typically, students in the program start doing research\r\nin their junior year and the following summer, and continue their\r\nwork during their senior year through carefully supervised honors\r\ntheses.  In addition, academic year activities include special\r\ncomputational mathematics seminars and visitors, plus an annual\r\nworkshop in which students present their discoveries.  Important\r\nscientific findings are submitted for publication in professional\r\njournals and presented at scholarly conferences.  In addition,\r\nstudents discuss their results and experiences in local high\r\nschools, in the Virginia Governor's School for Science and\r\nMathematics, and in regional two-year colleges.  Such outreach\r\npresentations should attract a larger and more diverse population\r\nof younger students into further study of computational\r\nmathematics, and give research students in the program additional\r\npractice in communicating mathematics to others.  To broaden the\r\nperspective of the students in the program, and to encourage the\r\ninterchange of ideas, there are visits to other institutions and\r\nresearch agencies in the U.S.  and abroad.  A website is set up\r\nto facilitate communication with other research groups and\r\ncomputational mathematics programs. \r\n\r\n     At the base of modern computer and information technology is\r\nan interdisciplinary field called computational mathematics. \r\nThis project unites the skills and knowledge of faculty from the\r\ndepartments of mathematics, computer science, and applied science\r\nto create a new computational component within the undergraduate\r\ncurriculum.  It prepares students to participate in undergraduate\r\nresearch projects in the theoretical and practical aspects of\r\ncomputation, and it builds linkages between the computational\r\nmathematics programs at William and Mary and similar programs\r\nnationally and abroad.  Successful experiences in this program\r\nattract students to further study in computational mathematics\r\nand to careers in the field.  The diverse research backgrounds of\r\nthe program's faculty interact to break down the intellectual\r\ncompartmentalization that stands in the way of progress for both\r\nour students and our faculty.  The new ideas developed in the\r\nprogram are disseminated through conference talks and scholarly\r\npublication by our students and their faculty mentors.  Through\r\noutreach to high school and community college programs, they\r\nattract a larger and more diverse group of pre-college students\r\ninto computational mathematics programs here and elsewhere.  The\r\nproject is supported by the MPS Division of Mathematical\r\nSciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the\r\nEHR Division of Undergraduate Education.",
