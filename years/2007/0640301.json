 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular systematics and biogeography of South American pronophiline butterflies (Lepidoptera:  Nymphalidae:  Satyrinae), submitted by Andrew V. Z. Brower\r\n\r\n\tBrower proposes to study the phylogenetic relationships of a poorly-known group of satyrine butterflies that live mainly in the Andean cloud forests of South America.  The research will build a phylogenetic framework for relationships among Satyrinae, and more detailed study of Pronophilina, based on molecular data, as well as a state-of-the-art monograph and phylogenetic analysis, web-based keys, catalogs and identification guides for south-temperate genera.  The study addresses fundamental questions of the history and biogeography of life in the southern continents.\r\n\tTogether with the global community of butterfly systematists, Dr. Brower's research is developing a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis for a major group of organisms that compose a valued portion of the world's biota.  Achieving an enhanced understanding of patterns of butterfly diversity is intrinsically worthwhile to a large audience of scientists and non-scientists, as model organisms in a broad range of research and as sources of inspiration that engage the public's appreciation of science and nature.  Improving our understanding of biogeographical patterns in Andean South America will provide tools for prioritizing areas that may be in greatest need of conservation.  This project also shares expertise and technology with collaborators in developing countries, and, via the web, with the entire world.  \r\n",
