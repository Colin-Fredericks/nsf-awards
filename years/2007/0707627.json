 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Bailyn and collaborators will carry out an observational program of two remarkable classes of celestial objects. The first are the Soft X-ray Transients - these systems consist of a black hole or neutron star accreting matter from a Sun-like companion star. The accretion is episodic, with short intense outbursts of X-rays alternating with long stretches of quiescent behavior. By combining observations of quiescence and of the outbursts, Dr. Bailyn will create a detailed model of these important sources and the exotic physical effects that take place in them. The second class of objects to be studied is the afterglows from Gamma-Ray Bursts. These violent explosions can be seen across much of the Universe and our understanding of them is still evolving in basic ways.\r\n\r\nBoth of these kinds of objects emit the bulk of their energy in the form of high energy photons - X-rays and Gamma-rays. However, crucial components of the systems also emit optical and infrared radiation. By studying this radiation alongside the high energy emissions, a much more complete understanding of these systems can be obtained.\r\n\r\nThis project is one of the key programs in the Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS), and Dr. Bailyn is the SMARTS Principal Scientist. SMARTS provides well-instrumented one-meter-class telescopes in the southern hemisphere that are available to all US astronomers through proposals to the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. Over 100 different projects were carried out at SMARTS during 2006. While this project does not include funding for SMARTS as such, some of the personnel supported through this award, including Dr. Bailyn, will also support SMARTS more generally. \r\n\r\nThese projects are expected to form the ideal basis for undergraduate research projects, and this program will provide many opportunities for students to carry out front-line research, and to travel to observe at research telescopes. Dr. Bailyn will also continue ongoing efforts to present this research to the public, and to incorporate it in his undergraduate classes.\r\n",
