 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arrow' is a new initiative in forefront research of theoretical physics that will provide a forum for leading scientists in the field to discuss, debate, and stimulate progress on the fundamental question of time's arrow.  Lectures and discussions are planned that touch on subjects such the initial conditions of the universe, inflationary models, alternative cosmologies, cosmological tunneling, the role of gravity, CP-violation, the nature of measurement and decoherence in quantum mechanics - all with a focus on their potential relevance for time's arrow.  The meeting will also provide a forum for scientists and philosophers to discuss and compare their perspectives on this issue, expose young scientists to cutting edge research on foundational issues, and expose the general public to some basic yet unresolved issues.  The workshop is supported by the Division of Physics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.",
