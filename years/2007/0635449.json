Berger\r\n\r\nSAMSI is a national institute that will deeply impact the future\r\nof the statistical and mathematical sciences and, through them,\r\nscience in general, by catalyzing creation of the theory and\r\nmethodology necessary to confront the central data- and\r\nmodel-driven scientific challenges of our time. SAMSI will focus\r\non new syntheses of the statistical sciences, applied mathematics\r\nand disciplinary science. To illustrate the vision, consider an\r\nactivity central to modern science and technology, and with which\r\nSAMSI will be heavily engaged: numerical modeling of complex\r\nphysical processes. Developing numerical models and evaluating\r\ntheir fidelity to reality requires merging knowledge from\r\nmultiple disciplines. Applied mathematics builds on disciplinary\r\nunderstanding to construct a fine-detail numerical representation\r\nof the deterministic aspects of a process; probability provides\r\nconcepts and insight to characterize stochastic elements of the\r\nprocess; and statistics provides the mechanisms to relate these\r\nconstructs to observational data on the real-world process. But,\r\ndespite a multiplicity of context-specific advances, there is\r\ncurrently no general framework for combining these disciplines,\r\nmuch less a formal system for simultaneously applying them. The\r\nSAMSI efforts in this direction will focus on filling this gap,\r\nby bringing together statisticians, mathematicians and modelers\r\nfrom across the country (and beyond) to establish frameworks for\r\nmodel development and validation, at a high level that spans\r\nmultiple application contexts.\r\n\r\nTo carry out this synthesis of the statistical sciences, applied\r\nmathematical sciences and disciplinary sciences, SAMSI engages\r\nestablished researchers - from academia, industry, national\r\nlaboratories and government - as well as young researchers\r\n(postdoctoral fellows and graduate students) at the formative\r\nstages of their careers. Each research program lasts from 6\r\nmonths to one year, and involves a host of activities ranging\r\nfrom research by intensive interdisciplinary working groups to\r\nbroad, energizing workshops. Outreach to undergraduate students,\r\nhigh-school teachers and faculty from teaching institutions\r\nextends SAMSI's impact on the essential development of the\r\nnational human resource base for science. To enable activities of\r\nthe breadth and depth necessary for the success of SAMSI, the\r\ninstitute is a partnership between the National Science\r\nFoundation and the consortium of Duke University, North Carolina\r\nState University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\r\nand the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. These\r\npartners provide a uniquely strong base for SAMSI's national\r\nscope. Scientific input to SAMSI comes, in part, from a National\r\nAdvisory Council composed of eminent statistical and mathematical\r\nscientists. Most important, SAMSI will engage the entire\r\nnationwide statistical and mathematical sciences communities, by\r\nmeans of widely publicized opportunities to bring problems to\r\nSAMSI, or direct SAMSI's attention to them.\r\n\r\n",

SAMSI Research Programs include workshops, working groups to pursue research on a particular topic, and visitors.

Most programs also develop interdisciplinary research with collaborators from a variety of fields.</p>\n<p>As an example of how these objectives are achieved, we highlight the 2011-12 program on Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). This was SAMSI&rsquo;s largest program ever and consisted of four components: Methodology, Climate Modeling, Engineering and Renewable Energy, and Geosciences. The impacts of the program included contributions to a new journal started in 2013 (Jim Berger, the first Director of SAMSI, was one of the founding co-editors) as well as a series of UQ conferences and new activity or interest groups in SIAM or ASA.</p>\n<p>As an example of the research coming out of this program, a major goal of UQ is to understand the sensitivity of mathematical models that describe complex physical processes to changes in input parameters. This can be phrased as an inverse problem, to find the range of input parameters consistent with the uncertain output of a model. Program leader Don Estep and coauthors undertook a systematic study of this problem in a triad of papers. They describe the uncertainties in terms of probabilities, and use a measure-theoretic approach to design numerical methods for computing these probabilities. The third paper, published in the SIAM/ASA Journal on UQ, demonstrates the effectiveness of the measure-theoretic approach in an application with simulated noisy data from Hurricane Katrina. Estimating the amount of flooding in the wake of a hurricane and identifying safe passages for naval transportation requires knowledge of the ocean floor, specifically its depth and topography (bathymetry). A mathematical model was used to infer this information from noisy observations of the maximum storm surge. The success of the method was demonstrated through numerical experiments.</p>\n<p>Another example of a SAMSI program that successfully brought together different disciplines is the program on Space-time Analysis for Environmental Mapping, Epidemiology and Climate Change (2009-10). IN a series of three papers, SAMSI postdoc Veronica Berrocal, with co-authors Alan Gelfand from Duke and David Holland from the Environmental Protection Agency, developed a Bayesian space-time downscaling fusion model approach to calculate predictive surfaces for air quality. Their method was incorporated into a model used by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Fused Air Quality Surface Using Downscaling (FAQSD) model, as part of its mandate to provide regularly updated reports on the nation&rsquo;s air quality.</p>\n<p>Table 1 gives a summary (based on program organizers&rsquo; reports) of papers, grant applications and software in all full-year programs during the project period; overall, some 286 papers, 15 grants and 11 software packages were directly attributed to SAMSI. Table 2 summarizes personnel who were long- or medium-term participants; they included senior and junior faculty visitors, faculty and graduate student fellows from the three sponsoring universities, visiting graduate students, and postdocs.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts</p>\n<p>SAMSI programs play an educational and career development role at multiple levels. Table 3 shows the current employment status of all postdocs who entered SAMSI during the project period; 70% of them are currently in academic positions.</p>\n<p>SAMSI organizes three workshops per year aimed at undergraduate students: a 2-day workshop each fall and spring and a week-long undergraduate modeling workshop in early summer. For graduate students, SAMSI organizes the Industrial Mathematical and Statistical Modeling workshop, a 10-day workshop each summer where students work on projects suggested by industry or government researchers. Reviews from participants in these workshops have repeatedly affirmed their value in introducing students to research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;SAMSI has shown a consistent track record in working to support diversity and encourage the involvement of underrepresented groups in its activities.

Table 2 summarizes personnel who were long- or medium-term participants; they included senior and junior faculty visitors, faculty and graduate student fellows from the three sponsoring universities, visiting graduate students, and postdocs.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nSAMSI programs play an educational and career development role at multiple levels. Table 3 shows the current employment status of all postdocs who entered SAMSI during the project period; 70% of them are currently in academic positions.\n\nSAMSI organizes three workshops per year aimed at undergraduate students: a 2-day workshop each fall and spring and a week-long undergraduate modeling workshop in early summer. For graduate students, SAMSI organizes the Industrial Mathematical and Statistical Modeling workshop, a 10-day workshop each summer where students work on projects suggested by industry or government researchers. Reviews from participants in these workshops have repeatedly affirmed their value in introducing students to research.\n\n SAMSI has shown a consistent track record in working to support diversity and encourage the involvement of underrepresented groups in its activities. Figure 1 shows how the percentages of women and ethnic minorities have varied over the years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard L Smith"
