The specific topic, nano devices and systems for energy applications and their associated environmental impacts, has not been addressed in previous workshops in this series.  The discussions will also include educational, and societal implications.  This forum will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, on April 26-27, 2007.  The PI is Professor of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.  His counterpart is the chair of the Korean organizing committee, Dr. Jo-Won Lee, director of Korea's National Program for Tera-level Nanodevices.  \r\nOf the twenty participants from each country who will attend, it is expected that 8 will be at an early stage in their careers. Presenters will be selected from government, industry, and academic backgrounds, to represent a broad spectrum of expertise.  Dr. Gang Chen of MIT has agreed to participate in the workshop and to assist in selecting U.S. presenters.  Special emphasis will be given to including underrepresented groups among the participants.  The Forum proceedings and findings will be published on CD and on Carnegie Mellon's Website and on Webpages maintained by the Korean counterparts.\r\n",
