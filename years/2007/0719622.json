Professor Jha of Clarkson University will make a two week visit to India to finalize collaborative research with investigators at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD) and the Indian Institute of Sciences (IISc), Bangalore.  The concept of smart structures constitutes a fundamental shift in design paradigms and has been identified as one of the six key future technologies in the U.S.\r\nJha will meet with S.P. Singh, IITD and S. Gopalakrishnan, IISc. to discuss the details of the research projects, formulate plans for proposal submission to NSF and to the Department of Science & Technology (DST) in India, assess laboratory facilities, and discuss arrangements for student exchanges. \r\n\r\nThe collaborations will leverage complementary expertise available at the three institutions and has high potential for synergistic research that will lead to innovation. \r\nExposure of Clarkson undergraduates and graduates associated with its Smart Structures Laboratory to innovative multidisciplinary research and to international collaboration    will enhance learning through Clarkson's experimental project-based programs.     \r\n",
