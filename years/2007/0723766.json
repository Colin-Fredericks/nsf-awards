 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carnegie Mellon University is adding three new cohorts to its existing SFS program. SFS scholarships are awarded to students in either of two masters degree programs; the MS in Information Security Technology and Management, and the MS in Information Security Policy and Management. Both curricula have been certified pursuant to the Information Assurance Courseware Evaluation Process of the National Security Agency's National Infosec Training and Education Program, and have been mapped against NSTISSI No. 4011 - National Training Standard for Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) Professionals and 4014 - Information Assurance Training Standard for Information Systems Security Officers. \r\n\r\nCarnegie Mellon University has been an active and enthusiastic participant in the SFS program since the program's inception. To date, sixty-two highly qualified students have graduated from the program and have been placed into federal information assurance positions. Of the twenty four graduates who have satisfied their two year service commitment, CMU has been able to determine the current status of nineteen of them. Of these nineteen, seventeen are still serving in federal positions. As the SFS program continues to study its impact, these data suggest that CMU students are committed to public service careers. \r\n\r\n",
