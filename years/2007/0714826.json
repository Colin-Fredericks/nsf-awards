 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fayetteville State University (FSU) is a public institution of higher learning and serves the community in the Southern region of North Carolina. FSU is an HBCU with 73.4% African American, 3.7% Hispanic minorities and 69% female enrollment.  FSU is the only institution in the 16-member University of North Carolina (UNC) System to offer Baccalaureate in Forensic Science; with concentrations in Forensic Biology or Forensic Chemistry.  This project will support the acquisition of forensic laboratory equipment which will be used in several biology and forensic courses as well as support continuing education programs for practicing forensic scientists.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The Target Infusion Project will enhance the instructional and research capabilities and potential of FSU faculty increasing the likelihood of acquiring other grants. The project will improve the forensic curriculum at FSU in anticipation for accreditation.  Graduating student will be better prepared for the workforce.  In addition, students in Biology and Chemistry will have enhanced educational experiences.  The project will also strengthen partnerships between the FSU, high schools, surrounding community colleges, and law enforcement agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will increase the number of underrepresented minorities engaged in forensic science instruction and research in STEM programs by increasing enrollment. The demand for trained forensic scientists nationwide is increasing as a result of the great backlog of criminal cases and the dependence of criminal cases on forensic analyses. Training on these state-of-the-art instruments will enhance student's chances of acquiring job and reduce on the job training time. Acquiring these equipments will also help the FSU to get accreditation of the program in near future as well. Successful implementation of the program activities holds potential for strengthening the social, economic, and intellectual fabric of the Southeastern region of North Carolina. In addition, the anticipated enrollment growth associated with the forensic science program, the demand for courses in chemistry, biology and criminal justice will also increase. As a result the departments of Natural Sciences and Criminal Justice would also experience growth.  \r\n",
