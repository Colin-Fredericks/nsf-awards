 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most parasites are harmful to their hosts and select for increased host resistance, yet the degree of genetic specificity for infection remains controversial. While current models focus on parasites with direct transmission, many important and devastating diseases, such as malaria and schistosomiasis, require multiple host species. This dissertation research explores the effects of host population composition and dispersal on the diversity and population structure of a trematode parasite. This work considers infection by multiple parasite strains as a mechanism for increased parasite diversity. Together, this body of research examines the genotypic specificity of infection and the maintenance of both host and parasite diversity.  \r\n\r\nThis dissertation work has important implications for controlling the spread of disease through the limitation of host dispersal. In addition, the research includes mentoring of undergraduate students through both support for experiments and through the undertaking of independent projects on the system using the molecular methods developed. The multidisciplinary nature of the work allows students to apply molecular techniques to population-level phenomenon and to examine the population-genetic interaction between multiple species. Therefore, the work appeals to students from a variety of backgrounds and with a diversity of interests.\r\n",
