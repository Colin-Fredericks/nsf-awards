 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deterioration of large infrastructure systems is a common, yet complex problem that requires innovative sensor technologies to address.  This collaborative proposal is focused upon the integration of five emerging sensor technologies that when fused into a structural health monitoring (SHM) system, have the potential to accurately identify structural distress.  At the local-scale, piezoelectric paint is proposed for passive acoustic emission sensing of fracture.  In addition, piezoelectric ceramic elements will be explored for active ultrasonic inspection of steel elements prone to cracking.  Elasto-magentic (EM) sensors are proposed to monitor dynamic stress in steel cables.  At the global-scale, \"smart\" wireless sensor networks will be adopted to monitor global system responses.  Finally, a vision-based system using video cameras will measure structural displacements.  To fundamentally address the challenging issues of formulation of a comprehensive SHM system, an international collaboration is formed with a leading team of SHM researchers from Korea, led by Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology.   The international collaboration facilitates unfettered access to Korean highway bridges in which loading and structural conditions can be monitored and controlled.  Education is an integral element of the proposed collaboration; US students will be trained in international research via student and educator exchanges between the US and Korea.  Finally, a diverse group of students at all levels will be engaged including underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students as well as regional underprivileged K-12 students.",
