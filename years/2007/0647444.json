 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Gregory V. Hartland of the University of Notre Dame and his graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will study the dynamics and physical properties of single metal nanoparticles.  Individual nanoparticles will be characterized with TEM, and subsequently analyzed with transient absorption measurements.  Experimental results will be compared with the results of model continuum mechanics simulations.  A wide variety of nanoparticles will be studied including cubic Ag particles, Au-Ag nanoboxes, nanorods, nanobarcodes and nanowires.  The goal of these studies is to learn more about how particle size, structure and morphology influence material properties. \r\n\r\nNanoparticles are increasingly being used in many applications, yet much remains unknown.  These studies hope to shed light on how physical properties like the rate of relaxation following excitation and the rate of interfacial heat conduction depend upon the size and shape of the particle.  These types of information are relevant if metal nanoparticles find use in photothermal therapy, and should also be broadly applicable to a development of a better understanding of heat transfer in nanofluids.  Besides the broader technological impact of this research, Prof. Hartland's students will receive cutting edge interdisciplinary training in materials science, physics and chemistry.  Prof. Hartland has plans for developing the results of his research work into curricular materials for the Freshman chemistry course that he teaches.\r\n",
