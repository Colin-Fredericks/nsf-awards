 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates embedded technologies for continuous monitoring and logging of vital medical signs and physiological parameters using a wireless body sensor network (BSN). BSNs consisting of a hybrid of implantable, ingestible and wearable sensors have emerged as a new paradigm of digital healthcare for disease alert and real-time monitoring of hospitalized as well as non-hospitalized, chronically-ill or aged patients. This project investigates embedded technologies to deal with unique challenges of a BSN including: extremely stringent energy constraints imposed by in vivo sensors, very limited on-sensor computing capability, and uniquely complex radio propagation body environments.  The goal of this research project is to design, optimize and test embedded system communications techniques for wireless BSNs, in order to achieve unprecedented energy efficiency, reliability and cost structure. The proposed research directions and innovative claims include: the design of practical radios for around-body networks and the development of adaptive media access control which is flexible to deal with and capitalize on heterogeneous sensor environments with extremely asymmetric traffic patterns and energy constraints. This project has substantial broader impact. With the technological advances in sensor networks and system-on-chip design, BSNs can be expected to prevail in medical healthcare, but also permeate healthy lifestyles to improve the quality of life in the future. Leveraging the high-profile subjects on communication, networking and embedded systems enjoyed among students, the multi-disciplinary body sensor network research promotes the integration of research with education and outreach activities at both graduate and undergraduate levels.",
