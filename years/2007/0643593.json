The main idea behind the technique \r\nis to compute a small subset of the input, called the Core-Set, that `approximates' the \r\ninput and allows the optimization problem to be solved on this concise representation. \r\nCore-sets are exciting because of their prospect in the development of powerful, practical \r\nand general methods that are applicable to a large class of problems from various \r\napplications including automotive and aircraft industries, space exploration, civil \r\nsurveyors, the movie, computer gaming and medical industries, and developers of security \r\nand geographic information systems.\r\n\r\nThis NSF Career proposal focuses on the design and implementation of efficient methods \r\nfor geometric optimization problems and their applications to real-world problems using \r\nthe paradigm of core-sets.  As part of this proposal, application of  core-sets to \r\nproblems like curve and surface reconstruction from massive unorganized point clouds \r\nwill also be explored. A key characteristic of the proposal is that it will help advance \r\nthe knowledge across disciplines like computational geometry, convex optimization and \r\nmachine learning. The use of core-sets will result in the design of algorithms that will \r\nbe easier to code and will be faster and more robust. Furthermore, the PI plans to continue \r\nincorporating his research results in: (1) course development, (2) mentoring of graduate \r\nand undergraduate students by maintaining a careful balance between theory, applications, \r\nalgorithms and computational projects, (3) development and maintenance of software \r\nsolutions related to core-sets and their applications.\r\n",
