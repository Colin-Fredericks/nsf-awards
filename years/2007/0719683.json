 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every year, there is a large influx of immigrants to the United States who do not understand or speak English. While learning a new language is not too difficult for children and adolescents, it is a much harder feat for adults. This is in part because adult speakers may not perceive meaningful sound distinctions in English if these distinctions are not part of their native language. For example, there are two different English vowels in ''bit'' and ''bead'', but Spanish does not distinguish between these vowel sounds.  It therefore can be very difficult for native Spanish speakers to learn to hear the difference between words like ''bit'' and ''bead''. Likewise, American English speakers may not perceive the difference between the Hindi ''d'' and the American English ''d''. Perceiving such sound distinctions is essential to learning new languages, and difficulties in making these distinctions can greatly hinder language learning.\r\n\r\nWith support of the National Science Foundation, Drs. Tuller and Jirsa are investigating how adults learn to perceive sound distinctions in non-native languages.  They are training adult monolingual speakers of American English to perceive the difference between Spanish trilled ''r'' and tapped ''r'', a distinction that does not occur in English. Some people appear to learn new languages more rapidly and robustly than others, and previous work suggests that the perceptual ability is a factor in determining whether or not learning will occur, and how it will occur during language training. The investigators are proposing a dynamic systems theory that predicts two basic kinds of language learners with respect to speech sounds:  Listeners either learn new speech sounds or they learn to make fine acoustic distinctions that are not language-based.  Experiments are being conducted to test and explore this theory, and the results may have broad implications for understanding the nature of learning itself as well as the more specific question of second language learning. Knowledge gained from this research may also help to improve second language education practices and technologies, and remediation strategies for speech disorders.",
