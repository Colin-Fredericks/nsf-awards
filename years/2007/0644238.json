 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide range of resource-constrained wireless networks including wireless sensor networks have shown considerable promise in bringing many envisioned applications and services to reality, such as healthcare, search and rescue operations, watch-my-child/aging-parent, power grid control and operations, battlefield surveillance, etc. However, due to the nature of their resource-constrained design and ways of being deployed and used, they are vulnerable to attacks. The failure of these applications may cause catastrophic damage or unwanted impacts that affect public safety, personal privacy, homeland security, the economy and society. The objective of this project is to develop methodologies for providing practical solutions in support of secure and resilient data-centric applications and services for resource-constrained wireless networks.  The project will focus on addressing fundamental security and resilience problems and challenging issues due to the resource-constrained device design and the complicated situations brought by the use of network coding techniques. The proposed research will provide efficient, provably secure, and resilient solutions for filtering false data reports, localization verification, and dynamic sensor revoking and re-tasking. This project has immediate and significant impacts. The developed solutions can serve as an important foundation to effectively provide secure and resilient support for data-centric applications and services. Integrated educational activities are another important part of this proposal and will expose a large number of students at various levels and the general public to this new knowledge. Accordingly, this project benefits society in a variety of meaningful ways.",
