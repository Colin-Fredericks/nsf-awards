 "awd_abstract_narration": "Norfolk State University, an HBCU that serves approximately 6,200 students including 765 enrolled in STEM disciplines, will focus this project on the development STEM majors in their junior and senior years.  This project builds on a successful first HBCU-UP five year project, which targeted students at the beginning of their undergraduate careers.  Many of the activities of the initial HBCU-UP project were institutionalized, thus allowing for growth of the program. \r\n\r\nThe major activities of this STARS-Plus (Science and Technology Academicians on the Road to Success-Plus) project include: (i) partnerships with local high schools; a local community college and a local corporation; (ii) a summer bridge program, which will target community college students as well as incoming freshman students; (iii) a residential learning community for STEM students; (iv) a mentoring center; (v) tutoring program; (vi) curriculum development; (vii) graduate school preparation, including a formal credit course; (viii) research opportunities and scholarships for undergraduates and (ix) faculty development activities.\r\n\r\nExtensive and multifaceted, this project has the full support of the institution, and expects to learn from the activities through thorough evaluation and data driven decision making.  These activities will serve as a model to the rest of the institution for ways to achieve the goals of:  increasing the number of students in STEM disciplines; advance the climate of learning and scholarship; and increase the STEM graduation rate.\r\n",
