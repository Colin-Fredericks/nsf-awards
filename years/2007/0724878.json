 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop, validate, and demonstrate a new technology for a low-temperature synthesis of vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) and nanofibers (VACNFs). The low-temperature manufacturing process is critical to decrease the cost and improve the quality of VACNTs/VACNFs-based materials and devices. This project will further advance and demonstrate the low-temperature technology by producing: a novel research-grade reactor with four special components: a RF plasma source for vertical alignment of free-standing VACNT/VACNF, a pulsed RF power source with tunable frequency in the GHz range for inductive heating of catalytic nanoparticles,.a nonconducting substrate to eliminate substrate Joule heating; and a system for active cooling of the substrate. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts anticipated from the proposed low-temperature synthesis approach will result in a novel research-grade reactor and a multiscale simulator for a direct, low-temperature synthesis of VACNTs at pre-selected locations on the surfaces of temperature-sensitive materials. This approach could lead to a new US-based high-technology manufacturing business.",
