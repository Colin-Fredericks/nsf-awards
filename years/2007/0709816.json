Proposal #IOS-0709816\r\nDISSERTATION RESEARCH - Reproductive allocation and success in a simultaneous hermaphrodite\r\n\r\nBarnacles simultaneously function as both males and females.  An individual's reproductive success is expected to depend on the ratio of investment into the male and female roles.  When competition for mates is more intense (as in large mating groups), barnacles are predicted to benefit from investing more energy in male function.  The hypothesis that investment in male function increases as mating group size increases will be tested in field experiments.  The ratio of male to female investment will be calculated directly by weighing male and female reproductive parts.  Whether differing levels of investments alter reproductive fitness will be measured by comparing functional male and female reproductive success.  Female reproductive success will be measured directly by counting fertilized eggs.  Male reproductive success will be quantified by using genetic markers to identify the eggs that were fertilized by an individual functional male.  This research will critically test several assumptions and predictions of reproductive biology, with the advantage of direct tests of male and female investment and the exact measurements of reproductive success.  The investigators have been recruiting undergraduate researchers of diverse backgrounds to work in the lab, and this project will provide further opportunities for undergraduate training.  This research will also be used as an illustrative example of the scientific process for various environmental, conservation and public education organizations with whom the investigators are affiliated.\r\n",
