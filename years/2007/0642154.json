 "awd_abstract_narration": "mRNA decay is important for regulation of gene expression. The amount of a particular mRNA present at a specific time in a cell is dependent on its rate of synthesis and decay. The nonsense mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD) is a specialized mRNA decay pathway that recognizes and rapidly degrades mRNA with premature stop codons and some wild-type mRNAs. Wild-type mRNAs degraded by NMD have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and humans. 5-10% of the S. cerevisiae transcriptome is affected when NMD is inactivated. Thus NMD has a significant impact on wild-type gene expression. Long 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) target mRNAs for NMD. Normal S. cerevisiae cellular mRNAs have 3'-UTRs ranging in size from 50-350 nucleotides, with most approximately 100 nucleotides long. mRNAs containing mutations that generate aberrant extended 3'-UTRs are degraded by NMD. A subset of wild-type transcripts from S. cerevisiae have naturally extended 3'-UTRs.  However, the impact of these extended 3'-UTRs on the decay of these mRNAs has not been examined. Preliminary data shows that some wild-type mRNAs with long 3'-UTRs are degraded by NMD while others are immune to NMD. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the targeting and recognition of wild-type mRNAs with long 3'-UTRs for NMD. The overall objective for this project is to determine the extent to which long 3'-UTRs target wild-type mRNAs for degradation by NMD. The central hypothesis, based on the faux 3'-UTR model, is that wild-type mRNAs with longer than normal 3'-UTR are targets for NMD.  Further, additional cis-acting sequences are required to protect wild-type mRNAs with long 3'-UTRs from NMD. The central hypothesis will be tested by determining the role of longer than normal 3'-UTRs in mRNA degradation by NMD and in parallel determine why one mRNA with a longer than normal 3'-UTR is immune to NMD.\r\nThis project will define the role of long 3'-UTRs in the degradation of wild-type mRNAs by NMD in S. cerevisiae. This knowledge will advance the field's understanding of the recognition and targeting of wild-type mRNAs by specialized mRNA decay pathways. The project involves a bioinformatics-based approach that will enhance the skills of the principal investigator who is African, an underrepresented minority in sciences. Furthermore the project will involve mentoring an undergraduate African American student. \r\n",
