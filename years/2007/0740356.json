A committee with expertise in the area of general chemistry, environmental health and safety, risk management, chemistry education, materials science, laboratory management, regulatory compliance, and biosafety will modify the existing content and add content as required to reflect new fields and developments that have occurred since the previous publication. The committee will have representation from four-year and two-year colleges, universities, other research institutions, medical schools, industrial firms and industrial safety consultants. \r\n\r\nThis report is relevant to any laboratory where storage or use of chemicals occurs, providing impact in physics and applied physics, materials science, biology and molecular biology, and other areas. It provides an accepted, comprehensive source of guidance that Environmental, Health and Safety professionals and community leaders can use to ascertain that laboratory facilities and the communities that surround them are safeguarded against unnecessary risk from laboratory activities involving chemicals.",
