 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) processes play a key role in solar chromospheric physics.  With prior NSF funding, the PI has developed a 1.5D MHD simulation of chromospheric dynamics, based on a model that included a complete space- and time-dependent electrical conductivity tensor, gravity, and an energy equation for magnetized multi-species plasmas of variable ionization (Kazeminezhad & Goodman, 2006). These efforts have been motivated by the concept that understanding chromospheric dynamics was critical to understanding solar atmospheric dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe PI now plans to parallelize the code and extend the existing model to the lower boundary of the solar photosphere.  He will generalize the code to 2.5D, as well as simulate the heating rates and flow acceleration due to MHD and shock waves from the photosphere to the lower corona.  He also will simulate the dynamics of horizontally localized, sub-resolution kiloGauss magnetic structures in the photospheric inter-network, estimating their contribution to heating the overlying chromosphere, and modeled the effect of photospheric magnetic flux emergence and magnetic footpoint shearing on chromospheric dynamics.  The PI's team plans to estimate the importance of the proton viscosity tensor and the effect of proton magnetization in chromospheric heating by developing a 1.5D steady-state, finite thickness shock wave model, as well as a 2.5D linear wave model.  Both models will include viscosity and electrical conductivity tensors, building upon previous work by the PI. \r\n\r\nThe PI's team will also contribute their time and research results to the West Virginia High Technology Consortium Foundation's education programs for grades 7-9 and 9-16.  These ongoing programs are separately funded by the NSF under the Comprehensive Information Technology Education in Rural Appalachia (CITERA) and Expanding Pathways for Educational Development and Information Technology Experiences (ExPEDITE) programs. \r\n",
