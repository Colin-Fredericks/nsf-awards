 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is improving the undergraduate research experience in STEM disciplines by training graduate students, postdoctoral personnel and faculty members in mentoring techniques.  This project is adapting and enhancing a mentor training program previously developed for the biological sciences for use in all STEM disciplines.  \r\n\r\nResearch experiences play a pivotal role in the decisions of undergraduate students to pursue research careers.  The success of undergraduate research experiences depends largely on a positive relationship between the student and the individual guiding the student-the mentor.  The mentor may be a faculty member, or at a large institution, a graduate student or postdoctoral researcher.  Training graduate students and postdoctoral personnel in effective mentoring techniques is producing a new generation of scientists who are entering the professoriate as skilled mentors.  The improved mentoring is leading to increased recruitment and retention of students in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThe Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning will be disseminating the developed materials.  Additionally, a web tool will be allowing others to create a mentor training seminar suited to their individual needs.",
