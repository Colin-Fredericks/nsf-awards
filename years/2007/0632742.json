The Workshop will consist of a day-long set of presentations from a delegation of Chinese academic, research laboratory, and industry experts, and will include individual presentations and panels addressing topics that include Government Plans, University Research, Applications, select programs at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and presentations by both Chinese and international vendors to get their perspectives on the status of computing in China. A key aspect of the proposed Workshop will be the unique opportunity for members of the US research community to interact and have direct discussions with top Chinese scientists who will travel to the US to participate.",
