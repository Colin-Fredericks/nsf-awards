 "awd_abstract_narration": "Processes of interaction of low-energy electrons with molecules play important role in\r\ngaseous, plasma, liquid and condensed-matter environments. Increased interest to\r\nthese processes is stimulated by recent studies of their role in the physics of the upper\r\natmosphere and in biological environments. Placing molecules in laser fields creates\r\nopportunities for control and manipulation of electron-molecule collision processes.\r\nElectron-molecule interactions in different environments present interest not only due to\r\ntheir importance in applications, but also because they demonstrate interesting physics\r\nmechanisms.\r\nThe present project proposes to study electron-molecule collision processes in gas\r\nphase, on surfaces, in condensed matter environment and in the presence of strong\r\nlaser fields.\r\nThe first part of the proposal deals with dissociative electron attachment to polyatomic\r\nmolecules with the account of interaction between two resonances or interaction\r\nbetween several vibrational modes. The role of vibrational Feshbach resonances due to\r\nweakly-bound dipole-supported states in these systems will be further investigated. The\r\nsecond class of processes which will be studied is dissociative electron attachment to\r\nphysisorbed molecules and molecules embedded in bulk medium. The theory of these\r\nprocesses taking into account the electron interaction with the environment will be\r\nfurther developed. Finally, the effects of laser field in electron-molecule interaction will\r\nbe studied. The main focus will be on the above-threshold ionization and particularly its\r\nresonant enhancement which was recently discovered in atom ionization.",
