 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports the work of Professor Brian J. Frost at the University of Nevada, Reno to study the development of new chiral phosphine ligands and environmentally friendly catalysts.  The project centers on the design and synthesis of novel water-soluble phosphine ligands and the development of catalytic reactions, such as hydrogenation and C-C coupling reactions, in aqueous and/or biphasic media.  Water is expected to become increasingly important as a solvent in future industrial processes as it is environmentally friendly, inexpensive, nontoxic, and nonflammable, and thus, presents far-reaching health and safety benefits.  This project may provide scientifically fundamental and industrially relevant advances in the field of aqueous-phase catalysis; such as the utilization of pH to modulate reactivity.  The educational aspect of this proposal focuses on improvements in K-12 science education in the Washoe County School District of Nevada.  This program will provide teacher workshops, and will send undergraduate students out into the classrooms during the academic year via the Science Partners Program.  In addition to research activities, undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students involved in this project will have the opportunity to participate in the preparation and production of a chemistry demonstration show entitled, \"It's not magic, it's SCIENCE!\" performed for K-12 students in northern Nevada.\r\n",
