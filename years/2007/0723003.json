HFMs have the potential advantage of greatly decreasing the separation between the anode and cathode in the MFC, which should greatly reduce internal resistance and increase efficiency. Low efficiency in energy conversion has been a major issue in the development of microbial fuel cells for electric power production from wastewater. The high specific surface area of HFMs also allows the use of relatively small reactors to treat large volumes of wastewater. The project will address several challenges in microbial fuel-cell research, including quantification of the importance of oxygen inhibition on MFC activity. The PI also will explore the suitability of converting the HFM-MFC configuration to produce H2 by eliminating oxygen supply to the cathodic side, thereby producing what has been called a \"bioelectrochemically assisted microbial reactor\" or BEAMR. The PI is a young investigator, which matches the division's goals of using SGER funding primarily for this class of investigators. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
