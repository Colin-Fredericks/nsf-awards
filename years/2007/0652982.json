 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to establish a sustainable high school/community college/University of Utah transition process that will nurture students and increase the number of engineering and computer science graduates by at least 180 per year. The project is in keeping with a statewide initiative in Utah and represents a grass-roots effort by enthusiastic partners. The project is student-centered and includes activities designed to improve partnership relationships between the University of Utah and feeder institutions. The project also establishes a Community Impact service learning community that includes interdisciplinary projects in the planning, preparation, and presentation of hands-on engineering modules aimed at high school students. The modules are based on real-world engineering applications. As part of this project a market survey is being conducted using state-of-the-art tools to determine why Utah students do or don't choose engineering or computer science as a major.",
