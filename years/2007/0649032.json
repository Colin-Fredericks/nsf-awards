Willis\r\n\r\nThis award for an REU site at Southern Methodist University (SMU) will engage undergraduate students in experimental research in mechanical engineering.  The objectives of the program are to provide students experience in mechanical measurements in a research setting in order to: 1) allow students to experience the discovery process through experimentation; 2) increase student interest in pursuing graduate studies; and 3) reveal the wide scope of mechanical engineering applications.  The program will include research on a wide variety of mechanical engineering topics including laser based manufacturing, experimental fluid dynamics, thermal measurements, and solid mechanics. The program will also include seminars on experimental methods and effective presentations, tours of industry, extracurricular activities, and a research day where participants will present the results of their research.  \r\n\r\nThe program will place emphasis on recruitment of students from underrepresented groups.  Recruitment will target students at SMU and Texas colleges and universities without major engineering research programs (including community colleges). The REU site program intends to encourage students to pursue advanced degrees in engineering and improve retention of students in engineering.  \r\n",
