This will be a two-part investigation. First, the calcium isotopic composition (delta 44Ca values) of barite in box core-tops will be compared with the known constant delta 44Ca of modern seawater to determine the fractionation between barite and seawater, and to evaluate the constancy of this fractionation in a range of modern environments. Then, a roughly 130 million year record of barite delta 44Ca will be produced, using existing deep-sea cores at a resolution of about 0.5 m.y., with higher-resolution sampling in a few key intervals. On the education side the PI will develop student-focused problem-based classes and a school-wide education outreach program at Stanford.\r\n\r\nThis field of study could provide valuable information regarding the sources and sinks of Ca, including carbonate production/burial and hydrothermal exchange reactions. Given linkages between the carbonate and carbon cycles, this work could also yield valuable perspectives on the long-term history of ocean pH and atmospheric CO2.\r\n\r\n",
