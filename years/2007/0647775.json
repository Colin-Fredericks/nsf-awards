This program will engaged 12 undergraduate students each year for three years in a 10 week summer research program in the field of nanotechnology.  In addition to laboratory work, students will participate in a weekly professional development seminar.   This training will teach students the skills necessary for success in graduate school and research careers, such as technical communication, navigating scientific literature, laboratory documentation, and research ethics.  The program will produce well-rounded future researchers through the weekly professional development seminars and strong mentoring in the laboratory. Also, a cohort experience among participants will be fostered with weekly social events and clustered housing in university apartments.   \r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will be focused on students who are underrepresented in the field of engineering on the basis of their ethnicity or gender, as well as students from non-research institutions.  The students who participate in this REU program are likely to pursue graduate education to further their interest in research which will enhance the diversity and number of research and development-oriented technological leaders, thus contributing to our nation maintaining a diverse, technological workforce.\r\n",
