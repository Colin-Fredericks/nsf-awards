 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovation), a virtual laboratory for exploring future internets at scale, is to create major new opportunities to understand, innovate and transform global networks and their interactions with society.  Dynamic and adaptive, GENI opens up new areas of research at the frontiers of network science and engineering, and increases the opportunity for significant socio-economic impact. \r\n\r\nGENI will employ a flexible and adaptable framework that incorporates spiral development, i.e., iterative prototyping, and federation, i.e., connecting heterogeneous networks, substrates and technologies. It is expected that each turn of the spiral will take advantage of what currently exists, what has been learned from the previous spiral, what can fruitfully be federated and what might be achieved through new development and prototyping activities. Spiral 1 will allow academic-industry partners to create end-to-end GENI prototypes with a strong emphasis on the design and implementation of multiple GENI control frameworks. The ultimate goal is to design end-to-end prototypes of a virtual laboratory with a suite of infrastructure that will support future experiments and research challenges articulated by the Network Science and Engineering (NetSE) research community.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This award gives funding to BBN Technologies to provide management and oversight of all GENI-related activities. GENI will 1) support at-scale experimentation on shared, heterogeneous, highly-instrumented infrastructure, 2) enable deep programmability throughout the network, promoting innovations in network science, technologies, services and applications, and 3) provide collaborative and exploratory environments for academia, industry, and the public to catalyze groundbreaking discoveries and innovation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Encouraging community engagement is critical to success. A GENI outreach plan will be developed and implemented. Each year, three GENI Engineering Conferences will be held. Open application for travel grants will ensure that researchers and students at underserved academic institutions and regions of the country will be able to participate. Potential partners in industry and international funding agencies will also be encouraged to attend. Students and young faculty will be hired as interns at BBN. As needed, interdisciplinary workshops will be convened that bring together researchers that don?t normally communicate, but from which GENI and the research community can benefit.  \r\n\r\nThere is no pre-ordained outcome for these activities; the resultant GENI infrastructure suite could be an enahanced Internet, enhanced testbeds, federations of enhanced testbeds, something brand new (from small to large), federation of all of the above and/or federation with related international efforts. The goal is to promote innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth.",

GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for \"at scale\" experiments in future internets.\n\nGENI supports two types of experiments: (a) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will greatly help improve our scientific under-standing of complex, large-scale networks; and (b) \"in the wild\" trials of experimental services that can engage large numbers of human participants within American universities and cities.\n\nGENI is a visionary undertaking with very high potential impact. If it succeeds, it will completely transform research in networking and distributed systems. Given the ever-growing importance of the Internet and global computing systems, its success could also create major opportunities for our economy and society.\n2 GENI Vision\n\nGENI\u00c6s vision is to become the world\u00c6s first laboratory environment for exploring future internets at scale, promoting innovations in network science, security, technologies, services and applications.\n\nGENI is now allowing academic and industrial researchers to perform a new class of experiments that tackle critically important issues in global communications networks:\n\n&bull;     Science issues &ndash; We cannot currently understand or predict the behavior of complex, large-scale networks.\n\n&bull;     Innovation issues &ndash; We currently face substantial barriers to innovation with novel architectures, services, and technologies.\n\n&bull;     Society issues &ndash; We increasingly rely on the Internet but are unsure that can trust its security, privacy, or resilience.\n\nRather than build a separate, parallel set of infrastructure \"as big as the Internet,\" which is clearly infeasible, we are GENI-enabling existing testbeds, campuses, regional and backbone networks, cloud computation services, and commercial equipment.
