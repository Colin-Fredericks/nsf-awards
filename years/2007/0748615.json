The CPATH initiative provides a means of engaging the community in alliances and activities that can shape a positive future for undergraduate computing education.\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses the pursuit of the CPATH vision as put forth by the CISE in the hosting of a one-day regional meeting to be held in Orlando, Florida in early December 2007. The southeast region of the U.S. will be targeted in reaching out to colleges and universities and other stakeholders to address the issue of revitalizing undergraduate computing education. These stakeholders, inclusive of industry, professional organizations, community colleges, and government, will come together to formulate and implement plans for transforming undergraduate computing education in the United States. The proposed regional meeting, hosted by Florida Institute of Technology, will provide for a collective dialogue to be started regarding the future of undergraduate computing education. The regional meeting will use as a foundation the CPATH initiative to assist participants in developing concrete plans and activities in the revitalization of undergraduate computing education. The regional meeting will provide a venue for building alliances among community participants in the development and implementation of action plans.\r\n\r\nThe regional meeting will be broadly publicized throughout the southeast region with an emphasis on institutions within an easy driving distance of the meeting. The intention is for local and regional participants to come together to pursue the CPATH vision in the revitalization of undergraduate computing education. The outcomes of the regional meeting, from both focus sessions and group sessions, will be disseminated electronically to those attending the meeting. They will also be posted on the NSF CPATH Southeast Town Hall Web site for virtual dissemination throughout the United States.\r\n\r\n",
