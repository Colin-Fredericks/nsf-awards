 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13). This project conducts systematic research to obtain convincing evidence about the effectiveness of using virtual experiment (VE) technologies in teaching physics and develops curriculum materials for implementation of VE in the introductory physics labs. In previous research, the PIs have found that using virtual experiments can help students understand difficult physics concepts at a more intuitive level and improve the effectiveness of laboratories on student learning. This project has Intellectual Merit as it brings cutting-edge computing technology to address the teaching laboratory that is a very important educational component of a STEM discipline. It advances technology and creates new strategies in the field of physics education. The Broad Impacts of the research can be considered in several areas. The VE technology itself has many advantages in helping improve students' interests, motivations, and attitudes toward physics and learning physics. Making a new technology affordable can have a significant impact in improving the education environment at a much larger scale. From a more general perspective, physical feedback is a novel component addition to a computer simulation. In medical applications, the attempt is to mimic the real thing. Animators have discovered that mimicking is best replaced by physics when possible and this project has significance in adding physics to the VE environment. The results of this research can also lead to full scale projects that develop VE technologies for a wide range of content areas in physical science.",
