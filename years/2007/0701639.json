The first pertains to Kazhdan's property of\r\nlinear groups over arbitrary finitely generated rings. Our recent\r\nresult that under certain conditions on n and the ring R, the\r\ngroup of determinant one n by n matrices over R has this property\r\n(fixed point for any isometric action on a Hilbert space),\r\ninvolves a mixture of K-theoretic and analytic tools. It promotes\r\nfundamental questions and speculations about both the nature of\r\nthese groups, and property (T). The second topic addresses a well\r\nknown question of Zimmer from 1979, on the subgroup structure of\r\narithmetic groups, which has been touched so far by only one\r\nauthor.  The question seeks refinement of Margulis' celebrated\r\nnormal subgroup theorem, to the understanding of almost normal\r\nsubgroups, i.e., ones which intersect their conjugates in a\r\nfinite index subgroup.  We plan to pursue a new approach which on\r\none hand leads to entirely new results and phenomena even for the\r\nsimplest arithmetic groups, and on the other to many intriguing\r\nnatural problems. The group theoretic notion of bounded\r\ngeneration turns out be deeply related to both aspects of the\r\nproject, although it arises from different sources.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical notion of a group is one of the most fundamental\r\nones in the sciences in general and in mathematics in particular,\r\nenabling one to rigorously treat as well as capitalize on\r\nsymmetries of various structures.  A distinguished class of\r\ngroups in mathematics is formed by the arithmetic groups, which\r\nappear and are fundamental in many mathematical areas including\r\ngeometry, number theory, algebra and even combinatorics and\r\ncomputer science. One main purpose of the project is to expose\r\nand study entirely new features of these groups, which were not\r\nseen previously in other groups as well. Another main goal is to\r\nmake first systematic study of a wider family of groups,\r\ngeneralizing the arithmetic ones, and try to bring to bear some\r\nof the rich theory and powerful tools which have been developed\r\nover the past half a century in the more classical setting.  This\r\nwould have many potential applications in those areas where\r\narithmetic groups have already proved to be a fundamentally\r\nimportant object and tool.\r\n",
