 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\nOrthologous genes, or orthologs, are genes in different species \r\nthat have evolved directly from a common ancestral gene. \r\nGenome-scale assignment of orthologs is a fundamental and \r\nchallenging problem in computational biology, and has a wide range \r\nof applications in comparative genomics and functional genomics. \r\nThis project continues the development of the parsimony approach \r\nfor assigning orthologs between closely related genomes \r\nwhich essentially attempts to transform \r\none genome into another by the smallest number of genome rearrangement \r\nevents including reversal, translocation, fusion, and fission, as well as \r\ngene duplication events. The project addresses three key algorithmic \r\nproblems including (i) signed reversal distance with \r\nduplicates, (ii) signed transposition distance with duplicates, \r\nand (iii) minimum common string partition. Efficient solutions to each of \r\nthese problems are combined and incorporated into a software system for \r\northolog assignment, called MSOAR. The project encompasses \r\ngenome-wide analysis of orthologous (and paralogous) relationships on \r\nthe human and mouse genomes to valdiate the approach, and more importantly, \r\nto address several important evolutionary biological questions including \r\nthe characterization of gains and losses of duplicated genes in the \r\ntwo genomes, the elucidation of gene movements in one genome with respect \r\nto the other genome, and the quantification of different mechanisms of \r\ngene duplication. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. \r\n\r\nThe parsimony approach presents a novel method for performing genome-wide \r\northolog assignment that takes into account both gene sequences and locations. \r\nThe above algorithmic problems are new in the literature and their solutions \r\nlikely require the introduction of novel algorithm design and analysis \r\ntechniques. The questions regarding gene duplication and quantification of \r\nthe duplication mechanisms in model species are of fundamental importance \r\nin evolutionary biology. \r\n\r\nBroader impact. \r\n\r\nAs ortholog assignment is a fundamental problem in comparative genomics and \r\nhas become a routine practice in almost all areas of genomics, MSOAR \r\nwill find itself a wide range of applications in biology and genomics. \r\nMoreover, the research will provide the training opportunity for two computer \r\nscience graduate students in the interdisciplinary field of computational biology. \r\n\r\nInformation concerning this NSF project will be provided at the website: \r\nhttp://msoar.cs.ucr.edu/ \r\n \r\n \r\n",
