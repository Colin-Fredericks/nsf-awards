 "awd_abstract_narration": "The distribution patterns and sensitivities to climate change of different species will be affected by their tolerance of environmental stress.  This project will characterize the physiological processes in native and invasive species of blue mussels (genus Mytilus) that are most critical in the animal''s responses to changes in temperature and salinity, on a scale from minutes to weeks and even to generations.  This work is the first application of modern genome-enabled technologies (transcriptomics - the study of gene expression, and proteomics - identification of proteins present in a cell) to describe the dynamics of thousands of genes and proteins simultaneously in marine animals subjected to environmental stress.  In addition, this project will compare gene sequences and protein structure and function to identify the characteristics of proteins that determine the species'' different tolerance limits.  \r\n\r\nThis project has many broader impacts.  These studies will examine why an invasive blue mussel species from the Mediterranean Sea has successfully replaced the native blue mussel along the southern portion of the Pacific Coast of North America.  The blue mussels to be studied are of great interest to researchers in ecology, marine science, and evolutionary biology, as well as to State and Federal natural resource managers who seek to understand the environmental impacts of climate change on natural populations and the processes by which invasive species succeed in new habitats.  The results will be of special significance to the \"\"Mussel Watch\"\" Project, which uses mussels to monitor the water quality status of coastal and estuarine waters.  The collaboration between Stanford University and California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, brings together students from all stages of training, from high school students to postdoctoral researchers, in an effort to foster a socially and ethnically diverse research environment.  Cross-campus exchanges will facilitate an excellent learning environment for students at both campuses.",
