Consequently, answers to critical science\r\nquestions about watersheds require observations of watershed characteristics and depend on\r\ndeveloping new engineering capabilities to sample data at high temporal frequency and spatial\r\ndensity; to assess the optimal frequency and density of sampling; and to analyze those data for the\r\nimprovement of mechanistic understanding of processes. Examples of fundamental timedependent\r\ncharacteristics of watersheds that require improved sampling and analytical\r\ncapabilities include the magnitude of mass of water, nutrients, sediments, and energy in stores;\r\nthe residence time in the stores; fluxes between the stores; and flowpaths among the stores. This\r\nproposed work develops new engineering approaches to address science questions about the\r\nspatial and temporal variability of regulators of nitrate load in watersheds; how geologic setting,\r\nland use and terrain influence loading and delivery dynamics; the relationship between flow\r\nmixtures and nitrate loads; and the feasibility of using surrogate measures for estimating basin\r\nscale nitrate dynamics in space and time. The engineering approaches are two-pronged. (1)\r\nCommercially available nitrate, conductivity, temperature, and pressure sensors will be installed\r\nin an array that will sample at sub-daily frequencies and communicate via cell phone technology\r\nin real time to a central computer. (2) Existing data will be used to develop a probabilistic\r\nalgorithm based on information theory to identify minimum spatial and temporal spacing of\r\nsampling necessary to reduce uncertainty to a prescribed level; this algorithm will be validated\r\nwith the newly collected data.\r\nThe study site is the Santa Fe River watershed in north-central Florida. The Santa Fe\r\nRiver is a major tributary to the Suwannee River which has been cited as a potential location for\r\nCUAHSI-CLEANER WATer and Environmental Research Systems Network. The Santa Fe\r\nRiver has similar characteristics to the Suwannee River Basin, but at a smaller scale, making it an\r\nideal test-bed for developing new sampling and analytical capabilities required to advance\r\nwatershed science and engineering. Both rivers cross the Cody escarpment, which marks the\r\nboundary between geologically confined and unconfined portions of the Floridan aquifer, and the\r\nchange from a surface water to ground water dominated system. The entire region is undergoing\r\na transition from minimal anthropogenic impact to multiple stressors from land-use practices\r\nincluding population increase and consumptive use, proposed water diversions, and accelerating\r\ndevelopment making predictive basin-scale science essential.\r\nBroader Impacts. Development of the sensor network and probabilistic algorithm represent a\r\ngood initial test at a small scale of how to develop water and environmental research networks.\r\nThe communication ports will be configured for testing of any newly developed or off-the-shelf\r\nsensors, and outside users will be welcome to test instrumentation at these sites. The probabilistic\r\nalgorithms to be developed as part of the work will be sufficiently generic that they will be useful\r\nfor planning sensor deployments in any watershed. This generic characteristic will make them\r\nuseful for analyses of the uncertainty of predictability of variables in addition to nitrate. Human\r\nresources will be impacted through support of two PhD-level graduate students (and a post\r\ndoctoral researcher). Data collected and collated for the work will be archived in an ArcHydro\r\ngeodatabase to be made available to non-local researchers. These data will also be demonstrated\r\nfor use in AP Environmental Science classes at the high school level, Environmental Science and\r\nHydrologic courses at the college level, and as a an interactive exhibit at the Florida Museum of\r\nNatural History in Gainesville.",
