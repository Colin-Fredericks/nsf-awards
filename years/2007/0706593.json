 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical:\r\nThese new layered III-VI Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor (DMS) systems complement the enormous progress in the II-VI DMS and the more recent efforts in the Mn doped III-V DMS systems.  The III-VI DMS Ga1-xMnxSe exhibits a strong red emission at 1.804 eV attributed to the Mn.  GaSe itself is known for its remarkable nonlinear optical properties and is a promising material for photoelectronic applications.  Ga1-xMnxS and In1-xMnxS will be investigated in detail followed by a study of In1-xMnxSe, Ga1-xMnxSe and a survey of Fe and Co based materials.  Non-linear magnetization scaling analysis on Ga1-xMnxS establishes there is a true spin-glass transition at 11 K.  This important result adds a whole new class of spin-glass materials and raises interesting questions of the effect of spatial dimensionality on the spin-glass transition in this system. The investigation of new materials is essential for discovering novel systems and properties that can be used in future devices.  In terms of broader impacts, this project involves mentoring three undergraduate students each year.  The research group currently includes 1 female student (currently an underrepresented group in physics).  This project also allows this undergraduate institution the honor of sharing a state-of-the-art SQUID magnetometer and a Physical Property Measurement System (2 major research instruments) with research groups at one undergraduate and two graduate institutions.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical:\r\nThes new layered thin film diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) systems complement the enormous progress made in systems based on other semiconductor hosts. The Galium(Ga)-ManganeseMn)-Selinium(Se) system exhibits a strong red light emission.  GaSe itself is known for its remarkable optical properties and is a promising material for photoelectronic applications such as flat TV screens.  Several of these type materials will be investigated to further explore the magnetic, thermal, and electrical properties of this newest class of DMS based on these layered  semiconductor hosts.
