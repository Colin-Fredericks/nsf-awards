 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent years have seen a rapid growth of enterprise data centers that host thousands of high-density blade servers and provide outsourced commercial IT services.  There are two key challenges for effectively operating a modern data center.  First, different customers have to be assured by meeting their required service-level agreements (SLAs) such as response time and throughput.  Second, power consumption has to be controlled in order to reduce operation costs, and avoid failures caused by power capacity overload or system overheating due to increasing high-density.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop a holistic management framework which controls power consumption and required application-level SLAs simultaneously with theoretical guarantees on both.  This cross-layered framework features a constrained multi-input-multi-output control model to manage multiple blade servers at the cluster level.  In sharp contrast to traditional solutions that rely on heuristic-based management schemes, this research adopts a rigorous design methodology that is based on a control-theoretic foundation for systematically developing control strategies, with analytic assurance of control accuracy and system stability.  This project also develops decentralized control algorithms for large-scale application services running on a large number of servers in a data center.  In addition, related challenges such as system controllability guarantee and thermal management will be addressed.\r\n",
