 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER grant aims at developing a pilot system to achieve synergistic and stable deep penetration welding by combining a fiber laser and a plasma jet. The success of this pilot system heavily relies on a real-time plasma sensor and the integration of the fiber laser and the plasma jet. To develop this real-time plasma sensor, a high speed photography system will be integrated with a high performance computing system for image processing at a frame rate up to 200,000 fps. This high speed photography system allows the PIs to observe the oscillation of keyhole and plasma ejection in order to validate and refine the design of the new plasma sensor array. The observation also allows the validation of rigorous mathematical modeling of the laser/plasma-jet process currently under development. \r\n\r\nThe key technology resides in synergistic energy deposition of a laser beam with moderate power and a plasma torch with a special nozzle design. The laser, with its much higher power density, will create the keyhole while a finely focused plasma jet from the plasma torch will provide additional energy deposition. The keyhole will be stabilized through active regulation of the plasma jet and the laser-induced plasma. The successful development of closed-loop deep penetration laser welding processes will be a breakthrough in this area. The request SGER grant will allow the PIs to prove the synergistic energy deposition concept as well as the inherent stability of the process, thus, establishing the foundation for a closed-loop welding system. Such a closed-loop system has not been attempted because the lack of real-time feedback sensors.\r\n\r\nThe technology will render laser welding economically viable for a much larger range of industries. The US industry is in need of this kind of advanced technology to boost competitiveness in order to turn back the tide of off-shoring jobs by many major corporations. Further, US laser job shops (over 10,000) will see their service capability significantly increased by the availability of such a technology. Computationally, the project uses novel combination of numerical strategies. The work is being performed in an interdisciplinary group environment that integrates research with undergraduate and graduate students through both courses and projects. \r\n\r\n",
