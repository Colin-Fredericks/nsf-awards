 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship Program (IGERT) supports graduate training that integrates social and natural sciences and considers the dynamics of change across temporal and spatial scales. Alaska and the Circumpolar North are appropriate places to train scholars to research the dynamics of social-ecological systems because of their pronounced rates of climatic, cultural and socio-economic change. The curriculum and research of this IGERT prepares students in the theoretical and applied underpinnings of resilience theory, vulnerability analysis, and sustainability science. This renewal builds on the previous IGERT at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) by adding: (1) a focus on global-local linkages that shape sustainability at all scales, (2) a bridging program with UAF rural campuses makes this PhD program more accessible to Alaska Native students, and (3) opportunities for graduate students to participate in activities of the International Polar Year. \r\nThis IGERT establishes new institutional partnerships and trains a new cadre of scholars who have the interdisciplinary skills to address the complex challenges of sustainability. These scholars will contribute to society through their skills in integrating knowledge and informing policy makers in mitigation and adaptation. This IGERT strongly supports the training of Alaska Native PhDs in this area who are needed to serve as university faculty, researchers, educators, and community leaders. This IGERT represents a US contribution to the International Polar Year through the establishment of a consortium of graduate programs with a focus on northern social-ecological resilience. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Our IGERT had three major outcomes.  The first was the permanent establishment of the Resilience and Adaptation Program (RAP) at UAF, now funded by the State of Alaska.  The creation of RAP at UAF addressed a number of deficiencies and issue related to interdisciplinary studies in social-ecological systems.  Students of interdisciplinary studies are commonly \"homeless\" during their degree programs &ndash; working on their own and without a learning community of scholars who share interest in their problem area.  While some academic departments and research institutes espouse the value of interdisciplinarity, the reward system of higher education often discourages faculty engagement in interdisciplinary scholarship and mentoring students with cross-boundary interests.  Today\u00c6s societal problems, however, require that solutions integrate social, economic, ecological, and political to contribute to sustainability, resilience and wellbeing.  In 2002, the year we launched RAP, the University of Alaska had no curriculum focusing on human-environment interactions. Many departments had faculty whose research touched on this topic, but those efforts were mostly framed in the context of faculty members\u00c6 home discipline.  Recognizing the societal need for sustainable solutions and the need for scholars trained in the study of social-ecological systems, RAP was established and is now institutionalized with base funding from the State of Alaska Legislature.  We view the creation of the RAP curriculum and the long-term institutionalization (and funding) of RAP as the greatest educational achievement of the IGERT grants received from NSF.  The RAP experience also had a ripple effect at UAF, leading to the establishment of a Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies by the UAF Graduate School.   Reviewing RAP\u00c6s developmental phases, we can attribute this achievement to a set of conditions that enabled our success. \n\n&bull;             Credibility and legitimacy of the program\n\n&bull;             Departmental buy in\n\n&bull;             Knowledge integration \n\n&bull;             Continuity and demand\n\n&bull;             Relevance\n\n&bull;             Faculty hiring\n\n&bull;             Long-term prospects\n\nA second outcome is the hiring of RAP graduates in the workforce.  Using this measure, we are proud that many of our graduates have been hired full time as researchers and faculty members at high quality institutions of higher education.  In this process, RAP graduates have been highly competitive in the job market. (Table 1.)\nThe third major accomplishment of our two IGERT grants was the development and application of a conceptual framework for the study of social-ecological systems that integrates theory on vulnerability, resilience, human adaptation, and social-ecological transformations.  ( Figure 1.) The framework illustrates how a system (e.g., household, community, nation, etc.) responds to a suite of interacting drivers (stresses, events, shocks) to produce one of three potential outcomes: (1) persistence of the existing system through resilience; (2) actively navigated transformation to a new, potentially more beneficial state through transformability; or (3) unintended transformation to a new state (often degraded) due to vulnerability and the failure to adapt or transform. These three outcomes are not mutually exclusive, because some components (e.g., ecological subsystems, institutions, or social units) of the system may persist, while others transform, and others degrade. The sensitivity of the system to perturbations depends on its exposure (intensity, frequency, and duration) to each perturbation, the interactions among distinct perturbations, and critical properties of the system. The system response to the resulting impacts depends on its adaptive capacity (i.e., its capacity to learn, cope, innovate, and adapt). Adaptive capacity, in turn, depends on the amount and diversity of social, economic, physical, and natural capital and on..."
