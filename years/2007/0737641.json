 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pulsar Search Collaboratory project (PSC) will engage West Virginia teachers and students in world class research in radio astronomy through the analysis of data collected using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Using the power of grid computing and the interconnectivity of the internet, high school students will assist astronomers in analyzing large data sets collected specifically for the purpose of discovering new pulsars. Not only will students engage with information technology and its role in astronomical data reduction, they will also actively participate in cutting-edge scientific research and contribute to the advancement of science.  Professional development and training for 60 high school teachers and 90 students will take place over the 3-year life of the grant. Teachers will be immersed in the research environment of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, WV, interacting with research scientists and the engineering and computer science staff of the NRAO as they learn about pulsar astronomy, and how data are collected, analyzed, and reported. They will participate in all facets of pulsar research from observing alongside astronomers using the GBT to conducting data reduction and analysis during a 17-day residential institute. NRAO and West Virginia University (WVU) faculty will assist participants in translating these activities into student-friendly modules. Students selected by participating teachers will join the teachers and PSC staff at NRAO for the final week of the institute to participate in detailed training.",
