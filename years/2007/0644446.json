Such complex nature is referred to as data heterogeneity. Clearly, how we organize, visualize, and correlate these heterogeneous datasets will influence the effectiveness of information interpretation and decision-making, and ultimately reflect on the success of a task.\r\nMany technical challenges persist in effectively dealing with complex visualization tasks involving large-scale heterogeneous data. To address some of the challenges, the PI aims to develop a heterogeneous display environment integrated with versatile data visualization and user interaction capabilities. The design of the visualization system is guided by a theory where the various aspects of complex controls on 3D visualization and user interaction are viewed as a multidimensional continuum space. The proposed system can potentially facilitate the process of visualizing and correlating large-scale heterogeneous data. Particularly, the PI will evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technology using scenarios directly related to scientific activities underway by researchers in NASA's Mars Exploration Program. The system will also offer a platform to refine the continuum theory and investigate methods that could improve the effectiveness of complex data visualization and user interaction. \r\n\r\nThe PI further outlines a comprehensive plan for developing interdisciplinary education opportunities tightly integrated with the proposed research agenda for a wide range of learner groups. Examples include training opportunities embedded in research activities for diversified learner groups, curriculum development to address the educational needs for students in interdisciplinary areas of research; and the development of short courses and hands-on projects for summer schools and community outreach events. The PI will also explore the value of 3D visualization techniques in science and engineering education.\r\n\r\nThe success of these plans will set up a solid foundation for the PI to achieve her life-long goals of establishing first-class interdisciplinary research and educational programs.\r\n",
