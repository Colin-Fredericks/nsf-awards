 "awd_abstract_narration": "COMBINED TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT  The goal of the \"The Polymer Science of Everyday Things\" symposium and workshop is to explain how things that people encounter and use everyday depend on polymer science for their ubiquity. Scientists and teachers hear and are often excited about new inventions or products but may not stop to think about common things, such as how controlled release processes for aspirin and Tylenol work, what are bandages made from, what issues are involved in implants made of polymeric materials....and what about diapers and catheters? The unique feature of the combined symposium and workshop consists of extending educational outreach on these topics in polymer science to teachers and scientists, by teachers and scientists, with substantial emphasis on three remote-site workshop learning facilities. Thus, this symposium and workshop fulfill these needs while enhancing education in the field of polymer science and enhancing teaching professionalism. \r\n\r\nThe scientific merit of this symposium lies in the fundamental approach taken in explaining the composition and properties of polymeric materials in the area of polymers in medical and health care applications.  Broader impacts stem from a high attendance of Ph. D. professionals (academic, industry, government), who are interested in requirements for polymers in medical applications and insight into the state-of-the-art. This information often influences the course of research projects or inspires relevant examples for inclusion in courses.   With the K-12 Long Distance Workshop, Boston, Akron, Phoenix, and ICI-sites will be utilized that involve local school districts' communication forums for inviting K-12 teachers. Thus, the presentations are leveraged by a factor of at least three in terms of K-12 teachers and a correspondingly higher factor in terms of students impacted. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
