 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for award DMS-0701029 of Matthias Flach\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to define and study a new Grothendieck\r\ntopology (the \"Weil-etale topology\") in connection with special\r\nvalues of Hasse-Weil L-functions of varieties over number fields\r\n(the \"Tamagawa Number conjecture\"). The idea of such a topology, as\r\nwell as a first definition, is due to Lichtenbaum who also shows the\r\nexpected relationship to the L-function in the simplest case of a\r\nzero-dimensional variety. However, truncation of the complex\r\ncomputing Weil-etale cohomology is necessary because in even degrees\r\ngreater than two the cohomology group is nonvanishing and of\r\ninfinite rank. One goal of the project would be to redefine the Weil\r\netale topos of the ring of integers of a number field so that it has\r\nbounded cohomology as well as a number of other properties such as a\r\nmap to the etale topos and to the classifying topos of the real\r\nnumbers. A second goal is to find a definition of the Weil etale\r\ntopos for higher dimensional arithmetic schemes of characteristic\r\nzero (the case of finite characteristic is already well understood\r\ndue to work of Lichtenbaum and Geisser). A third, more speculative\r\ngoal would be to reprove the analytic class number formula using the\r\nWeil-etale topology with the aim of generalizing it to Artin\r\nL-functions. One interesting aspect of this project is the\r\ninteraction of topos theory and logic with more classical and well\r\nestablished number theory, such as the analytic class number\r\nformula.\r\n\r\nDiophantine equations and their solutions have occupied the\r\nimagination of mathematically interested people for centuries but\r\nthey also have found real world applications in coding theory.\r\nModern mathematics provides a bewildering array of techniques,\r\nranging from the disarmingly simple to the highly abstract, to study\r\ndiophantine equations. The geometric perspective, viewing the\r\nsolution set as a \"space\", has been particularly useful. The project\r\naims to contribute to this line of thought by defining and studying\r\na new cohomology theory for diophantine equations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
