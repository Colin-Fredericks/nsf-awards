 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CPATH project develops, implements and disseminates a transformational model that illuminates new pathways to careers in informatics for new communities. The iCUBED model is based on the notion that levels of engagement in computation can be viewed on a continuum from novice to very technical levels and that students from any discipline and point on the continuum should have courses and programs that meet their needs and discipline interests.  The iCUBED model provides the inside reform within the computer science department, the interdisciplinary reform to infuse informatics into various disciplines, and the institutional reform to provide the administrative and infrastructure support for this transformation. The project includes the implementation of a campus wide interdisciplinary informatics minor, student community building and engagement activities, discipline-specific and interdisciplinary workshops, and dissemination on a national level.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the strong research basic for the transformation and the excellent project team with extensive expertise in their disciplines and in educational innovation. The project design includes educational transformation accompanied by institutional change as well as broad community outreach. There is clear potential for a national model to emerge which could inform and enhance the informatics community across the nation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include the outreach to many disciplines and the increased opportunities for students and faculty to involve informatics in their studies and professional careers. The project offers a flexible approach that is cost effective, adaptable, and scalable for any size university. Thus the iCUBED model has the potential to have nation-wide impact by disseminating a model that will change the way faculty and students think about, learn, and practice informatics.\r\n",
