 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to improve the mechanical integrity of biomaterials for functional tissue engineering (FTE) applications using long carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Researchers from the University of Cincinnati will examine the effects of CNTs on the material response and biocompatibility of biomaterials. Specifically, this research considers the roles of CNT concentration, dispersion, alignment and functionalization, as well as cell concentration and culture duration on the biomaterial response and cell viability. The program has four main objectives. First, the effects of CNT concentration, dispersion, alignment and functionalization on the mechanical response of our candidate biomaterial, agarose, will be determined for a broad range of treatment factors using a response surface methodology (RSM) approach. Second, the effects of CNT concentration and functionalization on biocompatibility will be determined using the same RSM approach. These two objectives will be pursued together. Third, improved computational models of the mechanical response of the biomaterial will be developed to capture its equilibrium and non-equilibrium characteristics. Fourth, summer research projects for undergraduate students will be developed to advance the research objectives and provide interdisciplinary research education to students.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this work is that it will advance knowledge of the reinforcing properties and biological effects of a class of nanomaterials, and knowledge of modeling them. This information will aid the long-term research goal of developing biomaterials capable of withstanding complex physiological loading. Broader impact is achieved by training undergraduate students in research in an important emerging field that combines nanotechnology and tissue engineering to address real problems of significant health and societal impact.\r\n",
