 "awd_abstract_narration": "A global regulatory effort is underway to allow secondary spectrum trading by license holders and flexible access by end-users. Preliminary evidence in early incarnations of secondary spectrum markets indicates a sophisticated market structure and suggests that realizing full potential of deregulated spectrum entails overcoming fundamental technical and economic challenges.\r\n\r\nThis project has the following research objectives: (i) Development of pricing strategies that capture network-wide effects of interference and that render secondary spectrum markets profitable for license holders; (ii) Design of market rules that facilitate new entrants and improve end-user perception in economic and performance terms; (iii) Development of resource discovery and monitoring algorithms that allow market participants to efficiently and securely utilize network services. These objectives are pursued in an integrated analytical framework that includes techniques of dynamic stochastic optimization, game theory, incentive engineering and tractable teletraffic modeling of large wireless networks.\r\n\r\nThis project promotes healthy deregulation of the wireless communication sector and shows promise for societal impact in view of the attendant economic activity and effective utilization of an important national resource. The educational component involves curriculum innovation aimed at facilitating the interaction between regulatory and technical communities, extracurricular activities in amateur radio, and outreach to members of minority and under-represented groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
