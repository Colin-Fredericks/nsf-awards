McMurtry, University of Utah \r\n\r\nThis workshop grant is to support a gathering of CAREER eligible faculty at the 2007 APS/DFD meeting in Salt Lake City. The workshop will involve discussion of CAREER Award criteria and issues by NSF personnel and discussion among CAREER eligible faculty and past CAREER awardees.  The intellectual merit of this workshop is to make new faculty more aware of what NSF is looking for in CAREER proposals to help young faculty focus their efforts. For broader impacts, this workshop will also provide a an opportunity for new faculty to learn more about NSF. This includes NSF budgets, trends in grants and awards and other information that will be useful to new faculty in submitting proposals to NSF. A specific effort will be made to invite faculty from under represented groups to this workshop.\r\n",
