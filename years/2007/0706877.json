Shipley\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to study algebraic derived equivalences using\r\nmethods from homotopy theory.  Specifically, the main project\r\nproposed here is to consider when an equivalence between derived\r\ncategories can be realized by an underlying richly structured\r\nequivalence.  The PI and Dugger have shown that certain derived\r\nequivalences of differential graded algebras (DGAs) can only be\r\nrealized by \"topological equivalences\" (involving tilting\r\nspectra) which arise by considering DGAs in the broader context\r\nof ring spectra.  One goal of this project is to produce simple\r\ninvariants for detecting topological equivalences of DGAs.\r\nAnother goal is to extend the study of topological equivalences\r\nto DG-categories.  In on-going joint work with Dugger, the PI is\r\nalso investigating an exotic example of two derived equivalent\r\nDGAs with no underlying structured equivalence.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research projects involve the interplay beween the\r\nstudy of algebraic structures and topology, the study of shapes\r\nor spaces. Algebraic topologists use algebraic structures to\r\ndescribe and simplify topological phenomena. In a project on\r\nrealizing derived equivalences, the investigator hopes to use\r\ntechniques developed in algebraic topology to attack questions\r\nwhich originate in algebra.  The PI also plans to organize\r\nconferences which will help to train graduate students as well as\r\ndisseminate results.  In addition, the PI will continue to be\r\ninvolved with several organizations which promote the\r\nparticipation of women in science.\r\n",
