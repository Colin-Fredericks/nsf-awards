 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Early Faculty Career Development (CAREER) award is to develop a new method to tailor the properties of liquid suspensions and nanocomposites by controlling the organization of nanoparticles during processing. Current materials that are made with carbon nanotubes and other nanoparticles are limited by a lack of tailored microstructure properties. This is seen especially in the lack of particle dispersion control. By controlling the microstructure, properties like suspension viscosity can be altered along with other composite properties including electrical conductivity, strength and degradation temperature.  In order to control the microscopic properties of a set of model nanoparticles, light, pH and temperature stimuli responsive polymers will be used.\r\n\r\nThis methodology and its results are important because it will demonstrate design methods to control nanoparticle dispersion in liquid dispersions. This is important for biomedical applications. In addition, the control of microstructure properties creates a new class of lightweight engineering composites that will have applications in microwave antenna substrates, sensing and actuation transducers for biomedical applications and highly conductive flexible microelectronic materials.  The educational objectives of this award include outreach to high school students as well as undergraduate students. Minority high school students will be included in the research via collaboration on science fair projects related to the research. Experiments in microstructure will be integrated into undergraduate coursework that will be developed as well as direct involvement of undergraduates in the research project as well.",
