The\r\nfirst project aims to construct an integrable hierarchy which\r\ngoverns the topology of the moduli spaces of degree d stable\r\nholomorphic maps from a genus-g, nodal Riemann surface to a\r\nvariety X which is assumed to be a toric complete intersection.\r\nThe topological information is encoded in a formal power series\r\ncalled the total descendant potential of the toric variety, and\r\nthe goal is to show that this potential is a solution to an\r\nintegrable hierarchy.  The second project in this research\r\nprogram is dedicated to an interaction of integrable systems with\r\nsymplectic field theory of a compact Kaehler manifold Y,\r\ndeveloping a potential related to the total descendant potential\r\ndescribed above.  Relationships are expected to emerge between\r\nGromov-Witten invariants for Y and for a projective line bundle\r\nover Y, with the relationships described via transformations of\r\nintegrable systems.\r\n\r\nSymplectic geometry is the structure underlying the Hamiltonian\r\nformalism of classical mechanics, in which the behavior of a\r\nmechanical system is determined by an energy-like function.\r\nGeometric spaces carrying such structures can be high-dimensional\r\nand structurally complicated, and much recent work in the area is\r\ndevoted to exploring symplectic structures through associated\r\nspaces of well-imbedded two-dimensional subsurfaces of them.\r\nTwo-dimensional surfaces have been studied for more than 150\r\nyears and our detailed understanding of them leads to constraints\r\nupon the associated invariants of high-dimensional symplectic\r\nmanifolds.  The principal investigator's work explores new\r\nconstraints of this kind that take the form of well-behaved\r\ndifferential equations, the integrable systems of the proposal\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n",
