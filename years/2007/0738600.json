The U.S. lead investigators are Eric Kaler of the University of Delaware and James Seferis from the Foundation for Research, Experiential Educational Developmental Operational Management (FREEDOM).  The Greek team leads are George Papanicolaou from the University of Patras, Nikos Andreanopoulos from National Technical University of Athens, and Danis Papadoupoulos from University of Athens. \r\n\r\nThe topics to be addressed at this workshop include (1) transdisciplinary research relating to materials and processes of load-bearing structures in aviation, medicine, building construction, and ship building, (2) materials and processes for ecological building construction, (3) the application of nano-structures towards the development of larger megastructures. The workshop will be organized as a series of discussions followed by break-out sessions to facilitate collaborations and follow-on research activities.  Several U.S. junior researchers and students will be supported to attend.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will leverage the expertise of the U.S. and international participants while strengthening research ties. Furthermore, the workshop participants will explore the concept of using museums as incubators for new businesses by analyzing an exhibited plane's tail fin to improve advanced composite components.",
