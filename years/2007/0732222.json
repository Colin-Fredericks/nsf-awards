 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechoso and his team will analyze data obtained by the VORCORE campaign of constant-density balloon observations over Antarctica. Twenty-seven such balloons were launched from McMurdo Station (77.5\u00baS) during the Austral spring of 2005. The pressure and position information from these balloons are unique data for studying waves in Antarctic atmosphere and its overall circulation. \r\n\r\nOf particular interest is the utility of these data for observing internal gravity waves. Gravity waves are ubiquitous in the atmosphere. Their vertical transport of momentum is important for the atmospheric circulation, especially in the middle atmosphere, and all modern climate models include gravity-wave parameterizations. These parameterizations are, however, only poorly constrained by observational data. In the Antarctic lower stratosphere, poorly represented gravity waves may be responsible for the persistent cold biases displayed by many climate models.\r\n\r\nTo make optimal use of the VORCORE balloon data, a formalism for analyzing gravity wave fields and fluxes in isopycnal (log-density) coordinates has been developed, and will be applied in this project. \r\n\r\nSpecific analyses will include: estimating gravity-wave momentum fluxes in order to constrain gravity-wave parameterizations, determining the effects of topographic  waves on the large-scale circulation and their role in creating conditions in which polar stratospheric clouds can form, observing the wave field at near-inertial frequencies, where previous observations have indicated the wave spectrum is strongly enhanced, studying the final stratospheric warming of 2005, analyzing Lagrangian dispersion across the edge of the polar vortex, and validating global analyses of the Antarctic lower stratosphere and testing the impact of assimilating VORCORE data on these analyses.\r\n\r\nData from the Concordiasi balloon campaign will also be analyzed as they become available. Concordiasi is a collaboration between the United States and France. The Concordiasi observations will be made during the austral spring of 2008 and comprise part of the U.S. and French contributions to the International Polar Year (IPY). The constant density balloons used in Concordiasi will deploy dropsondes, which measure vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, and pressure between the balloon and the surface. These data will provide valuable information about waves propagating to the balloon level from below.\r\n\r\nA limited set of data from a tropical balloon campaign conducted from Ecuador in 1998 will also be analyzed. The focus here will be on studying the spectra of waves generated over convectively active regions.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this research are in gaining a better understanding of the circulation and dynamics of this atmospheric region in which the ozone hole forms. This project is a contribution to the intense international observations of the Polar Regions during the IPY. A graduate student will be trained.  \r\n\r\n",

Introduction\n\nThe work carried out under this project produced significant results on three of its principal objectives: 1) Produce statistical descriptions of the gravity wave fields over the Antarctic in the spatial and spectral domains, 2) Obtain constraints for gravity wave parameterizations, and 3) Examine air exchanges and transports in relation to the polar vortex.

Project Objectives\n\nOur long-range goal is the better understanding of waves, circulation, and transport features in the Antarctic stratosphere. The methodology used is based on analysis of unique data sets gathered in situ by drifting Super-Pressure Balloons (SPB) launched from Antarctica. By design, SPBs drift at near-constant density levels in the atmosphere.\n\nThe data analyzed were obtained in the VORCORE field campaign.

VORCORE is been followed by CONCORDIASI, another SPB field campaign sponsored by CNES and the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), in which the PIs of this project participate also.\n\n3.  Statistical descriptions of the gravity wave fields over the Antarctic\n\nWe investigated why analyses of zonal wind speeds recorded by balloons drifting in the southern hemisphere polar vortex during the VORCORE identified a spectral peak with a frequency near 0.10 hr-1, which is more than 25% higher than the inertial frequency at locations along the trajectories.  Using balloon and reanalysis data we showed that the lower frequency limit of inertial waves in the background flow is not the inertial frequency but the effective inertial frequency defined as the Coriolis parameter plus the relative vorticity (i.e., the absolute vorticity).  The spectral peak near 0.10 hr-1, therefore, is interpreted as due to inertial waves propagating inside the Antarctic polar vortex (Gelinas et al. 2010). This finding contributes to the basic understanding of the spectrum of atmospheric waves.\n\n4. Constraints for gravity wave parameterizations\n\nVORCORE has provided one of the more important data sets available for evaluation of vertical momentum fluxes by gravity waves, and hence for reference on parameterization development. We produced detailed and direct inferences of momentum fluxes in the lower stratosphere above Antarctica using the VORCORE dataset and a formulation of gravity wave relations specially suited to calculation with SPB data.

Figure 2 presents the October and November mean momentum fluxes at the 50 hPa level produced by that OGWD scheme.  The simulated values are very small compared to the observation, and modifications to the parameterization input do not change these results. Part of the errors is due to deficiencies in the simulated flow. We found that the results can be significantly improved by refining definitions used in the parameterization.\n\n5.
