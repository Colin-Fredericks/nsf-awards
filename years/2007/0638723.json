These activities that center on such areas as astronomy, physics, chemistry, computer science and engineering, are developed by graduate students and experienced teachers and are then implemented in the K-12 classroom.  The research activities are connected to nationally recognized education programs such as QuarkNet (a previously funded NSF project, award # 0207072), TLRBSE and Supercomputing Education Programs.  The goals of NCeRC are: 1) to incorporate graduate students into the life and work of the Notre Dame QuarkNet Center so as to instill a sense of responsibility to and provide a model for education and public outreach, 2) to provide a research experience to a wider range of K-12 teachers and students in surrounding areas, 3) to strengthen and expand avenues of collaboration between University and surrounding K-12 institutions.  This project provides research experience in the sciences for those who traditionally would not have had the opportunity.  \r\n",
