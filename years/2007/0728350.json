The freshman scholarship recipients are residing in a living learning community with a select group of upper-class students serving as tutors and peer mentors.  The cohort is being supported by academic, career, advising, tutoring, recruiting and informational services.  The project is awarding approximately 35 scholarships annually, based on financial need, and the scholarships are renewed annually for up to 4 years given acceptable academic performance.\r\n\r\nThe scholarship students are engaging in various activities including visiting local high schools giving talks and demonstrations on a variety of engineering topics.  They each have a faculty mentor assigned to them supporting their academic, personal and professional development.  This program is serving as a model for a living learning community in STEM higher educational environments.",
