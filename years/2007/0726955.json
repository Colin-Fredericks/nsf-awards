 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the supported research is to fulfill the critical need for decision support in the management of expedited placement livers. When a liver is donated, a procurement coordinator attempts to place the organ with a recipient using a prioritized match list. To speed the process, coordinators often extend multiple offers simultaneously. However, if the procurement coordinator senses that the process will still not result in a match quickly enough, then the coordinator may initiate \"expedited placement.\"  Once this decision is made, the coordinator abandons the list and offers the organ not to an individual, but to a transplant center; the center then either declines the organ or selects a recipient from its list of patients. The specific decisions of interest from the procurement coordinator's perspective include: When implementing the match list process, how many simultaneous offers to extend? When to abandon the match list and initiate expedited placement? And from the transplant center's perspective: to which (if any) of its patients should it allocate an expedited placement organ? \r\n\r\nThe PI will examine these sensitive resource allocation problems surrounding the unpublicized, yet common practice of expedited placement in allocating donated livers through rigorous analysis of mathematical models driven by clinical data. The insights generated will supply much needed support to procurement coordinators and transplant centers, resulting in fewer wasted organs, better donor-recipient matches, saved lives and improved post-transplant survival expectancies.\r\n",
