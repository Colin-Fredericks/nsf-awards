Viewed broadly, KMC is\r\nthe numerical task of simulating stochastic models.  While the\r\nfocus of the project is primarily on crystal growth, KMC\r\nsimulations arise in many contexts, including micro-magnetics,\r\necology, and chemical processes.  The algorithms that are\r\ndeveloped are applicable to all such models.  In this work,\r\nhowever, two new algorithms with single event execution times\r\nindependent of the system size are used to examine dendritic\r\ngrowth during solidification.  Dendritic growth refers to a\r\ncommon interfacial instability that occurs during the formation\r\nof solid materials -- snow flakes being a familiar example. \r\nThese instabilities have a number of practical implications for\r\nmaterials processing and are also of fundamental scientific\r\ninterest.  Dendrites that form in both pure and composite\r\nmaterials are studied. \r\n\r\nThis project concerns the development of computer programs that\r\nsimulate the behavior of solid materials on length scales that\r\nare so small that individual atoms are resolved.  It therefore\r\nhas direct impact on the area of nanotechnology, which is rapidly\r\nemerging as an area of national strategic interest.  The programs\r\nthat arew developed are the most efficient of all known ways for\r\nperforming this particular type of simulation.  These simulations\r\nsimulate the growth and evolution of solid phase materials by\r\nimitating the random motion of individual atoms using millions of\r\nrandom numbers, which themselves are generated by a separate\r\ncomputer program.  A particular type of solid phase growth from a\r\nliquid material that gives rise to a snow-flake like crystal\r\nstructure is a principal area of study, but the computer programs\r\nthemselves are designed in a way that also makes them useful in a\r\nmuch broader class of problems.  Students are involved in the\r\nproject. \r\n",
