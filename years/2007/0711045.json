 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the Thirteenth International Meeting on Ciliate Molecular Biology,  which will be held as a FASEB Summer Research Conference in Tucson Arizona from July 21-26, 2007. The meeting will bring together 120-150 scientists from various countries who use ciliated protozoa as model systems to study diverse and important biological problems such as self-splicing RNA, telomerase, and chromatin remodeling by histone acetyltransferases. The conference will include nine platform sessions, three workshops and two poster sessions. Topics of the platform sessions represent active areas of current ciliate research including Genome Structure and Organization, Developmental Genome Rearrangements, Gene Expression and Chromatin Modification, RNA Metabolism, Genome Stability and Dynamics, Evolution and Population Biology, Morphogenesis and Development, Cytoskeleton and Cell Motility, Cytoplasmic Cell Biology. Roughly half the speakers will be chosen from submitted abstracts. to present and discuss projects that are less complete. The workshops will be on Genomics and Postgenomics, Ciliates in the Classroom, and New Tools.  NSF funds will be used to support attendance by students and postdocs.",
