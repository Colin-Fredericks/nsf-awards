 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SFS Scholarship Program at the University of California Irvine is working to attract, recruit, mentor and graduate talented domestic PhD students in Information Assurance (IA), and to foster their careers in the national service. The program emphasizes the recruitment of women and students from under-represented groups into the doctoral program.\r\n\r\nThe School of Information and Computer Sciences at UC Irvine is home to an exceptionally broad and well-rounded set of dedicated and world-renowned IA faculty members who have a track record of comprehensive training and successful post-degree placement of IA PhD students. This program is providing the support to expand the number of domestic students at ICS who are interested in national service. The inter-disciplinary nature of the ICS graduate IA track exposes students not only to topics Computer and Information Sciences, but also to topics in Mathematics and Ethics/Law. \r\n\r\nAs the first SFS scholarship program focused solely on doctoral students, UC Irvine is producing IA experts who will serve as ambassadors of academic research and will help build new, and strengthen existing, bridges between academic institutions and the federal sector. This will engender increased collaboration, exchange of ideas and innovations as well as faster technology transfer from the purely academic to the real-world setting. \r\n\r\n",
