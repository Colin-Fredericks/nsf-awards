 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental research program is a new project aimed at realizing a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) composed of polar molecules.  The long-term goal of the program is to study novel quantum phases that can be engineered using the unique interaction properties of polar molecules.  A BEC of heteronuclear Li-K molecules in a specific high-lying vibrational state will first be created from overlapping spin-polarized Fermi gases of lithium and potassium atoms by adiabatically sweeping across a Feshbach scattering resonance.  Due to the Fermi statistics of the constituent atoms which comprise the molecules, the BEC is expected to be stable against inelastic collisions for magnetic fields close to the Feshbach resonance.  To create a dipolar BEC, molecules will be adiabatically transferred to their ground ro-vibrational state via a two-photon process where application of a small electric field can easily polarize the molecules. \r\n\r\nThe realization of quantum degenerate gases of polar molecules will open up a vast array of new methods for the manipulation of quantum matter.  A myriad of novel quantum phases can be engineered using dipolar quantum gases.  Investigations of these systems will result in a substantial increase in our theoretical understanding of many-body quantum systems.  Such knowledge will aid in the development of new devices based on complex materials which can benefit society.  Furthermore, the availability of ultracold polar molecules is of importance for implementing certain quantum computation schemes and engineering matter with topological order which may be useful for topological quantum computation.  Pursuit of these research objectives will also benefit society through the training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers.\r\n",
