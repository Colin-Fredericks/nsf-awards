 "awd_abstract_narration": "Image registration is one of today's challenging image processing problems.\r\nGiven two images, one attempts to find a  reasonable transformation to deform one image into the other.\r\nImage registration is applied whenever images resulting from different times and devices need to be compared or integrated. It is often used in radiation therapy and surgery planing.\r\nImage registration is a highly ill-posed problem. To reduce the level of non-uniqueness, it is possible to use additional constraints such as rigidity of bones. \r\nThis research deals with the numerical treatment of image-based constraints.\r\nWhile it is possible to formulate constrained image registration problems, such problems can be very difficult to solve.  This project develops and experiments with inexact adaptive multilevel inexact Sequential Quadratic Programming methods that allow inaccurate solutions of the subproblem at each iteration.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The challenges in this work are composed of two parts.\r\nFirst, constrained image registration problems are formulated in a way that yields continuously differentiable objective functions.  Second, constrained optimization techniques are develop. This involves SQP, multigrid and adaptive mesh refinement methods.\r\nBroad Impact: Image registration is routinely used for clinical procedures.\r\nNevertheless a vast majority of registration problems use either rigid or affine linear transformations.\r\nThis is because fully nonlinear registration tends to be unreliable. \r\nUsing image-based constraints will\r\ngenerate realistic deformations and thus expand the use of image registration algorithms to much more complicated problems. This can directly impact clinical procedures such as radiation planning  and tumor tracking.\r\n",
