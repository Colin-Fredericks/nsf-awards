The long-term goals of the proposed research are to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms mediating the anaerobic fermentation of glycerol in E. coli and use the knowledge base thus created to engineer this organism for the efficient production of reduced chemicals and fuels. The specific objectives of the research plan are: (1) study the effect of medium composition and cultivation conditions on glycerol fermentation, (2) assess the role of hypothesized pathways in the fermentative metabolism of glycerol by using genetic and biochemical approaches; (3) identify genes, proteins, and metabolic processes involved in the fermentation of glycerol using functional genomics tools; and (4) engineer E. coli for the efficient co-production of ethanol and hydrogen, thus illustrating the advantages of using glycerol fermentation as a new platform to produce biofuels and biochemicals. To achieve these goals, functional genomics tools will be used to supplement a traditional hypothesis-driven approach. In addition, metabolic engineering will be used as a rational approach to engineer E. coli for the conversion of glycerol into ethanol and hydrogen. The intellectual merit of this proposal relates to elucidating the fermentative metabolism of glycerol in E. coli, a puzzle that has remained unresolved for more than eighty years. By enabling and integrating the production of biofuels, this proposal will contribute to the creation of fundamentally new processes and paradigms such as those embracing the biorefinery concept. This research will also make significant contributions to the education of our society on the role of biofuels as enablers of a secure and sustainable energy future. \r\n\r\n",
