 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) A variety of Research-Based Instructional Strategies (RBIS)have been developed and tested extensively. Although these RBIS have been demonstrated to improve student learning, attitudes, and retention, among other things, little information exists about the extent to which they are actually being used by instructors. Anecdotal evidence and a few small-scale studies suggest that the level of use may be quite low. Even less information exists about why many instructors do not use RBIS. Have they not heard about these strategies? Are they happy with their current instruction and see no reason to change? Do they believe that they lack the skills necessary to implement the new strategies? In order to plan successful curriculum development and dissemination projects it is crucial to develop a better understanding of the current situation. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to understand the level of knowledge about, attitudes towards, and use of RBIS by instructors of introductory quantitative (i.e. calculus-based & algebra-based) physics courses. This is being accomplished in two phases through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. In Phase 1 a web-based survey is being administered to a random sample of approximately 1600 physics instructors stratified by type of institution. The web survey asks instructors to self-report their current level of knowledge about and use of RBIS. In Phase 2, telephone interviews with 96 instructors focus on the two RBIS that are most widely known. These interviews focus on three types of instructors: (1) users of the RBIS, (2) former users of the RBIS, and (3) knowledgeable nonusers of the RBIS. The telephone interviews can provide qualitative data that can be used to answer how and why questions related to the use of RBIS. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project seeks to increase the broader impacts of projects previously funded by programs such as CCLI. The data collected in this project is currently unavailable and is crucial for understanding the impact, limitations, and possibilities of recent curriculum development and dissemination efforts. The PI and Co-PI are active physics education researchers and are familiar with the range of RBIS currently available as well as issues related to the implementation of these strategies. The advisory committee consists of experienced curriculum developers and can help to ensure the usefulness of the project results. The findings can advance understanding not only in the context of introductory physics, but also across many fields. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Curriculum developers and designers of professional development activities can use the results of this project to design curricula that are more likely to be adopted and professional development that is better able to provide instructors with the knowledge and skills they need to successfully improve their instruction. Ultimately, these more effective curriculum development and dissemination efforts can increase the number of instructors using RBIS. It should also be noted that many of the RBIS, while improving outcomes and reducing attrition for all students, have been shown to have a disproportionately positive effect on traditionally underrepresented groups such as women and ethnic minorities. \r\n\r\nThe results of this project are being disseminated within the Physics Education Research Community as well as to the larger STEM Educational Research Community, curriculum developers, and funding agencies. Because of their stature, the advisory committee helps to facilitate this process and is also expected to incorporate the results into their own curriculum development and dissemination efforts.",
