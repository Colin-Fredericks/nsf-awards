 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves nanostructured, ionic polymer metal composites that are capable of mechanical motion with application of a weak electric field.  Like actual muscle tissue, these synthetic materials move in response to an electrical stimulus, and thus mimic nature as artificial muscles.  The actuation behavior of these unique nanocomposites originates from the formation of electrically-conducting metal nanoparticles near the outer layers of the ionic polymer (electrode layers) that stimulate ion/solvent migration through nanostructured, ion-transporting domains.  In this project, the nanoscale organization of ionic domains in the polymer membrane will be altered to create anisotropic actuation behavior in a manner similar to the form and function of the fiber-like structure of actual muscle tissue.  By controlling the nano-scale structure of these artificial muscles, new fundamental information regarding the morphology-actuation property relationships will be developed in order to discover the precise actuation mechanism in these active nanostructures. \r\nThrough a bio-inspired approach, this project eloquently demonstrates the profound importance of understanding nano-science and technology in the ability to create synthetic materials that are capable of mimicking Mother Nature in form and function.  Since many applications are envisioned for these artificial muscles (from bio-mechanical implants to energy conversion devices), this research effort will provide the critical information needed to tailor nanostructure for specific macroscopic characteristics.  As artificial muscle research has an intrinsically broad appeal to a wide audience, the research results will serve as an ideal vehicle to develop outreach and educational materials for K-12 students, undergraduates, and graduates.\r\n",
