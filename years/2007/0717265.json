 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists have long studied consequences of biological diversity among species on ecological processes.  For example, it is well established that species identity influences ecological interactions and that the presence or absence of dominant species, keystone species, or ecosystem engineers can regulate community structure and ecosystem function.  In contrast, much less is known about how variation within a species affects ecological interactions. This project will test the effects of variation in life history among populations of anadromous and landlocked alewives, Alosa pseudoharengus, on community structure and ecosystem function in lakes.  Landlocked alewives are a keystone species, and phenotypic differences between landlocked and anadromous populations are expected to affect lake ecosystems.  Results from whole-lake experimental and comparative studies, and small-scale experiments will addresses fundamental questions about how biological diversity within a species influences community structure and ecosystem function. \r\n \r\nThere are three broad impacts of this work.  First, the research addresses questions with direct management implications for the conservation and management of anadromous alewives, a federally listed species of conservation concern.  Second, the research will engage local stakeholders in a lake sampling effort providing both outreach opportunities and supplemental data collection. Third, the research will provide interdisciplinary training in aquatic ecology as outlined in the 1996 NRC report on the status of education in freshwater ecosystems.\r\n",
