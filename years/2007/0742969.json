 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nNSF Forum - Guam\r\nThe proposed Forum will provide skill-building workshops and information about the resources and services of the National Science Foundation [NSF] to researchers and educators from a range of U.S. Pacific Island jurisdictions to encourage and broaden their participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and the workforce. Recommendations from previous NSF outreach targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI, 2003) stressed two urgencies: 1) the need to develop capacity and support projects specific to the needs of Pacific Islanders, and 2) the need to bring information and conduct trainings on-site in the Pacific region. As a result, in 2006, a Pacific-based Outreach Workshop convened in Hawaii (NSF, 2006). Most of the attendees represented the islands of Oahu and Hawaii; however, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands also participated. Such exposure was beneficial to all, though, for participants beyond Hawaii it underscored how little regular access they have to quality information and advice in these arenas. Also the activities and discussions further illuminated the fact that the Pacific Island jurisdictions have neither the resources nor the same needs as the state of Hawaii. It is clear that broader outreach is needed so that NSF can more specifically address the education, evaluation, and research needs of all Pacific entities that maintain relationships with the U.S. and ultimately increase their participation in STEM education and careers.\r\nWe propose to convene a diverse international group (approximately 30) from across the Pacific all of whom are underrepresented in higher education and STEM fields. Participants will come from U.S. Pacific Island jurisdictions: Guam, the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia (Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae), the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (Rota, Saipan, Tinian), and American Samoa. Guam was selected as a strategic location for the meeting because 1) as a U.S. Territory it qualifies for a range of NSF funding opportunities, 2) it is in reasonable proximity to the other Micronesian entities, as well as American Samoa, and 3) it has the capacity and infrastructure to support the meeting.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis coordinated international effort to bring NSF resources and services to more isolated entities across the Pacific will inform the professional growth of educators and others and impact exemplary community-driven STEM education for indigenous students of Pacific Island descent.\r\nBroad Impacts\r\nA growing group of knowledgeable educators and other professionals will work collaboratively to pursue NSF funding for programs and research, and bring new knowledge to their communities, national and international meetings, and future events, increasing the participation of Pacific Islanders in STEM education and careers.",
