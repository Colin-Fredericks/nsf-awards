 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop, publish and disseminate a\r\nreference guide to the nation?s 35 tribally controlled colleges and universities. Tribal\r\nCollege and University Profiles will feature descriptions of each institution, as well as\r\nintroductory information on the history and philosophy of the tribal college movement. In\r\naddition, it will summarize the role\r\nand impact of NSF-supported STEM education initiatives.\r\nThe proposed reference guide supports the National Science Foundation?s STEM and capacity\r\nbuilding initiatives targeting tribal colleges. Because tribal colleges are small, rural\r\nand underfunded, their needs and accomplishments are frequently overlooked by policy\r\nmakers and funders within the public and private sectors. Publication of Tribal College\r\nand University Profiles brings greater visibility to the movement and creates\r\nopportunities for tribal colleges to showcase accomplishments and identify new\r\npartnerships.\r\nThe project will result in publication of a professionally written and designed book of\r\napproximately 96 pages. With an anticipated print run of 4,500 copies, it will be widely\r\ndistributed among mainstream educational institutions, federal agencies, policy makers and\r\nnonprofits. The guide will also be distributed to tribal colleges, the National Science\r\nFoundation, and associations affiliated with the tribal college movement.",
