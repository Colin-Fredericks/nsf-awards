 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially support the curation, outreach, and data management activities for cores obtained by Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 150X and 174AX. These two legs obtained over 4 km of core from 11 sites drilled onshore in the New Jersey (NJ) and Delaware coastal plain as a coordinated effort with Legs 150 (NJ slope), 174A (NJ slope and outer shelf), and the Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 313 drilling on the NJ shelf. Drilling by Legs 150X and 174AX has provided an exceptionally well documented series of continuous cores from the coastal plain drilled in collaboration with the NSF, ODP, ICDP (International Continental Drilling Program), USGS, DOSECC (Drilling, Observation, and Sampling of the Earth's Continental Crust), and the state geological surveys of New Jersey and Delaware. The Rutgers Core Repository currently archives ODP onshore cores from Legs 174AX and 150X. These cores continue to provide insights into global sea level change, sequence stratigraphy, basin tectonics and sedimentation, and climate change.  Rutgers University is providing long-term storage space materials support for archiving these cores, which have become a significant holding that warrant more dedicated curation management and outreach activities.  Funding is provided for partial support of a Curator and funds to develop a web presence for the Repository including a relational database (with metadata from all coreholes, comprehensive core and log datasets), links to related publications, ODP/IODP, and links to other core repositories (Bremen, TAMU, and continental repositories, linking IODP with continental drilling). The Curator will also serve as the primary outreach coordinator for the Repository.",
