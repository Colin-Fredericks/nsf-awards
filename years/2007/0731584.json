 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanotechnology's ability to manipulate atoms and molecules enables us to create nanoscale materials and novel device structures with fundamentally new properties and unprecedented functions.  The key to exploiting opportunities in nanoscience for chemical and biological sensors is putting together the diverse fields of biology, chemistry, engineering, materials, medicine and physics to understand both what is possible and what is needed for new generations of sensors.  Identifying gaps enables interdisciplinary teams to form and to share expertise in order to make significant progress in developing new capabilities.  This conference has a mixture of invited and contributed talks, panel discussions, poster sessions, and time for smaller discussions, all with the aim of exploring opportunities, identifying gaps, and developing collaborations.\r\n\r\nRecent advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology have opened up myriad opportunities for applications and commercialization. Nanotechnology is anticipated to lead to dramatic changes in every aspect of our lives, not only representing novel and unique chemical strategies to make unprecedented functional nanomaterials, but also delivering better health and longer life spans through related diagnosis and therapy. This full-scale international meeting will educate scientists and students and promote the intellectual exchange of the current status of and future opportunities in this area.\r\n\r\n",
