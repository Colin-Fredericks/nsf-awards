Tian) is to describe the how\r\nEinstein metrics can degenerate.  In our previous work we gave a\r\ngood local description of collapse of Einstein metrics in\r\ndimension 4, showing that away from a definite number of points\r\ncollapse occurs with bounded curvature and in the limit, gives\r\nrise to Einstein metrics with continous symmetries.  We want to\r\nglobalize this local description and, in so far as possible,\r\nextend it to higher dimensions. A second main goal of the\r\nproject, joint with B. Kleiner, is to study first order calculus\r\non metric measure spaces for (Lipschitz) functions with values in\r\ninfinite dimensional Banach spaces. In this context,\r\ndifferentiation theorems can give rise to bi-Lipschitz\r\nnonembedding theorems.  For applications arising in computer\r\nscience, the most interesting target is the space \"Ell-One\". In\r\nthis case, a Lipschitz function need not be differentiable\r\n(anywhere) unless (as Kleiner and I discovered) differentiability\r\nis understood in a suitable extended sense. This sense was still\r\nstrong enough to enable us give a counter example to the\r\nGoemans-Linial conjecture.  An important aspect of the present\r\nproject (joint with Kleiner and A. Naor) is to make this\r\nnonembedding theorem quantitative (which is what computer\r\nscientists really want).  Our approach requires the developement\r\nof new techniques in geometric measure theory.\r\n\r\nThe study of certain special (higher dimensional) smoothly curved\r\nobjects called Einstein manifolds is important in mathematics and\r\nin modern physics e.g. in connection with the theory of\r\nrelativity and in string theory.  In particular, we want a theory\r\nwhich tells us what can be the \"most distorted\" examples of such\r\nobjects.  Our project is concerned with this issue.  A second\r\nmain focus has to do with \"metric spaces\".  By a metric space,\r\none can understand any collection of objects where there is a\r\nnotion of distance between any two of them.  For example, the\r\nobjects might be finger prints and a suitable notion of distance\r\nwould enable a computer to detect which finger prints closely\r\nmatcheda given one. A key issue in both the pure and applied\r\naspects of the subject, is to be able to decide whether a\r\n\"complicated\" metric space which one wants to understand, can be\r\nrealized (perhaps in a non-obvious way) as a subset of a\r\n\"simpler\" metrric space which one already understands. In our\r\nproject, sophistocated tools from pure mathematics are developed\r\nwhich can be used in various cases (of pure and applied interest)\r\nto decide the feasibility of such an approach.\r\n",
