Steckl, Principal Investigator\r\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering\r\nUniversity of Cincinnati\r\nCincinnati, OH 45221-0030\r\nTel: (513) 556-4777 e-mail: a.steckl@uc.edu\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this research is to establish the fundamental principles of liquid field field effect transistors (LiquiFETs), a novel concept for transistor structures using liquids for the active medium.  The technical approach for the LiquiFET involves electrowetting between competitive insulating/conducting fluids. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The LiquiFET could serve as the basic building block for a new type of integrated circuit - liquid logic. Liquid electronics would enable the development of large area (\"human-scale\") circuits for various applications: large flat or flexible panel displays, large array antennas, scanners/printers/copiers, large area sensors, full-size medical imaging systems, photovoltaic arrays, electrotextiles, electronic newspapers. By using a liquid medium, one can also readily incorporate additional functionality into the transistor, such as controllable optical properties (reflectivity, fluorescence, etc.) and interaction with biochemical species (chem/bio sensors).\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This project will provide interactions with faculty and graduate students in the Institute for Nano Science and Engineering, which encompasses the departments of Chemistry, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Materials Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Molecular Biology. Cross-disciplinary biomedical applications of LiquiFETs will be explored with colleagues in Chemistry and in the College of Medicine. Undergraduate students will participate in the program through specifically designed \"senior projects\" at UC. African-American, Latino/a, and Native American students will be recruited through the Emerging Ethnic Engineers Program and female engineering students through the Rowe Center for Women. Research results will be disseminated through journal publications and conference presentations and through ongoing collaborations with US universities.  The development of applications for the technology will be pursued by interactions and collaborations with industrial colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
