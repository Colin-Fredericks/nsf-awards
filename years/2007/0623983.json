 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jan Mandel, PI, will spend one academic year in residence at NCAR to study atmospheric science and perform research in data assimilation in hurricane and wildfire modeling. In previous research, he has taken the principal role in building a new wildfire model based on physics and partial differential equations and developed new data assimilation methods, suitable for highly nonlinear problems. The purpose of this project is to gain the needed background and hands-on experience in atmospheric sciences, in interaction and collaboration with some of the best experts in mesoscale meteorology and data assimilation. The PI will also learn how to work with and extend the WRF (Weather Research Forecasting) atmospheric model code, and to use his methods with WRF on real data sources.\r\n\r\nRisks to human activities from catastrophic weather related events such as wildfires and hurricanes are immense. The new data assimilation methods will contribute to better on time forecasts and thus savings in lives and property. They can also improve the use and interpretation of data from environmental sensors, which are becoming widely available, to provide an early and accurate warning of a natural disaster or an atmospheric contaminant based terrorist attack. The project will involve two of the PI's PhD students, who\r\nare currently working on thesis topics related to data assimilation and wildfire modeling. The students will regularly visit NCAR to work with the PI and to participate in seminars. The new knowledge gained\r\nby the PI will make it possible to integrate the students' thesis research with applications in atmospheric sciences and it will enable the PI to supervise the students' research more efficiently.\r\n\r\nThis IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).\r\n\r\n",
