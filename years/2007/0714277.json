Addressing the problem has proven difficult, primarily\r\ndue to deployment and complexity concerns about previously proposed\r\nmechanisms. In particular, receiver-controlled capabilities are an\r\nelegant way for preventing communication interference, but are\r\ndifficult to deploy in practice and are susceptible to control-channel\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nThis project is investigating a new communication paradigm, named\r\nPacketSpread, which makes feasible the use of capability-like mechanisms\r\non the current Internet, without requiring architectural modifications\r\nto networks or hosts. The high-level hypothesis of the research is that\r\npractical network capability schemes can be constructed through the\r\nuse of end-point traffic-redirection mechanisms that use a\r\nspread-spectrum-like communication paradigm enabled by an overlay\r\nnetwork. To test this hypothesis, the project is prototyping and\r\nexperimentally validating the resistance of such a scheme against\r\nattacks launched by realistic adversaries, while minimizing the\r\nimpact of the approach to end-to-end communication latency and\r\nthroughput.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will enable a better understanding how\r\nnetwork-capability schemes can be deployed and used to provide robust\r\nand secure communications under both normal operation and in times of\r\ncrisis.  Improvements in the security and reliability of large-scale\r\nsystems on which society, business, government, and individuals depend\r\non will have a positive impact on society.\r\n",
