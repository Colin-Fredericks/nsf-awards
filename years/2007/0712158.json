 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will develop a wearable tactile display system for blind individuals. The goal is to develop a tactile display which has the following features: (1) lightness, (2) conformability, (3) high spatial resolution, (4) low power consumption, and (5) low manufacturing cost. The proposed technology will consist of an array of novel micro-fluidic tactile actuators, which can provide spatial resolution that has never before been achieved in a tactile display utilizing standard actuators like piezoelectric actuators or vibrators. The project will further integrate the proposed tactile display with a talking tactile tablet, an award winning system which allows visually impaired individuals to access graphic imagery they otherwise would not be able to access and hear audio descriptions of each\r\ncomponent of an image. By integrating our tactile display system with talking tactile tablet, the following two major limitations will be surmounted: 1) the current system of printing on special paper with raised lines and texture fills is cumbersome, takes time and cannot be modified, and 2) the lack of access to content that is widely available electronically to sighted users. Consequently, the proposed research will improve access to education - mathematical concepts such as graphs, and geographical maps; entertainment and will promote navigation skills by map reading. \r\n\r\nA wearable, lightweight, low power tactile display has excellent applicability not just in the field of education for blind individuals, but also in a variety of other fields. A tactile display-enabled talking tactile tablet product that targets education alone could represent a market potential of at least $16 million in the US and at least $32 million worldwide. In addition to a wearable tactile display coupled to a portable talking tactile tablet display for individual use, it is also envisioned that a larger kiosk version could be developed for institutional use, the cumulative market potential for which is at least $219 million domestically, and at least $428 million worldwide.",
