 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will result in a low cost-of-ownership production system for commercial grade bulk SiC substrates up to 6\" in diameter. It proposes to develop, test and implement a production system for high purity, bulk SiC crystal growth based on high temperature Halide Chemical Vapor Deposition (HCVD). The advantages of this approach over current manufacturing technology are multifold: HCVD crystal growth processes yield substrates of higher purity, it offers better control over the material stoichiometry and it offers the advantage of highly accurate impurity control for conductive and semi-insulating substrates. \r\n\r\nSilicon carbide (SiC) is a wide bandgap material that is the proven key enabler of the next-generation high power, high-frequency and radiation hard device applications succeeding silicon and gallium arsenide. Due to its unique materials and electronic properties, SiC devices can function under higher power ratings as well as higher frequency and temperatures compared to Si and GaAs products. For that reason, these \r\nhigh-performance devices are intensely sought after for both commercial and military device applications. To date, however, its commercial potential has been limited by a lack of production capacity for high purity epitaxial films and substrates.\r\n",
