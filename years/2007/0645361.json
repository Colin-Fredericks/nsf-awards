 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of this CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Kent Kirshenbaum of New York University will pursue fundamental research in biomimetic chemistry by establishing new approaches for the study of folding in synthetic polymers. The ability to control precisely the architecture of complex chemical structures in three dimensions will provide molecules with sophisticated properties, such as specific molecular recognition and catalysis. The project will explore the design, synthesis, characterization and applications of a versatile family of protein mimics: sequence-specific N-substituted glycine polymers, also termed 'peptoids'. Some peptoid sequences have been shown to adopt stable helical conformations. The research program will focus upon this class of compounds since peptoids can effectively mimic more complex secondary and tertiary structures. The efforts will include the introduction of macrocyclic constraints to enforce peptoid conformational stability, design of novel folding motifs, enzymatic ligation of peptoid fragments, synthesis of peptoid macromolecules, and the structural characterization of folded peptoids. An enhanced understanding of macromolecular folding and its application in the design of functional chemical structures will be developed.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Kirshenbaum will utilize experimental approaches in his research that will span the disciplines of bioorganic chemistry, physical chemistry and macromolecular engineering. This project will yield broader impacts by enhancing the discovery of chemical structures suitable for diverse materials and biomedical applications. The research program will provide an excellent training environment for undergraduate and graduate students to obtain skills in fields ranging from bionanotechnology to organic synthesis and drug design. Professor Kirshenbaum will establish an innovative approach to introduce topics in Macromolecular Chemistry to students from diverse backgrounds in the New York City Public School system. Working in partnership with New York University's Steinhardt School of Education, educational modules in 'Molecular Gastronomy' will be developed. Demonstrations utilizing unusual and delicious preparations of food polymers will allow students to learn that we perform chemical reactions in our kitchens on a daily basis; that the organization of molecules can be subjected to our control; and that Chemistry has an influence in every aspect of what we breathe, drink and eat.\r\n",
