CDEF awards are made to individuals who have achieved distinction in the computing profession, who are committed to transforming undergraduate computing education, and who have innovative ideas on how to do so. Dr. Astrachan's CDEF project focuses on the development and deployment of instructional materials to introduce Computer Science to majors across many fields. The research and approach build on the successful models of Case-Based learning and Problem-Based learning which are standard practices in business and medical schools, respectively. This approach will relate new knowledge and techniques from computer science to what students already know, e.g., how to use iTunes, why humans are similar to chimpanzees, or why blogs and wikis have transformative effects. The problems used in a Problem Based learning setting are authentic and are typically open-ended in that they can be approached, answered, and justified in more than one way. The model for Computer Science Education has remained largely unchanged in the past twenty years despite a thousand-fold increase in computing power and an unprecedented change in how society and science use technology. This project develops a process and materials to transform both what is taught and learned about computer science and how it is taught. The approach and materials are interdisciplinary as is the advisory board that has oversight for the project. The materials developed are aimed at both traditional computer science students and more broadly at students in other fields who remain largely unaware of the transformative tools, methods, and technologies that are part of the foundation of computer science. The extent to which Problem Based learning is made part of a course or curriculum and the type of Problem Based learning exercises developed depend on student population and experience, the goals of the course, the extent to which faculty are on board, and the resources committed to the process. An intrinsic aspect of the project is a cross-institution, collaborative, and interdisciplinary approach combining faculty and undergraduates to develop, test, and widely disseminate the approach.  Well-designed and implemented Problem-Based learning modules will attract and be effective with a group of students beyond those considering computer as software engineering or mathematics.  Using an approach with a track-record in medicine and business, but also with proven success in postsecondary biology and engineering courses will encourage new approaches and attract new audiences to computer science. The interdisciplinary character of the modules will necessarily have a broader impact than traditional, engineering and science approaches.  The dimensions of effectiveness for Problem Based learning cut across learning style and gender as well as discipline.\r\n\r\n",
