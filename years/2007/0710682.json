 "awd_abstract_narration": "This international travel award to Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) provides support that will enable a diverse group of approximately twenty-five U.S. graduate students to attend the annual meeting of Nobel Laureates in Lindau, Germany, in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. Since 1951, Nobel Prize winners and students in chemistry, physics, and physiology or medicine have met annually in Lindau, Germany. Each year an international group of some 600 students is invited to attend the weeklong meeting. The program includes formal lectures in the mornings and the remainder of each day is set aside for the students to meet informally with the Nobel Laureate scientists, as well as with their fellow students from around the world.  The programmatic cycle revolves among the three Nobel themes noted above, followed by a multidisciplinary theme every fourth year that embraces all three of these Nobel focus areas.  Together with another approximately thirty-five-member cohort supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, (DOE), the National institutes of Health (NIH), ORAU, and private foundations, this grant brings to sixty the number of graduate students in the U.S. delegation that will participate in these meetings. The objective of this program is to motivate participating U.S. students toward excellence in their chosen careers through their exposure to and interaction with Nobel Laureates and fellow students from around the world.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this international travel activity and NSF support of it by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering include the likely synergistic impact on the participating students' scientific career development, the potential for initiating career-long international scientific interactions, and the opportunity to promote diversity at multiple levels among the student participants.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n?From 2007 through 2011, NSF supported a total of 159 graduate students to attend the Lindau Meeting of Nobel Laureates through this grant.  This was dispersed over following Lindau Meetings in 2007 (medicine/physiology), 2008 (physics), 2008 (economics), 2009 (chemistry), 2010 (interdisciplinary - all three science topics), 2011 (economics), and 2012 (physics).\n\nBefore the Lindau Meetings begin, the students attend an orientation meeting where they are introduced the sponsors of the US delegation (including NSF), to the Lindau Meeting activities, and to Lindau and Germany.  While attending the Lindau Meetings, the students attend plenary lectures in the morning given by the Laureates.  Lunches provide an opportunity to interact with international peers, while one lunch is dedicated to small group discussions with Laureates.  The afternoon sessions are closed question and answer sessions held in parallel with that morning's plenary speakers.  Dinners provide an opportunity for students to again meet their peers with one dinner during the week of the scientific meeting with Laureates, and a final opportunity for the US delegation to join as a group with their sponsors to wrap up the week. \n\nORAU administers an immediate post-trip survey to the students and has conducted longitudinal studies in the past.  These go to document the successful and deep impact made in inspiring the next generation of US STEM employees in inductry and academia.   It is not uncommon for attendees to describe this event at an opportunity of a lifetime or a life changing event.\n\nThis grant has enabled to the US to have a sustained presence and influence at the Lindau Meeting of Nobel Laureates and established a strong foundation for future years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samuel Held"
