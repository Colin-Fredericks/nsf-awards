 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the \"Physics & Aerospace Catalyst Experiences in Research (PACER) -  Minority Focus\" pilot program at Louisiana State University.  During this two year program teams will be invited from HBCU (Historically Black College and University) institutions each year to participate in a 9-week summer research experience program.  Each team will consist of a faculty member plus three students from the HBCU.  Established materials will be used to guide the teams while they build skills in electronics, real-time programming, design and management which they will then apply to the design, fabrication and operation of a small science experiment that will be carried to the Edge of Space by a helium filled sounding balloon.  When these teams return to their home institution the PACER program will continue to partner with them during the following and subsequent academic years as they establish a research experience program in aerospace physics for their local students.",
