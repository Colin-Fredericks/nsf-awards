 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research from Koronis Biomedical Technologies (KBT) will develop a low-cost indoor personal navigation system.  Indoor navigation technology is needed to support seamless mobility for the visually impaired.  A number of location devices have been created, but thus far they all have major drawbacks that limit their widespread use.  The ability of a person to move freely within public and commercial buildings is an important factor for integration and independence in educational institutions and the work environment.  Recently developed time-domain ultra-wideband wireless technology makes indoor navigation feasible.  This new technology has the capability to track locations inside buildings without any special building infrastructure.  A small, portable personal navigation device that provides current position, useful contextual wayfinding information about the indoor environment, and directions to a destination would greatly improve access and independence for people with low vision.  Such a device would allow visually impaired persons the freedom of movement within public and commercial buildings.",
