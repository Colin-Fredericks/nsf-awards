 "awd_abstract_narration": "Incremental forming deforms a flat sheet metal into a three-dimensional geometry using a Computer-Numerical-Control (CNC) controlled tool without a supporting die.  The research objectives of this collaborative international project are to understand the failure mechanism in the incremental forming (IF) experiments; to create a double-side incremental forming technology, such that incremental forming is no longer limited to producing components of geometrical features only on one side of the initial sheet plane; and to discover the potential of generating micro-features on macro-scale curved panels using this new forming process. Our approach is based on the mechanics understanding of failure mechanism in the incremental forming process considering both nonlinear strain paths and local contact pressure.  Experimental work will be conducted to verify our failure model. The tool path design will be using a newly proposed inverse strain mapping and minimum damage method. The achievable tolerance and multi-scale feature sizes will be studied here using both experimental and numerical methods. \r\n\r\nThis project will lay down the solid scientific and technological groundwork for regarding the incremental forming process as a valid means for small-volume productions. This project will also demonstrate a successful model for international collaboration and its effort to enhance the global view of our U.S. students. Co-sponsored by MPM and OISE, this project will support our graduate and undergraduate students to be at Indian institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK), for several months during the project period. Faculty and students of IITK will visit NU funded by Indo-US forum or other India funding sources. Students will be involved in both research projects and the development of manufacturing class projects. Research results and collaboration model will be disseminated via publications, seminars and workshops.  \r\n",
