 "awd_abstract_narration": "Epilepsy is the most frequent neurological disorder in children in developing countries. Research in Kilifi district, one of the poorest areas in Kenya, has revealed some of the highest prevalence rates in Kenya and on the African continent.  Biomedical anti-epilepsy drugs are effective at controlling seizures. However, fewer than 5% of children with active epilepsy in Kilifi District access and adhere to these medications. This context presents several theoretical questions including: why do so few families access bio-medical treatment? and, how do epilepsy and treatment choice affect the lives and well-being of the families of these children? Thomas Weisner and Nathaniel Kendall-Taylor's research project examines how cultural and material factors influence the way families seek treatment for pediatric epilepsy, and how these factors and their treatment choices affect the concept of family well-being. Their primary objectives are to: 1) improve the theoretical understanding of how epilepsy, and chronic pediatric disabilities more generally affect the well-being of a family, 2) examine the cultural, social, and material factors that shape how these families seek treatment, and 3) explore how different treatment decisions influence family dynamics and functioning. Their research applies a mixed methods approach including surveys, person-centered interviews, participant observation and structured monitoring.  Their project contributes to the literature on the effects of family factors on the management of childhood disability, and adds to the recently developed anthropological literature on \"well-being\".  Additionally their project will provide training in ethnographic methods for Nathaniel, a PhD student, and will develop his regional specialization in Coastal East Africa. \r\n",
