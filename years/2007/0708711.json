 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-0708711 Gemeinhart     This proposal suggests a strategy for local, controlled drug release using electrospun fiber assemblies, and more specifically core-shell (i.e., radially inhomogeneous) nanofiber structures. The proposed approach combines expertise in bioengineering and polymer nanoscience to produce biocompatible polymer fibers that are uniquely suited to encapsulate therapeutic molecules. The fibers consist of two layers, with the outer polymer sleeve serving a containment role for the inner core, which contains the drug. The premise of the work is that by controlling the physical and chemical properties, as well as the thickness of the outer fiber layer (biocompatible polymer), the release of the drug from the inner core will be regulated. In addition, the feasibility of stimuli-responsive drug release will be examined by incorporating in the fibers additional chemicals that act as environmental sensors. The proposed system is advantageous in that it can accommodate multiple drugs in sequential therapy, i.e., when these drugs need be administered with different temporal profiles. The methodology does not focus specifically on any particular disease, but rather on the engineering principles that can be used to design effective drug delivery systems. Combining experiments and modeling, this program aims to demonstrate in vitro a complete method for controlled drug delivery with tunable time release. \r\n\r\n",
