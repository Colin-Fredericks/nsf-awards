 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chicago Botanic Garden and Northwestern University will host a 10-week summer program focused on plant conservation biology. The REU program will involve students, particularly those from under-represented groups, in contemporary research in plant biology and conservation, foster interdependency and leadership in a cohort of young scientists, encourage independent thinking and intellectual development, and contribute to research in core issues in conservation science. Research projects will span current conservation issues from the genetic to the ecosystem level. The program will foster interdisciplinary system thinking, a skill necessary, yet often lacking, for scientists to address complex environmental issues. This goal will be accomplished experientially via a weeklong field research experience for students and mentors; skills workshops; the opportunity to meet with graduate students; and the design, implementation, and presentation of a research project. Students experience all aspects of modern plant conservation research, from experimental design, data collection and analysis, to reporting the results in a symposium. In addition to hands-on research in the lab or field, students participate in weekly field trips, workshops, and lectures. Students who do not have research opportunities at their home institutions are encouraged to apply.
