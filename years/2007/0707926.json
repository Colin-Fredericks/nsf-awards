This motion law is a very useful model in\r\nmaterials science for phase boundary motions, which appear in\r\nthermal grooving, grain boundary migration, sintering, and many\r\nother instances.  Even though the model was proposed by Mullins\r\nin the 1950s, analysis and understanding of the model is still\r\nfar from complete, due to the lack of sufficient mathematical\r\ntools.  Many issues such as existence of solutions, their\r\nqualitative behaviors, and singularity formations are still wide\r\nopen.  The project analyzes surface diffusion from a variational\r\napproach, which has proved to be quite versatile for many similar\r\nmotion laws.  Questions to be investigated include approximation\r\nand construction of solutions, the analysis of crystalline facet\r\nmotions, and the understanding of solutions exhibiting\r\nself-similarity structures.  The outcomes can benefit both the\r\nmathematical and materials science communities. \r\n\r\n     The use of mathematics in the modeling and analysis of\r\nmaterials science phenomena has become more and more important,\r\nin particular with the current continued outgrowth of\r\nnanotechnology.  The properties of real materials very often are\r\nlinked to the presence of inhomogeneity and defects such as phase\r\nboundaries and triple junctions.  Successful understanding of\r\nthese structures, especially their dynamical response behavior,\r\nrequires intricate mathematical tools.  This project aims to\r\nintroduce new mathematical techniques to study phenomena of\r\nsurface diffusion that have been proposed and experimentally\r\nobserved for a long time, though many questions remain unsettled. \r\nThe scientific merit of the project includes a better\r\nunderstanding of the materials and their response under various\r\nexternal environments.  The project also provides an excellent\r\nopportunity for interdisciplinary research and educational\r\nactivities that can tie together mathematical and engineering\r\nsciences, and graduate students are involved in the work. \r\n",
