 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent upsurge in recognition of autism has raised concern among parents and the medical community.  Many efforts are underway to examine the efficacy of various treatments and to improve the timeliness and accuracy of diagnosis.  Largely missing, however, is an understanding of the basic science issues raised by this syndrome.  As with any disorder, our understanding of normal function can be put into new perspective by understanding the difference in development and functioning of those with and without the impairment.  Autism covers a broad range of symptoms and degrees of severity, and it is quite possible that multiple causes are involved.  However, one recent proposal holds the promise of attributing a series of seemingly disparate effects to a specific neural system: the mirror neuron system. \"\"Mirror neurons\"\" respond both to the performance of an action and the observation of that action in others.  Since their discovery by direct recording in the macaque, a great deal of work has shown that mirror neuron system also is present in humans and underlies both recognition and production of intentional acts, and imitation.  A recent proposal is that the failure of this system is central to autism.  In a workshop funded by the National Science Foundation, Dr. Sally Rogers will bring together specialists in autism and mirror neuron system research to explore this hypothesis and to outline how the study of basic scientific questions will be advanced by inclusion of the data from this special population.  This two-day workshop will provide a contingent of emerging researchers to interact intensively with our eight senior researchers, providing the opportunity to address not only the issue at hand but the scientific process itself.\r\n\r\nThe disabilities that make up Autism Spectrum Disorder affect some of the most basic developmental areas: language, social connectedness, attribution of thoughts and emotion, and integrating input from various sources including the differing senses.  Understanding the mechanisms behind such a disorder?especially if it turns out to be a relatively unified mechanism with diverse consequences?will aid us considerably in understanding the functioning of typical development.  It will also assist in the development of target and effective treatments. The further implications of the mirror neuron hypothesis are also of widespread interest and impact.  The training of scientists interested in development is of great importance, and the present conference will focus to a large extent on bringing a contingent of emerging researchers together with a cluster of senior researchers focusing attention on the scientific evidence the autism affords developmental studies in general.  Whether or not the mirror neuron hypothesis is correct, this intensive exposure to the scientific process at work will increase the likelihood of progress both in the basic science and in future applications for this and other developmental disorders.",
