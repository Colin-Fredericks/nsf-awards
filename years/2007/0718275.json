 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nStructure Based Development of Organic Reactions\r\n\r\nAlkali metal and a very few additional cationic metal stabilized reagents such as boron, zinc, titanium and platinum are the most widely utilized organometallic reagents in organic synthesis today.  However, many unanswered questions concerning their solution and solid-state structures remain.  Specific aim 1 of this proposal is designed to enhance our understanding of the aggregation state, the coordination number, the geometry of attached ligands, and the intimate structural features of such reagents.  Results of this project will provide models for use in developing new reagents and in optimizing the stereoselectivity of extant reagents. \r\n\r\nThe second specific aim of this project is designed to synthesize and characterize new reagents and to develop asymmetric synthetic methodology utilizing new chiral polymeric reagents that will be prepared in my lab.  The design of new polymers will be based upon structure motifs of reactive intermediates from my lab.  \r\n\r\nNew equipment will be designed and protocols developed from growing, sorting and manipulating extremely reactive, extremely moisture sensitive and extremely temperature sensitive organometallic compounds in preparation for their characterization by x-ray diffraction analysis.  Hence, a high throughput crystal screening apparatus and protocol will be developed in analogy to the protocols that have proven highly successful for high throughput preparation of macromolecular protein crystals.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  Stereoselectivity is the basis for synthesizing pure, chiral chemical compounds.  Structural details are especially important for the optimization of stereoselectivity in the design of new reagents and catalysts.  Speculative and unproven structural postulates typically have been utilized for this purpose.   However knowledge of the intimate structure of these reagents remains woefully incomplete and is not commensurate with the widespread, successful use of these reagents in practice.  Nonetheless it is encouraging that there is a very good correlation between the structures of these reagents and their reactivity.  \r\n\r\nHence, I propose a research program designed to obtain structural information that will be utilized to prepare new chiral polymers and to improve the efficiency with which new chemical compounds are prepared.  Specific to this proposal is a focus on boron enolate reagents and chiral lithium amide bases.  New reagents that we develop will be optimized for the synthesis of chiral molecules utilized as catalysts and as building blocks for larger molecules.   Success of this project directly and positively affects the efficiency with which new materials, nanostructures, polymers, and bulk organic chemicals are discovered and prepared.   \r\n\r\nAll students in my research group develop expertise in organic synthesis, spectroscopic analyses, chromatography and x-ray diffraction analysis with a major emphasis on acquiring the skills necessary to continue independent research in a chemical, materials or biochemical research laboratory.  I actively recruit students to participate in this program in collaboration with ongoing initiatives at Brown University including the Leadership Alliance (minority undergraduates), NSF COACH grant (graduate women in science), UTRA (undergraduate teaching and research), WISE (undergraduate women in science & engineering) and Beckman Foundation (undergraduate research training) programs.  I am especially pleased with success we have had in the inclusion of minority, female undergraduates identified through the Leadership Alliance and WISE programs.\r\n",
