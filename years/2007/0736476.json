The purpose of the workshop is to understand how new computational tools and resources have been taken up by humanists and applied to problems long considered out of reach, and at the same time revealed new challenges and desired capabilities for information technologies research. This meeting will bring together approximately 25 participants representing a diverse and experienced group of domain and IT scholars and practitioners. These scholars from diverse fields have all contributed to shaping through their work a vision for how computation, tools and underlying technical infrastructure can shape the future of research and scholarship in the Classics and humanities more generally. Artifacts and manuscripts essentially inaccessable for broad scholarly use in their physical form have been accurately rendered in digital form and distributed widely for examination and analysis by students and researchers.  A specific expected outcome is an articulated description of the emerging state of cyberinfrastructure for the Classics and how it has been shifting the center of gravity away from the traditional structures and practices in the field, which has been in printed materials. The current and evolving set of tools based on technology (computational algorithms; digitization; databases; network access; tagged, indexed and cross-referenced archives) is substantial and collectively forms an impressive shift away from the traditional forms defined by print. A second expected outcome is identifying the global production and refinement of computing/humanities collaborative work and elucidate state-of-the-art progress in a number of areas. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
