The planning visit and workshop is scheduled for October 7-17, 2007 in Shanghai, Chongqing, and Beijing, China.  The PI in the U.S. is Dr. Yong Bai, Assistant Professor, and the Co-PI is Dr. Steven McCabe, Professor, both from the Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering at the University of Kansas.  The Chinese counterparts are Professor SUN, Limin of the Department of Bridge Engineering at Tongji University, Professor WANG, Zhijun of the Department of Structural Engineering at Chongqing University, and Professor NIE, Jianguo of the Department of Civil Engineering at Tsinghua University.   The workshop is expected to advance knowledge across disciplines and especially between U.S. and Chinese scientists drawing on complementary expertise to test novel approaches on new infrastructure in China.  Ideas for improvements to the field of rapid bridge replacement stemming from this workshop will have direct and immediate societal benefits. The PI will also introduce a number of U.S. early career scientists and an undergraduate student (female) to research being conducted in China.  \r\n\r\n",
