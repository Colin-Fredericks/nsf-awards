JOSEPH\r\nINSTITUTION:\t\t\tUNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA  TWIN CITIES \r\n\r\n\"WORKSHOP ON MULTIPHASE TURBULENCE: DUST STORMS, EROSION, HURRICANES AND TORNADOES\"\r\n\r\nThe grant is for partial funding, primarily for the travel and attendance at the \"Workshop on Multiphase Turbulence: Dust Storms, Erosion, Hurricanes and Tornadoes\". The objectives of the workshop are to understand the effects of particles on the modification of turbulence and the effects of turbulence on the transport and fluidization of particles. The grant will support US participation in the workshop to form a collaboration between the University of Minnesota, the key state laboratory of X'ian Jiaotong University, the center for the study of turbulence in the new school of engineering at Peking University and the University of Melbourne, Australia. One goal of this research is to understand the effects of turbulent intensity and particle size, weight and concentration on the problems of dust storms, erosion, hurricanes and tornadoes from systematic and controlled laboratory experiments. Dust storms are an environmental hazard. The colloidal fractions are long lasting and polluting. The proposed experiments, particularly those in turbulent flow in convection cells, are apparently a new way of doing controlled aerosol studies. These experiments are a first phase in a program to establish facts about the multiphase fluid mechanics of particles in geophysical turbulent flows. Our first goal is to establish correlations for the effects of the particles. \r\n\r\nThe topic of this workshop can form a coherent and identifiable topic of scientific and environmental research. This will help form a deep and focused international collaboration on the problems just described and the supported workshop is one facet of this effort.  \r\n\r\nNSF funding will be used primarily to support young researchers to attend the workshop.\r\n\r\n",
