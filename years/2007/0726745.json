 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the Muskegon Scholars project, scholarships are being awarded annually to students majoring in mathematics, geology, chemistry, astronomy, physics, or engineering. Scholarships are available to full-time students in the Associate of Arts and Sciences program. The project is (a) increasing the success of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students through scholarships and other support services; (b) increasing the participation of low-income, academically talented students, including students from underrepresented groups; and (c) assisting students to transfer to four-year institutions or find employment.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The Muskegon Scholars project is ensuring that students perceive skill in science, engineering, and mathematics as necessary to achieve greater career opportunities and success. This is being accomplished through student support mechanisms already available at the college, as well as through a cohort community of scholars. Student success is being enhanced through face-to-face mentoring and an assortment of other student support activities such as job shadowing, internships, and cohort support groups. In addition, students participate in professional activities and receive assistance in transferring to four-year institutions. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The new manufacturing economy of western Michigan demands trained science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals. Through the Muskegon Scholars project, underrepresented students are being recruited from the public schools, the Workforce Development Centers, and through various college outreach programs to pursue education and careers in STEM fields. The project builds upon existing recruitment, support, and career placement activities at the college and integrates new programs to provide a complete infrastructure. After earning an associate degree or completing transfer curriculum, STEM scholars continue their education at one of college''s partner institutions or enter a high-skill, high-wage career. Industry partners provide internship activities and mentoring to students wishing to seek employment upon graduation.",
