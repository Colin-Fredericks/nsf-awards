 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a theoretical model and a numerical program for rationally patterning conducting polymers using a so-called intermediate-layer lithography (ILL) method. Preliminary experimental results, obtained through the support of a nano exploratory research grant, have demonstrated the feasibility of applying the ILL to pattern conducting polymers. On the other hand, a theoretical model, as well as a corresponding numerical program to solve the theoretical model, is needed to address experimental phenomena and direct experimental conduction. Fluorescent particles and quantum dots will be distributed on the substrates to find in-situ deformations of polymer patterns in the ranges of 2.5 microns to 1 millimeter and 50 nanometers to 2.5 microns, respectively. This deformation information will be used to verify and modify the theoretical and numerical models. In addition to conducting polymers, the ILL approach can also be applied to pattern metals as well as other types of polymers. In this sense, it is believed that if successful the ILL will become one of the major non-photolithographic approaches in generating polymer-based micro/nanosystems, and the systematic investigation of the ILL in this project will be a critical move to achieve this goal. \r\n\r\nThe project will contribute to micro/nanotechnology education through new teaching modules, a new course, seminar presentations, and talks and forums at Grambling State University (a neighboring HBCU). This project will also focus on an effort to help K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students visualize micro/nanotechnology concepts, including establishment of a website which will have a database of rich visualization materials. \r\n",
