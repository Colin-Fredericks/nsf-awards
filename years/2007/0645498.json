 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern Nuclear Physics rises to the challenge to understand how the complex\r\nstructure of hadrons and nuclei at low energies emerges from Quantum Chromo\r\nDynamics QCD, the fundamental theory of strong interactions. Effective Field\r\nTheory, the model-independent, systematic description at low energies, has\r\nlead to a vibrant interplay between experiment and theory. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is a better understanding how the internal structure\r\nof nucleons and few-nucleon systems emerges from QCD: The heart of its\r\napproach are model-independent estimates of its theoretical uncertainties\r\nwhich in turn lead to reliable determinations of nuclear binding effects and\r\nfew-nucleon forces. Both encode essential information about QCD. I merge this novel\r\ndescription with well-developed but sophisticated numerical techniques to\r\nextend it into the realm of light nuclei. Besides the intrinsic interest, I\r\nwill investigate few-nucleon reactions which are hard, if not impossible, to measure\r\nbut essential for Astro-Physics (e.g. in big-bang nucleo-synthesis or\r\nsupernovae) and for tests of extensions of the Standard Model of Particle\r\nPhysics. Such an approach is in addition vital to compare and understand\r\nproton and neutron properties with a minimum of theoretical prejudice. I therefore\r\nprovide model-independent parameterisations and predictions in close contact with a\r\nvariety of current and upcoming experiments. One focus is to extract the\r\nnucleon polarisabilities, and in particular the so-far poorly explored\r\nspin-polarisabilities, which contain essential information on the constituents\r\nand spin-structure of the nucleon. \r\n\r\nWith research and teaching inseparable in higher education, I will train\r\nboth undergraduate and graduate students in communication and teaching skills\r\nin a non-traditional format, enabling them to raise the general standard of\r\nscientific literacy. Students will apply the acquired skills in GW courses for\r\nschool teachers and high-school pupils in the DC area, where the\r\nsocio-economic and educational indicators are particularly low.",
