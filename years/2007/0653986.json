 "awd_abstract_narration": "There have been great strides in the development and diverse utilization of hard nanocrystalline and nancomposite coatings in recent years to combat wear in a wide range of tribological applications.  However, the progress has been rather slow in the development of films that are not only ultra-hard and tough but also self-lubricating over broad ranges of temperatures and environments.  Research has focused primarily on nanocomposite adaptive coatings that combine a hard phase that is highly wear resistant embedded with one or more nanocrystalline solid lubricant (SL) phases that provide lubrication in different environments.  The current research project aims at developing a novel technique for the fabrication of adaptive self-lubricating coatings by producing ultra-hard nitride films with highly ordered nanopores that are subsequently filled with reservoirs of SLs.  The advantage of this approach over the 3-dimensional nanocomposite design is that the SLs should be released during contact at a controlled rate to continuously replenish the surfaces and maintain a low friction coefficient while the mechanical integrity of the film is maintained.\r\n\r\nThis program will help advance the manufacture of new nano-textured multi-functional protective coatings for a variety of tribological applications. The new generation of self-lubricating materials will result in higher productivity, greater energy savings, and better environmental compliance for various industries that include manufacturing and tooling, material forming, automotive, aerospace, and nuclear power. The use of SLs is attractive because of environmental and health concerns in addition to the cost of treatment and disposal of liquid lubricants.  Moreover, SLs are the only alternative for high vacuum and space-vacuum environments and food-processing machines.  Educational aspects of the project include enhancing the undergraduate research initiatives and the REU program already implemented at SIUC with an emphasis on recruiting under-represented groups.  This program also aims at providing a K-12 outreach program that includes giving science workshops at various local schools. \r\n\r\n",
