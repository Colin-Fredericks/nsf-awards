 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Robert J. McMahon of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  This research will explore the structure, reactivity, and spectroscopy of carbon-rich molecules in organic chemistry.  Prof. McMahon, his students, and their collaborators, will synthesize new molecules that are highly reactive by virtue of their unusual bonding.  They will determine their spectroscopic properties, elucidate their characteristic thermal and photochemical reactivity, and, search for their existence in flames and in interstellar space.  These studies impact diverse areas of chemical and physical science, including astrochemistry, flames and combustion, and soot formation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research involves the training the next generation of graduate and undergraduate students in the study of complex chemical problems as part of an interdisciplinary research team.  Training in mechanistic organic chemistry also provides a valuable foundation for subsequent careers in industry or academia.  Half of Prof. McMahon's former coworkers are employed in the chemical or pharmaceutical industry, half hold faculty positions in academia and a large number have been women.  Prof. McMahon and his coworkers will continue their engagement in a variety of science education and outreach activities, including the development of research collaborations with minority students and faculty at Howard University, Spelman College, and Xavier University of Louisiana.",
