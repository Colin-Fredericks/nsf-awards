 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering Technology (58)\r\n\r\nThis project links two community colleges and a four-year university in a collaborative practice to design and develop a specific PIC microcontroller training system with custom designed software and curriculum materials for related engineering technology courses.  The functions of the hardware and software cover different areas of engineering technology courses and majors to maximize the use of the system.  This project includes the design and development of the training system with appropriate curriculum (year one) testing and assessment of the effectiveness of the designed digital, microprocessor curriculum package for two-year community college courses (year two).  The evaluation portion of this project is to compare the students' evaluation scores for those who used this training system and students who did not use the system in their microcontroller courses.  A survey of the students and teachers at the end of the semester and external evaluation is used for the assessment of this project.  Sharing of this training system with other institutions will occur at the end of project.  This project is an attempt to improve student learning and overcome obstacles in teaching digital, microprocessor/microcontroller related courses that are delivered through distance learning formats.  Implementing this project provides opportunities to students in rural and urban areas to learn current technology concepts and become prepared to qualify for high-tech jobs.  The institutions involved in this project currently serve diverse, under-represented students in the geographic areas they reach. \r\n",
