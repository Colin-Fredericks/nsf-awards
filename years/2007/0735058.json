 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fraser Stoddart of the University of California Los Angeles is supported by an award from the Division of Chemistry for a workshop to be held at NSF May 13 - 15, 2007 on the topic of Complexity and Emergent Phenomena in Chemistry.  The workshop will bring together approximately 35 participants from a variety of sub-disciplines within Chemistry to discuss the role of complex systems and the emergent phenomena associated with them and the interesting and important implications these systems have for the field of Chemistry.  Among the topics to be discussed are:  the role of complexity in the nature and function of biomolecular systems; self-assembly and supramolecular chemistry; the use of complex systems ideas in designing and synthesizing complex functional materials, possibly leading to new devices; and topics related to determining the best ways to support and encourage work in this field.  The workshop participants will be led by a steering group who have created the agenda, identified the participants and determined the questions which will guide discussion at the workshop.  The results of this discussion will be captured in a report to NSF which will list recommendations for the best way to respond to exciting new advances in this field.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will have a broad impact through its inclusion of members of diverse groups at all levels:  as participants, as steering committee members and at the level of co-chair.  In addition, the report is expected to have a broad impact by delineating ways in which NSF can support this type of research, which is likely to have an impact on a number of fields beyond Chemistry.",
