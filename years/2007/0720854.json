 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nCollections of heterogeneous, network-connected computational devices\r\nhave emerged as a new computational paradigm.  This new network-based\r\nparadigm simplifies constructing flexible and scalable hardware\r\ninfrastructure.  Unfortunately, making such systems robust to failures\r\ncan be difficult.  Many of these distributed software systems contain\r\na large number of devices, and therefore, have a significant chance of\r\nexperiencing a hardware failure.  Developers have to manually develop\r\ncode to allow the software system to recover from such hardware\r\nfailures.  As a result, developing robust distributed software systems\r\nis typically more difficult than robust centralized software systems.\r\n\r\nThis work builds upon the Principal Investigator's prior work on the\r\nBristlecone language for developing robust software systems.  The key\r\ninsight behind the Bristlecone language is that most errors propagate\r\nthrough software systems to cause further damage either by corrupting\r\ndata structures or through the control-flow--induced coupling between\r\nconceptual operations.  Bristlecone programs are architected as a set\r\nof decoupled tasks that are linked through a set of task\r\nspecifications that describe how these decoupled tasks interact and\r\nwhat consistent data structures look like.  Bristlecone then uses\r\nthese specifications to adapt the program's execution in response to\r\nfailures.\r\n\r\nThis project extends the previous work to support distributed software\r\nsystems.  This project develops static analyses to help developers\r\nunderstand how failures in the underlying hardware will affect the\r\nsoftware system and to manage data and tasks so that hardware failures\r\nhave a minimal affect on the computation.\r\n\r\n",
