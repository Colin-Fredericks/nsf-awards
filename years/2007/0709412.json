Prieto\r\nColorado State University\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\n\tThe energy needs for society are rapidly outpacing current technology.  Nanotechnology will have a profound impact in applications for storing and transporting energy.  We propose to integrate our experience in developing new materials with superior physical and electronic properties (Manivannan) and new synthetic methods for the organization of nanoscale materials (Prieto) to fabricate and characterize a novel nanoscale architecture for lithium ion battery technologies.  We will fabricate nanowire arrays of novel electrode materials into a new battery architecture.  Each anodic nanowire will be coated with a polymer electrolyte, then surrounded by the cathode.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe significant advantage of this battery architecture is that the diffusion length for lithium ions between the cathode and anode will be dramatically reduced.  While every aspect of lithium ion batteries will benefit from enhanced materials properties, the intellectual merit of this project is in the synergy between the architecture developed by the PI and the optimized cathode materials developed by the co-PI.  The ultimate goal of this research is a nanoscale lithium ion battery with faster charge and discharge rates and longer lifetime.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\tDramatic improvement in rechargeable batteries will have broad impacts economically.  Furthermore, this is an excellent project for training students because the components are modular - one student is in charge of the cathode, anode, or electrolyte, but then must collaborate to effectively combine them into a functional device.  The PI's will continue to include their cutting-edge research in several undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as actively recruit talented students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
