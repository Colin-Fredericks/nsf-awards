 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate computer education will benefit from this project''s focus on the preparation of students for a computing and technology workplace that is increasingly diverse and trans-disciplinary. This project involves a partnership between Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne), Joliet Junior College (JJC), and Governors State University (GSU). This group will also work with the Chicago metropolitan regional higher education community, computing professionals from across the regional industrial sectors, the research community, and the not-for-profit community. Together they will engage in a process of identifying the relevant knowledge, skills, and other qualities required for computing professionals in the Chicago metropolitan region as well as project future needs and trends. The major goals of the project are: 1) establish partnerships and leaderships in the CISE community in the Chicago metropolitan region that focus on transforming computing education, 2) build an innovative, trans-disciplinary model for undergraduate computing education, 3) create student learning experiences especially accessible for the adult learner.\r\n\r\nAs a model for developing undergraduate computing education, the outcomes of this project may define a new focus on preparation for the diverse computing and technology workplace. This project pursues better preparation for computing careers by defining curricula that provide opportunities to develop an understanding of application domains from industrial experience, perhaps incorporating an application domain focus into courses, workshops, student practicum, and new types of student learning experiences. This ?demand driven? strategy focuses on the requirements for success as a computing professional. The CBTeams will create a cadre of CISE faculty and students both within specific industry sectors and across application domains. \r\n\r\nThe model of a regional CISE community recruited from higher education, research and industry sectors can be replicated in other metropolitan regions. The findings of the CBTeams will be relevant to other metropolitan regions and the new designs for student learning experiences are suitable for adoption by other colleges and universities.",
