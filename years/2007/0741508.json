 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, NUE: Preparing Undergraduates for Careers in Nanotechnology, at the University of Central Florida (UCF), under the direction of Dr. Hyoung Jin Cho, will develop three layers of teaching modules with the goal of preparing undergraduate students for future nanotechnology careers: (a) nano in everyday, to disentangle nanotechnology surrounding one's daily life (b) nano showroom, to provide students museum and immersion experiences into nanotechnology and (c) nano hands-on, to equip students with practical skills and further engage them into higher education. This NUE program will give students an opportunity to learn economic, societal and legal impacts and procedures involved in rapidly growing nanoscience and nanotechnology. These modules will be adopted into both traditional and nano track courses at UCF.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering Program Solicitation (NSF 07-554), and is being funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).",
