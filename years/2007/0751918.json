 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will support acquisition of a high performance computing (HPC) facility for faculty and undergraduate student geoscience research at Angelo State University (ASU).   A 16 CPU compute cluster will support faculty and student research on seismic wave propagation through heterogeneous materials and will be used to process large seismic data sets collected from field active- and passive-source seismic recorder deployments for crustal and upper mantle imaging.  The PI will develop fully three-dimensional models of seismic wave propagation.   The cluster will support undergraduate student research in physics, geophysics, applied physics, applied mathematics, and geology and would enhance research opportunities and collaborations with other departments at ASU, such as agriculture, biology, computer science and mathematics.  ASU is a Hispanic serving institution.  The compute cluster will expose underrepresented students to computational research and in so doing, help them to develop marketable skills.",
