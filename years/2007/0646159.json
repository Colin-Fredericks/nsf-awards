 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore the sources and fates of organic matter as it travels from source to sink in the Waipaoa Rivers system in New Zealand. Because the organic matter content, age, and isotopic character are influenced by sediment transport processes and rates, this information provides valuable insight into the movement of sediment through the system. The project will provide an independent view on sediment fluxes and residence times in various environments from the sediment source to offshore depocenters. A large fraction of the terrestrial organic matter delivered to the sea comes from small rivers on active continental margins and studies of this subject are sparse. This type of study was identified as important by a MARGINS program review committee. The S2S initiative with MARGINS program offers an appropriate venue to conduct such research in a holistic manner.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve graduate and undergraduate students. It also involves substantial international cooperation with New Zealand scientists. The study will use and develop biogeochemical tools to assess the transport and burial of organic matter in a source to sink system. The study of storage and burial of organic carbon is of importance to understanding regional and global carbon cycling and will impact other climate, sea-level and sediment transport studies\r\n",
