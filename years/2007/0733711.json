 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert Noyce Scholarships are being given at Clemson University to recruit career changers from STEM disciplines and recent graduates from STEM majors into a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program that includes initial teacher certification for Middle Grades Education.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The administrative team for this program consists of a mathematics educator, a science educator, and the Coordinator of the MAT program. For each of four years, 10 participants are being recruited from industry, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as well as Clemson University to participate in the Noyce Scholarship Program. Each participant receives a $10,000 scholarship. The Clemson MAT program has partnered with a nationally renowned program, Call Me MISTER (Men Instructing Students Towards Effective Role Models) (CMM), that is placing African-American males in elementary classrooms in South Carolina. The established relationship with CMM is another vehicle to recruit new teachers from underrepresented populations to careers as mathematics and science teachers.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The emphasis of teacher education at Clemson University is not only standards-based, but also inquiry-based education. By increasing the number of mathematics and science teachers from underrepresented groups, this program is increasing the number of positive role models for many middle school students.",
