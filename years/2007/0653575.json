The activity has been and\r\nremains a resource for the theoretical atomic, molecular and optical physics community\r\nsince 1988. The ITAMP has a world wide, competitive postdoctoral program, supports\r\nlong and short term visitors and runs a number of workshops in forefront problems in\r\nAMO physics. ITAMP postdoctoral fellows have been the major source of junior faculty\r\npositions in theoretical AMO physics for the past ten years and have led to two senior\r\nappointments to Harvard physics and chemistry departments where these individuals\r\ncan train some of the best and brightest students in AMO theory in the US.",
