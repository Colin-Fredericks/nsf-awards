 "awd_abstract_narration": "In March 2008, the Mathematics Department of the University of Florida will conduct a conference\r\non Partitions, q-series and modular forms, which will include in it a Student Workshop.\r\nThis conference is one of the highlights of a year long program on Algebra, Number Theory, and Combinatorics in 2007-08. The conference will bring together number theorists and combinatorialists\r\nto share and learn new methods and results. An important aim of the conference is to\r\ninvolve graduate students and advanced undergraduates. The Workshop in the first part is to prepare students for the Research Conference to follow.\r\nThe theory of partitions and q-series is a central area of number theory having interactions\r\nwith combinatorics, analysis, the theory of modular forms, computer algebra, and physics. It\r\nis an area where the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan has made spectacular\r\ncontributions. Topics covered in the conference will include Rogers-Ramanujan type identities,\r\nelliptic hypergeometric functions, partition congruences, modular forms and mock theta functions.\r\nA special feature of the research conference will be a series of lectures by Ken Ono on\r\nrecent pathbreaking work connecting mock theta functions and modular forms.\r\nThe three conference organizers from the University of Florida - Alexander Berkovich, Frank\r\nGarvan, and the PI - form one the major groups the theory of partitions, q-series, and modular\r\nforms, and the mathematics of Ramanujan. The strength of their program has been enhanced\r\nby association and collaboration with George Andrews, the premier authority on partitions and\r\nRamanujan's work. This conference builds on several successful programs conducted previously\r\nby the number theorists at the University of Florida.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
