 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and colleagues will organize the meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability.  This involves the organizing of an application process, selecting conference attendees from the applicant pool, arranging senior speakers and panelists, coordinating talks and poster sessions, creating and hosting the conference website, and a number of other administrative tasks (e.g. advertising the conference through professional bulletins and statistical journals, arranging the conference center, accommodation and food at the time of the conference, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the New Researchers' Conference (NRC) is to provide a much needed venue for interaction among new researchers in Statistics and Probability (i.e. recipients of doctoral degrees within the last five years) at an important developmental stage in their careers.  At present, researchers develop contacts with others in their field either through their own institutions or at meetings of professional societies. Junior researchers often have limited contact with senior colleagues, even at their own institutions.  Meetings of professional societies are rather large and junior researchers often find them overwhelming.  In contrast with large meetings, this conference will be restricted in size, with a target of 70-80 participants.  Sessions will be followed by discussions and breaks to facilitate interactions. The NRC provides a unique opportunity for junior researchers to exchange ideas and initiate contacts amongst themselves as well as provide them an enhanced opportunity to interact with the invited senior researchers, through invited lectures and panel discussions on funding opportunities, journal publications, teaching and research. The relationships established in this informal collegiate setting among junior researchers often are ones that may last for the rest of their professional careers.\r\n",
