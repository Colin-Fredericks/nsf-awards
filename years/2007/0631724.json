 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissemination project seeks to expand the participation of girls and women in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science education by implementing a broad, national public engagement campaign to disseminate The Gender Chip Project. The goal is to advance discovery and understanding about the way that girls and women access STEM educational opportunities and careers. The Gender Chip Project is a multi-platform program which includes, a one-hour film documentary and companion set of enrichment materials designed to deepen discussion and inquiry, while also offering further experiential activities for youth interested in STEM. The overall program, which builds upon the documentary as a foundation, features targeted classroom curricula, a comprehensive action workshop toolkit, and an evolving web site that aggregates research findings, best practices, professional development activities and evaluation instruments.\r\n\r\nWorkshops, training and presentations will reach more than forty institutions and organizations, both large and small, spanning the country. It will engage more than 6,000 individuals throughout these sectors: (1) middle and high school teachers and counselors; (2) college and university faculty and administrators; (3) after-school and organizational nonprofit program staff; (4) professional development associations; (5) corporate personnel; (6) local, regional and national gender equity and STEM-related conference attendees.\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT-- The Gender Chip Project is a vehicle to advance discovery, understanding and action about the way girls and young women access STEM and computer technology educational opportunities and careers. The documentary and materials have been designed to stimulate dialogue, inquiry and action, especially among groups underrepresented in STEM careers. The documentary, web site, workshop and curricula materials have been developed in collaboration with leaders in STEM and gender equity research and education to provide the materials, training and support for adults who serve and mentor girls.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT-- By deepening current partnerships and reaching out to regional and national organizations, and recognized leaders, programs, and other NSF grantees working in this area, this dissemination project will contribute critically needed resources and training opportunities for a variety of groups and individuals across the country who have a direct and indirect impact on young women's decisions about whether or not to pursue, and stay with STEM careers. The Gender Chip Project takes the theme of \"how do women realistically begin to participate in wider STEM arenas as they prepare for adulthood and careers\" to a broader and deeper level of discussion and action. By disseminating the film and all its companion materials throughout a variety of platforms -- from live interactions to materials always available online, the Gender Chip Project will significantly support and encourage key STEM educators and mentors making a difference in young women's lives and professional choices.",
