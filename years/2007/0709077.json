The research involves understanding and testing theories of how these three aspects of human-robot interaction independently and interactively affect collaborative work and investigating how assistive robots can be designed best to aid people in domains such as health and aging. Designed to motivate and test theories, the work studies \r\n.\tFundamental laboratory research on behavioral characteristics of robots performing social tasks, especially as these characteristics reflect likeness;\r\n.\tControlled experiments and field studies of interpersonal communication and development of mutual understanding between robot and human, and\r\n.\tRobots in work groups.\r\nAiming to better understand the societal impact of robots, a multidisciplinary team (robotics, computer science, social psychology, engineering, organization science, design) draws from and builds on basic research in cognitive and social psychology, and on recent research in robotics, computer graphics, and design. The team seeks a foundation for understanding and designing collaborative work with robots in critical environments like mines, hospitals, households with elderly or disabled residents, in challenging scientific settings and in situations in which the robot is remote.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This development contributes to public and student awareness of the human side of robotics. A life-size robot will be taken to school for educational purposes.\r\n",
