 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program of the Atmospheric Sciences Division of the Geosciences Directorate, Prof. Amitabha Sinha of the University of California - San Diego and his graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will study the intramolecular dynamics of gas-phase organic peroxide species, which have been excited to highly-excited vibrational overtone levels.  The goals of these studies are to develop a firmer understanding of how energy flows in these atmospherically important molecules, and to gain a better understanding of what these molecules' fates are in the atmosphere, after they absorb solar radiation.\r\n\r\nOrganic peroxide molecules fall apart in the earth's atmosphere to give reactive HOx species that contribute to the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere.  These species play important roles in the removal of pollutants.  A better understanding of the photochemistry of peroxides in the atmosphere will lead to better computer models.   In addition to the broader scientific impacts of these studies on chemical physics and atmospheric chemistry, Prof. Sinha will continue to provide valuable educational opportunities for his research students through his extensive collaborations with other research groups (e.g. Prof. Joseph Francisco's theory group at Purdue University.)\r\n",
