The expert panel will include the fields of science classification structure underlying the National Science Foundation?s Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS) Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development in this review. The panel will reach out to senior officials of federal agencies that provide the federal funds data and key data users, as well as solicit advice from providers of complementary and competing data sources. The panel will review past studies on Federal funds data, identify common requirements and consider new data elements and fields that could be useful to collect. The panel?s investigation will be facilitated by the conduct of a workshop. A final report with recommendations on modernizing the infrastructure of the survey will be the primary product of the study.\r\n\r\n",
