 "awd_abstract_narration": "For several years now, the University of Utah has run two-week intensive summer\r\nminicourses in which some aspect of modern mathematics was taught to visiting\r\nmathematics graduate students and postdocs. In June 2007, the minicourse will be on\r\nmathematics and string theory, topics relevant to recent physics. The Co-PIs together\r\nwith Eric Sharpe (a physicist at Utah U) expect this to be an important opportunity for\r\nyoung physicists as well as mathematicians. Money to support visiting mathematics\r\nstudents already exists (through the University of Utahs VIGRE grant, and potentially\r\nthrough additional MSRI support). This proposal requests support to reimburse lodging\r\nand travel for five visiting young physicists. The minicourse will be immediately followed\r\nby an AMS Summer Research Conference to be held at Snowbird, Utah, again\r\norganized by the Co-PIs and Eric Sharpe. This research workshop will be held on the\r\nsame topics as the minicourse, and like the minicourse primary funding already exists.\r\nThe physicists who attend the minicourse will also be able to attend the workshop The\r\nintellectual merit of this subject is justified by the current activity in both the mathematics\r\nand physics communities. Some research results may come directly out of this summer\r\nminicourse, as attendees apply what they have learned. The impact of the minicourse\r\nwill be broadened by bringing the physicists and mathematicians together, to help them\r\nform good interdisciplinary contacts that will serve them well in future years.\r\nFurthermore, the Co-PIs plan to videotape the lectures and make them available on the\r\nweb, so that non-attendees can also benefit, further broadening the impact of this\r\nsummer minicourse. Efforts will be made to encourage participation of women and\r\nunderrepresented minorities.\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nDiary Note\r\nProposal:0652421 PI Name:Lee, Yuan-Pin\r\nPrinted",
