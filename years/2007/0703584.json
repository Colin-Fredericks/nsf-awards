 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas (UT) System Alliance requests a five-year continuation of funding for its fourth and final phase of the National Science Foundation Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program. The members of the UT System Alliance are UT Arlington, UT Austin, UT Brownsville, UT Dallas, UT El Paso, UT Pan American, UT Permian Basin, UT San Antonio, UT Tyler, Tarrant County Community College, Collin County Community College, El Paso Community College, Howard College, Midland College, Odessa College and San Antonio College.\r\nThe Alliance's activities for this phase are to continue support for current NSF LSAMP undergraduate researchers; provide research support for new undergraduates and faculty mentors in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines; host a summer academy for students to do research at other UT System Alliance partnering schools; introduce an international research component with the Fulbright Exchange Program; and enhance an infrastructure that enriches students' experiences and professional development, creating opportunities for broad interaction and mentoring among Alliance partners, STEM faculty, undergraduate, master's, and doctoral-level students.\r\nUsing 2000 UT System data as baseline, the Alliance is setting the following new overarching goals for 2015: 1) at least double STEM enrollment and baccalaureate degrees awarded to under-represented minority students; and 2) at least double STEM enrollment and master degrees awarded to under-represented minority students. The proposed project advances knowledge and understanding of the dynamics involved in a State-wide URM student retention effort. The PI, co-PI and campus coordinators have ample experience to conduct the project. In recent years, the PI and co-PI joined efforts in the development of a program aimed at increasing the retention and success of first year STEM student and have published their work. The PI also directed an undergraduate research program that supported a large number of STEM majors, and reported a high graduation rates. The fundamental research questions that the PI and team of collaborators investigate are: 1) to what extent can a focused system-wide effort influence the success of students that share a common profile (generally low income, largely under-prepared, first-generation college bound)? 2) What are the factors involved in changing the culture of a higher education school system so that it embraces undergraduate research and promotes its replication The proposed activities in the project activity promote discovery and understanding in STEM disciplines by directly promoting and supporting the training of undergraduate students and graduate students by their faculty mentors. The proposed activities explicitly broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (Hispanics, African-American, Native American, Women). Results will be disseminated broadly to enhance understanding of the issues of underrepresented STEM student retention and success. The most important benefit of this project is that it will enable long-term systemic change in the STEM workforce of the 21st century.\r\n",
