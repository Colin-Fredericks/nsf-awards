 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graduate student Penelope K. Morrison, under the guidance of Dr. Kathleen M. DeWalt, will undertake research on the lives and culture of street youth in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, how they are perceived by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and how those perceptions affect the efficacy of NGO methods of service interventions.  Recent social science research has revealed that street youth often do not always conform to stereotypes that they are dysfunctional, destitute, homeless, and out of touch with their families. Neverthless, NGO workers may believe in the stereotypes. The researcher will investigate both sides of this interaction by studying the street youth and the NGOs that serve them.\r\n\r\nThe researcher will undertake twelve months of field research in Rio de Janeiro. She will employ qualitative research methods, including unstructured and semi-structured interviewing, as well as participant observation, with a comparative sample of the NGOs and with a sample of the street youth, their families, and their peers. \r\n\r\nThe research is important because one of the key areas that NGOs provide services for is HIV/AIDS. Much remains unknown about the activities that put these youth at risk for contracting these diseases. Therefore, NGOs need to have accurate understandings of youth life and culture in order to provide appropriate services. The research also will contribute to a growing cross-cultural, social science literature on children and childhood. In addition, it will contribute to the education of a social scientist.",
