 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) and Mathematical Sciences (21). To invigorate courses in discrete mathematics and computer science, this project is developing modular course materials based on primary historical sources that highlight or illuminate the discovery of certain concepts underlying finite mathematics and algorithmic thought. An initial set of twenty to twenty-five historical projects ranging from a beginning to an advanced undergraduate level comprise an interdisciplinary resource guide for use in a variety of mathematics and computer science courses. A web-based version is also available as an online resource. A network of faculty at a diverse set of institutions is classroom testing the material, with testers also signing on to create their own modules to contribute to the main resource guide. The intellectual merit of the proposal lies in providing motivation, perspective, and direction to these courses in finite mathematics, combinatorics, algorithm design, data structures, logic, abstract algebra, and automata theory via an examination of primary historical sources that compelled the development of these subjects. The broader impacts of the proposal include: external site testing at a diverse collection of institutions, from community colleges to four-year liberal arts colleges to large public universities; the development of faculty expertise in the use of historical projects; and the education of pre-service teachers in mathematics with projects. The two lead institutions also have a significant Hispanic student enrollment, which further increases the project's potential for broader impacts.",
