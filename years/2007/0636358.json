 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates in an interdisciplinary program that integrates modeling, analysis, and computations with contemporary experimental research.  Scientifically, the overarching theme is large multi-scale nonlinear systems and the mathematical and numerical methods needed to analyze them.  We are interested in applications that are highly nonlinear, noisy, have a large number of components, and evolve over an extensive range of spatial and temporal scales.  The models are physically realistic but are so difficult that direct numerical simulations are not able to faithfully reproduce the processes they are intended to describe.  Our research objective is to provide a more in-depth analysis, and this invariably involves integrating modeling, computations, and analysis with contemporary experimental research.\r\n\r\nThe core of our program is mentored participation of students and postdocs in an interdisciplinary research team.  At the same time, the activities we will develop will reach a wide audience and combine research, mentoring, and broad education experiences.  Specific examples are Applied Math Days and mini-symposia.  Also included in this effort will be innovative curricular changes that will provide mentored transitions that will both increase the number of students interested in, and prepared for, graduate school in mathematics and which will also prepare our graduate students and postdoctoral associates for careers in academia or industry.  In addition we will develop innovative recruitment and retention components, as well as careful management and assessment of the program.",
