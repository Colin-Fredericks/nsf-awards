Two replacement units of about 4-5 lessons each, one unit on geometry and one on measurement, will be developed, field tested, and revised by a collaborative, cross-disciplinary team (including teachers) and published by Kendal-Hunt. Curricular materials, available in both English and Spanish, will focus on promising discourses of hands-on inquiry of rich problem-situations, presented in real-world and/or scientific contexts, and while utilizing technology. These units will be accompanied with professional development guides and materials for use by trainers of elementary mathematics teachers to promote mathematics content and pedagogical knowledge that teachers need to implement the units with fidelity. Annual professional development models will consist of a one-week summer institute followed by three one-day workshops during the academic year and through a weekly visit to the classroom of field-test teachers. Field-testing will be conducted in 14 classrooms in three different states (CT, KY, and TX), including research, by an external evaluator, about the impact of the materials on student outcomes and on teacher perspectives and practices. Dissemination will include publication of student materials in print and on the web, as well as newsletters and family nights/meals to actively engage parents in their children's math learning.",

Studies investigating the Project M3 curriculum found statistically significant gains on open-response, criterion-referenced and standardized mathematics tests for students studying this curriculum.\n\nThere are a total of 6 units, one each of geometry and measurement at each of grades K, 1 and 2.

A team of national experts in mathematics education, gifted education, and early childhood education wrote these units.  The curriculum is challenging and is differentiated to accommodate a range of students\u00c6 abilities, interests, and prior experiences.  Each unit was first pilot tested, revised and then field tested in 12 classrooms in urban and suburban schools across the country.
