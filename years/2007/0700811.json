 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators study asymptotic invariants of groups. The topics include:\r\nconstructing finitely presented groups with \"transcendental\" properties (infinite\r\ntorsion and with Kazhdan property (T) ), residual properties and linearity of\r\nhyperbolic groups, groups with irregular or small Dehn functions and other filling\r\nfunctions of groups, asymptotic cones of finitely presented groups, and asymptotic\r\ninvariants of embeddings into Hilbert spaces (Hilbert space compressions of groups).\r\nThese topics are intimately related. For example, Higman embeddings and S-machines \r\nare used to construct finitely presented torsion groups, in the study of Dehn functions,\r\nand in the study of residual properties of hyperbolic groups. The investigators propose\r\nto organize several group theory conferences and attract students to their area of\r\nmathematics. They are also going to give several courses on the topic of the proposal.\r\n \r\nIt is a well known point of view after Klein, Hilbert, Einstein and Weil that fundamental\r\nlaws describe symmetries occuring in the nature. The symmetry of an object can be \r\nmeasured by the group corresponding to the object. Groups can be difined either as \r\ngroups of symmetries or abstractly by an algorithmic description (generators and\r\nrelations). In the second approach, the investigators choose some basic symmetries\r\n(generators) so that all other symmetries are compositions (words) of the basic ones,\r\nand describe certain relations between the basic symmetries such that all other\r\nrelations follow from the chosen ones. The geometry of groups given by such\r\npresentations is described in terms of certain asymptotic invariants. The invariants\r\nhave been known since the pioneering works of M.Dehn at the beginning of the 20th\r\ncentury, but the investigators discovered deep relationship between these invariants\r\nand algorithmic problems. The investigators are developing their geometric method\r\nsolving old mathematical problems of algorithmic nature and corresponding algebraic\r\nproblems about groups.\r\n",
