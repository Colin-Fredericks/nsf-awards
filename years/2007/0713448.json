 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous approaches to statistical machine translation (SMT) have\r\nemployed phrase-based models which represent phrases as sequences of\r\nfully-inflected words, and are otherwise devoid of linguistic\r\ndetail.  Such approaches are unable to generalize and essentially\r\nrely on memorizing the translations of words and phrases that are\r\nobserved in training data.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to improve the quality of SMT through the\r\nintroduction of more sophisticated models which represent phrases\r\nusing multiple levels of information.  This can include basic\r\nlinguistic information such as part of speech, lemmas, and agreement\r\ninformation (case, number, person), as well as more sophisticated\r\nlinguistic detail including semantic classes, argument structure,\r\nco-reference, phrase boundaries, and information propagated from\r\nsyntactic heads.\r\n\r\nBy annotating all data with this information and extending models\r\nappropriately, there is the potential to learn much more from\r\ntraining than was possible under previous approaches.  There is now\r\nthe potential to learn translations of unseen words if other forms of\r\nthe words occur; it is now possible to learn general facts about a language's\r\nword order; it is now feasible to use linguistic context to generate\r\ngrammatical output. Such generalization has the potential to result\r\nin much higher quality translation, especially for languages that\r\nonly have small amounts of training data.  It therefore represents a\r\nsignificant advance over previous approaches to SMT.\r\n\r\nMulti-level models have the potential for wide-ranging impact on\r\nall language technologies.  Simultaneous modeling of different\r\nlevels of representation is an extremely useful and natural way of\r\ndescribing language.  This project is developing a general framework\r\nfor the creation of multi-level probabilistic models of language and\r\ntranslation, and exploring its application to tasks beyond\r\ntranslation including generation, paraphrasing, and the automatic\r\nevaluation of natural language technologies.\r\n",
