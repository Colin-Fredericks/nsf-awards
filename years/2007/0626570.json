 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for renovation of the Martin Field Station building, an existing 6,000 sq.ft structure at the Bath Nature Preserve, a relatively new field station operated by the University of Akron in cooperation with the Bath (Ohio) Township.  As the result of an NSF supported planning effort, the University has leased the Martin building, formerly a private residence, which has  sufficient space to greatly facilitate teaching, research, and outreach at the site. To realize this potential, part of the facility will be remodeled for teaching and research lab use, and basic services, including plumbing and electrical supply, will be modernized to a level consistent with the planned usage.  The improvements supported by the award will also provide improved safety, access, and communications at the station. Since its establishment in 1998, educational and research activities at the Field Station have increased rapidly. The combination of its urban location (midway between Akron and Cleveland, in Northeastern Ohio), and the high quality and diversity of the land make this an excellent site in which to study the rapidly disappearing natural habitats of the region. The preserve is used by a number of educational institutions in the region for education, research and training activities at levels extending from K through postgraduate levels. Currently, there are 14 funded research projects and several long-term studies including amphibian monitoring and wetland restoration being conducted at the station. Education and outreach activities include over 24 courses, an active outreach to K-12 schools and the general community, and an emphasis on connecting students and the public with current research at the station. Located within twenty minute's drive of The University of Akron, the Bath Field Station allows grade school, high school, and University students from an urban area to experience natural environments. The station has already permitted a number of institutions to enrich the environmentally-oriented curricula of University programs that are not traditional users of field stations, such as law, art, literature, sociology, and engineering. The station has promoted a vigorous program of outreach to K-12 students, including participation in NSF GK-12 program.",
