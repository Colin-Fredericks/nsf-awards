 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-day conference for undergraduate women in physics that focuses on the critical transition from undergraduate to graduate study. On January 19-20, 2008, the University of Michigan, the University of Southern California (USC) and Yale University will each host a Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWP). The unifying aim of the three conferences is to encourage young women to apply to graduate school by providing a stimulating and supportive venue for them to learn about the exciting possibilities presented by advanced careers in physics. Towards this goal, the conference objectives are that participants leave with:\r\n. Increased awareness of current research and career options in physics.\r\n. Greater familiarity with the graduate school experience.\r\n. Resources for applying to and being successful in graduate school as well as\r\ngeneral resources for women in physics.\r\n. A network of women in physics.\r\nThe two-day event will bring together female undergraduate students in physics from\r\nacross the US to learn about current research and career opportunities in physics, the\r\ngraduate school application process and experience, and resources for women in physics.\r\nWomen attending the conferences will have the opportunity to present original research,\r\ndiscuss physics topics with other students, and meet other successful women with more advanced careers in physics.",
