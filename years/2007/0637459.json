Her work will be comprised of a series of Antarctic-inspired, large sculptural installations that seek to instill a sense of wonder at the beauty of the region, while bringing to light the potential for instability in the Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem. The Frozen Field project also aims to further Antarctic understanding by providing wondrous views of the continent's life. She will achieve these goals by making the less familiar life forms (krill, moss, algae) the subject of her study. The resulting art will not only have a message of conservation, but will also capture the audience's imagination through the creative depiction and presentation of the region's life. The project will aim to reproduce unfamiliar Antarctic phenomena, reminding the gallery audience that for most, the continent is still very much a terra incognita.
