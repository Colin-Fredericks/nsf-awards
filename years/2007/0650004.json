ABARJI\r\nINSTITUTION:\t\t\t\tUNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO \r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO: WORKSHOP \"TURBULENT MIXING AND BEYOND\": 2007, THE INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR THEORETICAL PHYSICS, TRIESTE, ITALY\r\n\r\nThe grant is for partial funding, especially for young investigators to attend the workshop \"Turbulent mixing and beyond\" at the International Center for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy 18-26 August 2007. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the workshop is to expose accelerated turbulent mixing to a wide scientific community, to promote the development of new ideas in tackling the fundamental aspects of the problem, to assist in application of novel approaches in a broad range of phenomena, and to have a potential impact on technology. The workshop will provide a unique opportunity to bring together scientists from the areas, which include but not limited to applied mathematics, fluid dynamics, turbulence and combustion, high energy density physics, plasmas, astrophysics, geophysics, material science, etc, and to have their attention focused on the long-standing problem of the turbulent mixing. Accelerated turbulent mixing plays a key role in a wide variety of phenomena, ranging from astrophysical to nano-scales, under either high or low energy density conditions. Supernovae and accretion disks, stellar non-Boussinesq and magneto-convection, planetary interiors and mantle-lithosphere tectonics, inertial confinement and magnetic fusion, heavy ions, laser-material interaction and non-equilibrium heat transfer, properties of materials under high strain rates, strong shocks, explosions, premixed and non-premixed combustion, oceanography, atmospheric flows, accelerated boundary layers, formation of sprays are a few examples to list.\r\n\r\nNSF funding will be used primarily to support young researchers to attend the workshop.\r\n\r\n",
