Littman, Rutgers University\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on several aspects of automated feature discovery in the context of reinforcement learning. Badly chosen features cause reinforcement-learning algorithms to fail and, as such, only individuals skilled in feature construction can create successful reinforcement-learning systems for novel tasks. This issue underscores two shortcomings in existing research. First, most existing reinforcement-learning methods cannot generate or discover features automatically and robustly. Second, existing benchmark problems and paradigms for benchmarking do not distinguish adequately between clever algorithm design and clever feature engineering.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses these challenges in two-pronged approach. The first prong aims to advance a technical agenda leading to a new approach to feature discovery and model representation. The second prong is the development of a benchmark methodology and repository with a different focus and structure from existing endeavors. The goal for the benchmarking effort will be to produce a set of fair and reproducible experiments that will help elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches, while simultaneously introducing challenges to motivate the development of new approaches.\r\n\r\n",

Although many different kinds of these machine-learning algorithms have been developed, the critical element for successfully applying this technology to real-world problems is finding the right set of \"features\"---vectors of numeric attributes that describe the examples in a form machines can manipulate.\n\nThe purpose of this project was to explore the problem of automatically identifying promising features for reinforcement-learning problems.  Reinforcement learning is the task of forecasting the success of possible behaviors in sequential decision problems.  For example, consider the problem of learning to play a game like backgammon.  It is easy to learn to recognize legal moves, but a good player is one who can predict which of the immediately reachable board positions is most beneficial in the long run.

The funding helped support the development of a new introductory computer science class called \"Great Insights in Computer Science\".

The goal of this work has been to envision a future in which most people are familiar enough with programming that they can command their household appliances using their own simple algorithms.
