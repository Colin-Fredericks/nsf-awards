 "awd_abstract_narration": "SGER: Carbon Nanomaterial Translocation and Transfer\r\n\r\nOver the past four years the PI has studied the binding of RNA and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and first demonstrated RNA delivery by SWNTs. The PI has invented the use of lysophospholipids as a remarkably efficient method for solubilizing SWNTs.\r\nUsing molecular dynamics simulations and transmission electron microscopy the PI and his team have unraveled that the binding of lysophospholipids to an SWNT as predominantly aligned along the tube axis. The PI and his collaborators have also discovered the in vivo modification of lipid-coated SWNTs by aquatic model system Daphnia magna. Towards obtaining a mechanistic understanding of nanotoxicity, the PI and his collaborators have simulated the ready uptake of fullerene C60 and the minimal translocation of fullerene derivative C60(OH)20 across a DPPC bilayer. These pioneering studies have examined carbon nanomaterials in biological and environmental systems and have facilitated the following three objectives of this proposal.  1) Understand the binding mode of fullerene C70 and phenol gallic acid for biocompatibility.   2) Detect the cellular translocation of C70-gallic acid in real time.   3) Investigate the transfer of carbon nanomaterials in the food chain.\r\n",
