 "awd_abstract_narration": "Florida A&M University proposes to serve as the institutional host-site for the\r\nFlorida - Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP) during\r\nPhase IV program operations. FGLSAMP is designed to promote and facilitate the\r\nprogrammatic goals of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) LSAMP program under\r\nthe HRD Directorate. In accordance with the goals, objectives and effort of NSF to\r\naddress the low participation and degree production within science, technology,\r\nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) by those ethnic groups identified as\r\nunderrepresented in STEM disciplines, FGLSAMP will address this problem through its\r\nprogrammatic structure which promotes enhancement of academic performance,\r\nundergraduate research experiences, professional development, and preparation for\r\npursuing STEM graduate degrees. The standard of success will be measured by our\r\nstudent participants': progression (to attain the B.S. degree); retention (within STEM\r\ndisciplines); graduation (timely attainment); and STEM graduate enrollment\r\n(increasing STEM Minority enrollment). FGLSAMP will continue to employ a holistic\r\napproach to reform undergraduate education in the STEM disciplines along with\r\nidentified \"beast practices\" as determined through it Steering Committee, while\r\ndetermining means to enhance and provide new program activities. FGLSAMP is\r\ndesigned to include a firm commitment of institutional administrators, faculty, staff,\r\nexternal partners, as well as parents and students.\r\nThe goals of FGLSAMP are to significantly increase both the number of\r\nunderrepresented minorities pursuing undergraduate degrees in STEM disciplines and the\r\nnumber of STEM B.S. degree recipients pursuing STEM graduate degrees. FGLSAMP\r\nwill provide training opportunities to students in STEM disciplines while also providing\r\nan array of academic performance enhancement and support that will yield greater STEM\r\nretention and graduations rates among underrepresented STEM minorities. Additionally,\r\nto address the numbers of STEM B.S. recipients pursuing STEM graduate degrees,\r\nFGLSAMP has developed a formalize program component to prepare its undergraduate\r\nparticipants to pursue graduate degrees. This will be accomplished through an intensive\r\nprogrammatic design that has been accepted and adopted by the FGLSAMP Steering\r\nCommittee. FGLSAMP will continue provide assistance for undergraduate research\r\nexperiences that will include the introduction of international research opportunities for\r\nstudent participants. FGLSAMP will also continue to build and strengthen ties and\r\ninclusion of community colleges by the inclusion of 2 new associate level partners within\r\nthe alliance. Community Colleges are a valuable source of human capital to enter the\r\nSTEM academic pipeline.\r\nFGLSAMP program operations will be met through annual financial support from the\r\nNational Science Foundation, a special appropriation from the State of Florida.\r\nThrough the addition of two additional community colleges, FGLSAMP will be\r\nable to: 1) stimulate and increase student awareness of academic and professional\r\nopportunities in STEM areas and 2) create a larger network/pipeline between the\r\ncommunity college students and FGLSAMP undergraduate institutions with which these\r\ntwo community colleges are affiliated. FGLSAMP will also capitalize and capture\r\ngreater numbers of potential STEM majors prior to graduation and transfer to the upper\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
