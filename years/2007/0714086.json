 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  research project is focused  on a broad range of questions concerning \r\nalgebraic stacks and their applications.  The project is divided into two \r\nparts.  The first part concerns foundational problems  which have arisen \r\nin recent important applications of stacks such as the geometric \r\nLangland's program, the theory of moduli of stable maps, and the \r\nconstruction of moduli spaces for higher dimensional varieties.  The \r\nsecond part of the program concerns applications of the theory.  In \r\nparticular new applications of the relationship between log geometry in \r\nthe sense of Fontaine and Illusie and stacks discovered by the PI in \r\nearlier work, generalizations of the theory of twisted stable maps, as \r\nwell as applications to the construction and study of moduli spaces for \r\nvarieties of general type, abelian varieties, and vector bundles on \r\ncurves.\r\n\r\nThe notion of stack is a tool used to deal with internal symmetries of \r\nmathematical objects, as well as actions of groups.  For example, when \r\ntrying to classify geometric objects one is naturally forced to deal with \r\nthe symmetries of the objects in question. In recent years, the theory of \r\nstacks has come to play an important role in almost every part of \r\nalgebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, and mathematical physics and a \r\ngreat number of exciting new applications of stacks have been found. This \r\nis not surprising considering the importance of symmetries in mathematics \r\nand other fields of science. This great interest in stacks has brought to \r\nlight a number of important problems about stacks. The research project \r\naims to broaden  our understanding of both the foundational aspects of the \r\ntheory of stacks and as well as the many applications.\r\n",
