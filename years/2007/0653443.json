 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a number of projects related to computer simulation of binary black holes, the gravitational waves they produce, and the interface of these waveforms with LIGO data analysis. Projects include modeling binary black hole systems of unequal-mass, spinning and eccentric binaries, providing waveforms including assessments of their quality based on measures used in gravitational-wave data analysis, providing crucial information about black-hole kick velocities and spins to astrophysicists, estimating the template space for numerically generated, binary-black-hole waveforms, and exploring the physics behind the waveforms through reduced experiments like distorted black holes and black holes evolved in the presence of a strong gravitational wave. An additional goal is to enhance and accelerate the connection between numerical relativity and data analysis and build stronger ties to the general public through research.  The interdisciplinary projects supported by this award, applying numerical relativity to astrophysics and data analysis, form an ideal ground for training the next generation of gravitational-wave physicists.  The project includes an outreach plan that capitalizes on the excitement the public has for black holes---publishing the images and movies that are generated in the pursuit of binary-black-hole mergers on the web in a format accessible to the general public, with links to other resources for the public on this topic.\r\nThe imminent detection of gravitational waves will open a new window on the universe.  Facilities such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) are now operational and searching the sky.  Fundamental to the success of the search for gravitational waves is the theoretical modeling of the sources that produce them.  Over the past year, numerical relativity has begun to successfully solve Einstein's equations governing gravity for the strongest source of gravitational waves, the final few orbits and plunge of two black holes.  Taken together with gravitational wave detection, these models probe the mysteries of general relativity by interpreting what nature is telling us about gravity.  Given the time and computational cost necessary to evolve the black hole binaries, a cost that will increase as more of the parameter space is explored, the coupling of numerical relativity and data analysis becomes increasingly important.",
