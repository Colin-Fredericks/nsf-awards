 "awd_abstract_narration": "RNA silencing, mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), has evolved as an antiviral defense mechanism in plants and animals. However, it is not known whether host cells also utilize siRNAs in antibacterial and antifungal defenses. Thousands of endogenous siRNAs have been discovered by deep sequencing recently, but their important function in gene regulation has just started to be unveiled. This project will identify endogenous siRNAs that are induced by bacterial and fungal pathogens on a genome-wide scale and characterize the biogenesis and mode of action of a subset of the siRNAs. Furthermore, the physiological functions of these siRNAs and their target genes in plant defense responses will be examined. This project explores a previously uncharted area in plant defense responses. This work will likely reveal new regulatory mechanisms underlying plant disease resistance and defense responses and ultimately contribute to the development of new strategies to combat plant pathogens to improve agriculture. As an important component of this project, an innovative summer course with a follow-up training program is designed for undergraduate students from UC Riverside (UCR) and a local Hispanic Serving Institution San Bernardino Valley College. This summer course will cover basic concepts and provide hands-on experience in the area of Plant Molecular Biology and siRNA-Mediated Gene Silencing. A follow-up training program will be provided to those students who have interest in research. This program will mainly target women and minority students who have no or limited access to research opportunities, with the aim of enhancing their chance of pursuing advanced education and a scientific career in the future.",
