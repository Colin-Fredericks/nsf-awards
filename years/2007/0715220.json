 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glucosinolates are secondary chemicals produced by plants as a defense against herbivores.  These chemicals are found in the Cruciferae plant family, which includes the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli.  Disruption of plant tissue by mechanical damage or mastication (chewing) is needed to transform glucosinolates (through enzymatic hydrolysis) into biologically active products, including plant defense and cancer protection in humans. \r\n\r\nThere is some evidence that plant secondary compounds may also play a role in attracting carnivorous insects (predators and parasitoids) that consume or parasitize insect herbivores; thus, providing plants with an additional indirect defense mechanism to deal with insect herbivores.  Using the wild crucifer, A. thaliana, as a model system, this project will evaluate the role of glucosinolate hydrolysis products on plant/herbivore/carnivore interactions in a field setting.  Because A. thaliana shares the same defense system with many crops, this study may have implications for agroecosystems by potentially identifying plant chemical blends that are both more toxic to common insect pests and better attractants for carnivorous enemies of insect pests.  In addition, this project will include the training of two students (one undergraduate and one graduate) from underrepresented groups in Science, who have recently joined the PI's laboratory.\r\n",
