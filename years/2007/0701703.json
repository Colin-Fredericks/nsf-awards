Smith, University of Cincinnati\r\nAn Ultrasensitive Biosensor Integrating Semiconductor Nanowires\r\n with Plasmonic Resonators\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The goal of this research is to harness optical nonlinearities in semiconductor nanowires and metal plasmonic resonators to create a novel nanoscale biosensor.  The proposed biosensor will synergistically combine these two powerful effects in semiconductor and metallic nanostructures to develop an extremely sensitive self-contained sensor for detecting specific biopathogens such as bacteria, viruses and toxins.  Functionally, attachment of a pathogen to a metallic nanostructure will cause it to come into resonance with an exciting laser, thereby causing large photocurrents in a one-dimensional semiconductor nanowire.  This project will lead to an understanding of both the fundamental and the technical issues involved in each component of this sensor in order to fabricate a portable device with arrays of nanowires, each sensitized for a specific pathogen.  Such a handheld device could be used by local health officials, by law enforcement officials, by doctors in their offices, and by the producers or processors of our food supply. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed research benefits society, since the rapid and sensitive detection of pathogens or toxins will improve our homeland security as well as the safety of our water and food supply.  The proposed research project will also have great impact on preparing our nation's future scientists.  The involvement and training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows as well as undergraduate students in interdisciplinary work involving semiconductor nanostructure science and engineering provides needed talent for this growing segment of the nation's workforce and, on the individual level, provides the sort of training necessary to be successful in these jobs.  These researchers will also work to excite young people about science through an annual Saturday Nanoscience Day for area middle school students and their teachers.\r\n\r\n",
