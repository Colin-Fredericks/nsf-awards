 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Copernican Revolution From Below\r\nThis project seeks to turn upside down the traditional account of the \"Copernican\r\nRevolution\" by examining the work of a wide variety of mathematical practitioners from\r\nacross Europe that has remained essentially unstudied by previous historians. These\r\nprinters, physicians, surgeons, astrologers, instrument makers, city officials, and \"lovers\r\nof astronomy\" (as they called themselves) produced hundreds of editions of annual\r\ncalendars, prognostications and practica in the century following Copernicus. To prepare\r\nthese periodica, the authors had to decide whether to compute planetary positions from\r\nthe medieval Alfonsine Tables or from more recent tables derived from Copernicus,\r\nTycho Brahe, or Kepler. Many of them explicitly discussed the choices they faced.\r\nFrom this vantage point, the Copernican Revolution becomes less a matter of natural\r\nphilosophy, religion or realism debated at universities and more a matter of numeracy,\r\nempirical evaluation of astronomical predictions, medical practice, clock-making and the\r\ncompetitive business of printing in the everyday bustle of towns from London to Vienna.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nWith its approach to mathematical astronomy from below, the monograph\r\nresulting from this project will provide yet another story of how ordinary people helped\r\nmake the Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Extending the\r\nwork of historians like William Eamon, Harold Cook, Paula Findlen, Pamela Smith,\r\nWilliam Newman and Mario Biagioli, my book will investigate the lives of more than\r\n400 rather marginal practitioners of astronomy who gained authority and legitimacy not\r\nby their elite (Latin) learning, place at courts or noble birth but rather by their\r\ncomputational skills and the perceived reliability of their annual prognostications. This\r\nproject will thus expand our view of the origins of modern science by considering users\r\nas well as makers of astronomical knowledge, and by viewing the content of astronomical\r\nknowledge as comprised by computational practice as well as theory.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nBy writing a monograph of modest length, in non-technical language, the PI\r\nhopes to produce a book that will appeal not only to historians of science but also to the\r\ngeneral public and (as a textbook) to graduate and undergraduate students. And by taking\r\na perspective from below, the PI hopes to foster an awareness of science as an activity in\r\nwhich both lay and learned people have shaped the content, values and social legitimacy\r\nof the enterprise.\r\n",
