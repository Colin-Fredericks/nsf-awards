 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61). \"Integration of Microbial Communities into a Microbiology Laboratory Class Curriculum\" is providing undergraduate students in microbiology courses with exposure to modern molecular methods and tools that are transforming research in microbial ecology. This project is translating existing research-based methods for microbial community analysis into an instructional microbiology laboratory exercises that are expanding the undergraduate experience from traditional exercises using pure culture techniques to activities that investigate microbial communities. The project emphasizes collaborative learning of key concepts related to the functioning of microbial ecological communities. These concepts include: 1) that microbial communities consist of multiple taxa whose collective actions underlie community activities; 2) that culturable microbial taxa can be distinct from those that control community function; 3) that culture-independent molecular methods can be used to clarify community composition; and 4) that community composition and community function are integrally related concepts. A microbiology concept inventory (MCI) that assesses gains in students' understanding of these key ideas is being developed and tested. The dissemination of the MCI and the instructional materials and exercises through regional and national meetings, the internet, and educational publications, is broadening the impact of the project and increasing the likelihood that the project becomes a model for microbiology courses at other institutions.",
