 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a CAREER award that will set a solid foundation for a young scientist in developing a successful academic career through creative and exciting research, education, and integrated activities.  The focus of the work plan is to advance research and education in lidar remote sensing and the applications of global lidar data to middle and upper atmospheric science.  The research represents the first time that worldwide lidar data will be combined to create a global picture of the thermal structure of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) via the use of satellite data and computer simulations.  These efforts will significantly advance our understanding of the global MLT thermal structure and will further our knowledge of middle atmosphere dynamics that govern these variations.  This research will also test and improve sophisticated global circulation models through use of these observational data.  Because this project will identify altitudes in the MLT region where the temperatures undergo minimum seasonal variations, it will be important for establishing a temperature baseline that can be used to monitor climate change.  This project will significantly advance our knowledge of the least understood region of the atmosphere, which is the equatorial and transition region of the middle atmosphere.  This project will also significantly increase the usage of the lidar data collected at Arecibo Observatory, a national facility for scientific research, and at other sites around the world.  Through analyzing past and present data, the large data backlog will be reduced, and scientific results will be obtained to help guide future data collection and instrumentation upgrades.  The study will act as a bridge to encourage collaborations between modelers and experimentalists to dramatically increase the use of lidar data in testing and improving GCM models.  This project provides excellent opportunities to educate and train graduate and undergraduate students, and to advance the integration of atmospheric science with lidar engineering.  Students will gain extensive knowledge and experience through classroom learning of lidar remote sensing and then applying them to active lidar research.  This project will help the principal investigator to successfully develop her academic career.  The activities align well with the PI's career goals of establishing a strong lidar and atmospheric research and education group at the University of Colorado, and developing a center of excellence for lidar technologies and applications for the middle and upper atmosphere community.",
