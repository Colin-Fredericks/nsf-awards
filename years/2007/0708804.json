The family of gradient flows\r\nassociated to the interfacial energy are compelling fourth and\r\nsixth order extensions of the familiar Allen-Cahn and\r\nCahn-Hilliard operators with rich new structure.  The\r\ninvestigator rigorously derives sharp interface limits for the\r\ngradient flows associated with pore formation.  The exclusion\r\npotential that separates the protonic defects from the anions\r\ngenerates a novel equilibrium charge distribution within the\r\nphase separated membrane, modifying the classic Gouy-Chapmann\r\ndiffusive double layer.  A multiscale analysis of the elliptic\r\nequations governing the charge distribution quantifies the impact\r\nof the exclusion potential on the structure of the electrostatic\r\ndouble layer, and the impact of the electrostatic pressure upon\r\nthe phase separation.  The solvent pore network within the\r\npolymer electrolyte is a novel high-contrast conductive composite\r\nmedia.  For local minimizers of the phase separation arising from\r\ninterfacial and electrostatic energies, the investigator exploits\r\nthe high contrast afforded by the permittivity and exclusion\r\npotential to derive the effective conductivity of polymer\r\nnetwork.  This entails asymptotic analysis of the saddle point\r\nstructure of charge distribution at channel junctions and\r\ndevelopment of a variational characterization of the effective\r\nprotonic conductivity. \r\n\r\nPolymer electrolytes are comprised of long hydrophobic polymers\r\n(essentially Teflon) with short acidic side-chains attached, like\r\na single pole ladder.  They form a rich structure that phase\r\nseparates in the presence of water, forming intricate nanoscale\r\ngeometries lined with pendant acid groups and filled with charged\r\nfluid.  Such structures are the workhorses of ion transport,\r\ngenerating the selectivity of ion channels in cell membranes, the\r\ncomplex biochemical processes that occur within the pores of\r\nlipid membranes, and the motivation of this project: the\r\ntransport of charge within polymer electrolyte membranes of fuel\r\ncells.  This project analyzes the mathematical underpinnings of a\r\nnovel Conductive Polymer Electrolyte (CPE) model for phase\r\nseparation and ion transport in polymer electrolyte solutions. \r\nThe fundamental understanding of pore formation and ion\r\nconduction in these materials is essential to the development of\r\nhigh-temperature membranes for fuel cell vehicles.  High\r\ntemperature membranes are a key step in the transition to a\r\nhydrogen economy, as higher fuel cell operating temperatures will\r\ngreatly reduce costs associated with platinum catalyst loading\r\nand radiative cooling of the engine.",
