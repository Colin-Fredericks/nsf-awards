 "awd_abstract_narration": "Counted among the most dramatic predictions of general relativity are black holes and gravitational waves.  Scientists are now poised to probe general relativity, black holes and the early universe using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) as an astronomical tool. The success of LIGO's long-term observing campaign is predicated on continuing timely analysis of the observational data. To achieve this non-trivial computational task, LIGO has successfully adopted the grid computing model and has been at the forefront of its application for data-intensive observational science. This award supports the LIGO Data Grid, a distributed computational facility developed specifically to meet the significant computational needs of gravitational-wave astronomy. It provides personnel to support, enhance and deploy software and grid-services on the LIGO Data Grid. It addresses the needs of the community of gravitational-wave physicists involved in LIGO data analysis, and will have significant impact in that area.  The LIGO Data Grid also tests grid concepts at both the high level of grand ideas and at the detailed level of tools in everyday use for a large scientific experiment.  This experience will have broad relevance for other grid and information technology initiatives.  Finally, this award will provide training for students, scientists and computer specialists in the use of emerging cyber-technology which has applications outside LIGO's endeavor.",
