 "awd_abstract_narration": "0610009\r\nWelty\r\nDespite the growing footprint of urban landscapes and their impacts on\r\nhydrologic and biogeochemical cycles, comprehensive field studies of urban water budgets are few.\r\nThe cumulative effects of urban infrastructure (buildings, roads, culverts, storm drains, detention\r\nponds, leaking water supply and wastewater pipe networks) on temporal and spatial patterns of\r\ngroundwater stores, fluxes, and flowpaths are poorly understood. Any environmental observatory\r\nnetwork must include efforts to understand critical processes in urban landscapes, and urban\r\ngroundwater can fairly be characterized as a missing link in our understanding of the integrated\r\nfunctioning of the natural and built environment. The goal of this project is to develop expertise and\r\nanalytical tools for urban groundwater systems that will inform future environmental observatory\r\nplanning and that can be shared with research teams working in urban environments elsewhere.\r\nOur work plan draws on a robust set of information resources in Maryland provided by ongoing\r\nmonitoring efforts of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES), USGS, and the U.S. Forest Service\r\nworking together with university scientists and engineers from multiple institutions. Consent decrees,\r\nsigned by both Baltimore City and Baltimore County with U.S. EPA to mitigate failures in the sanitary\r\nsewer network, are leading to increased deployment of rainfall, groundwater and wastewater flow\r\nsensors including wireless telemetry for real-time data collection. The proposed project will leverage\r\nthese resources with strategic investments in monitoring, modeling and database development to\r\nestablish protocols for quantifying groundwater systems in urban areas.\r\nA key concern is to bridge the gap between small-scale intensive field studies and larger-scale and\r\nlonger-term hydrologic patterns using synoptic field surveys, remote sensing, numerical modeling,\r\ndata mining and visualization tools. Using the urban water budget as a unifying theme, we propose\r\nto estimate the various elements of the budget in order to quantify the influence of urban\r\ninfrastructure on groundwater. Proposed efforts include: (1) comparison of base flow behavior from\r\nstream gauges in a nested set of watersheds at four different spatial scales from 0.8 to 171 km2, with\r\ndiverse patterns of impervious cover and urban infrastructure; (2) synoptic survey of well water\r\nlevels to characterize the regional water table; (3) use of airborne thermal infrared imagery to identify\r\nlocations of groundwater seepage into streams across a range of urban development patterns; (4)\r\nuse of seepage transects and tracer tests to quantify the spatial pattern of groundwater fluxes to the\r\ndrainage network in selected subwatersheds; (5) development of a mass balance for precipitation\r\nover a 170 km2 area on a 1x1 km2 grid using recording rain gages for bias correction of weather\r\nradar products; (5) calculation of urban evapotranspiration using the Penman-Monteith method\r\ncompared with results from an eddy correlation station; (7) use of numerical groundwater model in a\r\nscreening mode to estimate depth of groundwater contributing surface water flow; (8) data mining of\r\npublic agency records of potable water and wastewater flows to estimate leakage rates and\r\nflowpaths in relation to streamflow and groundwater fluxes; and (9) evaluation of the CUAHSI\r\nHydrologic Information Systems data modeling tools for application to urban environments.\r\nBroader Impacts. The project will provide guidance for development of environmental\r\nobservatories, which are envisioned as providing critical information not only for basic science but for\r\nmanagement of vital resources affecting the future health and well-being of both human populations\r\nand ecosystems. The project also will contribute to the education of graduate and undergraduate\r\nstudents. Graduate students will participate as research assistants during the summer field season,\r\nas coordinated through UMBC's Center for Urban Environmental Research and Education. We will\r\nemphasize recruitment of undergraduate student assistants from UMBC's Meyerhoff Scholars\r\nprogram, which has a national reputation for training of talented minority students committed to\r\ngraduate education in science and engineering. Through the Baltimore Ecosystem Study LTER, an\r\nextensive outreach educational program managed by the BES education coordinator is already in\r\nplace with inner city Baltimore schools and with suburban Baltimore County schools, which includes\r\na hydrologic science module within the environmental science curriculum. Results from the\r\nproposed work can contribute to/enhance this ongoing curriculum development effort.",
