Libgober\r\n\r\nThe project deals with the study of topological invariants for\r\nsingular algebraic varieties with many ideas motivated by\r\nphysics.  One of its goals is to develop new invariants for\r\nsingular spaces extending the theory of elliptic genus of\r\nvarieties with mild singularities and orbifolds which was\r\npresented in joint works with Lev Borisov earlier.  This will\r\nyields an extension of the previous contributions by many authors\r\non vertex operator algebras associated to manifolds or orbifolds\r\nand application of these invariants to geometric problems. PI\r\nplans to develop further generalizations of elliptic genus\r\ndetecting the torsion in the cobordisms of special unitary\r\ncomplex manifolds as well as use this invariant in classification\r\nand surgery problems of singular spaces. The principal\r\ninvestigator will investigate the possibility that the elliptic\r\ngenus plays a role in singularity theory beyond classical\r\napplications in Landau-Ginzburg models associated with weighted\r\nhomogeneous polynomials. In particular it is planned to consider\r\nthe extensions of elliptic genus of Landau-Ginzburg models in\r\nconnection with the Arnold-Steenbrink spectrum of isolated\r\nsingularities. In another direction, PI plans to study the\r\nhomotopy groups of non-simply connected quasiprojective\r\nvarieties. In particular the study of characteristic varieties\r\nassociated with homotopy groups controlling among other things\r\nthe cohomology of local systems will be continued.  A.Libgober\r\nwill focus on properties of the Hodge decomposition of the latter\r\nand will study the fundamental problem of realization of these\r\ninvariants, i.e. the existence of quasiprojectve varieties with\r\ngiven characteristic varieties.  As part of this work, PI will\r\ninvestigate the restrictions on the dimensions of characteristic\r\nvarieties in the case of plane reducible curves generalizing\r\nresults in the case of arrangements of lines in complex\r\nprojective plane.\r\n\r\nIn general terms the proposal aims to develop new approaches to\r\nthe study of geometry of spaces appearing in a variety of\r\nproblems in mathematics and such aspects of theoretical physics\r\nas string theory. A new type of data, called elliptic genus,\r\nreflecting geometry and topology of these spaces which appeared\r\nnaturally in physics will be investigated from a mathematical\r\nperspective and applied to a wide range of problems in geometry,\r\ntopology and singularity theory.  It is planned to study further\r\ngeneralizations of elliptic genus which should have applications\r\nto fundamental problems of physics.  The realization of presence\r\nof infinite dimensional aspects in geometric issues, on which our\r\nwork depends in an essential way, is a novel feature which\r\nemerged in the last 20 years in mathematics and physics. It is\r\nplanned to widely disseminate such new viewpoints gaining\r\nstrength in contemporary mathematics and physics.\r\n\r\n",
