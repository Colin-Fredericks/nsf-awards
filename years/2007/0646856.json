 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the effect of regional land surface-atmosphere processes on the climate of the La Plata Basin of South America.  Focus is on the role of soil moisture feedback mechanisms and the Pantanal wetlands on the South American climate system.  These feedbacks will be investigated primarily through the evolution of rainfall.  The aim of the work is to examine whether land surface-atmosphere interactions and feedbacks can be exploited to improve the capability to predict monthly-seasonal climate and surface hydrology in the region.  Phase one of the research is a diagnostic analysis of South American atmospheric analyses and land data assimilation products to identify areas most sensitive to land-atmosphere interactions and to propose pathways by which soil moisture interacts with precipitation.  This will be followed by ensemble regional climate model simulations for hypothesis testing.  The project will support a graduate student, facilitate international collaborations with scientists of South America and particularly students at the University of Buenos Aires, and contribute to international science goals and efforts focusing specifically on the climate of the La Plata Basin.",
