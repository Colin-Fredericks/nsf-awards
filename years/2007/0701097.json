 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposes to study which Banach spaces have the class of their \r\nlinear subspaces and/or linear quotients closed under uniform or Lipschitz \r\nmaps. It also proposes to study the coarse geometry of these Banach spaces \r\nand their subsets. Coarse maps were introduced by Gromov to study the \r\ngeometry of groups in the large scale. The particular subsets that the project \r\nwill focus on will be discrete metric spaces with bounded geometry, including \r\nexpanders. As the project goes along these lines, the geometry of general \r\nmetric spaces will be studied as well. The general aim is to extend the \r\ntechniques from Banach space theory into the study of metric spaces. One \r\nof the goals will be to understand metric uniform convexity more fully. \r\n\r\nNonlinear Banach Space Theory is a branch of Banach Space Theory that \r\nstudies the geometry of Banach spaces and their subsets under nonlinear \r\nmaps. Banach Space Theory is a mature branch of Functional Analysis with \r\nwell-developed techniques. The nonlinear theory rejuvenates it by bringing \r\nit into the service of other areas of Mathematics such as Algebraic Geometry, \r\nGeometric Group Theory and Theoretical Computer Science. It is one of the \r\ntools used in the study of the Novikov conjecture, a conjecture that spans \r\nseveral areas of Mathematics already, by studying the metric geometry of \r\none object intimately tied to the manifold: its fundamental group. It also \r\ncontributes to Computer Science by helping find a simpler geometry for the \r\nmany metrics that appear in practice, like in Data Mining for example. In \r\nthe meantime, it deepens the understanding of the primary objects of Banach \r\nSpace Theory itself. The research proposed in the present project will touch \r\nall of these aspects of Nonlinear Banach Space Theory. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
