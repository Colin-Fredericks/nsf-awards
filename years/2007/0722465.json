 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging technology areas together with advances in bio, micro and nano technologies have introduced new challenges and areas of opportunity for the system dynamics community. Technological evolution from macro to micro and nano scales require development of new constitutive laws, new modeling techniques and dynamic analysis, and new system analyses which would not be a simple extension of the current state-of-the-art. In order to assess the impact of these technological challenges and identify future research directions, a organizing a workshop is being proposed. The main objectives of this Workshop are:\r\n\r\n.         Bring together scholars and leading researchers from diverse backgrounds and applications areas associated with dynamic systems.\r\n\r\n.         Identify cross-cutting issues where attention should be focused, or where cross fertilization of ideas may take place.\r\n\r\n.         Create an opportunity to establish state-of-the-art in dynamics of multi-scale, multi-physics systems.\r\n\r\n.         Identify and prioritize focus areas and develop a vision for research directions and education.\r\n\r\n.         Develop a roadmap of research and education including required resources and milestones.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together researchers and scholars from diverse backgrounds, gender and minority groups with interest and experience in a variety of dynamical systems. Given the areas of focus and application, e.g. bio-systems, nano-systems, social, infrastructure, and defense systems, results from this workshop will have a major and broad impact. Due to its potential impact, we plan to disseminate results of this workshop extensively, including in academia, national labs, industry, and outreach to high schools. We will arrange for special sessions at the ASME-IMECE, ACC, and IEEE annual conferences to share the results of this workshop and create plans for implementation of its recommendations. \r\n\r\n",
