 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glycoproteins play important roles in biology, and are needed for the study of biological processes.  Since it is difficult to isolate pure glycoproteins from biomaterials, an alternative approach is to generate these compounds by chemical synthesis.  This requires the synthesis of (glyco)peptide thioesters and (glyco)peptides, which are used as building blocks.  The P.I.'s research focuses on the development of a unique photochemical method, which can be used to synthesize the desired components under mild reaction conditions.  The building blocks are then reacted with each other, which will produce large glycopeptides.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will be conducted by students at the University of Texas at El Paso, a recognized Hispanic Serving Institution.  The students will obtain expertise in modern carbohydrate and peptide chemistry.  Some of the research will be done in collaboration with an outstanding Japanese group, which will contribute to a competitive and invigorating learning environment for the P.I.'s students.  Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of the project, the anticipated results will have an impact on the science community well beyond organic chemistry.\r\n",
