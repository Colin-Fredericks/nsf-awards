 "awd_abstract_narration": "Imagine a virtual environment so realistic that within it one could practice a violin technique such as vibrato, or how to filet a freshly caught halibut, or a surgical procedure using patient specific data.  Such applications, and countless others, would require a high quality haptic device for the hands through which realistic forces could be applied to convincingly simulate touch.  Today's haptic interfaces - information technology that supports human touching and manipulation of virtual or remote objects - are still in their infancy compared to human haptic capabilities.  The typical haptic device is connected to a single finger, or supports interaction through a pen-like stylus.  In an effort to dramatically advance the state of the art, the PI has developed an exciting prototype multi-finger device of high resolution and bandwidth.  In this project he will determine the limits of the prototype and refine the technology so that it is useful for evaluation in applications.  To these ends, the PI will explore the requirements on high-fidelity haptic technology imposed by human perception.  He will measure user thresholds {i.e., the smallest forces which they can perceive with multiple fingers), and will study multi-finger and bi-manual behavior and performance in exploring and manipulating objects and materials.  These data will enable the PI to reconfigure his multi-finger haptic device and create software modifications as necessary, and also to develop a new haptic rendering algorithm and study how it interacts with human perception.  Project outcomes will include engineering requirements for successful yet cost-effective haptic devices, along with some of the knowledge necessary to achieve future high quality multi-finger haptic interface applications\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The technology to be developed in this project will ultimately give people who are visually impaired access to the many images and 3D datasets and models which are accessible only in electronic form.  Additionally, haptics is an important enabling technology for medical simulations; better medical simulators will lead to fewer medical errors and more efficient training of medical personnel.  Haptics is expected to have a significant impact on the appreciation and the conservation of works of art.   Demonstrations of applications in these and other fields will be byproducts of this research.",
