 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor Peng Chen at Cornell University to study bioinorganic systems on a single-molecule basis.  The overall research objective is to harness single-molecule fluorescence techniques to understand the dynamics and functions of metalloproteins including tyrosinase and copper chaperones.  The single-molecule methods will open new dimensions in characterizing bioinorganic systems and provide unique insights into tyrosinase and copper chaperone functions and dynamics that are not available.  The mechanistic knowledge on copper chaperones will impact the understanding and treatment of copper transport related diseases.  The educational component of the program promotes science education by providing a \"Single vs. Mingle\" workshop which will bring an appreciation of single molecule measurements to high school and community college teachers through a special science workshop.  A new graduate course, research-based undergraduate education materials, and a research symposium will provide interdisciplinary education and training.  Professor Chen will also broaden the participation of female and Hispanic students, as well as other four-year college students, by including these students in his research and educational programs.\r\n",
