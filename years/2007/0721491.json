 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the key problems in today's Internet is that basic measuring and monitoring functionality has not been built in from the outset.\r\nAlthough infrastructure has been added and ad hoc solutions have been created to allow monitoring and measurement of various Internet behaviors, we still don't know a great deal more about the Internet.  The next-generation Internet will require an infrastructure that gives more emphasis to self-monitoring and self-measurement from the beginning.  This research focuses on the value of providing a near-ubiquitous, flexible hashing infrastructure that allows approximation schemes for a variety of network measurement and monitoring tasks.  The focus is motivated by the great value of deploying hash-based structures, including their relative simplicity, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The goal of such an infrastructure would not only be to handle issues that have already arisen in today's network, but also to provide a general framework for handling additional, currently unknown problems that may arise in the future.  It is anticipated that such an infrastructure will prove sufficiently valuable that it will be made part of the standard architecture for Internet devices.",
