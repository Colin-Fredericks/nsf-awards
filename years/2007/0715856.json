 "awd_abstract_narration": "This South Eastern Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society (SERMACS) will emphasize solid-state and materials chemistry as a multidisciplinary field that is growing in vitality and importance due mainly to the development of advanced synthetic techniques and the discovery of new solid-state materials. Innovative approaches in solid-state chemistry are critical to addressing and providing solutions for emerging scientific and technological challenges, and to providing various sectors in society with materials tailored to meet future needs. The aim of this particular meeting is to highlight recent innovations by:\r\n   Providing a forward-looking symposium that focuses on recent advances in syntheses and structural chemistry, and opening new approaches to research challenges.\r\n   Discussing the challenges confronting the synthesis of specific desired materials, e.g., ones that are relevant to magnetic, electronic, optical, and catalytic applications.\r\n   Educating the next generation of solid-state scientists in new advances and creativity in syntheses, preparing them for significant new contributions during their careers.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nNSF support, in addition to funds provided by the American Chemical Society, will help bring together a diverse group of speakers focusing on recent advances in the solid-state syntheses (e.g. hydrothermal, flux, and high-temperature techniques) and structure of new solid-state compounds (e.g. oxides, sulfides, and intermetallics). The organizers have chosen invited speakers that serve to represent diverse classes of materials that have a broad impact on technologies in areas of national need. Specific areas include magnetic, optical/electronic, thermal, and reactive and catalytic solids. This symposium will also facilitate many interactions of internationally recognized scientists with research students to encourage cross-fertilization of research ideas.\r\n",
