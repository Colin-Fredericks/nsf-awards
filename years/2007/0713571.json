 "awd_abstract_narration": "Text summarization generates a concise summary of documents to\r\nhelp a user quickly digest information and has become increasingly important due to the \r\nexplosive growth of information. Most existing summarization methods \r\ncan only generate an unstructured summary with a simple list of sentences. \r\nIn many applications, however, we want to generate a (more structured)\r\nmulti-faceted comparative summary, in which sentences are grouped into \r\nmultiple facets and compared across different views. For example, a summary about laptop opinions \r\nmay group sentences into facets such as ``battery life'' and ``memory'' and separate sentences\r\nwith positive and negative opinions in each facet. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to systematically study this new summarization problem (called multi-faceted\r\ncomparative summarization). The PI will develop general probabilistic approaches that can \r\nbe applied to multiple instances of the problem in different domains. \r\nThe basic idea is to use probabilistic mixture models to model and extract\r\nthe multiple facets and multiple views of each facet in a set of text documents to be summarized.\r\nThe extracted facets and views are then used to generate facet labels and select sentences for\r\ndifferent facet-view combinations. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will open up a new research direction in text summarization. \r\nThe developed methods can be directly applied to provide more useful\r\nproduct opinion retrieval service on the Web to all people and help scientists in multiple fields\r\nto digest scientific literature more effectively, thus speeding up scientific discovery.\r\nAll research resources and results will be disseminated to the research community \r\nthrough publications and downloadable software and data. The research results will also\r\nenhance the current curriculum in information retrieval, \r\nleading to improved education of the information technology workforce.",
