 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support this 2007 NSF-Engineering Education grantees meeting.  Invitees include: PIs from engineering Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), Research Experiences for Teachers (RET), Department-Level Reform (DLR), Engineering Education Programs (EEP), Faculty Early Career (CAREER); pre-college outreach coordinators from Engineering Research Centers (ERC); selected students from REU sites; selected teachers from RET sites and guest presenters. The meeting will be held at the Key Bridge Marriott hotel in Arlington, Virginia, September 26-28, 2007. Meeting activities will include a keynote speaker, poster sessions, networking meals and receptions, hour-long workshops for awardees, and evaluation of the meeting.  Bringing together leading researchers and practitioners in engineering education is a key activity to advancing engineering education as a research discipline. Representation of diverse projects and initiatives in engineering education ensures that exciting new connections and ideas will be sparked by this meeting.  This meeting provides the opportunity for investigators, RET teachers, REU students, distinguished guest speakers, and NSF program officers to interact across NSF Engineering Education and Centers programs. The networks that will form across these programs will enhance the infrastructure for research and education improvement in engineering. The meeting will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning through its dual focus on research and education projects. Society will ultimately benefit from this meeting through NSF's ongoing engineering education projects, which will be enriched by the information and connections made at this meeting.",
