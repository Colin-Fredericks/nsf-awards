Byrne \r\nInstitution:  Auburn University \r\nProposal Number: 0730903\r\nTITLE: Enhancing Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Binding Parameters via Reaction Analysis \r\n\r\nThis work will involve the formation and characterization of three-dimensional polymeric networks for the recognition of template molecules. In recent years, the field of macromolecular recognition, molecular imprinting, has exploited porous, highly-crosslinked heteropolymers as robust recognition matrices. However, there have been no studies or progress within the field in the area of polymerization reaction analysis to study the network formation and its influence on the binding affinity, selectivity, and number of binding sites within the polymer matrix, main parameters that determine the imprinting effectiveness. Since these properties are strongly dependent on the network structure, it is very important to study the details of the reaction. As transitional applications and specialized applications are pursued, such as functional sensor films, point-of-care diagnostics, assays, and drug delivery carriers, the characterization and optimization of the polymer structure via reaction analysis is paramount. Polymerization reaction analysis will lead to a greater understanding of the imprinting mechanism, enhancement of binding parameters, and a substantial increase in the application potential for imprinted networks. \r\n\r\nThe major objectives are to: \r\n. Synthesize imprinted networks for the template ethyl-adenine-9-acetate via free-radical photopolymerization. A parametric study of network composition will occur with variations in initiator type, mechanism, and concentration, template/functional monomer ratio, crosslinking monomer type and length, temperature, and solvent concentration; \r\n. Determine template equilibrium binding parameters such as affinity, capacity, and selectivity; \r\n. Analyze template polymerization reactions to determine chain propagation and termination kinetics, final double bond conversion, and kinetic chain length. Reaction analysis and associated reaction and structural parameters will be correlated to template capacity, affinity, and selectivity; and \r\n. Determine network structural properties and dynamic template transport. \r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\r\n \r\n. Advance and contribute fundamental knowledge on the formation of recognitive polymeric structures and develop understanding of how template molecules affect the architectural organization and kinetics of macromolecular chains. Results within this proposal are the first to show enhanced binding parameters by reaction analysis and alteration of the reaction kinetics, hypothesized to be due an increased structural homogeneity and increased stability and integrity of binding sites. \r\n. Substantially advance knowledge across a diverse number of fields/disciplines since this work has impact in separation science, robust chemical/biochemical sensor coatings and functional micro- and nano-layers, enhanced carriers for the sustained release of therapeutic agents, as well as in precise polymerization strategies. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS \r\n\r\n. Employ polymer science techniques to influence the rational design and engineering of templated materials, which will influence a broad number of material directives, advance innovative technologies and discovery, and lead to better integration of imprinted structures in technologies to benefit society. \r\n. Create a multi-level, diverse, integrated research team consisting of the PI, 2 under-represented or minority doctoral graduate students, and 3 under-represented or minority undergraduate researchers with a focus on broadening the participation of under-represented groups in research opportunities. \r\n. Provide multi-disciplinary, collaborative research training and education for 2 graduate and 3 undergraduate students by integrating polymer science, polymer engineering, materials engineering, molecular recognition, and chemical engineering principles into a research and educational project. \r\n. Increase the excitement for undergraduate students toward research activities and careers by integrating state of the art research and discovery in polymer engineering with educational activities. \r\n. Broadly disseminate results by publishing results in diverse media (polymer science and engineering journals, biomaterials science journals, drug delivery journals) as well as conference presentations to a diverse number of societies (Materials Research Society, Society for Biomaterials, American Institute for Chemical Engineers). \r\n. Incorporate transformative technologies and research from this work in the classroom within the PI's courses. \r\n. Increase public understanding and stimulate K-12 interest in science and engineering by incorporating the impact of this work in a \"Polymer Show\" for Auburn's TIGER Summer Camp. \r\n. Provide mentoring, professional development, and career guidance to graduate and undergraduate students, which will help build a well-prepared workforce. \r\n. Promoting faculty development through the graduate and undergraduate research mentoring experience. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
