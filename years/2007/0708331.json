It consists of three separate but closely related parts: 1. Quasi-periodic motions; 2. Almost automorphic intermittency; 3. Bio-chemical oscillations.  Part 1 of the project concerns the  study  of quasi-periodic phenomena in three important classes of conservative systems: properly degenerate, nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems, Poisson-Hamilton systems, and Hamiltonian networks.\r\nPart 2 of the project is devoted to the study of two general dynamical intermittencies: Strange, non-chaotic attractors in damped, quasi-periodically forced, nonlinear oscillatory systems and Cantori in nearly integrable conservative systems.  Part 3 of the project contains a program of developing generic bio-chemical models and studying the underlying fluctuating bio-chemical oscillations.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on a continuing study of multi-frequency phenomena in nature especially those arising in  biological, electrical, and mechanical  systems. It is predicted by many experiments and computer simulations that physical systems involving multi-frequency can produce much complex dynamical outcomes oscillating in multi-phases. But the mechanism of such complexity is far from being well-understood. The main goal of the proposed project is to develop a mathematical theory toward making a fundamental understanding of such complexity.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
