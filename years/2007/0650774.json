 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nRood 0434187\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks support for a US PI, Mark Rood at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and a graduate student, to work with Prof. P.B. Mota at the University of Lisbon in Portugal to develop a better understanding of the environmental implications of nanomaterials and to seek novel materials to store renewable fuels.\r\n\r\nScientific Merit.  The collaboration is directed toward two tasks.  The first task is molecular simulations describing the interactions between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and environmentally relevant molecules to engineer interactions between SWNTs and environmental relevant molecules to engineer controlled structures of SWNTs for specific applications.  The second task is to determine hydrogen storage capacities of SWNTs chemically altered to have high adsorption capacities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  The full-fledged use of nanomaterials is expected within the next ten years, meaning that knowledge of their environmental aspects will be in great demand.  The research also aims to find an inexpensive way to store energy.  The success of this work will reduce the costs of other energy and environmental studies worldwide.  The research collaboration will contribute to the globalization of scientific research and over an overseas experience to the participating graduate student.",
