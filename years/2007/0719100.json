 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for the 2007 biennial conference on the Neurobiology of Drosophila, continuing a series of meetings first instituted in 1987. The aim of the four-day meeting is to provide the members of the Drosophila neurobiology community a unique and rewarding opportunity to share current advances in the field. We offer an exciting venue for researchers to exchange their most recent observations, to initiate new collaborations, to learn about progress on novel techniques, to further their own research, and to identify, recognize, and especially encourage new and young investigators. In 2005, almost 40% of participants were women, 31% postdoctoral fellows, and aver 25% were from foreign countries.  \r\n\r\nThe aims of the meeting are:\r\n1. Bring together an international group of approximately 430 participants from academic, governmental, and industrial laboratories to present their most recent and preferably unpublished findings. Each participant is strongly encouraged to submit an abstract to present a poster or short talk.\r\n2. Cover all aspects of Drosophila neurobiology through the presentation of behavioral, physiological, developmental, cell biological, molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches to better understand the complex nervous system of the fruitfly. We will also encourage participants to present novel techniques, including those that exploit recently described methods for genetic manipulation in Drosophila, those that take advantage of the genomic and proteomic advances of recent years, and those that use state-of-the-art imaging and electrophysiological techniques to query neuronal activity and define neural circuits.\r\n3. Ensure that junior investigators, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, are well represented. Young investigators and women traditionally have played a substantial role in the organization and participation of this meeting. The open format of thismeeting allows all participants to freely exchange ideas, further promoting this highly active field.\r\n4. Evaluate whether the goals of the meeting have been met through questionnaires and an open business session that all participants are invited to attend. This feedback is used to plan and organize the next meeting. The whole assembly elects the organizers of the next meeting during this business session.",
