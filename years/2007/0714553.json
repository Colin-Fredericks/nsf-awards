The project will include faculty development and research activities, curriculum development activities and student support activities in support of the overarching ASPIRE project goal:  to improve the quality of STEM majors through innovative, interdisciplinary Informatics education and research activities.\r\n\r\nThe curricular activities include the development of Informatics modules for introduction into STEM courses and development of new Informatics course.  The modules will be included in Physics and Chemistry courses, as well as in first year seminars which will impact all STEM students.\r\n\r\nSupplemental Instruction will be implemented to address the needs of eleven bottleneck courses which various departments have identified based on grade distribution in those courses.\r\n\r\nUnderlying the curricular and supplemental instruction activities are faculty development and research activities, which aim to increase faculty knowledge of informatics, and develop collaborative interdisciplinary informatics research teams of faculty and students.\r\n",
