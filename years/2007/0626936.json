 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award supports improvements in basic infrastructure, including potable water supply, sanitation facilities and communications equipment, for a new field station located on the Powell River, the main tributary of the Clinch River.  The Powell River is an important site for study of federally-listed endangered species of freshwater fish and mussels, and for study of amphibians listed as species of special concern. In addition, the station facilitates research use of a 120 sq. KM. karst plain that lies near the station. The karst plain is believed to provide primary habitat and/or food source for at least one species of endangered mammal, the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis). The research and communications equipment acquired with the aid of this award will, through collaborative efforts with state, federal and academic partners, facilitate development of a publicly accessible database that provides information about the ecology and other attributes of this highly biodiverse region. These improvements will also enable improved educational and research training opportunities for undergraduate students, and will facilitate an effort by the station to support enrichment activities for the science curriculum offered at local and regional K-12 schools.",
