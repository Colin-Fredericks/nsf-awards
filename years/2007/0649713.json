 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project, The Bay Area Houston Partnership for Innovation in Biotechnology and Life Sciences (PIBLS), has been formed to strengthen bioscience innovation.  The goal of the project is to build a replicable, transferable process model for web-based and enhanced education; develop online science classes; virtual labs; and simulations.  Using up-to-date information, creative methods, and cutting-edge technologies, the project will contribute to the development of undergraduate STEM education, provide research opportunities to professors, students, and industry partners, enable faculty to effect change in their students' academic and career choices, and extend the biopipeline. Expected outcomes are defined, measurable, and part of a fully developed evaluation plan.\r\n\r\nHispanics have not historically been drawn to the sciences or to the job opportunities which the sciences offer upon graduation. PIBLS will play a key role in helping to alter this trend. Students moving into the workplace will ensure a sustainable pipeline of workers to further grow and develop the biotechnology and life sciences industries, leading to enhanced economic development of the region and U.S. economy.\r\n\r\nPartners:  The partners include San Jacinto College (lead institution); Aerospace & Biotechnology Academy; University of Houston-Clear Lake; Texas Southern University; University of Texas Medical Branch; Texas Workforce Commission; Independent School Districts (7): Clear Creek, Deer Park, Friendswood, Galena Park, La Porte, Pasadena, and Sheldon; Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board; Houston Galveston-Area Council; Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership; Bay Area Houston Technology and Education Center; Biotech/life sciences employers, and NASA-Johnson Space Center.  Five additional pilot schools will be identified by East Texas Area Health Education Center (AHEC), University of Texas Medical Branch, for participation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
