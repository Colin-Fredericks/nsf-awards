 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demand for alternative and renewable energy generation systems has been growing in the U.S. and globally at a rate of about 25% per year. The use of alternative and renewable energy sources on a large scale requires new technologies such as reliable and efficient power electronics interface, new system control schemes, as well as energy storage systems. The program goal is to develop innovations in hybrid energy systems, especially the hybrid fuel cell system, to bring down the technology barriers in the above subjects. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: \r\n\r\nThe traditional method to combine the energy source and energy storage elements is through multiple separate dc-dc converters and most research has focused on single converters and single-task control. The multi-port converter is promising from the viewpoint of integrated control, high power density, low cost and more efficient power harvesting from a variety of power sources. These converters present special design challenges including high power, bidirectional power flow, non-ideal characteristics of input voltages, integration of power processing, and complicated dynamics caused by interactions among the ports. The proposed research tasks include (1) design of a high efficiency, high power density multi-port converter module using multi-phase and soft-switching technology; (2) theoretical analysis and dynamic modeling of the complicated behavior caused by the interaction between the converter, fuel cell, energy storage, and the load; (3) control strategy design and digital control system implementation; and (4) implementation of scalable module based experimental research platform featuring standardized power, thermal, and control interfaces. The validity of design, modeling, and control will be verified through this experimental platform. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThe multi-port power converter not only can be applied to fuel cell based energy systems, but also to other alternative and renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic and rectified wind generation with energy storage elements. In addition, the multi-port bidirectional converter can interface hybrid energy storage elements such as batteries and ultracapacitors for pulse power requirement with higher specific power and efficiency, weight, cost and volume reductions than single energy storage alone. Therefore, it is a key enabling technology for distributed generation, electric cars, more-electric craft, and the all-electric ship where alternative energy sources and energy storage elements play an increasingly important role. The research results will enable more rapid and wider usage of alternative and renewable energy, resulting in a significant reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases, reduced costs of non-renewable fuels, and increased energy security. \r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe educational plan is to build and improve the quality of graduate and undergraduate education in the power engineering area at FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. This will be done by integrating the research into the power curriculum, updating the current power laboratory with digital control setups, and creating a multidisciplinary education and design experience with Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering Departments on alternative energy sources and energy storage elements. It also aims to increase the number of under-represented minority students and graduates in the field of power engineering. The PI will provide power engineering-focused projects from her research for the Business and Engineering Summer Training program to attract high school minority students. The PI will also recruit undergraduate minority students from the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program to participate in the research. The research and education results will be made public through web-based courses, web pages, published articles and Open House demonstration. \r\n\r\n",
