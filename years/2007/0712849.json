 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\nProject Title: Knowledge Compilation with Fast Response \r\nPIs: \r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with the development, maintenance, and \r\nutilization of index structures -- reduced implicate tries \r\n(ri-tries) -- that answer logical queries of large databases. \r\nThe primary goals of this project are further development of ri-tries, \r\nidentification and classification of databases for which these tries \r\nwill be effective, and development of computer systems that implement \r\nri-tries. \r\n\r\nA reduced implicate trie is a data structure for storing a propositional \r\ndatabase on a computer. Fast responses to queries are enabled by \r\nmaking it easy to determine consequences -- queries with yes answers -- \r\nof the database. Technically, once a database has been compiled into \r\nan ri-trie, the response time to any query is guaranteed to be linear \r\nin the size of the query, regardless of the size of the compiled \r\ndatabase. This response time represents a trade-off between \r\nperformance and space, since ri-tries may be large. A central focus \r\nof this project will be determining what types of databases lend themselves \r\nto ri-tries. This will be accomplished through experimentation and \r\nthrough theoretical developments. \r\n\r\nA prototype system that compiles logical formulas into ri-tries and \r\na query processing module will be developed. Initially, the system \r\nwill be designed for databases in conjunctive normal form; in the \r\nlonger term, any formula from propositional logic will be acceptable \r\ninput. The query processor will be designed to accept clauses as input, \r\nsince a clause is the typical form for a query. Students at the University \r\nof New Haven and at SUNY at Albany will be active participants. \r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of the Proposed Activity \r\n\r\nThe RUI component of this project will be extensive participation \r\nby undergraduates at the University of New Haven. Students will be \r\nintroduced to the basic ideas of automated deduction and knowledge \r\ncompilation and will work on the prototype system. The goal is to \r\ninspire students by engaging them in real research that contributes \r\nto real publications. The PI is committed to attracting talented \r\nyoung men and women into mathematics and computer science and to \r\npreparing them for graduate school. The University at Albany has a \r\nstrong graduate program in computer science, and the PI at Albany \r\nis committed to preparing students for careers in research. \r\n\r\nProject Web Page: http://www.cs.albany.edu/~nvm/ritries/ \r\nErik Rosenthal's Web Page: http://www.newhaven.edu/show.asp?durki=1623 \r\nNeil Murray's Web Page: http://www.cs.albany.edu/~nvm/ \r\n \r\n \r\n",
