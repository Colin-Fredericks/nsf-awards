 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel and expenses for participants in the tenth Latin American Congress on Probability and Statistics, to be held in Lima, Peru in March 2007. The main objectives of the conference are:\r\n.\tTo contribute to the development of probability and statistics in Latin America.\r\n.\tTo facilitate the interaction between scientists from the U.S. and Europe and their colleagues in Latin America.\r\n.\tTo provide a valuable experience for talented scientists who have few opportunities to attend conferences outside their region.\r\n\r\nEight distinguished U.S. based researchers will participate in the conference as invited speakers. The award will also provide travel support fourteen young researchers; eight from the U.S. and six from Latin America. Peru has offered to host this year's conference as a means of encouraging its young researchers to increase the level of research activity and education in the mathematical sciences. The National Science Foundation has supported this conference series since 1990, when the congress was held in Mexico. \r\n",
