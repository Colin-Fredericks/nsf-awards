 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project focuses on one of the fundamental problems in augmented reality (AR): how to combine virtual and real images and display the integrated three-dimensional (3D) images to users. Traditionally, there have been two ways to combine real and virtual images - using video and optical technologies. While each has particular advantages and disadvantages, AR systems' designers have to make a choice between these two. This project provides the advantages of both optical and video technologies in a single system, and can be seamlessly transited. Additionally, most AR applications require outdoors usability, where the level of illumination conditions can vary from complete darkness to bright sunlight. Sunlight readability is a major challenge for all displays in general. This research project will provide a real see-through/look-at screen which has the capability of automatically adapting to environmental brightness. The display will have the same form factor and weigh the same as a pair of regular eye glasses, and its binocular screen structure will enable full 3D stereo capabilities, making it ideal for virtual reality (VR) applications.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of this research project can be applied to broad commercial markets outside of the AR and VR areas. For example, a personal appliance capable of playing television, and VCD/DVD video can be the most direct, obvious and may be the largest market for this technology. With this device, people can watch TV just as they listen to radio today, while conducting other activities. Endoscopy devices for medical microsurgery and engineering inspection are other application markets. This eye glasses-type, see-through, full-function display technology will facilitate remote Internet access, hands-free mobile video conferencing system, mobile video telephony, and entertainment systems, anywhere, anytime, and under any ambient light conditions.\r\n\r\n",
