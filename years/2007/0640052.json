 "awd_abstract_narration": "The West Indies contain one of the five primary biodiversity hot spots in the world. This region has many endemic plants and animals, unique plant/animal interactions, and an increasing rate of habitat transformation. Data from floristic surveys indicate that mosses and liverworts (bryophytes) represent prominent members of the threatened West Indian cloud forests. Data from temperate surveys suggest that bryophytes are important \"biodomes\" (from Latin domus, house) housing many moisture dependent microbes, particularly ciliated protozoans, testacean amoebae, and microcrustaceans. There is no clear explanation for this relationship. It is known that the more \"leafy\" bryophytes provide \"rough\" microcanopies that retain more moisture than the \"smooth\" microcanopies produced by bryophytes with more uniform textures. Differences in moisture retention between the rough and smooth bryophyte microcanopies may be important variables in explaining associated microbial diversity. It is hypothesized that bryophyte species producing rough microcanopies support higher microbe diversity than bryophyte species providing smooth microcanopies. Transect sampling in cloud forests will provide data for determining bryophyte diversity, cover, and microcanopy type. Specimens will be collected, identified, and preserved and species diversity will be estimated for bryophytes, protists, and microcrustaceans. Analyses will be preformed on the data to test the bryophyte microcanopy forms /microbe diversity hypothesis. This project provides an opportunity to survey poorly known groups such as bryophytes and their associated microbes in a threatened habitat within a world's biodiversity hot spot. New knowledge from this research will be valuable for habitat conservation and restoration. Students and university faculty from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic participating in this project will gain expertise in sampling, data analysis, and specimen identification, preparation, and preservation.\r\n",
