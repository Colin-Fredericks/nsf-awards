 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide support for 5-6 very talented young scientitsts to participate and present their research findings at the Workshop on Steriod Hormones and Brain Function to be held in Breckenridge, CO on March 27-31, 2007.  The Young Investigator Symposium will serve as a key forum for stimulating novel scientific initiatives between junior and senior investigators within and across disciplines. The high quality of science that these young investigators present coupled with the opportunity  to meet and discuss their research will facilitate the integrations of innovative topics and cutting edge technologies that can benefit both junior and senior researchers alike. This year's focus will be on the neural basis of gender differences in behaviral responses obeserved across classes of vertebrates, a timely topic. The Young Investogator Symposium will showcase new researchers and will nurture emerging talent in the field by recognizing both the contribution and future potential of young investigators, including women and underrepresented minorities involved in research in neuroendocrinology. This Symposium is known for identifying and nurturing researchers who go on to write highly competitive proposals that are funded by the NSF.",
