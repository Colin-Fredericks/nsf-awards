 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior to construction, NEON, Inc.'s Project Management Office must complete a Project Execution Plan (PEP) that includes a final design with detailed scientific, technical, and functional requirements, a network deployment plan, site-dependent construction and operations costs, and implementation schedule. This award will support several critical functions necessary to maintain the NEON Project Management Office final design activities, business services, and production cyberinfrastructure initiation. This award will provide funds to expand the level two manager and business services staffing of the NEON, Inc.'s Project Management Office. Funds will support project management accounting and reporting functions and continuation of the NEON, Inc.?s business processes (accounting, procurement, human resources, recruiting). In addition to project engineers and level 2 managers, funds are provided for proposals (RFP) to contract for services to NEON, Inc. to 1) fully capture technical and functional requirements, protocols, and policies and procedures necessary for the first phase of the production CI design and 2) requirements, design, installation, and training for the NEON Operations support cyberinfrastructure. The first phase of production cyberinfrastructure design is focused on data modeling and data strategy; computing, storage, and archival architecture; network and information security design which include technical designs, risk mitigation strategies, and deployment plans. A priority for this phase will be reports detailing and analyzing the CI research and development activities completed during the preliminary design phase.",
