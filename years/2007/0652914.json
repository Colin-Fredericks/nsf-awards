 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program explores quantum dynamical processes for individual atoms strongly coupled to the field of an optical cavity. The general theme of the project is an investigation of the dynamics of open quantum systems in manifestly quantum domains. The specific setting for the research is that of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) in a domain of strong coupling whereby single atoms and photons can profoundly impact the evolution of the composite system. \r\nOne component of the research program makes use of traditional Fabry-Perot resonators with extremely high mirror reflectively. Specific research projects in this component include the realization of reversible emission and absorption of single photons, quantum teleportation of the polarization state of a photon to the internal state of a trapped atom, and the demonstration of quantum measurement of atomic motion beyond the standard quantum limit. To continue the quest for yet stronger interactions of single atoms and photons, a second component of the research develops a new paradigm for cavity QED by employing lithographically fabricated microresonators, which have the potential to achieve equivalent reflectivities one hundred times greater than in the Fabry-Perot resonators. The whispering gallery modes of microtoroidal resonators are exploited to generate nonclassical fields and to realize quantum interactions of multiple atom-resonator systems mediated by single-photon pulses.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the broader impact of the proposed research, cavity QED with strong coupling propels optical physics beyond traditional nonlinear optics and laser physics into a new regime with dynamical processes now involving atoms and photons taken one by one. The work utilize interactions in cavity QED to enable complex quantum networks, with each atom-cavity system functioning as a \"quantum node\" in a network linked by fiber optics. Such capabilities would impact quantum computation, communication, and metrology, as well as quantum information processing on atom chips. The research also makes important contributions to education and human resources by way of advanced scientific and technical training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars in areas of immediate importance to the nation's technological future.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Project Outcomes Report \nNSF Grant PHY-0652914 \"Cavity QED with Localized Atoms\"\nAugust 1, 2007 - July 31, 2012\nThe overall scientific directions of this research program were related to investigations of the dynamics of open quantum systems in manifestly quantum (i.e., nonclassical) domains. The research program was both theoretical and experimental in character and exploited recently discovered possibilities in the microscopic realm of quantum mechanics to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be impossible by traditional classical means, including new capabilities for precision measurement and for the processing and distribution of information.\nWithin this context, the outcomes of the research include new realizations of interactions between matter and light involving individual atoms and single light quanta (i.e., photons). The research program moved scientific capabilities beyond traditional nonlinear optics and laser physics with macroscopic numbers of atoms and photons into new regimes with phenomena involving coherent control of atoms and photons taken one by one. The research program addressed fundamental scientific questions related to quantum metrology, to quantum computation and communication, and to the general development of the field of quantum information science.\nSpecific noteworthy outcomes of the research program include the following:\n1. Photon transport dynamically regulated by one atom &ndash; By using lithographically formed, microscopic optical resonators, in 2008-2009 we demonstrated robust, efficient mechanisms for the regulated transport of photons \u00e6one-by-one\u00c6. A single atom within an optical resonator dynamically controlled the reflection and transmission of the resonator, thereby functioning as a \u00e6photon turnstile\u00c6 and a \u00e6photon router.\u00c6\n2. Quantum control of single phonons via strong coupling to 1 atom &ndash; In 2009-2010, we presented a theoretical scheme for achieving coherent control of single quanta of mechanical vibration (i.e., phonons) by strong coupling between 1 trapped atom and a mechanical oscillator.\n3. Ultra-high quality factors for mechanical oscillators through optical trapping &ndash; Inspired by exciting prospects from our theoretical analyses, in 2009-2012 we initiated research efforts to achieve strong coupling of a single atom to a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator and thereby to open a new frontier for the quantum manipulation of micro-mechanical oscillators. To reach a regime of quantum behavior of mechanical devices at room temperature, we analyzed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally new approaches that could substantially enhance mechanical quality factors beyond conventional material limits.\n4. Quantum information processing and state manipulation with atomic ensembles -In 2007 we demonstrated a system with the minimal functionality required for scalable quantum networks by creating, addressing, and controlling entanglement for two pairs of atomic ensembles at each of two quantum nodes. A further advance in 2008 was the initial realization of the coherent mapping of photonic entanglement to and from a pair of quantum memories. In 2010, we demonstrated (a) high-fidelity entanglement stored in four atomic memories; (b) user-controlled, coherent transfer of atomic entanglement to four photonic quantum channels; and (c) the characterization of full 4-party entanglement by way of quantum uncertainty relations. This work provides an important tool for the distribution of multipartite entanglement across quantum networks and is relevant to the challenge of entanglement characterization for interacting quantum systems. \nThe broader impacts of the research program included applications ranging from measurements of fundamental constants to the development of novel semiconductor devices to the deterministic generation of novel quantum states of light. The research program made contributions to education and human resources in areas of immediate importance to the nation's s..."
