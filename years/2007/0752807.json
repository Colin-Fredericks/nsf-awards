 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the 12th International Symposium on Equatorial Aeronomy (ISEA), to be held in Crete, Greece from May 18 to 24, 2008.   The ISEA is the premier meeting venue for researchers working on the low latitude atmosphere and ionosphere, including their coupling with other latitudinal and altitudinal regions.  The meetings occur every three to four years; the most recent past meetings have attracted 100 or more attendees, including students and postdocs.   Past meeting results have been published as a special issue of the Journal of Atmospheric, Solar, and Terrestrial Physics; 18 papers were published from ISEA-11 and thirty papers from ISEA-10.   Papers based on presentations from ISEA-12 will be published in a special section of the Annales Geophysicae.\r\n\r\nISEA-12 will cover a wide range of research areas:  lower and middle atmosphere dynamics, mesosphere and thermosphere dynamics, ionospheric electrodynamics, atmosphere/ionosphere coupling, plasma irregularities and instabilities, and space weather effects and diagnostics, as well as descriptions and discussions of new techniques, trends, and experiments.   The meeting will have 11 oral sessions, four poster sessions, and anticipates hosting 120 to 150 participants, including 30 to 40 graduate students.  This award is to enable attendance at this important international conference by US students and scientists.  First priority for funding will be given to students.  \r\n\r\n",
