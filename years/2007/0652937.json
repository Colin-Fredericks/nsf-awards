 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on enabling of a novel class of self-powered sensing systems based on ionomeric materials. The scientific objective of this research is to clearly identify the physical mechanism responsible for ionic polymer sensing and electromechanical energy harvesting response, and develop appropriate new methods of modeling, and integrating these ion-conducting polymer materials. Selective ion conduction arises in ionomeric materials due to the phase separation caused by charge aggregation in nanoscale 'clusters'. Selective ionic conductivity in polymeric materials gives rise to sensing and scavenging functionalities. Currently there are no engineering models that correlate ionic conduction in response to mechanical stimulus to the physics responsible for the response. \r\n\r\nThe program will consist of tasks that are focused on the equilibrium state and mechanical stimulus response of a single nanoscale cluster. The models are then extended to a multi-cluster system, enabling detailed study of the proposed streaming potential hypothesis. The experimental tasks, to be led by Virginia Tech, are designed to relate electrode architecture and ionomeric response to the hypothesis of streaming potential. \r\n\r\nThe research program will be integrated with the Positive Psychology educational initiative currently led by the PI. This initiative is designed to increase recruitment, retention, and performance of women in engineering, but is expected to benefit all prospective engineers. In its current early stages of development, this Positive Psychology initiative is generating student response at a rate that requires increased undergraduate-appropriate research projects. The proposed research will be implemented synergistically with the Positive Psychology initiative.\r\n",
