 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for a workshop to address scientific, technical, and organizational issues that pertain to launching USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN). Science issues to be addressed at this workshop include the selection and prioritization of appropriate plant species and events to observe, and development of observation protocols. The participants will formalize a standardized web-based reporting system for observers and develop a data management plan. The workshop will address organizational issues including observations site location, plans for public participation, and cooperative agreements with existing sites and networks. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits of the Workshop: The USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) is an emerging partnership among academic communities, federal agencies, and volunteers. An Implementation Team (IT) consisting of 28 scientists spanning multiple disciplines, institutions and related environmental networks has been established. The four observation tiers, represent different levels of spatial coverage and quality/quantity of phenological and related environmental information: 1) Locally intensive sites focused on process studies; 2) Spatially extensive scientific networks focused on large-scale phenomena; 3) Volunteer and Education Networks; and 4) Remote sensing products that can be ground-truthed and assimilated to extend surface phenological observations to the continental-scale. This second workshop will provide an essential component to: 1) Inform and guide final NPN design and implementation with sound science; 2) Finalize initial species and protocols for data collection by students, citizen-scientists, and scientists, starting in spring 2007, including lists of target species representative of the Nation's ecoregions and customized for each of four network tiers; 3) Plan initially needed web resources; 4) Develop an initial data management plan; and 5) Draft initial cooperative agreements for co-location at existing sites and networks. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: USA-NPN is a unique opportunity to increase collaboration between federal agencies and the academic community, to facilitate and recruit public participation in the study and understanding of Nature, and to serve public needs in Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Health, Recreation, and Natural Resources. The USA-NPN will actively support exchange and training programs for students and researchers from participating organizations, as well as participation by students, citizens, and scientists from under-represented communities in all network activities. The USA-NPN is committed to substantial participation from members of the public as citizen-scientist phenological observers.  \r\n",
