 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's software systems suffer from poor reliability and security,\r\nwith software errors costing the U.S. economy upwards of $60 billion\r\nannually.  This situation is likely to get worse, as the complexity of\r\nsoftware systems increases without a matching increase in the\r\neffectiveness of software quality tools and techniques. The situation\r\nis particularly challenging for concurrent systems, which pose\r\nsignificantly higher difficulties for software quality tools, yet are\r\nbecoming more widespread with the growing use of multicore machines.\r\n\r\nStatic analysis software-quality tools are very precise but do not\r\nscale well to large codes.  Testing is easy to use but for good\r\ncoverage requires extensive test suites.  We propose to bridge the gap\r\nbetween ad hoc testing and static analysis by combining them in a new\r\nscalable technique called predictive testing.  Predictive testing uses\r\nstatic program analysis to maximize the effectiveness of a given\r\ntest-suite for finding in the testing stage bugs that could manifest\r\nin real production runs. Although predictive testing tools use complex\r\nstatic analysis and automated theorem proving techniques internally,\r\nall of this complexity is hidden from the user by a testing usage\r\nmodel. For this reason, we expect that such tools can be easily\r\nintegrated into existing software engineering processes and will be\r\nusable even by unsophisticated developers.\r\n\r\n",
