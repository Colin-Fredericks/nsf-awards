 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II research project will address the need to see beyond ordinary human vision, which is critical to improvements in health care delivery, development of precision agriculture methods, guarantee of front-line responder safety and protection, and processing a safe food supply. Hyperspectral imaging, with its ability to capture hundreds of continuous spectra, delivers a valuable tool that provides enhanced visualization and analysis. Current systems tend to be space- or air-borne, large bulky modules that do not lend themselves to portable or hand-held solutions. This mini hyperspectral imager has at its core a novel MEMS monolithic, Fabry-Perot tunable filter and optical system and will be portable and handy, similar in size to a zoom camera in a cell phone. \r\n\r\nThis research and development effort will develop a family of innovative miniature hyperspectral imaging systems that potentially can have a significant impact. These systems can alert our modern war fighter and emergency first responders by seeing beyond our vision and identifying terrorist threats. It can safeguard our nation's water and food supplies by utilizing affordable hyperspectral systems to identify e-coli and other bacterial contaminations before they are consumed. \r\n",

Hyperspectral imaging, with its ability to capture hundreds of continuous spectra, delivers a valuable tool that provides enhanced visualization and analysis.

Our mini hyperspectral imager, which has at its core a novel MEMS monolithic, Fabry-Perot tunable filter and optical system, answers this need, proposed to be small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.  This enabling technology integrates photonics and electronics to create a robust tunable filter that when combined with an imager or other system provides great value to expanding current sensing capabilities and analytical tools, delivering improved situational information for rapid and informed decision-making.\n\nBefore we can discuss our accomplishments we need to set the set the stage by revisiting our commercialization strategy.

We went through a 2nd generation refinement of the design and fabrication to miniature and improve the operation. Empirical testing was completed successfully and final testing, awaits a functional TF.\n\nPackage miniaturization: A miniature package along with the electronics for battery operation was designed.
