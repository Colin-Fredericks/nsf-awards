 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a novel, real-time, state-of-the art power system simulation teaching and undergraduate research laboratory that incorporates actual computer-controlled hardware in the simulation loop. These resources are being used to develop and incorporate real-time simulation-based experiments into undergraduate power engineering education. As a part of this project, a new course on real-time power system simulation is being developed and taught, and six existing courses are being transformed to incorporate real-time simulation with hardware-in-the-loop experiments.  By incorporating real-time simulations with hardware-in-the-loop the power engineering curriculum is providing students with valuable hands on experience, helping them understand how real power systems and power system elements respond in real-time.  Instructional materials and project results are being disseminated by posting the material on a website, by conference and journal papers in both engineering education and power engineering venues, and through the laboratory equipment manufacturer's publications.  Evaluation efforts, led by an expert from the University's learning center, are using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods to monitor progress, and an external advisory committee with industrial members is overseeing the project. The broader impacts include the dissemination of materials and results, outreach and diversity efforts, and workshops for practicing engineers. \r\n",
