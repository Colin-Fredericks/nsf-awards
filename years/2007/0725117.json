 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lawrence Friedman of the University of Pittsburgh is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow for the 2007-2008 academic year.  Friedman's research will focus on the capture of carbon dioxide using a set of novel, ionic liquid-based polymers.  These polymers will be designed, synthesized and characterized in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh in collaboration with Professor Toby Chapman.  Friedman and his students also will collaborate with Dr. David Luebke of the National Energy Technology Laboratory to evaluate the effectiveness of the polymers for separation of carbon dioxide from gas streams and flue gases produced in coal-burning electric power plants.\r\n\r\nThe service component of this project includes developing and teaching a short course on green chemistry and organizing a seminar program that will bring leaders in green chemistry and chemical engineering to the University to make technical presentations and interact with students.  In addition, undergraduates will contribute to the development of green chemistry laboratory projects for mainstream introductory and organic chemistry courses.  These students also will be involved with outreach with the University's College in High School program and with the Bidwell Training Center's Chemical Technician program.  This project addresses an important national and global environmental issue, the reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and creates unique collaborations among University students and faculty and technical personnel at the National Energy Technology Laboratory.  \r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program seeks new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.\r\n",
