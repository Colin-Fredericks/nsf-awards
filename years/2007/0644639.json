Knowledge on the basic and critical issues of how such anthropogenic particles \"fit in\" and modify biological assemblies, whether they be in plant or animal, is still very limited.\r\nThis project is therefore devoted to providing some of this critically important environmental information through a highly synergistic scientific approach.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nParticulate matter (PM) ranks as one of the principle pollutants linked to acute and chronic physiological ailments.  These particles, sized less than 200x smaller than a grain of sand, are generated by both natural and anthropogenic sources with the latter primarily consisting of fuel combustion processes from utilities, vehicles and industrial emitters.\n\nWith an understanding of the toxicity of micrometer-sized pollutant particles becoming clearer, a new frontier in epidemiology is emerging with attention directed toward smaller, nanoparticle pollutants.  Due to their prevalence, nanoparticles certainly pack a punch compared with the larger particulates.  In fact, it has been estimated that these \"ultrafine\" particles of less 0.1 mm (PM0.1) account for 80% of the particle number concentration in urban environments.\n\nWith this in mind, we have developed a set of approaches to specifically study the biochemical interactions of carbonaceous nanoparticles.\n\nComputer simulation is a standard R&amp;D tool used to gain a fundamental understanding of macroscopic phenomena and optimize design.  Once established, models and simulations can minimize development cost or time and elucidate mechanisms in a manner sometimes unobtainable by experiments, e.g., the correlation between contaminant particle size and toxicity.\n\nMany biological, chemical, and material processes, however, are too large to be efficiently simulated by conventional molecular modeling approaches, but require molecular level insight that can not be provided by the continuum based methods.  We developed a computational approach designed to fill that void and provide the necessary tools to tackle simulation of these mesoscopic-sized systems.\n\nThis study combines classical biological experiments, biophysical methods and computational modeling for a more detailed determination of carbonaceous nanomaterial interaction with a biological membrane than classical biology alone would have provided.
