Sikavitsas, University of Oklahoma Norman Campus\r\n\r\nIn tissue engineering, often the cells require extended in vitro culturing on the scaffold prior to transplantation to proliferate and to achieve extended extracellular matrix deposition. Bioreactors have been developed to provide improved nutrient transport in the cells residing at the interior pores of such scaffolds. This research project goal is the detailed characterization (to a micrometer level) of the fluid dynamic environment in the porous network of biodegradable cell/scaffold constructs for tissue regeneration in bioreactors with continuous flow perfusion. Integration of experiments, theory and numerical simulations will investigate the effect of convective flow perfusion in 3D scaffolds relevant for bone tissue engineering on i) cell detachment, ii) shear forces on the scaffold walls iii) spatial distribution of nutrients in the three-dimensional porous network, iv) cell proliferation and distribution, v) osteoblastic behavior, and vi) mineralized extracellular matrix deposition. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. The project goals are to: 1. Investigate the effect of convective flow perfusion in 3D scaffolds for bone tissue engineering on cell detachment differentiation and extracellular matrix deposition. 2. Characterize in detail the fluid flow environment within the porous scaffold, while the 3D configuration changes due to tissue growth. 3. Develop a theoretical framework to explore the potential existence of concentration gradients of nutrients critical for tissue growth using direct simulations of flow and transport in the porous space. 4. Validate the theoretical models and predictions experimentally and use the theoretical developments in the detailed understanding of the effect of shear forces on osteoblastic cells in a 3D environment. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. This research attempts to characterize in a micrometer scale the fluid dynamic environment in these scaffolds to provide a necessary tool to better understand cell behavior under fluid shear forces in complex 3D environments. It will allow for the first time the rational design of the porous network of tissue engineering 3D scaffolds. The educational aspect will include the incorporation of the research in the material of two elective graduate courses in \"Tissue engineering\" and \"Industrial and Environmental Transport Processes\" and a course for professionals in the region of Oklahoma through the University of Oklahoma Continuing Education Program.  Furthermore, the project will leverage the proposed educational activities with the activities of the recently established Oklahoma University Bioengineering Center. The project will, thus, serve the dual goal of encouraging the transition of undergraduate students to graduate school, and of preparing a group of the technical workforce of our State for cutting edge engineering technologies. \r\n\r\n",
