 "awd_abstract_narration": "Who is likely to be the more ambitious and hard-working employee--the one who was born into privilege and attended excellent private schools, or the one who, starting from the most humble beginnings, clawed her way out of the ghetto and worked to put herself through college?  Hiring and promotion decisions are some of the most important ones in any organization, and they are filled with exactly this sort of difficult attribution problem. Job candidates vary with respect to both their abilities and obstacles they have had to overcome. The question posed in this research is whether those making the selection and promotion decisions can adequately adjust for the difficulty of success when making inferences about what performance signals about abilities. \r\n\r\nPeople too readily take performance at face value. This project examines the correspondence bias in the domain of performance evaluation, asking whether those evaluating performance correctly take into account the situational constraints that may have impeded performance or the fortuitous circumstances than may have enhanced it. In particular, the proposed research would explore the degree to which the correspondence bias (1) leads university admissions decisions to excessively favor applicants who come from institutions with lenient grading, and (2) enhances the promotability of managers who happen to have easy job assignments.",
