 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is a critical enabler of national importance for expanding scientific discovery and industrial applications. To realize CI?s full potential, domain scientists need to easily run their existing applications on the CI available to them.  Scientists also need to be able to design their future applications in a way that allows them to take advantage of an ever-changing and growing CI. However, the current technology used to create CI applications presents two problems: (1) they are either too generic and do not provide the right level of abstraction to allow experts in diverse domains to easily code their application logic; or (2) they are too specific, in most cases following a stove-pipe development process, resulting in rigid and expensive solutions that do not promote the reuse of commonalities across domains.\r\n \r\nLeveraging an innovative and successful international industry and university partnership called Latin American Grid (LA Grid) for this PIRE project, Florida International University's (FIU) School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida Atlantic University's (FAU) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and IBM Research Worldwide (China, France, India, Japan, USA), together with the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (Mexico), Tsinghua University (China), the Universidad Nacional de La Plata (Argentina), the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (Spain), are developing methodologies, platforms, and tools for creating CI applications in a way that eases the application development process and makes the resulting applications more adaptive to future changes of CI. The approach is application-driven and is focused on: (1) supporting CI-enablement for carefully chosen critical application domains, e.g. hurricane mitigation, bioinformatics and healthcare, and (2) developing common methodologies, services and tools for CI-enabled applications in these domains. The technology and tools created by the partners have broad significance and utility to both scientific discovery and industrial/societal applications.\r\n\r\nStudents from U.S. universities, including underrepresented minorities, are engaged and each participant receives multiple perspectives in each of three different aspects of collaboration as they work with local and international researchers, in  academic and industrial research labs, on basic and applied research projects.  Consequently, PIRE students are able to participate in the full research pipeline from inception of ideas, through basic research, to practical applications with a wide choice of collaborators and international experiences.\r\n\r\nBy training a globally engaged workforce and by driving sustainable international partnerships with shared infrastructure and resources, through which faculty, students and industry scientists/engineers collaborate to solve critical and nationally-important complex scientific problems, this activity aims to have  a major impact on American competitiveness.  \r\n\r\nThis PIRE project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) with co-funding from the Office of Cyber Infrastructure (OCI).",
