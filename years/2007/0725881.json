 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this research is to investigate new spin tunnel junction and spin transistor devices enabled by high-resistivity boron-carbide (B-C) semiconductors. The approach is to use the unique properties of semiconducting B-C (bandgap tunability, high interfacial spin density of states with ferromagnets, and small spin-orbit coupling) as a barrier material in spin devices) and to conduct spin-resolved photoemission, near-atomic-scale characterization, transport measurements, and device modeling. The research aims are to study novel non-oxide barrier layers which will enable efficient spin injection and detection even near ambient temperatures as well as less-demanding, highly-robust, scalable fabrication of spintronic and ultrafast devices. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit lies in the ability to correlate the interface electronic states, structure, and transport behavior and so to understand and optimize properties of the proposed, and future, magnetic tunnel junction devices. This will offer insight to other spintronics approaches by clearly delineating the role that the above parameters play in contributing to spin transport properties. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nThe research will spur investigation of non-oxide barriers and open a path to efficient spin-injection devices using non-magnetic semiconductors. The research team will increase graduate student research participation from under-represented groups (particularly women), train graduate students in sophisticated experimental and modeling techniques, and provide them with national networking opportunities not available regionally. For outreach, especially to rural Nebraska, hands-on science and technology learning modules based on semiconducting BC will be developed as model in-class resources for teachers and will be integrated with planned growth of the NSF/UNL Cosmic Ray Observatory Program. \r\n\r\n",
