DataLogger supports reliable data transport and the integration of sensors and remote instruments into Cyberinfrastructure through a set of services supporting data streaming and management. Work areas include visualization, single sign-on, adding datalogger drivers, benchmarking, porting to 64-bit architectures, and other enhancements. Intellectual merit lies in the realization of bringing sensors into the CI continuum and insights gained in applying this technology to observing systems. Broad impact includes direct operational integration for a number of NSF observing systems, including NEON, NEES, and CUAHSI.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
