 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electro-elastomers are large strain electroactive polymers that have revolutionized smart materials research with the potential to advance the areas of prosthetic devices, endoscopic surgery, compliant robots, and adaptive structures.  The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop new nonlinear analysis techniques and modeling tools to study the dynamic response of large deformation polymeric actuation materials.  New actuators with the novel biomimetic capabilities of peristaltic motion and gripping/grasping are proposed.  Light, compliant, nondestructive constructs that can permeate obscure hard to reach areas are needed for a variety of applications.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This research seeks to develop a continuum model that combines Maxwell-Faraday electrostatics and nonlinear elasticity to describe the dynamic response of electro-elastomers configured for peristaltic motion and gripping/grasping, and to also characterize the constitutive response of newly synthesized acrylic copolymers for improved electromechanical actuation. \r\n\r\n Broader Impacts: Supported students will be immersed in both theoretical and experimental environments and will gain an interdisciplinary experience through direct collaboration with the Chemistry Department at Virginia Tech.  The advancement of smart materials research in the area of electroactive polymers will provide the means to attain significant health-related goals that were thought previously unattainable in orthotics/prosthetics, endoscopic surgery, and robotics.\r\n",
