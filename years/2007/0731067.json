Lee, Program Director, (703) 292-5356\r\n\r\n\tThe main goal for this work is to develop the intellectual framework necessary for engineering and managing an international reverse supply chain from a sustainability perspective.  The PIs take a case study approach using the reverse supply chain for personal computers in the U.S. The research consists of three components. The first component consists of a material flows analysis to understand the global reach of the end-of-life computers from the U.S. The analysis will stimulate methodological development due to the lack of supporting data infrastructures addressing used goods and materials for recycling. The second component consists of understanding the environment and development aspects of different paths for this reverse supply chain. A new method/perspective termed Global Paths Analysis will be developed, which traces and assesses environmental, economic, and social characteristics of flows of end-of-life processes through different nations. The third component explores the earth systems engineering of technology systems incorporating both engineering and social/policy contexts.\r\n\r\n\tRecycling of electronics receives a great deal of attention from policy-makers and the public, although the mass share of material flows of both toxic and benign substances is small.  Despite the focus of attention from governments, non-governmental organizations, and the media, relatively little research has been conducted to inform the broader implications and management strategies of international product/material reverse flows.  This project can make a key contribution to the policy and public discourse.  The case study of personal computers will also be appealing for educational activities for middle school students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. The educational modules and research results will be disseminated through the Center for Sustainable Engineering.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
