 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nPrior research on data integration led\r\nto XML mediators, which provide to applications a\r\nvirtual integrated XML view\r\nthat allows a single point of access to the data of\r\nmultiple distributed and heterogeneous information sources.\r\nConsequent industrial products address \r\nEnterprise Information Integration\r\nand follow the Global-As-View paradigm,\r\nwhere the owner specifies the integrated\r\nview as an XQuery function of the source views.\r\n\r\nThe emergence of Service-Oriented Architectures\r\nand large scale Internet-based data integration, which\r\nis often needed in the science domains,\r\nrenders Global-As-View-based information insufficient to benefit from\r\nthe emerging opportunities and inefficient in large scale environments.\r\nService-Oriented Architectures provide live data access\r\nat data sets by offering a set of web service calls to them,\r\nas opposed to (the studied in prior works) \r\nfull query access to the data sets.\r\nLarge scale data integration highlights the deployment, development\r\nand maintenance bottleneck that the Global-As-View paradigm\r\ncreates by requiring the integrated view owner to have knowledge\r\nof the schema, data formats and semantics of all sources.\r\n\r\nThe proposed mediator provides a scalable solution\r\nby employing a new Global-Local-As-View paradigm in an XML setting:\r\nEach source owner can become responsible for fitting her source\r\ndata and web services to the integrated view.\r\n\r\nFundamental algorithmic and system innovations \r\nare needed for the implementation of the paradigm.\r\nFirst, queries over the integrated view must be rewritten to use the \r\nsource services and data. Existing algorithms for rewriting\r\nrelational queries over relational views \r\nare not sufficient, as they do not address services and\r\nthe rich structure of XML queries. Second, the source owner needs\r\nan appropriate language and visual tools to export interfaces in\r\na way that can range from full access to the\r\nunderlying database to a few parameterized queries and anywhere\r\ninbetween. Finally, the client needs corresponding systems\r\nto comprehend which XQueries can be asked on the integrated view.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the above fundamental contributions will enable\r\nthe development of the rewriting module of the UCSD-XMED XQuery\r\nmediator,  which can become a valuable information sharing \r\nand publishing component,  especially for science portals where \r\nscientists will connect their databases \r\nof experimental data to XML-based portals for integrated access\r\nto scientific information. The UCSD-XMED query processor will be\r\nused by graduate and undergraduate students in database and\r\nmiddleware technologies.\r\n\r\nUpdates about the project, including its people, software \r\ndistributions and publications are available at \r\nhttp://db.ucsd.edu/NSF07xmlMed/",
