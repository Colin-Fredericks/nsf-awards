The program will engage 10 undergraduates each year for three years in a 10-week summer research experience.  The objective of this REU Site is to introduce undergraduates with engineering and science backgrounds to a diverse research environment involving bioengineering at the molecular and cellular level.  The four goals of the project are to: 1) focus on the recruitment and selection of undergraduates from institutions with modest levels of molecular and cellular bioengineering research; 2) introduce the undergraduates to a diversified research program in molecular and cellular bioengineering; 3) promote team-based and cross-disciplinary research within this field; and 4) expand the student's knowledge of emerging technologies and trends, preparing them for graduate studies or a professional career.\r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will be focused on undergraduates from institutions with modest levels of molecular and cellular bioengineering research. In particular, recruitment efforts are targeted towards students from major liberal arts colleges, institutions without graduate programs, or institutions without bioengineering activities.\r\n\r\nAn important aspect of this REU is the potential involvement of students from many disciplines and backgrounds in the exciting area of molecular and cellular bioengineering.  Students will be brought in from chemistry, biochemistry, physics, and biology in addition to chemical engineering undergraduate programs.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
