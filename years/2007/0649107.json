 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pennsylvania State University will host 10 undergraduate students to participate in a ten-week program in Astrobiology. The program focuses on the early evolution of life on Earth and the possibilities for life in the Universe through multidisciplinary studies in biology, chemistry, geosciences, and astronomy. Participants undertake original research directed by faculty mentors. Questions that have been addressed in the past include the timing of the rise in oxygen, methane, and other components of the atmosphere, the temperature of the Earth's surface through time, microbial activity and how it influenced the environment at different times, global glaciations (snowball Earth events), the diversification of eukaryotes including plants, animals, and fungi, and detection and evolution of extrasolar planets. Aside from 10 weeks of intensive research, the program includes an orientation, field trips, interactions with graduate students, and weekly meetings that include astrobiology professors. Professional development activities include communication skills enhancement and a seminar on applying to graduate school. The program concludes with a symposium during which students give a presentation of their research. Publication in a scientific journal is encouraged. For further information and application materials, please contact Blair Hedges at astrobio@bio.psu.edu, (814) 869-9991, or visit HTTP://EVO.BIO.PSU.EDU/ASP/.",
