 "awd_abstract_narration": "This team plans to better understand the gecko adhesion and dynamics, and to carry over this understanding into the design and fabrication of hierarchical analogues. There are three main goals the interdisciplinary team plans to achieve over the next four years: 1.) Improved fundamental understanding and development of models describing 'frictional adhesion', 2) Development of adhesion metrics and test standards for natural and artificial adhesive systems, and 3.) Design and fabrication of bioinspired articulated reversible adhesives integrating nano-, micro- and macro-scale components for adhesion and micro-robotic applications. By addressing the system through three cohesive goals, the team hopes to make significant gains into understanding and mimicking this unique and useful system.\r\nReversible, reusable adhesives have applications in many areas including health and medicine, robotics and manufacturing. The general area of adhesion science is one that can be successfully utilized to excite and motivate students of many levels. A website and experiments are planned to not only bring together the scientific community studying this problem, but also to excite students of all levels, which demonstrate the basics of adhesion science. These experiments could be viewed on the web or used in classroom situations (i.e. materials are inexpensive and readily available).  In addition, we propose the creation of a nano-art show to bring the realm of nanotechnology to the public.  Finally, we plan to have students (graduate and undergraduate) travel between the three collaborative institutions as part of internship/exchange programs.  This will give students invaluable access to expertise of all five investigators, as well as access to facilities and portions of the research to which they would otherwise not be exposed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
