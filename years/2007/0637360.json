 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I research project addresses the problem of tinnitus that afflicts millions of Americans, and millions more internationally. Tinnitus, or \"ringing in the ears,\" is a common and often debilitating ailment with no current cure. A common device used to ameliorate tinnitus is a \"tinnitus mask,\" which provides external audible stimulation to the brain. The brain focuses on this external noise instead of the artificial \"ringing\" that it is generating. Each person's response is different because tinnitus varies by individual. This project addresses the needs of individual tinnitus sufferers by applying interactive evolutionary computation to discover tinnitus masks that are optimal for the individual, and can adapt to the individual over time. The research objectives include having tinnitus sufferers test prototype software to determine the ease and effectiveness of the program, and to optimize the evolutionary computing that facilitates it. The research will use statistical measures for assessment and will follow accepted protocols for human subjects. The anticipated result is a new technology that can greatly benefit millions of Americans, and millions more internationally, at low cost, with simple distribution using the Internet. It also offers the possibility to advance discovery in addressing tinnitus.\r\n\r\nThis research project has far reaching implications. As many as 13 million Americans suffer significantly from tinnitus, and 50 million Americans are afflicted. There is no current cure for tinnitus, and few options are available, leading to significant market pull. Tinnitus masks can be effective, but effectiveness is limited because each individual case is different. Tinnitus sufferers are often desperate for help, and will spend hours searching the Internet for information. The price of common tinnitus masks ranges from $50 to $250. The commercial value of penetrating the American market at 2 percent of significant sufferers, even when priced at the low end of competitive products, is in excess of $4 million. The software will be delivered easily over the Internet, making distribution costs minimal, and expanding marketing internationally. The potential societal impact is important, both in terms of potential reduced afflictions but also the possibility for reduced medical treatment with less need for calming drugs. By examining commonalities of tinnitus masks evolved for different people, it may be possible to learn more about the properties of effective tinnitus masks, and also more about tinnitus itself.\r\n\r\n",
