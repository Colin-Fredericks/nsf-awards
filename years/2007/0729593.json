 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for travel support for student participation in the 38th Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics which takes place in Calgary, Canada, June 5-9, 2007. For the sixth consecutive year, a satellite student tutorial is being held on Tuesday, June 5. This tutorial will consist of special talks, geared toward students, on topics of current intense interest to the DAMOP community. Travel support from this award is limited to U.S. students, primarily graduate students but including advanced undergraduate students in appropriate cases. Awards will be based on the anticipated contribution by the individual to the Conference, and distance of travel. Support will average $300 per award, and it is anticipated that 40 such awards will be made. The support of students through this grant makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists in the field of AMO physics.",
