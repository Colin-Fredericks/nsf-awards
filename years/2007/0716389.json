Typical examples of identities include your name and your social-security number, or your fingerprint/iris-scan, or your address, or your (non-revoked) Public-Key coming from some trusted public-key infrastructure. In many situations, however, where you are defines your identity. For example, we know the role of a bank-teller behind a bullet-proof bank window not because he or she shows us her\r\ncredentials but by merely knowing her location. In this proposal, we ask the following question: is it possible to have the \"\"geographical position\"\" of a party take part in defining the set of credentials\r\nshe has? What are the new possibilities in terms of what we can achieve in this setting?\r\n\r\nFirst, we propose to consider the central task in this setting, i.e.,\r\nsecurely verifying the position of a device. Despite much work in this area, we have preliminary results that show that in the \"\"vanilla\"\" (i.e., standard) model, the above task (i.e., of secure\r\npositioning) is impossible to achieve.\r\n\r\nWe  propose to study the proof of position in the bounded storage model (i.e. where we assume some bound on the total memory of the adversary).\r\nIn this setting, we wish to achieve   two tasks: secure positioning, and position-based key exchange. While the question of secure positioning has been asked in the past, no satisfactory answers exist. \r\n\r\nThe second question (of position-based key exchange) has not been asked in the past. We also ask a broader question: whether position-based Secure Multi-Party Computation can be achieved in this setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
