CADIS will provide the discovery, access, and use of scientific data by providing near-real-time data delivery, a repository for data storage, a portal for the discovery, and tools to manipulate data. This system and data service will be built in a stepwise coherent manner and result in comprehensive long-term management for Arctic scientific data. CADIS will be a joint effort of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), and the National Center for Atmospheric Research  (NCAR). The project team will develop a new body of cyberinfrastructure by leveraging, integrating, and extending UCAR's Community Data Portal (CDP) framework and Unidata's THREDDS environment to form the CADIS system and portal. The CADIS portal will make it easier for scientists to locate, display, subset, publish, and analyze related data sets provided by a network of data providers. In the first year, a metadata plan will be completed; it will include AON projects and Long Term Observatory (LTO) projects. In the second year, the CADIS portal will be populated with metadata from the AON and LTO projects. In the third year, real-time delivery through CADIS of selected AON and IASOA  (International Arctic System for Observing the Atmosphere) data will be accomplished, and tools for searching via a map interface, and a map server showing the location of selected AON or SEARCH components (where metadata are available) will be added. Also in the third year, system performance will be evaluated and documented, and a future direction charted. Guidance from the scientific and lay user communities will be key to implementing the CADIS facility. Information will be received via questionnaires, meetings, standing committees and individual queries to assess CADIS effectiveness and recommend improvements. This project is highly relevant to International Polar Year goals for developing comprehensive data management plans and creating legacy data sets. The intellectual merit lies in the stepwise development of a new cyberinfrastructure for management of Arctic scientific data. The broader impact of CADIS is that it creates a foundation for long-term access to data archives, discovery, delivery and analysis by the Arctic science community and other users.\r\n",

Figure 2 shows some AON investigation sites on one of three maps views (one can also use Google Earth or a traditional GIS).\n\n \n\nThe most significant lasting accomplishment of CADIS may be the metadata authoring tool.  Metadata are a collection of words that describe data in a standard format.  If a data set has good metadata, it is easier to find those data, using search engines or data portals, even if one does not know that that particular collection of data exists.   Usually, a data center like NSIDC, the NOAA national data centers, or NCAR has specialists write metadata for data sets. This can be inefficient, however.   CADIS developed the metadata authoring tool to be a more cost effective solution for NSF\u00c6s arctic data.   Figure 3 is a screenshot of the CADIS metadata authoring tool as it would appear to an investigator entering metadata. \n\n \n\nAON was envisioned as \"&hellip;a system of atmospheric, land- and ocean-based environmental monitoring capabilities--from ocean buoys to satellites--that will significantly advance our observations of Arctic environmental conditions\".  Its data service was envisioned as a portal through which scientists can archive their data and thereby meet NSF sponsor obligations; can find all data relevant to a location or process; can browse imagery and complete documentation; may plot online time series or fields; and can query multiple datasets and sources (see the Data Management chapter of the Polar Research Board\u00c6s 2006 report, Toward an Integrated Arctic Observing Network).  Some implications of these envisioned features were that all data have metadata at a detailed level (often called granule, file, or inventory level metadata in contrast to collection level metadata), stored in a relational database, and that data are in a standard format.

From a technical standpoint, data set identifiers remain major hurdles in spite of the progress of the international community on this issue. Arriving at the specialized controlled vocabularies needed before semantic search can work remains out of reach, as does inventory level metadata or easy-to-use translators to get all data into a standard format like netCDF. Nonetheless, substantial progress has been made relati..."
