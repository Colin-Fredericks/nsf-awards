 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project addresses the development of general principled methods\r\nto efficiently include domain knowledge expressed as constraints into \r\nclustering algorithms. This not only allows improved clustering quality \r\nand algorithm performance but also finding insights that are novel and \r\nuseful with respect to existing domain expertise. For example, phylogenetic \r\ntrees built using hierarchical clustering should be consistent with existing \r\ndomain knowledge such as that several species could not have evolved from \r\none another. \r\n\r\nExisting clustering under constraints work has focused on non-hierarchical \r\nclustering with conjunctions of must-link and cannot-link constraints that \r\nassert that two objects must or must not be in the same cluster. This work \r\ncan be interpreted as expressing knowledge using a limited logic comprised \r\nof instances as objects, two binary relations (must-link and cannot-link) \r\nand a single connector (and).\r\n\r\nThis project will make three primary contributions. Firstly, it will examine \r\na more complete logic to represent knowledge by adding in new relations, a \r\ncomplete set of connectives (not, and, or, implication), universal and \r\nexistential quantifiers and new objects. This logic can express a large \r\nvariety of knowledge such as minimum/maximum cluster separation, cluster \r\nwidth and even forcing distributions of certain objects across clusters. \r\nSecondly, it will investigate incorporating constraints beyond non-hierarchical \r\nclustering algorithms into algorithms for hierarchical agglomerative clustering, \r\ngraph and social network clustering, and feature selection for clustering. \r\nLastly, it will explore the computational challenges of using constraints by \r\nidentifying easy to satisfy sets of constraints and developing a framework to \r\nexplain why some constraint sets are more useful than others.  \r\n\r\nThis project will demonstrate and validate its technical contributions on two \r\ncore application domains: analysis of pandemic micro-simulations results to \r\naid in disaster preparation and image mining. The long term vision is to \r\nincorporate knowledge efficiently in a principled manner into other data mining \r\ntasks such as classification, anomaly detection and association rules.  \r\n\r\nProject outreach for high school and undergraduates students will be in the \r\nform of hands-on discovery learning courses with emphasis on the two core \r\napplication domains. For graduate students and researchers the tutorial slides, \r\npapers, datasets and software generated from the project will be freely \r\navailable. \r\n\r\nFurther information on this project may be found at the URLs \r\nhttp://www.constrained-clustering.org and http://www.cs.albany.edu/~davidson.",
