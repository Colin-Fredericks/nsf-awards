 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award supports the development of a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional graduate training program of education and research in Intelligent Diagnostics at Northeastern University and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez with partnerships with more than a dozen industrial and government partners.  A unifying framework for research and education in Intelligent Diagnostics emphasizes hands-on experience and the use of a suite of experimental TestBEDs for education and research. Experts in civil engineering, computer/signal processing and public policy educate trainees to address the national need for experts in intelligent diagnostics.  Trainees participate in a unifying \"Boot Camp,\" research workshops, short courses, weekly round tables, and an Urban Studio with integration of policy; they benefit from industry and government partnerships throughout their training. \r\n\r\nThe structured interdisciplinary education and training approach to early recognition and successful management of creeping damage associated with aging civil infrastructure systems will prepare graduates to address intelligent diagnostics in a wide range of physical systems.  The goal for trainees is to learn how to systematically monitor the health of society's civil infrastructure, prescribe cost effective procedures for the remediation of problems, and prevent catastrophic collapse, all within the context of public policy.  The program fosters disciplinary and cultural background diversity. Graduates will be diagnostic engineers whose training integrates advanced detection and diagnostics methods, understanding of physical systems and economic and management issues.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Intelligent Diagnostics IGERT training program was implemented collaboratively by Northeastern University and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez and engaged 41 graduate students (27 who are women or minority students) in unifying research to translate measured data into useful information about the health and integrity of aging infrastructure systems. PhD students and faculty focused on the integration between domain and inversion expertise to achieve reliable and effective diagnostic solutions.   Domain experts brought understanding of the physical system to inform this research.   The diagnostic solutions focused on damage detection and lifecycle planning; hence, Intelligent Diagnostics.  This multidisciplinary research focused on the:\n\n \n\nDevelopment of models;\nSolution of inverse problems;\nValidation and optimization through experiments;\nInterpretation and context; and\nSensor networks and data management.\n\n\n \n\nThe integrated training program included:\n\n \n\nFirst year community building experiences including \"boot camp\" style seminars, \"round tables\" to discuss multidisciplinary aspects and policy implications, \"urban studios\" for the in-depth study of policy challenges, and \"ID challenge\" enabling students to apply algorithms to existing models and structures;\nCohesive education program engaging leading researchers, educators, and practitioners in the mentorship of graduate research students;\nExperimental and practical training with integrated and realistic TestBEDs including SoilBED, RoadBED, TierraBED &ndash; experiments performed on these TestBEDs resulted in data sets used by trainees in ID challenges;\nCoursework and activities that integrated policy, economics, and politics into technology solutions to teach engineers how to communicate effectively with policy makers; \nMulti-cultural education with participation from and at multi-geographic locations for weekly seminars and summer research projects;\nEducation integrated with research and closely linked to industry needs to address global diagnostics issues; and\nCareer development and mentoring opportunities.\n\n\n \n\nAll trainees actively participated in research proposal and dissemination activities.  They frequently participate at conferences through oral or poster presentations and often engage in annual meetings to update industry partners or funders.  In addition, they have engaged in career development activities to enable them to be fully aware of their career choices.  These activities have resulted in an ongoing dialogue among the IGERT trainees about their roles within the field of Intelligent Diagnostics and within society.\n\n \n\nResearch projects engaged IGERT trainees on variety of use-inspired and purposeful research projects.  These include, the development of numerical models and the validation of these models to diagnose damage using a variety of sensing modalities including accelerometers, acoustics, and radar.  Trainees have implemented sensing and health monitoring algorithms on full-scale structures including the Zhanjiang Bay Bridge in South China.  The VOTERS Center for Infrastructure Assessment engaged a number of IGERT Trainees.  This VOTERS research resulted in 4 patent applications put forth by faculty teams mentoring IGERT Trainees.  Through their integrated and multidisciplinary education, IGERT Trainees were able to contribute in unique ways to the VOTERS platform, which automates the collection, processing of data, and the presentation of data for decision-making purposes.  Policy considerations enabled the VOTERS platform to meet the town and city decision-making needs, while also making available a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.  One IGERT Trainee is a co-founder of the Northeastern Spin-Off company, Street Scan Inc. \n\n \n\nIGERT Graduates who completed the MS or the PhD have embarked into careers in industry and in academia.  Industry careers include nontraditional positions, including a \"data scientist\" at Apple, an \"..."
