 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed workshop, 'Probabilistic Models of Cognition: The Mathematics of Mind,' will bring together leaders from cognitive science, computer science, mathematics, and statistics who are interested in developing  a common mathematical framework for all aspects of cognition, and review how it explains empirical phenomena such as vision, memory, reasoning, learning, planning, and language. This program is motivated by recent advances which offer the promise of modeling human cognition mathematically. The workshop will entail presentations by leading faculty-level lecturers and an audience of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and more senior researchers interested in focusing their efforts on probabilistic models of cognition and their applications. Attendees will represent a number of disciplines, including cognitive science, neuroscience, computer science, mathematics, physics, statistics, engineering, and education. Researchers interested in education should be equipped with a wide range of new computational, mathematical and statistical tools that can be used to improve educational technology, curriculum design and assessment, through the development of qualitatively more powerful models of human learning. Researchers in all of these fields, as well as basic cognitive-science researchers, should benefit immensely from interacting with each other and learning about this new generation of cognitive modeling approaches in an unprecedented interdisciplinary environment, with both basic and applied research themes represented among the lectures and discussions.",
