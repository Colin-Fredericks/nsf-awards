 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will upgrade and rebuild optical instruments at the Millstone Hill Observatory in Massachusetts.  The instruments include a new patrol Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI), an all-sky Doppler imager (ASDI), and a spectrometer.  The observations will be used to systematically address a number of issues in mesospheric and thermospheric physics.  Research will include the study of mid-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) tides using the combined FPI mesospheric and thermospheric Doppler winds and all-sky images from hydroxyl and oxygen emissions and incoherent scatter radar observations.  The semidiurnal tide usually has a large vertical wavelength so the combined observations will provide a large vertical altitude coverage during both the day and night, and will allow for a better characterization of the vertical tidal structure.  Also, the all-sky imager at Millstone Hill will record the hydroxyl, sodium, and oxygen nightglow emissions for gravity wave activity and the investigators will use the FPI neutral winds from the same emissions to calculate the intrinsic gravity wave parameters.  From the intrinsic parameters, they will deduce the propagation modes of the waves and several important wave parameters including quantitative measurements of vertical scale-sizes, estimates of the vertical fluxes of horizontal wave momentum and energy, and the amount of wave flux divergence between the airglow layers, the hydroxyl and oxygen layers, in particular.  The FPI neutral wind and temperature measurements will be used to study the long-term trends in the mesosphere and thermosphere in connection with the solar cycles, and small-scale thermosphere temperature and neutral wind variations will be studied using the all sky Doppler imager.  The regional cluster of optical instruments in conjunction with the Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter radar will provide comprehensive coverage from the mesosphere to the thermosphere.  They will provide a unique data set for studies of MLT dynamics and ionosphere/thermosphere interaction in the sub-auroral region.  Multi-institute participation will foster more collaboration between different research groups.  The Millstone Hill optical instruments will also be the test bed for the future distributed instrument projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith support from this grant, we accomplished what we proposed to do, which is to refurbish the Fabry-Perot interferometer at Millstone Hill to measure thermospheric winds in support of the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar operation and study mid latitude ionosphere thermospheric interaction.  Thermospheric winds have a profound impact on the ionosphere are a key parameter for understanding the ionosphere and have a strong implication for space weather forecast.  We went beyond that and deployed another Fabry-Perot interferometer at Boulder, Colorado, which is at similar latitude as Millstone Hill to study longitudinal variations.   In addition, we also collaborate with the Chinese colleagues from Chinese Academy of Science with their FPI instrument near Beijing, China and conducted first inter-continental comparison of the thermospheric winds.    Furthermore, the Millstone Hill instrument together with the Palmer station FPI in Antarctica form the first mid latitude conjugate pair for studying conjugacy in thermospheric winds.  There new instruments will continue to provide invaluable assess to future study of ionosphere in the mid latitude region from the America sector and beyond.   During the project we also provide opportuities to undergraduate students to work on instrument development and give them valuable experience in scientific research involving the state of art instruments.   Hence the project has help to train the next generation of scientists. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Qian Wu"
