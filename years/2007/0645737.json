 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Eva M. Harth, of the Chemistry Department at the Vanderbilt University, will perform research on two synthetically related but conceptually quite distinct projects, the first on development of multifunctional polymeric nanoparticles for drug delivery, and the second polymeric nanoparticles for magnetic resonance imaging. The bioinspired nanoparticles are prepared in a top-down approach where functionalizations are introduced to a basic nanoparticle and in a bottom-up approach where further specifications are introduced on the linear precursor level. The new generation of dendritic molecular transporters will allow delivery of bioactive cargo, such as developed nanocarriers, small molecules, peptides and genes into specific sub cellular locations (nucleus or cytosol). Also proposed is the creation of complex materials composed of conducting polymers using intramolecular crosslinking methods to create functional, distinctive particles with well-defined dimensions. In a novel approach semiconducting crosslinking units will be the core units of semiconducting star polymers with large nanoscale dimensions. The use of lanthanides in hydrophilic star polymers will provide powerful bimodal imaging reagents for MRI applications. \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Harth will pursue a multi-faceted, collaborative research plan involving the design and synthesis of functionalized nanoobjects to provide versatile platforms for cancer therapeutics, vaccine development, gene delivery, and imaging reagents in nanomedicine. The educational strategy will incorporate a coherent, systemic education and outreach plan that incorporates the research program with emphasis on addressing the underrepresentation of females and minorities in the fields of nanomedicine and soft materials science.\r\n",
