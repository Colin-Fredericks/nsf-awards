 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary purpose of this international conference is for participants in the US to exchange views international participants and discuss the latest research findings on (primary) science assessment. The conference will focus on research around building assessment systems that help teachers to diagnose student learning in the classroom but also link meaningfully to large scale accountability systems (in districts or national levels). \r\n\r\nThis challenge is faced not only in the US but in countries throughout the world such as in Canada, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Another purpose of the conference will be to designate clusters of people interested in developing action plans for future research and resource development efforts that capitalize on international perspectives on the challenges currently faced. \r\n\r\nThe project will result in a report, conference proceedings, journal publications, and dissemination via a website through CAESL and its partner organizations. \r\n\r\n",
