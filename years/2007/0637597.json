 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an innovative method of applying chromium-carbide cermet coatings without degradation in coating quality frequently induced by high-temperature thermal spray processes.  Chromium-carbide cermet coatings are usually applied with high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) or high velocity air-fuel (HVAF) methods. Recent work has demonstrated that dissolution of the carbide phase into the matrix degrades the hardness and corrosion resistance of these coatings.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of the research is to investigate the feasibility of using the low temperature Kinetic Metallization (KM) process for applying chromium-carbide cermet coatings to overcome these limitations.  Successful implementation of the KM deposition process is expected to require suitable feedstock powders; hence the project will initially investigate proprietary methods for fabricating chromium-carbide cermet powders with various matrix materials to produce ultra-fine powders. These ultra-fine chromium-carbide cermet powders will be deposited on various substrates including steel, titanium, and alumina using the KM process.  Mechanical and metallurgical properties including wear resistance of the coatings will be examined and compared to thermal sprayed coatings to access the improved performance.  It is anticipated the technology will enable superior wear and erosion resistant coatings for the high temperature applications in the power generation industry and improved biocompatible coatings for the medical industry.",
