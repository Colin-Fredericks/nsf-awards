This partnership resulted in the SREB-AGEP Doctoral Scholars Program. This program will continue and expand the participation of all AGEP programs in the Compact for Faculty Diversity Institute on Teaching and Mentoring, along with other services. \r\n\r\nThe Institute began in 1994 and is the largest gathering of underrepresented minorities seeking a Ph.D. and who plan a career in postsecondary education. This grant will permit selected AGEP scholars representing all AGEP Alliances to attend the Institute for the next funding cycle. One hundred and seventy seven scholars will be supported for each of the first and second years of the cycle and two hundred and seven for each of the next three years. These scholars will be provided the full array of services and program activities that have contributed to the success of previous scholars attending the Institute. \r\n\r\nThe Institute focuses on helping scholars build their teaching and mentoring skills and network with other scholars and faculty representatives. Scholars attend a large variety of workshops that enhance their skills and knowledge as they prepare for entry into the ranks of college and university faculty. Selected AGEP scholars have the opportunity to participate in the Institute with scholars from other programs with the same goal of entering academia. Other agencies that participate are the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Minority Ph.D. Program, and the Ronald E. McNair Post baccalaureate Achievement Program. \r\n\r\nThe Compact for Faculty Diversity Institute on Teaching and Mentoring has become the centerpiece activity that combines the strengths of national and regional programs. As a national program, each fall the Compact convenes an Institute on Teaching and Mentoring which brings together all participating students and faculty for three days of intensive experiences. The Institute has been successful in attracting faculty and minority doctoral scholars from every state and Puerto Rico. Since it was initiated in 1994, over 6,000 attendees have participated in the Institute. The Institute is the largest gathering in America of racial/ethnic minority Ph.D. scholars seeking faculty careers in academia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit... The intellectual merit of this program is demonstrated by the inclusion of the SREB-AGEP Doctoral Scholars Program in the AGEP community since 2002, and has resulted in a value-added component experiences for AGEP scholars. The participation of AGEP scholars in the annual Institute has provided them with experiences that have helped address a number of the problems as cited in many studies that minority graduate students often encounter as they pursue the Ph.D. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact...  This unique partnership between SREB and AGEP will achieve two broad goals: 1) provide AGEP scholars with the knowledge, skills, and support that will increase the likelihood of success in graduate school; and 2) enhance preparation of AGEP scholars for a career as a college or university faculty member. \r\n\r\n",

The Institute offers workshops, recruitment, and networking opportunities designed to enhance the capacity of underrepresented Ph.D. students to enter and succeed in the professoriate. There were two broad goals: (a) to provide scholars with knowledge, skills, and support that would increase the likelihood of their success in graduate school and, (b) enhance their preparation for a career as faculty. The Institute has become the nation's largest gathering of racial/ethnic minority Ph.D. scholars seeking career in the academy and is comprised of various groups with a similar mission. The Supplement Award (#0639678) provided support to SREB to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the Institute on scholars that had attended previous Institutes. The study focused on surveying scholars from AGEP, SREB's DSP, and the Sloan Minority Ph.D. Program that had attended the Institute from 2011-2016. In the 25-year history of the Institute this was the first time and evaluation research study were conducted to assess the impact of the Institute on different groups of similar participants and program missions against national baseline data, Survey of Earned Doctorates (SDR). The study addressed the following: (1) How do participants' perception of value for participating in the Institute change as a function of time and professional experience? (2) What knowledge do participants report gaining through their experiences with the Institute and how does that knowledge benefit participants' professional development over time? (3) How does participation in the Institute impact distal outcomes for participants, including likelihood of degree competition, success in procuring a faculty position, and levels of scholarly productivity? The study revealed some key findings: (1) Institute participants overwhelmingly report that their experiences at the Institute were \"extremely important\" to their academic and professional success. (3) &nbsp;Institute alumni report that if they had the opportunity to repeat their graduate training, they \"would definitely\" attend the Institute at a significantly greater rate than pursuing the Ph.D. in general, the Ph.D. in their original field of study or selecting the same university at which to receive their degree. (4) Institute alumni indicated that the Institute was at least as effective in preparing them to collaborate with colleagues, verbally communicate about their research, and communicate about their research with a variety of audiences. (5) Institute alumni were significantly more likely than their SDR counterparts to hold employment at a 4-year institution. (6) Female alumnae of the Institute were significantly more likely than female SDR respondents to indicate that their current employment is closely related to their Ph.D. and to indicate that they currently hold a faculty position. (7) Black Institute alumni were significantly more likely than their SDR counterparts to be engaged in employment for which their primary activity is basic research. (8) Overall, Institute alumni were significantly less likely than their SDR peers to have an annual income in the bottom three income brackets. (9) Institute alumni reported that their participation in the Institute prepared them for their current employment significantly more than SDR respondents. For institutions that seek to hire faculty from underrepresented groups the Institute is a fertile place to recruit potential faculty have been exposed to professional experiences that are not offered in traditional Ph.D. programs. The results of this study can have implications and impact beyond the bounds of STEM. The findings indicate that Institute participants found great value in the Institute, both as current students and in retrospect after completing the Ph.D. Institute alumni identified areas in which they felt their professional preparation received from the Institute met or exceeded the preparation they received from their doctoral programs. The most unique outcomes from this study are those that compared the professional readiness and employment outcomes of the Institute alumni against SDR respondents from the same years. These comparisons provide a clear picture of how Institute alumni fare in their professional endeavors following the completion of their doctorates. One finding revealed that the rate of female Institute alumnae attaining faculty positions was greater than the rate for SDR respondents. Women of color who attended the Institute are disproportionately successful in securing faculty positions compared to a majority White sample. However, these positions are less likely to be tenured or tenure-line that those belonging to female SDR respondents. The strength of this evaluation research study on the Institute is that it represents the first of its kind in terms of assessing its results against national baseline data. The outcomes can inform future SREB, Institute planners, agencies, and institutions that support doctoral students of color that seek a career as college faculty.
