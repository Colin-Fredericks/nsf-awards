 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for support for a 3-year exploratory research study aimed at exploring the components and impact of a teacher professional development model (PDM) on teacher performance and student achievement in STEM disciplines at schools serving large numbers of minority students. It seeks to develop a solid empirical basis for strategies to reduce and eliminate the achievement gap in school. It is aimed at exploring the components and impact of a teacher professional development model on teacher performance and student achievement and motivation in STEM disciplines at schools serving large numbers of minority students. It also aims to research and evaluate the impact of teachers who provide students with school experiences that are geared toward fostering high academic achievement. It asks the question, \"can a structured intervention aimed at fostering positive student academic attitude be integrated with a quality inquiry science program to increase both student academic outcome and positive achievement-oriented attitudes?\" To answer the questions the PI proposes a 3-year controlled study where the impact of PDM on teacher performance will be evaluated using measures of student achievement and attitudes. The plan is to implement research using a corps (30) of elementary and middle school teachers from the Baltimore public schools wherein three groups of teachers will be exposed to a pedagogic only program of study in an institute; another to a content only program of study; and a third group will do studies in an institute focusing on STEM pedagogy and content. The performance of students on a standardized science learning test will determine the extent to which the three groups exposure to content and pedagogy impacts student learning in science.",
