Refai\r\nUniversity of Oklahoma\r\nDisaster Area Wireless Network\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The objective of this research is to design a quickly deployable, reliable communication infrastructure for reestablishing communication following a disaster.  Such a disaster area wireless network (DAWN) would provide much needed communication for coordinating relief and recovery efforts until normal communication channels can be reestablished.  The DAWN infrastructure is based on network nodes deployed on balloons that are tethered to the ground.  Each node utilizes free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) links to construct a hybrid network between balloons and between balloons and the ground.  To realize such a system, this research investigates:  (i) viable mechanisms for physical layer connectivity between balloons using FSO links that consider link acquisition and maintenance; (ii) receiver access control (RAC) protocols to allow sharing of receivers among multiple FSO nodes; (iii) routing algorithms and methods for topology design to realize a self-configuring FSO ring topology with an RF link for inter-nodal communications and backup capacity when the FSO links are unavailable; (iv) aggregation of multiple wireless local area network signals into a single FSO signal and extraction of signals for transmission to ground; (v) techniques to balance power and weight to increase battery life and meet balloon payload requirements; and (vi) methods to provide ample coverage of ground-based nodes and reliable connectivity to existing terrestrial networks.  A combination of experimental research and theoretical modeling will be utilized.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  If successful, this research will lead to methods to realize rapidly deployable, cost-effective communication systems that facilitate coordination between law enforcement and public safety agencies responding to natural and manmade disasters.  Additional applications include airborne internet access and battlefield communications.  Experiments are planned for adoption in two ongoing engineering and science summer academies for middle and high school students and teachers.  The investigators will engage undergraduates in research and will leverage existing relationships to recruit undergraduates from underrepresented groups to participate.\r\n",
