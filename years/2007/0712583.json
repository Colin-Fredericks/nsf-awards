 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the problem of corporations that are becoming fuzzy and flexible, and users who increasingly share files with external entities for business (consultants, customers, prospects, etc.). Given the global ID nature of email addresses, email has become the most popular communication vehicle for document exchange. This approach has four fundamental shortcomings: proliferation of disaggregated versions of documents, lack of security (the email protocol is not encrypted), unreliable delivery of attachments, and expensive growth of email storage and staff support.\r\n\r\nThis project develops an email server filter that strips attachments from messages and stores them on cheaper file servers instead of expensive email storage. Messages (sent or received) can be modified so that each attachment is replaced by a secure link and the attached documents can be tracked and managed. Xapio designed a system architecture and user interfaces that harness the best features of email, web, and file systems: this includes a system that supports shared metadata between files and emails, secure links to permanent objects, and email based authentication, and a set of browser user interfaces that converge the file and email experience. By adding these capabilities to a system, it is possible to deliver all benefits without changing IT infrastructure, install desktop applications, or changing user habits.  That is, Users can securely and reliably send any size file to anyone from their email client (i.e. Outlook). Recipients retrieve the files with their email client or any browser. The sender can track downloads.  If successful, this project has the potential to significantly impact email cost, security and reliability.\r\n",
