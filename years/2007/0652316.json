 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project covers a wide range of aspects in algebra such as\r\nalgebraic geometry, algebraic groups and motivic cohomology.\r\nThe investigator proposes to use theory of algebraic cycles in\r\ngeometry to study properties of splitting varieties of algebraic objects. \r\nThe first topic the investigator proposes to study is the canonical\r\ndimension of an algebraic object such as algebraic variety,\r\nquadratic form, central simple algebra, etc. The canonical dimension\r\nmeasures complexity of the class of splitting fields of an algebraic \r\nobject. In particular, the investigator  proposes to compute the canonical\r\ndimension of projective homogeneous varieties and simple algebraic\r\ngroups. The investigator also plans jointly with A. Suslin to compute \r\nthe motivic cohomology of Severi-Brauer varieties and generalize\r\nthis computation to the case of generic splitting varieties of arbitrary\r\nsymbols. These varieties were used in the proof of the Milnor and the\r\nBloch-Kato Conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of mathematics is to provide an approximation to the\r\npicture of the physical world. This project develops methods from\r\ntopology that studies continuous transformations of structures called\r\ntopological spaces and algebraic geometry concerning geometric objects\r\ncoming from graphing polynomial equations and called algebraic varieties.\r\nThis project is devoted to the study of certain fundamental problems\r\nof motivic cohomology theory - a relatively new and very quickly developing\r\nbranch of algebraic geometry. The new areas of algebra that will hopefully\r\nevolve from the work on the project will create new research opportunities \r\nfor mentoring graduate students and junior faculty and provide material\r\nfor graduate courses.\r\n\r\n",
