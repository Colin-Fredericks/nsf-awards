Geddis, Norfolk State University\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis request to the National Science Foundation is for an Inductively Coupled Plasma Etch System, which will be a major piece of equipment required for advanced dry etching capabilities for the Marie V. McDemmond Center for Applied Research Cleanroom at Norfolk State University. Complementary equipment for photolithography, metal deposition and thin film processing has already been purchased and will be installed in the cleanroom. An Inductively Coupled Plasma Etcher will complement this equipment.  It will enable the fabrication of III-V devices using an advanced dry etch process.  This equipment will enhance the research and training initiatives in the areas of 1.) microsensor fabrication for bio-chemical agent monitoring/assessment and space environment measurements and 2.) multi/-hyperspectral filtering and detection for target recognition.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe larger impact of the acquisition of the Inductively Coupled Plasma Etcher for the Marie V. McDemmond Center for Applied Research Cleanroom at Norfolk State University will be the education and training of a new generation of scientists and engineers who will replace retiring professors and researchers in academia and research and development centers associated with the government laboratories or industry.  During the 21st Century, the population of the United States will become more culturally diverse than in any period of our nation's history.  In order for the nation to remain technically competitive in a global economy, the talents and skills of women and underrepresented minorities must be included in the skilled and technical workforce.  The principal investigators believe that the establishment of a state of the art cleanroom at Norfolk State University will be central to areas of research interest of the National Science Foundation.  Moreover, a graduate course/seminar has been added to the curriculum on microfabrication techniques that will benefit from the purchase of the proposed etching equipment.  \r\n",
