 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systematics of Amorpha L. (Papilionoideae: Fabaceae) - Molecular Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Conservation\r\n\r\n\tDelimiting closely related species and understanding their evolutionary relationships presents a significant challenge for biologists. The legume genus Amorpha L., with its 15 morphologically variable, yet genetically similar, species illustrates these difficult problems. Amorpha includes several endangered species, as well as a widespread, weedy species complex. The goals of this proposed research are to elucidate the evolutionary relationships among Amorpha species, explore the origin of and relationships within the A. fruticosa species complex, and assess the taxonomy and genetic diversity of rare Amorpha species. In order to accomplish these objectives, diverse methodologies will be used to uncover molecular sequence variation patterns and collect basic biological information, such as genome size and chromosome number. \r\n\r\nKnowledge of the evolutionary relationships of Amorpha species will provide better understanding of a poorly studied genus and possible insight into the relationship of genome duplication to invasiveness. In combination with population genetic studies, this work will expand current knowledge for working at the boundary between species and populations. Genetic markers developed in this study will have utility for other researchers and information gathered about rare species will be useful to government agencies for assessing conservation plans and preventing loss of biodiversity.\r\n",
