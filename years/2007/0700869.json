 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research grant addresses the critical need for improved sustainability in the plastics industries through the development of an environmentally benign manufacturing process for nanocomposites. Ecologically responsible conversion of renewable resources through industrial biotechnology, enhanced by nanotechnology, produces green materials that represent a triple technological convergence. This convergence is resulting in a class of bioplastics that can be referred to as Ecobionanocomposites. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the present project rests in developing sustainable plastics technologies. Progress towards petroleum-free, sustainable plastics will be accomplished by developing new polylactide-graft-cellulose nanowhisker supramolecular structures. The feasibility of reactive compatibilization in a twin-screw extruder is being demonstrated and a preliminary life cycle analysis is completed. \r\n\r\nThe project advances a new technical milestone: polymer nanocomposites based on 100% renewable resources. The expected project outcome is the scientific and technical knowledge associated with creating a series of renewable-resource-based plastics. Once the proposed approach is proven feasible, the new nanocomposite formulations and processing techniques will lead to the economically practical development and commercialization of novel bioplastics. These bioplastics could make use of millions of pounds of domestically produced renewables each year and boost domestic job growth. A sizeable portion of the 10 billion lb/yr polystyrene market could be captured, leading to better use of renewables while reducing dependence on foreign petroleum and protecting our environment. \r\n\r\n",
