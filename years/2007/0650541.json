 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to secure support for a first workshop between scientist and researchers\r\nfrom the United States and Ireland in the area of nanotechnology. This symposium is to\r\nbe held in Belfast, Northern Ireland on Oct 23 and 24. It will help strengthen already\r\ndeveloping ties between researchers in the US and Ireland in nanotechnology, and will\r\nalso be of great significance in involving joint participation from both the Republic of\r\nIreland and Northern Ireland (the \"Two Irelands\"). The symposium will consist of: (i)\r\nOverview presentations by participants from US and Ireland on topics that define the\r\ncurrent forefronts in four selected sub-fields of nanoscience and technology where there\r\nis substantial activity in both the US and the Two Irelands (Spintronics and\r\nNanomagnetics; Computational Nanoscience; Self Assembly Mechanisms; and Nano-Bio\r\nInterfaces); (ii) Poster sessions that highlight the work of leading younger scientists\r\nfrom the US and a broad community of scientist from the Two Irelands. (iii) Significant\r\ntime set aside for informal technical discussion and relationship building. (iv) A\r\nstructured planning session, where plans for specific collaborations will be developed.\r\nThe major objective of the forum is to develop an agenda for possible future collaborative\r\nresearch and educational exchange between the three nations in this field.",
