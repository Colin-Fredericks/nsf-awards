 "awd_abstract_narration": "Self-fertilization is believed to be an evolutionary dead-end because it erodes genetic variation and leads to inbreeding depression. However, occasional genetic exchange may alleviate the fitness consequences associated with perpetual self-fertilization, thus enabling the long-term survival of primarily self-fertilizing populations. This study will utilize the model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, to test this theory using the experimental evolution of populations containing mutations that alter their mating system dynamics. Specifically, the robustness of perpetual self-fertilization and the significance of genetic exchange will be evaluated under conditions of increased mutation rate and adaptation to novel pathogenic environments. \r\n\r\nThis project will evaluate the importance of genetic exchange between individuals within the context of adaptation and genetic preservation. These conditions are broadly important and have impacts on the fields of agriculture, conservation, and epidemiology. In addition, the project will provide valuable scientific training and experience for an aspiring scientist and educator and offer multiple opportunities for the mentorship of undergraduate researchers through direct participation in the scientific process.\r\n",
