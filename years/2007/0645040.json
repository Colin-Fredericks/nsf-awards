 "awd_abstract_narration": "Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) hold great promise to revolutionize nearly every product category, from automotive to biomedical. However, catastrophic failures often occur due to tribological issues preventing such devices from being efficient and reliable. The goal of this career-development plan is to establish an integrated research and education program in nano-engineered-surfaces (NESs) for tribological applications in miniaturized systems, such as MEMS. A novel MEMS process compatible nano-surface-engineering process will be studied to produce a wide range of nano-topography-engineered surfaces (NTESs). These unique NTESs will be modified with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and nanoscale lubricants to provide superior tribological performances of the NESs, thus providing solutions to plaguing MEMS tribology issues.  \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the proposed research are to 1) understand and control the new nano-surface-engineering process to produce surfaces with controllable nano-topographies, 2) develop processes to apply nanoscale lubricants to the NTESs, and 3) study the tribological and wetting properties of the NESs and correlate these properties to surface topography and chemistry. The success of the proposed project will benefit society through increased product reliability of two multi-billion dollar/year industries: MEMS and computer hard drive industries. It will also enable nano-surface-engineering for hydrophobic and biomedical applications beyond tribological applications. This research offers abundant opportunities to train students, especially women and minorities, in the emerging fields of nanomanufacturing and nanotribology. The outreach activities through the Lotus-Effect Demonstration Unit will increase high school students' awareness of and interest in the engineering profession.  \r\n",
