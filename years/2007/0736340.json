Researchers will approach questions on multiple scales, including the molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem.  \r\n\r\nThe research conducted by the center will increase the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners by solving problems on multiple temporal and spatial scales and determining fundamental solutions that transcend traditional species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries.\r\n",
