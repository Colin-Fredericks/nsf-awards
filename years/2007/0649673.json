 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding from the National Science Foundation will allow Dr. Harold Dibble and his students to perform a series of experiments directly relevant to the understanding of how stone tools (lithics) are made.  While modern flinknappers (those who replicate stone tools) are able to reproduce forms found in the archaeological record, most of the fundamental processes involved are not well understood.  These experiments will test the relationship among three sets of independent variables'platform morphology, core surface morphology, and the application of force'in determining the shape of flakes produced by direct percussion knapping technology.  The experimental design overcomes many of the limitations inherent in earlier controlled studies by making cores and flakes that are similar to archaeological pieces, but which are highly controlled and quantifiable.  Since glass chips in ways that are identical to materials used in the past, a series of glass cores will be cast from molds.  In this way, extremely realistic core shapes similar to those used in prehistory can be designed and produced in quantity while at the same time changing, in a highly controlled fashion, the specific variables to be investigated.  In addition, a device will be built to simulate more accurately the application of force to these glass cores; it will incorporate the ability to vary the amount of force applied, the direction of that force relative to the core surface, and the use of different materials for the percussor.  Two applications of the experimental results will also be carried out.  These are designed not only to verify the experimental results with reference to actual lithic assemblages, but also to address questions both inter- and intra-industrial technological variability.\r\nThis experiment, which will allow for complete control of several variables while changing others, will build significantly on previous research in two ways.  First, it will utilize more realistic cores that will yield flakes products that are much more analogous to those found in the archaeological record.  Second, it will be more comprehensive in its scope.  The research proposed here has a goal that is much broader than understanding a particular prehistoric technology or identifying specific processes in the production of particular stone tool types.  Rather, the goal is to test specific relationships among the independent variables used by all knappers'prehistoric and modern alike'to control the sizes and shapes of flakes.  As such, it speaks directly to the fundamental processes underlying the knapping process and is intended to give lithic archaeologists a much better understanding of how these independent variables affect the morphology of flakes.  In this way the results of this experiment will be relevant to virtually all geographic areas and temporal periods that yield lithic assemblages.  \r\n\r\nThis experiment will also form the focus of an undergraduate course at the University of Pennsylvania in experimental archaeology and as part of their curriculum the students will take part in the experiment.  This will provide first-hand experience in experimental design and methodology.  In addition, the experimental operation and results will be made accessible to the larger public through a website designed specifically for this purpose (www.oldstoneage.com).\r\n",
