 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is now exploring the sky in a whole new way, poised to detect extremely tiny ripples in the geometry of spacetime that are generated by distant astrophysical objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and supernovas.  This project involves searching for bursts of gravitational-wave energy in the best data collected so far by LIGO and the similar European gravitational-wave observatories, GEO and Virgo.  The data will be characterized to identify and reject periods of poor quality, improving confidence in any signal detected by the search.  Also, a \"rapid response\" capability will be developed to allow gravitational-wave signal candidates to be promptly examined by astronomers using optical telescopes in order to check for an associated optical signal that would lend support to the detection and help identify the source.\r\nThis project takes full advantage of NSF's investment in LIGO to perform the broadest possible search for potential gravitational-wave sources.  The direct detection of gravitational waves, when it comes, will confirm---or challenge---a key prediction of Einstein's theory of relativity and will provide a new observational tool for understanding massive objects in the universe.  This project strengthens international cooperation among gravitational-wave scientists, builds connections with the optical astronomy community, and contributes to graduate education by providing research experience.",
