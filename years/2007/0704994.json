 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent years have seen important progress in the understanding of two\r\ndimensional statistical physics. The rigorous study of macroscopic\r\nrandom geometric structures generated by microscopic random inputs and\r\ninteractions has been greatly stimulated by the introduction of\r\nSchramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLE) and related objects. This enabled to\r\nestablish results predicted by Conformal Field Theory (CFT) in Theoretical\r\nPhysics, most often without matching the techniques. The P.I.'s research program\r\nis primarily directed at realizing CFT concepts from SLE based\r\nconstructions. The methods and issues involve an interplay of\r\ngeometric, functional analytic and representation theoretic aspects.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to analyze mathematical models of the\r\nphysical phenomenon of phase transition. A phase transition describes a sharp\r\nqualitative change in a physical system under variation of an external\r\nparamater, such as freezing of water (transition from liquid to\r\nsolid phase as temperature decreases). At the phase transition, a random macroscopic geometry\r\nmay emerge, akin to the wiggly interfaces separating non mixing fluids\r\nlike oil and water. The study of those fluctuating interfaces is\r\nrooted in both Probability Theory and Theoretical Physics. Special focus\r\nwill be placed on the interaction between these two approaches, and\r\nother areas of mathematics involved in the analysis.\r\n",
