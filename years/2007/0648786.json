The program assembles a\r\nlarge international group of mathematicians and physicists\r\ninterested in graph models arising in widely disparate areas of\r\nhigh practical and theoretical importance.   Analysis on graphs\r\nhas been developing very quickly in the last decades, due to\r\nneeds of number theory, algebra, probability theory, and spectral\r\ngeometry.  This area has experienced recently a surge of new\r\nimportant applications, new methods, and new models.  New\r\nobjects, such as quantum graphs (quantum networks) or\r\ndifferential operators on fractals, have emerged, which provide\r\nsimplified models of complex systems and help with studying\r\ndifficult issues such as, for instance, Anderson localization and\r\nquantum chaos.  All these developments have sparked the interest\r\nof experts in other areas of sciences and mathematics in analysis\r\non graphs and in the diversity of methods employed.   The program\r\nstarts with a tutorial workshop where young researchers and\r\nstudents are introduced to the basics of analysis on graphs,\r\nquantum graphs, and fractals.  Then two workshops follow devoted\r\nto spectral analysis and quantum chaos on quantum graphs and\r\ngraph models for nanotechnology, chemistry, optics,\r\nmicroelectronics, and other areas.  The third workshop addresses\r\nalgebraic aspects of analysis on graphs and fractals.  Besides\r\nworkshop participation, longer term visits of both established\r\nand young researchers are arranged.  \r\n\r\n     Analysis on graphs has experienced sharp growth in recent\r\nyears, due to many new applications that sweep throughout a wide\r\nscientific landscape: computer graphics, information technology,\r\nInternet studies, nanotechnology, microelectronics,\r\nsuperconductivity, optics, chemistry, and material science. \r\nResearchers in these areas meet problems that are similar to\r\nthose faced by mathematicians in areas like number theory,\r\ncombinatorics, differential equations, and spectral theory.  The\r\nprogram facilitates the urgently needed communication and\r\ncooperation among researchers in different areas of mathematics\r\nand sciences.  It thus accelerates progress in this new area that\r\nhas extensive applications in crucial scientific and technology\r\nfields, such as nanotechnology, photonics, and material science. \r\nIt alsos help to increase participation and visibility of US\r\nresearchers in these fields.  Significant training for junior\r\nresearchers and graduate students is provided, including\r\nspecially designed tutorials, seminars, and open problems\r\nsessions.  A proceedings volume is planned to be published.   The\r\ngrant supports US-based participants in the program, mostly US\r\nstudents, postdocs, junior faculty, women, and other\r\nunderrepresented groups.  \r\n",
