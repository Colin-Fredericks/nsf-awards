 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project, Eco-enterprise Partnerships for Innovation in Puerto Rico, will bring together a diverse group of stakeholders to create a replicable model for the transfer of knowledge on environmental sciences, industry innovation, scientifically literate and competitive workforce development, and mentoring partnerships.  Its primary focus is on the northern technological corridor of the island known as the Iniciativa Tecnologica del Norte, (INTENOR, for its initials in Spanish), but project activities will be carried out throughout the island.  This project will address industry-related environmental issues; the need for innovation; and industry concerns regarding energy, alternative fuel vehicles, and solid waste disposal.  A major component of this three-year project will be the establishment of an eco-enterprise incubator that serves the entire cycle of waste management: from industrial by-products -- to waste-to-energy -- to marketable recycled products.  The project will have seven (7) major components: (1) an initial island-wide conference, (2) an island-wide general scholarship competition, (3) knowledge transfer, through a three-year eco-enterprise training initiative led by UMET's School of Environmental Affairs in partnership with UMET's Entrepreneurship Area, in close collaboration with the government agency Puerto Rico Trade (PRT), (4) an island-wide eco-enterprise competition, open to all citizens who have completed the PRT sponsored \"La Llave para tu Negocio\", (5) establishment of a specialized eco-enterprise incubator, (6) collaborative mentoring and technical assistance, and (7) EcoLink, a website for industries, academia, and the ecobusiness community to present current environmental concerns, stimulate innovative solutions from the wider public, and establish new partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide eco-enterprise innovation training and cutting-edge knowledge transfer throughout Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nPartners: The core partners include Universidad Metropolitana (Lead Institution) (Hispanic Serving Institution); Puerto Rico Trade (PRT) (government agency); INTENOR: a coalition of thirteen (13) contiguous municipal governments and the pharmaceutical/biotech industries located in the northern technology corridor of Puerto Rico, including Merck Sharpe & Dohne, Pfizer, DuPont, Abbott, and San Juan Cement; and 13 municipalities: Arecibo, Barceloneta, Ciales, Dorado, Florida, Hatillo, Manati, Morovis, Toa Alta, Toa Baja, Utuado, Vega Alta, and Vega Baja.  Collaborating Partners include Puerto Rico Energy Affairs Administration (government agency); Puerto Rico Solid Waste Authority (government agency); Bank of Santander; Banco Popular of Puerto Rico; Solena Group (company); EcoElectrica (cogeneration company); Mision Industrial (NGO); Conectarse (NGO); Estudios Technicos, Inc (ETI)(economic and planning consulting firm); and Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce.\r\n",
