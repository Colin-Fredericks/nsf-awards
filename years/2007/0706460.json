 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fried\r\n0706460\r\n\r\n     Epitaxially-grown thin alloy films are essential components\r\nin many nano- and microscale devices used in the electronics and\r\nother industries.  Unfortunately, the growth of planar strained\r\nfilms is susceptible to instabilities.  These instabilities are\r\noften manifested by the formation of surface ripples, surface\r\ncusps, and island-like mounds such as quantum dots and quantum\r\nwires.  The demand for films with precisely tailored micro- and\r\nnanostructures has led to an extensive literature concerned with\r\nmorphological instabilities during the epitaxy of thin alloy\r\nfilms.  To date, attention has focused primarily on instabilities\r\nthat arise from a mismatch in lattice parameters between the film\r\nand the substrate and surface diffusion.  However, interfacial\r\nstress, which may strongly influence the formation of surface\r\npatterns, has received almost no attention.  Moreover, because of\r\nthe geometric complications associated with the description of\r\nevolving surfaces in three space dimensions, studies of\r\ngrowth-stress interactions have thus far confined attention to\r\ntwo-dimensional theories, wherein the interface is a curve. \r\nAdditionally, no theory yet accounts for the influence of surface\r\nstress on phase segregation and related pattern formation,\r\nprocesses that occur during epitaxy.  In this project, the\r\ninvestigator and colleagues:\r\n  1.  Perform stability analyses and numerical simulations\r\n  designed to explore the role of surface stress in the stability\r\n  of epitaxially growing films. \r\n  2.  Extend the existing two-dimensional theory to three space\r\n  dimensions. \r\n  3.  Develop a theory that describes the interaction of growth\r\n  and phase segregation during the epitaxy of alloys. \r\n\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues develop and analyze\r\nmathematical models, and carry out numerical simulations, of the\r\nbehavior and characteristics of epitaxially grown thin films.  An\r\nincreased understanding of the morphological stability of these\r\nfilms allows for progress and innovation in a variety of\r\nstrategically important applications.  For instance, in the\r\nelectronics industry, epitaxially grown multi-layers have been\r\nused to increase the storage capacity of hard drives and are now\r\nbeing studied for possible improvements.  Progress rests directly\r\non the ability to control small-scale features that form during\r\ngrowth.  Another compelling example of the importance of\r\nepitaxial films is provided by recently proposed hybrid\r\norganic/inorganic devices capable of detecting airborne\r\ncontaminants.  These devices combine a monolayer of sensing\r\nmolecules on a semiconductor transducer grown via molecular beam\r\nepitaxy.  A precisely tailored surface structure is necessary to\r\nensure that the sensing molecules adhere correctly to the\r\ntransducer and perform reliably.  Epitaxial films also have\r\npotential in the development of optical semiconductors for\r\napplications such as variable wavelength lasers.  The devices\r\nhave a wide range of potential applications, including the\r\ndetection of toxic gases from vehicle exhaust, factories,\r\naccidents, fires, natural disasters, etc.  With a variable\r\nwavelength laser, it is possible to shorten measurement times\r\nfrom 1-2 minutes to 1 second, allowing for more rapid containment\r\nand evacuation during emergencies.",
