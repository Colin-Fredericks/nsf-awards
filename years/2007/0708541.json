 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the trend towards smaller electronic devices continues, current silicon technology consisting of metal-oxide semiconductor junctions and metal interconnect will face significant deficiencies such as a large leakage current, increase in film resistance and electromigration of atoms. In this regard, one-dimensional nanomaterials such as carbon nanotube and nanowire offer advantage as nanoscale alternatives to current silicon-based devices.   The goal of this NER project is to fabricate and test hierarchically designed one-dimensional heterostructures based on carbon nanotubes and nanowires. The specific goals are to: (a) create precisely controlled (diameter, length, and geometry) nanotube/nanowire heterostructures in various configurations using anodize aluminum oxide nanochannels as templates followed by chemical vapor deposition and electrodeposition techniques, (b) characterize and study their structures, junctions, and transport property, and (c) perform computational investigations of structural and electronic properties of nanotube/nanowire heterostructures.  The intellectual merit of the research lies in the first detailed study that will attempt to create and characterize novel heterostructured and hierarchical molecular scale junctions based on carbon nanotubes with nanowires. The research will demonstrate control over tailoring transport properties and building of one-dimensional nanomaterial based nanodevices. These heterostructured materials will open up new opportunities for both fundamental research and building of true nanoscale interconnection and architecture. Specifically, these nanotube-nanowire hybrid structures will enable advanced nanoelectronics for logic devices, multi-terminal nanoelectronic devices, switches, integrated diode circuits, and multifunctional nanosystems. The research emphasizes the participation, education, and training of undergraduates, and graduate students who will all benefit from exposure to nanoscience and nanotechnology research in three participating universities.\r\n\r\n",
