 "awd_abstract_narration": "0722854\r\nDuran\r\n\r\nEight instruments are requested that will be utilized for genomics level bioengineering research and teaching at Villanova University, namely: a genetic analyzer, a real-time PCR system, a liquid chromatograph with UV-Vis and light scattering detectors, a cell viability analyzer, an epifluorescent microscope, a plate reader, and two freezers. These instruments will form the analytical infrastructure of a new Core Genomics Laboratory. The new laboratory and the instruments requested represent a significant upgrade from the existing laboratories currently used by the co-PIs. The capabilities brought about by the new facility and the requested instruments will allow co-PIs to incorporate modern genomics level experimental protocols into their current and future research and teaching activities in environmental microbiology, bioprocessing, mechanotransduction, and microstructured optical fiber spectroscopy-based biological sensors. \r\n\r\nThis proposal has significant intellectual merit in that it will allow the co-PIs to conduct advanced research in areas which they have well-established competence through prior work. The details of the current and several planned studies that necessitate the requested instruments are presented in the later sections of this proposal. These advanced studies will help to expand the knowledge base in the co-PIs' respective fields of expertise. \r\n\r\nThis proposal also has significant broader impacts. First, acquisition of the requested instruments will help develop the experimental infrastructure available to the co-PIs for research and educational purposes. By improving the ability of the co-PIs to attract funded research, more graduate students will have the opportunity to take an active role in genomics research as part of their graduate education. The co-PIs are also committed to a true integration of research into the undergraduate educational experience. Through a variety of mechanisms described in the proposal, undergraduates will have the opportunity to use the requested equipment to conduct research. Underrepresented groups, including high school students from the city of Philadelphia, will benefit as a result of the continued commitment of the co-PIs and the College of Engineering toward providing opportunities for these groups in engineering education. \r\n",
