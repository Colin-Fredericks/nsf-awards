 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brown University is awarded a grant to develop algorithms and software tools for building genomic maps of the developmental regulatory circuitry of cells. The focus is on two fundamental problems of great practical importance. The first is to build the cisGRN Database of genomic regulatory information behind gene networks: capturing the complex nature of the cis-regulatory evidence from many kinds of regulatory information across technologies. The database will contain the following components: genomic structure and organization, comparative genomics, cis-regulatory analysis of expressions constructs and mutational analysis, spatial expression profiles, and logic functions of the genomic cis-regulatory code. The second aim is to build Regulatory Genomics Logic Map Browser a next-generation genome browser incorporating model-building, annotation, and visualization capabilities for gene regulatory systems and networks. It will present genomic structural views, spatial expression views, expression constructs views, and information processing views, obtained through mathematical analysis of the logical principles of genomic regulatory systems and networks. The work will be carried out in collaboration with the California Institute of Technology. \r\n",
