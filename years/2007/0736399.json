Researchers will approach questions on multiple scales, including the molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem.  \r\n\r\nThe research conducted by the center will increase the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners by solving problems on multiple temporal and spatial scales and determining fundamental solutions that transcend traditional species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTwo projects were funded at the Purdue University site within the Center for Advanced Forestry Systems of the NSF I/UCRC program.  The first project developed a system for providing nitrogen fertilizer at the time that walnut trees are mostly likely to utilize it, thereby maximizing growth and storage of nutrients and reducing runoff in waste streams.  Growth in the first year was increased by greater that 30% and this resulted in future growth in second year that allowed the trees to reach free to grow status faster.  In addition, the work resulted in a significant decrease in fertilizer use.  This method has been adopted and implemented by several nurseries.  The second project analyzed twenty five black walnut clones for their crown architecture and physiological differences that resulted in faster growth.  The goal of this work was to describe the ideal plantation tree to help mitigate rapid forest loss due to urbanization and other causes that lead to reduction in forest cover. Clones were able to be rated by crown type and determinations were made why some clones grow faster than others.  By knowing the best crown ideotype, tree breeders can be guided in future efforts to chose the most efficient clones to make the next generation of trees.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/21/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles H Michler"
