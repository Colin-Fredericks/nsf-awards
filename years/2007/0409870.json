 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project (INDEPTH IV) is a continuation of previously funded projects (INDEPTH I, II, III).  The overarching goal of the INDEPTH studies is to understand the basic processes that take place in a continent-continent collision.  INDEPTH I, II, and III were joint Sino-U.S. studies to understand the formation of the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan mountains, which together comprise Earth's type example of an active continent-continent collision zone.  Results from these studies have profoundly influenced prevalent theories of mountain building in such tectonic settings. \r\n\r\nThe focus of INDEPTH IV is the northeastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau.  This boundary plays a central role in a contemporary debate concerning continental plateau formation as an intracontinental response to collisional orogeny.  Recent geological studies and limited geophysical measurements in this region have been cited to argue that a) uplift is due to internal imbricate \"stacking\" of Asian crust while b) Asian continental lithosphere is being detached and \"subducted\" into the Tibetan mantle.  Such models contrast with a competing paradigm, derived primarily from observations in the southern and eastern portions of the Plateau, that attribute plateau formation to ductile flow in the deep crust.  Critical to any model of surface tectonics is the mantle dynamics beneath the plateau and adjacent regions.  Upper mantle geophysical properties beneath the northern plateau have been variously attributed to delamination triggered by instability of a thickened lithosphere, mantle lid detachment and/or asthenospheric counterflow associated with subduction of Indian continental lithosphere.  INDEPTH IV will test key elements in these hypotheses with an integrated, focused program of geophysical surveys across three key segments of the NE Plateau boundary zone.  \r\n\r\nGeophysical surveys will consist of integrated seismic reflection, refraction and densely spaced passive seismic profiles, a detailed magnetotelluric survey, and a regional broadband seismic array.  Specific features to be investigated by the surveys include:   a)  the existence and nature of proposed Moho offsets;  b) the deep geometry of major thrust faults at the plateau boundary;  c) the relationship between major thrusts and strike slip faults;  d) constraints on lower crustal flow from structural continuity of crustal markers;  e) the existence and nature of subducting Asian lithosphere; and f)  the mode of lithospheric thickening beneath the plateau foreland.",

It also involves Cambridge University and the University of Missouri at Columbia. The goal of this project is to study the crustal and mantle structures of the northern and eastern Tibetan Plateau in order to better understand how the Tibetan Plateau is evolving since the last 50 million years. We first deployed a seismic array comprised of 93 broadband temporary stations. We collected about 2-years of data from this array. The surface wave and body wave tomography images show that much of the crust beneath the northern Tibetan Plateau has low velocity. The velocity boundary is not confined by older terrane boundaries and suggests that recent crustal flow has removed older structures in the middle and lower crust. Shear wave splitting measurements using core S waves revealed significant anisotropy in the lithosphere. Fast S wave directions for stations in SE Tibet are subparallel with the velocity vectors derived from GPS data and also sub-parallel to the strike-split faulting. This relationship suggests that the crust and mantle are deforming coherently. Prior measurements of the surface crustal velocities across the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau, western Sichuan, Yunnan and Myanmar are characterized by clockwise rotation around the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis (about 1&deg; per million years). Relative to Sundaland, there is no eastward extrusion of crustal material beyond the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The crustal clockwise rotational deformation appears to continue into northern Myanmar, accommodated by a series of East Northeast - West Southwest left-lateral strike-slip faults bounded between the Sagaing Fault and the Red River Fault. The relative contribution of crustal and mantle processes to surface clockwise rotational deformation remains to be determined.</p>\n<p>We perform a finite-frequency tomographic inversion to image 3D velocity structures beneath southern and central Tibet using teleseismic body-wave data recorded by many seismic arrays.

The Indian continental lithosphere appears to extend further north in central Tibet than in eastern Tibet, reaching 350 km depth at about 31&deg;N along 85&deg;E but at about 30&deg;N along 91&deg;E. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We use receiver functions calculated for data collected by the INDEPTH-IV seismic array to image the three-dimensional geometry of the crustal and upper mantle velocity discontinuities beneath northeastern Tibet.

A region in the central Qiangtang Terrane with higher than normal crustal Vp/Vs ratio of ~1.83 can be the result of the Eocene magmatic event.
