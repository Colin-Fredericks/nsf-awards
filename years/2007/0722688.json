 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department at the Wheaton College will acquire a cluster of instruments to make their single-molecule microscopy and laser laboratory at Wheaton College capable of picosecond to nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements. A high-power, picosecond-pulsed laser will be configured for multi-user access with data acquisition hardware that includes: (1) a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) PC card; (2) a stage, interface, and software for fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM); (3) a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer; (4) electronics and software for time-gated optical and electrical detection of single ion channels in large lipid bilayer membranes.  The specific research contributions facilitated by this instrumentation request include: (1) the development of a novel time-gated detection scheme that will expand the detection area for single molecules in the far-field by ~100-fold over the existing state-of-the-art technique; (2) a comparison of the dynamics and structure of alpha hemolysin and Anthrax toxins in lipid membranes; (3) a study of electron transfer and solvation dynamics in polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) thin films; (4) the development of new time-resolved  fluorescence assays for structure/function studies of cGMP-dependent protein kinase.\r\n\r\nFluorescence instrumentation provides an excellent means for fostering interdisciplinary scientific investigation because fluorescence applications are replete throughout chemistry, biology, and physics.  Fluorescence measurements record the emission of radiation after being probed with a laser or light source.  They are inherently sensitive, enabling trace amounts of material to be probed.  Once established, the techniques are relatively simple and robust, which facilitates multi-user accessibility.  The equipment will be used by undergraduates in research and laboratory instruction.",
