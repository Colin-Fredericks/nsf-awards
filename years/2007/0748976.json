 "awd_abstract_narration": "When we reach toward a visual object, there is a precise and continuous flow \r\nof information from the visual areas to the motor circuits that control arm and \r\nhand movements. But a moment later, we may be engaged in scratching an ear, with \r\nthe same motor circuits now guided by tactile sensation and uncoupled from \r\nvision. This research project asks fundamental questions about how neural \r\ncircuits perform such complex switching functions to re-route the flow of \r\ninformation during controlled and adaptive behaviors. A critical role in \r\nfunctional switching may be played by gain modulation, in which a type of \r\n\"volume-control\" mechanism at synapses adjusts neural responses. An important \r\nnovel component is a testable hypothesis of a specific biophysical mechanism for \r\ngain modulation. Mathematical models of neurons and neural populations will be \r\nconstructed based on detailed anatomical and physiological data, and the results \r\narising from these models will be compared with experiments involving visual, \r\ndiscrimination, and motor tasks. Results of the proposed research will shed \r\nlight on some of the complex features of neural circuitry that allow animals and \r\npeople to control their actions and modify and tune their behaviors to specific \r\nconditions. \r\n   The scientific goal is to relate these behavioral aspects of neural circuitry \r\nto the underlying cellular and biophysical mechanisms that generate them, using \r\nmathematical modeling to bridge the gaps between our knowledge at the cellular \r\nand behavioral levels. In addition, the proposed research will play a critical \r\nrole integrating mathematics and biology into the education and training of \r\nundergraduate and graduate students, through classroom work, honors and rotation \r\nprojects, and thesis research. This project is jointly supported between \r\nComputational Neuroscience (BIO) and Applied Mathematics (MPS).  \r\n",
