 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to develop new numerical algorithms and mathematical models \r\npredicting the breakup of liquid into droplets due to cross-flowing air \r\nand the resulting gas-liquid mixture that follows.   New numerical methods \r\nare proposed which exploit large-aspect ratio computational elements.  The \r\ninvestigator together with two graduate students, shall develop new algorithms \r\nfor including the capability for large aspect ratio elements, as a part of \r\na dynamic block-structured adaptive mesh method.   The study of large aspect \r\nratio elements as a part of an adaptive, unstructured grid framework has \r\nreceived significant attention recently (albeit, not in the context of \r\ntwo-phase flows, as we propose to study).   In contrast, the study of \r\nmoving mesh methods with large aspect ratio elements, as a part of a block \r\nstructured adaptive framework, has received very little attention.  An \r\nalgorithm based on block structured adaptive mesh refinement affords one \r\nthe advantage of easy scalability in regard to parallel computing, adoption \r\nof multigrid methodology and implementation of temporal sub-cycling \r\ntechniques.  Numerical analysis issues regarding stability and convergence \r\nof a numerical method when applied on a moving mesh, block structured \r\nadaptive grid, shall be investigated.  Also, algorithms defining the motion \r\nof the moving mesh shall be investigated.   It is important that the level \r\nof skewness for the moving mesh can be controlled.  Research developed in \r\nthis proposal can be applied to mathematical problems that exhibit moving \r\nboundary layers, shock waves, ignition fronts, or sharp interfaces.   \r\n\r\nThis proposal is concerned with the development of orders of magnitude faster \r\n(100 times faster) numerical tools for the simulation of multiphase flow \r\nproblems as applicable to science and industry.  These numerical tools shall \r\nbe specifically formulated for high-density ratio, high-shear flows at an \r\nacceptable computational cost for engineering analysis of practical problems.  \r\nOne immediate application of the proposed research is a jet-propulsion system \r\nin which fuel injected as a liquid is atomized into spray by interaction with \r\na gas phase.  Another application is the prediction of momentum and energy \r\ntransfer in the ocean due to hurricane force winds.  In order to predict \r\nmomentum and energy transfer at the sea surface, one must take into account \r\nthe sea spray generated by the high speed winds.  The ultimate benefits \r\nto society are reduced pollution, increased engine efficiency, and improved \r\nhurricane predictive capability due to a more accurate sea-spray \r\nparameterization.  This proposal is motivated by interactions between the \r\nPI and industry (e.g. UTRC).  Success of this proposal will not only have a \r\ndirect impact on industrial applications relevant to atomization type \r\nprocesses, but also a direct impact on any industrial/scientific application \r\nof multiphase flow (e.g. navy ship hydrodynamics, microfluidic applications \r\nfor testing human serum, biological fluid flows, nuclear reactor cooling \r\nsystems, and underwater explosions).  The PI has ongoing collaborations with \r\nSAIC (ship hydrodynamics), Department of Applied Chemistry at the Muroran \r\nInstitute of Technology (non-newtonian multiphase flows in chemical processing \r\napplications), the Center for Bio-Imaging and Modeling at Rutgers University \r\n(CBIM, visualization and animation of multiphase flows), for which all of \r\nthese collaborations benefit from the proposed research on simulating \r\nmultiphase flows.  The proposed research involves the participation of \r\ngraduate students; graduate students shall be trained on issues which are \r\ntimely and to which they have access to experts in the field.    \r\n",
