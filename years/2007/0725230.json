 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carl Batt of Cornell University is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow for the 2007-2008 academic year.  His research program focuses on the natural ability of bacterial surface-layer proteins to self-assemble into two-dimensional, nanoscale arrays.   These biological arrays will be exploited to produce a variety of nanoscale structures, including silicon nano pillars, which have potential use in new optical and electronic devices. Batt will use the scientific discoveries arising from his research to expand outreach to the public through interactive, traveling museum exhibits and to develop improved models for understanding and describing nanoscale phenomena.  The goals of the project include the development of the \"Chronicles of a Science Experiment,\" which will provide the public with a view of the evolution of a science project over time.\r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Informal Science Education (ISE) program of the Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings (EHR/DRL).  The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program seeks new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.",
