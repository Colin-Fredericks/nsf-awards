 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project revises and tests integrated STEM modules and an accompanying professional development component that promote differentiated instruction in order to facilitate high school teachers' instruction of 21st Century skills and integrated STEM content. STEM Fusion is a multi-tiered project focusing on the refinement of draft professional resources and the development of teacher skills related to differentiated instruction within integrated STEM instruction.\r\n\r\nProject goals include: refining, testing, and finalizing draft curriculum modules in science, mathematics, and engineering; developing, refining, and testing  a professional development process that promotes the effective curricular integration of science, technology, engineering and math content into real-world applications; and the use of pedagogical strategies that promote differentiated instruction and standards-based curriculum; and  disseminating widely models of effective STEM integration utilizing differentiated instruction in the classrooms through the NSDL database, WVDE communication channels, and a STEM Fusion Web portal.\r\n\r\nHigh school teachers will participate in revising draft modules and testing an implementation model that increases the focus on content and pedagogical knowledge. The STEM Fusion modules will utilize differentiated instruction to assist teachers in diagnosing the differences in readiness, interests and learning styles of all students in the class, using a variety of performance indicators and formative assessments. Participating teachers will apply critical math, science, and technology knowledge while they test and revise tiered lessons during summer learning experiences and in their classrooms. The curriculum, aligned with current West Virginia and national science, technology, engineering, mathematics standards, as well as with 21st Century skills, will be refined, pilot tested, further refined, and field tested. An integral part of the professional development component and the STEM Fusion curriculum will be effective strategies for teaching special needs, ESL, and advanced students. Teachers will be supported by content-expert facilitators, who will guide the module revision and implementation process and group reflection.\r\n",
