The objective of the conference is to share effective methods and strategies in undergraduate STEM education. Conference sessions will focus on five strands: (1) Examples of effective programs and strategies that improve learning and achievement for both STEM undergraduate majors and non-majors; (2) Improving project evaluation; (3) Improving faculty development, collaborations, and institutionalization; (4) Improving dissemination; and (5) Using models for teaching and learning.  The overall outcome of this conference is for participants to identify collaborators, strategies, and actions that they and others can take to transform undergraduate STEM education.  To ensure diversity among participants, selection will take into account discipline, type of project, type of institution, race/ethnicity, gender, disability, and geographic location.  The on site project evaluation will capture both the participants' opinions about the conference and the actions that they intend to take immediately after the conference.  An online follow-up survey will capture actions that participants are taking five months after the conference.  Products will include a conference publication with abstracts, a glossy publication summarizing the conference, and highlighting exemplary CCLI strategies, a website hosting all conference materials, and a CD contain these materials. \r\n",
