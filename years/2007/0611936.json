 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on advancing understanding of ice nucleation, one of the most basic processes leading to precipitation and impacting the radiative properties of cold clouds. Poor understanding of ice initiation processes in clouds results in large uncertainties in the ability to model precipitation production. Furthermore, one of the least understood postulated climate effects of aerosols is the modification of cold-cloud properties, the \"ice indirect effect\". Quantification of this effect is hampered by the lack of observational data on concentrations of particles capable of initiating ice formation at conditions relevant to the mid-to-upper troposphere. Data on ice nucleation collected using continuous flow diffusion chambers in a variety of settings in recent years have contributed to elucidation of the ice indirect effect. These data have indicated the importance of mineral dust as a significant, but highly variable, source of heterogeneous ice nuclei (IN). Through this research, the database on relatively unperturbed background tropospheric IN will be expanded and, in dust-laden air masses, relationships between dust particle concentrations, IN concentrations, and impacts on cold cloud formation and microphysics will be quantified. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, IN measurements will be made in association with two aircraft-based measurement programs having objectives that include the investigation of ice initiation in wave clouds, mid-level layer clouds, isolated cumuli and cirrus clouds. These experiments are ICE-L (Ice in Clouds Experiment - Layer clouds) and PACDEX (PACific Dust Experiment). Building on methodologies developed in previous studies by this research group, specific sampling procedures will be used within the context of flight plans to investigate ice formation processes and to relate IN measurements to ice crystal concentrations in clouds. Further, the compositions of ice nucleating particles will be measured and both concentrations and compositions will be related to aerosol sources, using supporting measurements and guidance from global aerosol transport models. Both field studies have a particular emphasis on evaluating the impact on cloud formation and properties of long-range dust transport from Asia to the U.S. in Spring. Results are expected to inform and improve numerical model simulations of mixed- and ice-phase clouds. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in the expected improvement in understanding the important sub-population of aerosols that affect cold cloud properties directly and climate indirectly. Participation in the field studies offers an unprecedented opportunity to confirm and augment understanding of ice initiation in clouds and links to aerosol particles of natural or manmade origin. \r\n\r\nThis work will have broader impacts through promoting graduate education and training, enhancing research infrastructure, testing new measurement capabilities on a new airborne platform, and through collaboration with numerical modelers, application of results toward global climate change issues. A graduate student and post-doctoral researcher will participate in the field experiments, which will involve collaborations amongst scientists in different disciplines from multiple universities and from a national research center. Finally, these data are of critical importance to unresolved issues in global change and climate impacts of anthropogenic activities. It is expected that the research of this research will find broad applications as diverse as global studies of the effects of human activities on cloud formation and development of improved parameterizations in cloud resolving and global models.",
