 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nIn many problems arising in biology, social sciences and various other \r\nfields, it is often necessary to analyze populations of entities \r\n(e.g., molecules or individuals) interconnected by a network. This proposal \r\nintends to develop new statistical formalisms and computational methodologies\r\nfor modeling and inference the semantic underpinnings of\r\nnetwork entities, and investigate how these aspects influence \r\nthe network topology and its temporal evolution during biological and \r\nsociological processes. It will also study a number of yet unexplored \r\ntopics such as discriminative learning of network structures,\r\nrecovering temporally evolving network sequences, and related theoretical \r\nissues. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research is envisaged to help address big-picture problems \r\nsuch as: 1) Hidden Identity/Function Induction, e.g., what role(s)\r\ndo individuals play when they interact with different peers under different\r\nconditions? 2) Structural/Organizational Forecast, e.g., whether and how \r\nchanges of molecular functions lead to alterations of biological pathways? \r\n3) System Robustness, e.g., how a network adjusts to \r\nperturbations caused by exogenous intrusions? \r\n\r\nThis research straddles statistical learning, social/biological sciences\r\nand data mining. The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in both \r\nthe algorithmic and theoretical novelties of the methodological developments, \r\nand the analysis of specific social and biological networks and various other \r\napplications enabled by the proposed methods. The main novelties include: \r\n(1) new Bayesian formalisms for latent space modeling of node \r\nfunctions and network linkages, which capture the functional/behavioral \r\ncontext of network entities; (2) novel temporal extensions of exponential \r\nrandom graph model for network evolution, and inference/learning algorithms; \r\n(3) algorithms for reverse-engineering temporally rewiring networks from \r\nlongitudinal node attribute data; and (4) novel discriminative learning \r\nalgorithms for learning very-large networks from partial samples of the \r\nnetwork and relevant learning theory. These methods will be applied to\r\nthe ENRON email network to explore the behavioral patterns under various \r\nbusiness operation conditions, and to analyze a longitudinal molecular \r\nabundance profile measured from breast cancer cells to infer (alterations of) \r\nnetworks under carcinogenic or tumor-suppressing environments. The results \r\nare expected to advance the principles and technologies for network analysis, \r\nand enable a wide-range of applications of broader interests.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is also expected to have broad educational and \r\nsocietal impact. As an interdisciplinary research effort, this project will \r\nprovide rich opportunities for multi-disciplinary educational and research \r\ntraining, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. A thorough understanding \r\nof social network structures in human populations can have significant impact \r\non important issues such as policy making or technology adoption. Knowledge of \r\ncellular networks and its changes in response to exogenous interventions can \r\nhelp reasoning disease causes and designing therapeutic schemes. Our methodological\r\nand software deliverables can potentially facilitate such studies, improve the\r\ncost-effectiveness of network data collection, and foster future development\r\nin this area. \r\n\r\nMore details of this project can be found at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/projects/network.htm",
