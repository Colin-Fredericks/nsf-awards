 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  goal  of this  project is  to help  users ask complicated\r\nquestions   over  unstructured   text  and   get  as   results  a\r\nconcrete  answer and  not simply  pointers  to more  data, as  is\r\ncurrently   the   practice  with   general  search  engines.  The\r\nresearch  examines how  to  execute  efficiently complex  queries\r\nover  multiple web  sources and  how to  estimate the  quality of\r\nthe   returned   results.  The  research  also  examines  how  to\r\nexecute  queries over  subjective,  sentiment  data by  examining\r\nthe   economic  context   in  which   the  stated   opinions  are\r\nevaluated.  The  experimental  research  is  strongly  linked  to\r\nthe educational  goals   of  the   project that  include,  among\r\nothers,   modernization  of   the  undergraduate   curriculum  on\r\ndatabases   to   include  the   latest  trends  in  database  and\r\ninformation  systems and the introduction of a graduate course on\r\nthe  transformative  role of  search technologies in business and\r\nsociety.  The  results of this project will give the power\r\nand  tools  to the  users to  quickly process  the vast amount of\r\navailable  data  on the  web and  get back  answers (and not more\r\ndocuments  or  data to process).  The systems built as\r\npart  of this project, together with the related data sets, will\r\nbe  available  on the project website (http://text-centric-db.stern.nyu.edu/),  \r\nallowing everyone to evaluate complex queries over web data\r\nand build novel applications on top of the built infrastructure.\r\n",
