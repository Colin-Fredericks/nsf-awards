 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThis study examines the impact of the European Court of Justice- the best case of\r\npowerful supranational justice- on the health services of Western Europe- the best cases\r\nof welfare states, politically salient and deeply wedded to their domestic order. Since\r\n1998, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the top court of the European Union (EU) and\r\n\"the most effective supranational body in the history of the world\" (Stone Sweet\r\n2005:108), has begun to incorporate health and social security into the liberalizing EU\r\nsingle market. Existing studies have focused on explaining this case of European\r\nintegration and on doing preliminary maps of power and responsibility in EU health care\r\npolicy. This project goes beyond those studies and takes this development as a case of the\r\nimpact of supranational justice on policy and implementation. It asks (1) what variance is\r\nthere in the concrete policy responses of EU member states to the decisions of the ECJ on\r\ncross-border mobility of patients and labor regulation? And 2) what explains the variation\r\nin EU member state responses to the developing EU law?\r\nAnswering the first question requires research to identify what \"compliance\"\r\nmeans to governments in different states and how much of it there has been. This\r\ninvolves governments' interpretation not just of EU law but of the likely actions of the\r\ndomestic courts that interpret and apply most EU law. For the second question, there are\r\ntwo clear hypotheses derived from the literature on the impact of judicial decisions on\r\nsociety. One is a political hypothesis, that the success of judicial decisions is a function of\r\nthe existing \"support structure\"- that decisions, without interest groups who will support\r\nand take advantage of implementation, will have very limited impact. The other is\r\ninstitutional, drawn from the literature on \"Europeanization\". It identifies the problem as\r\na goodness-of-fit problem; states will comply faster and better with decisions that require\r\nless change to existing institutions.\r\nThe study will be conducted with legal elite-level interviews and legal\r\ndocumentary analysis in Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The countries\r\nhave been selected because they represent a range of relevant variables- legal systems,\r\nhealth systems, bureaucracies, and historic relations with EU law and policy. This plays\r\nto the strengths of qualitative case studies in a situation with many hypotheses and few\r\nreliable indicators. Policymakers' perceptions of their legal powers and constraints are\r\ncrucial, and best accessed through interviews and research in the relevant law.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal lies in its approach to the issue of\r\njudicialization in the EU and beyond. For the EU, it contributes to the analysis both of the\r\nrising power of the ECJ and of its actual impact- an impact that includes both extended\r\nEU powers over the welfare state, and the potential legitimation or delegitimation of the\r\nEuropean project. More broadly, it should contribute to the small literature on the\r\nimportant relationship between courts and bureaucracies, identifying the effects of courts\r\non implementers. The broader impact will come in two ways. First, European Union\r\nlaw and the welfare state is an important topic with ample potential to engage in\r\ncontemporary European debates. Second, the project incorporates student research from\r\nthe undergraduate to doctoral level, exposing students to sociolegal research and\r\nEuropean politics.\r\n\r\n",
