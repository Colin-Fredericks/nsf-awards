Uhlenbeck\r\n\r\nThe UT Geometry Group Research Training Grant is a vertically\r\nintegrated program to enhance the training of undergraduates,\r\ngraduate students, and postdoctoral associates at the University\r\nof Texas and, through publication on the web, beyond.  The nine\r\nfaculty members of the Group will initiate new activities at all\r\nlevels.  Included is a new distinguished lecture series,\r\nPerspectives in Geometry, which will be widely disseminated.  The\r\nGeometry Group at UT has long taken a unified perspective on the\r\nfield.  Our seminars reflect our approach: they include a healthy\r\nmix of ideas from algebraic geometry, differential geometry,\r\nglobal linear and nonlinear analysis, representation theory, and\r\ntopology.  Often concepts and inspiration from theoretical\r\nphysics play a role as well.  The RTG training activities are\r\ndesigned to promote this view of geometry and, more broadly, of\r\nmathematics and science to young mathematicians.\r\n\r\nMathematics, the study of Number and Space, lies at the\r\nfoundation of science and technology.  Geometry, the study of\r\nSpace, has long had connections with and applications to the real\r\nworld.  In the ancient world measurement was introduced to\r\nfacilitate commerce; more advanced concepts, such as\r\ntrigonometry, were introduced to understand the stars.  In our\r\nmodern world advanced ideas in Geometry underlie abstract\r\ntheories in physics and also have more immediate practical\r\nimplications, for example in coding theory, computer graphics,\r\netc.  Effective training of the next generation of Geometers is\r\nvital for the continued development of this field, both within\r\nmathematics and for external applications.  The University of\r\nTexas Geometry Group Research Training Grant (RTG) promotes a\r\nunified view of the field.  Through local activities in Austin,\r\nand via dissemination on the web, the RTG will enhance training\r\nat all levels.\r\n",
