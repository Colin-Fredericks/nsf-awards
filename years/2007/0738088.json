The research at Auburn University will address several important areas in the next generation wireless Internet and will complement the research capabilities at the existing research sites.  The theme of the research will be cross-layer optimization of coexisting wireless systems.  \r\n\r\nAs a research site of the I/UCRC, Auburn University will be able to expand the base of technologies that the faculty and graduate students have been addressing at the system level.  The research will benefit the society by providing efficient and low cost wireless systems.  \r\n",
