 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with two broad classes of problems. The first\r\nconcerns varieties of commuting matrices and jet schemes, and arises\r\nfrom algebro-geometric interpretations of an open problem in\r\ncommuting matrices.  The other concerns division algebras, and\r\narises from the classical question of crossed products, and as well,\r\nfrom recently discovered applications of division algebras to coding\r\ntheory.\r\nIn the first class of problems, the PI, Sethuraman, wishes to study\r\nvarious varieties defined by the condition that certain matrices\r\ncommute, such as varieties of commuting pairs, of commuting triples,\r\nand of commuting pairs in the centralizers of fixed matrices. The\r\nidea is to gain insight into three generated commutative matrix\r\nalgebras. Jet schemes of commuting pairs of matrices arise naturally\r\nin these considerations, as do jet schemes of determinantal\r\nvarieties.  In the second class of problems, Sethuraman wishes to\r\nstudy certain generically defined symbol division algebras of prime\r\nexponent and index various powers of the prime to determine if these\r\nare crossed products.  The generic nature of the symbol algebra\r\nmakes this a significant object to study.  In a different direction,\r\nSethuraman wishes to continue to study applications of division\r\nalgebras to wireless communication, including determining large\r\nsubgroups of units in orders in division algebras, and the\r\nconstruction of orthogonal lattices inside number fields for\r\nappropriate trace forms.\r\n\r\nThe problems considered in this proposal arise from algebra and\r\nalgebraic geometry.  There are two kinds of problems studied here:\r\none where the motivation comes from within mathematics, and the\r\nother where, very significantly, the motivation comes from\r\nwireless communication.  The PI has had a successful collaboration\r\nwith engineers where he was able to utilize certain abstractly\r\ndefined mathematical objects (``division algebras'') to solve a very\r\npractical telecommunications problem.  The synergy appeared most\r\nunexpectedly, and has led to a very fruitful body of results in the\r\nfield.   In addition to this work with engineers, it is to be noted\r\nthat the PI teaches in a primarily undergraduate institution, with a\r\nlarge immigrant population, where he has guided several\r\nundergraduate and masters level students on research projects in\r\nmathematics. Some of these students will go on to be school\r\nteachers. He proposes to continue working with students on research\r\nprojects.\r\n",
