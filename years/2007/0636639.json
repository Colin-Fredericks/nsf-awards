 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory project searches for fossils on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands off of the Antarctic peninsula. Strata there date from 125 to 99 million years in age, a critical time in the development of various flora and fauna. With so many unknowns in the biotic history of the Antarctic, any finds of vertebrate fossils on this little explored island will be of great significance. One key question is marsupial evolution. It is assumed that marsupials of South America and Australia transited through Antarctica, but a supporting fossil record has yet to be discovered. Related investigations on Mesozoic climate will be performed through stable isotope analysis of clay and rock samples. The broader impacts of the project include graduate student education and public outreach through a museum exhibit.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n",
