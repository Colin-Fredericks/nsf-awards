The successful development of a viable technology to generate continuous lasing spectrum crossing multiple communication bands in near-infrared will bring significant advances and impact to optics fiber communications, imaging, metrology, spectroscopy and sensing. In this project, our objective is to develop a new class of diode laser that will produce ultra-broad stimulated emission at high quantum efficiency and wall-plug efficiency that inherits from the interband transition operation of quantum confined heterostructure at near-infrared region. We aim to achieve this objective by fabricating the diode laser in highly inhomogeneous semiconductor quantum-dash medium with the ground state and the excited states properly engineered to give small energy spacing and simultaneous emission at room temperature. This compact, cost effective and high efficiency broadband diode laser will unfold many new ideas across inter-disciplinary fields. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nWe have a balance effort of research and educational components in this research. Our educational effort will prepare students with exposure to broad spectrum of inter-disciplinary physics and engineering perspective from material science, fundamental semiconductor nanostructure physics, theoretical modeling, to the advanced photonic devices. The findings of the research will have a broad impact on optoelectronics, sensor, imaging, educational units, and industry programs, as well the society at large. In the broad education elements of this project, students will gain unique experience in a vertically-integrated technology, theoretical model development to material and devices. We will continue to actively promote the involvement of undergraduate students in the research program to interest more under-represented students to contribute to the advanced research. For a broader impact to the general public, our theoretical models on intermixed quantum-dot/dash and the broadband semiconductor laser will be converted to a laboratory module, and posted in the internet for all levels of students, academy, and industry professionals to download. \r\n",
