 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine a model system of vocal learning, bird song learning. The research will concentrate on the role of social factors, and will contrast several different hypotheses about these factors. According to the direct interaction hypothesis, young birds learn songs by interacting with older birds. According to the social eavesdropping hypothesis, the young bird learns primarily by extracting information from interactions among other birds that he observes or overhears. According to the social dominance hypothesis, the key information concerns the dominance relationships of those birds, while according to the singing rules hypothesis, the key information concerns which songs are appropriate replies to other songs. These hypotheses will be tested using the newly-developed 'virtual tutor' system which can both simulate interacting singers and interact directly with the subject.  This system also captures many of the features of live counter-singing birds while permitting the investigator more experimental control than is possible with live birds.  Parallel studies will be carried out in the field.\r\n\r\nSong learning in songbirds has been analyzed extensively in the laboratory and, in part because of its many parallels with human language learning, it has become a major model system for studying the neurobiology and genetics of learning. It is only recently that another parallel with human language learning has been recognized; i.e., the role of social factors in vocal learning.  This research will further develop the utility of this model system of learning. The research will support both graduate and undergraduate students. It will also play a role in public education, featuring the field research which takes place at Discovery Park, a 532-acre natural area park operated by Seattle Parks & Recreation.\r\n",
