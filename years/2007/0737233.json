 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summary of research:\r\nThis project will develop a gene chip for the Neotropical butterfly Heliconius erato and use it to study the temporal and spatial patterning of gene expression during wing pattern development.  Heliconius erato has undergone an extraordinary adaptive radiation in its vividly colored wing patterns and is an important ecological and evolutionary model for studying selection, adaptation and morphological differentiation.  This research will determine how differences in gene expression are correlated with differences in pigmentation both within and between geographic races of H. erato, and how gene expression patterns for different elements of the color pattern change during development.  This work is expected to uncover new genes involved in pattern formation and lays the groundwork for understanding how changes in genetic regulatory interactions cause morphological diversification and about how these interactions are modified during an evolutionary radiation.  On a more general level, wing pattern formation and evolution in Heliconius is an excellent model system for conceptualizing the developmental mechanisms underlying the formation and diversification of more complex morphological traits.  In addition, because the genetic networks underlying wing pattern formation in butterflies may be simple, this system could provide a powerful model for reverse engineering of genetic regulatory networks from gene expression data.  This project is a synergistic collaboration between researchers at the University of Puerto Rico and Duke University and will promote a broader participation of underrepresented groups in science, particularly at the undergraduate level.  Furthermore, given their visually stunning patterns and remarkable evolutionary radiation, Heliconius butterflies are excellent models to promote general conservation and educational efforts.\r\n",
