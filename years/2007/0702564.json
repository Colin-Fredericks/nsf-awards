Harris, Northeastern University\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nPlanar microwave circuit components based on tunable negative index materials (TNIMs) are proposed. We have recently demonstrated unique properties of a ferrite-based negative index material that include a dynamic tunability of the negative index over 5 GHz at K-band, in addition to low microwave losses (0.4 dB/cm). The primary goal of the proposed program is to demonstrate in simulation and experiment a phase shifter operating from 19-24 GHz, having an instantaneous bandwidth of 10%, a dynamic bandwidth of 25%, and 0.3 dB/cm insertion loss, operating at a microwave power of 100 Watts. The stretch goal will be to demonstrate a TNIM-based electronically scanned planar leaky wave antenna in the K-band. We will demonstrate a directivity gain of the order of 6 dBi per cell. Focus will be in achieving 3 dB pattern bandwidth of 600 or more continuous scanning capability.  \r\n\r\nBroader impact\r\nThe proposed research will represent the start of a new technology that incorporates negative index metamaterials in monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). Improvements in performance figures of merit, together with reduced size and weight, may revolutionize the MMIC industry. Research will be carried out in the Center for Microwave Magnetic Materials and Integrated Circuits (CM3IC) at Northeastern University. Since its establishment, the CM3IC has had an aggressive outreach program that targets research minded high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Additionally, NEU is renowned for its successful cooperative education program. The CM3IC is a registered co-op provider at NEU that offers undergraduate students meaningful research experiences. During the last 24 months, high school students have co-authored five journal articles and co-op students have published four journal articles. The Center presently has one African-American student and two minority women. Funding of this research program will lead to an increased membership of these underrepresented groups. \r\n",
