 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently,considerable progress has been made in the study of string theories.\r\nIt has been realized that superstring theory has a web of duality symmetries relating\r\nnonperturbative effects to perturbative ones. The picture emerging is that there exists a\r\nfundamental theory, M-theory, that perturbatively, looks like string theory, but\r\nnonperturbatively has a very rich structure which includes symmetries relating\r\nperturbative excitations to solitons. Another recent development\r\nhas been Maldacena's conjectured equivalence between string theory on anti-de Sitter\r\nspaces and gauge field theories living on the boundary of these spaces. This ADS/CFT\r\nequivalence gave more importance to the study of gravitational anti-de Sitter\r\nconfigurations as they provide a tool to the study of quantum gauge field theories\r\nimportant for particle physics. The main focus of this proposal is: a) to find\r\na complete classification of supersymmetric gravitational backgrounds in various\r\nspacetime dimensions and to understand better the ADS/CFT correspondence and the\r\nintricate relation between geometry and supersymmetry. b) to develop our\r\nunderstanding of the nonperturbative theory underlying string theory, and incorporate\r\nthe new developments in the study of the phenomenological implications of string theory\r\nto gravitational physics, particle physics and cosmology. The broader implications of\r\nthis proposal are that it will lead to collaboration between string theorists and differential\r\ngeometry. Also the work will take place at the Center for Advanced mathematical\r\nScience at the University of Beirut which will become a Major Center for collaborations\r\namong scientists in the Middle East.\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nDiary Note\r\nProposal:0703017 PI Name:Sabra, Wafic\r\nPrinted from eJacket: 02/28/07 Page 1 of 1",
