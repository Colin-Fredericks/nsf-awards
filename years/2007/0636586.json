 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed program is the area of applied and computational analysis to be hosted by the Department of Mathematics and the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) at the University of Texas at Austin. The goal is the creation of a model program in applied and computational mathematic that will include enhanced undergraduate research experience (REU), reduced time to graduation and stronger background in applicable mathematics for graduate students, and the highest level of postdoctoral mentoring, all to be achieved by curriculum and examination reform, new undergraduate concentrations, new integrated seminar and working group series, summer programs, and an active mentoring program.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed work is based on applied and computational analysis as the fundamental field that links mathematics to the different areas of applications in the natural and social sciences and engineering both within and outside of the university. Focus will be on non-linear theory and computations of differential equations, which give the most fundamental of mathematical models in science and technology from an applied point of view. The need for young, well-trained mathematicians capable of connecting to diverse areas of applications has never been higher. At the local level, the proposed program will contribute towards the increase of the number of students attracted to mathematics, and, at the national level, it will serve as a model program for similar initiatives.\r\n",
