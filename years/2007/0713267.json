 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nDeclarative, database-style models for programming distributed applications \r\nare becoming widely adopted, in a variety of realms ranging from sensors \r\nto publish-subscribe to network state management.  They free the developer\r\nto define high-level queries for the specific data of interest,\r\nwithout regard to details about data sources, communications protocols,\r\nor synchronization.\r\n\r\nAs this approach to programming gains momentum, there is increasing need\r\nto abstract low-level stream data source variations away under a uniform\r\n representation, i.e., a view; and to integrate, i.e., conjoin, different \r\ntypes of stream data from large numbers of sources.  Such tasks involve\r\nmuch more distributed communication and coordination than in traditional\r\ndistributed databases or even data stream management systems. \r\nIt becomes essential to do in-network computation of the query, \r\nand to optimize the processing of each stream (or few streams) separately, \r\nin a way that considers the topology of the network.\r\n\r\nThis proposal develops the technologies to support integration of data streams, \r\nincluding languages for stream schema mappings, focusing on issues relating\r\nto combining distributed messages and maintaining timing information;\r\ntechniques for rapidly establishing query computation paths through a network,\r\nfor sets of data stream elements that need to be joined and aggregated together; \r\noffline and adaptive, network-aware query optimization techniques for\r\ndistributed computation in the network. These techniques will scale\r\nacross widely heterogeneous (sensor, wireless, and\r\nconventional) networks, and will be evaluated in environmental monitoring\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is the development of new techniques for performing\r\nqueries across large, highly distributed networks of stream-producing sources;\r\nthis increases understanding of the adaptive query processing space when access\r\ncosts to data items are non-uniform and query processing requires distributed\r\ncommunication, and the trade-offs with respect to offline versus adaptive\r\noptimization and relative to optimization granularity.  The broader impact\r\nincludes the development of distributed stream integration capabilities that\r\ncan directly address a number of emerging and well-known challenges in the \r\nnetwork and environmental monitoring domains.  The educational component \r\nincludes the training of two PhD students, and the teaching of stream data \r\nintegration in graduate and advanced undergraduate courses.\r\n\r\nProject URL:  http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~zives/stream-integration/",
