 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This study is being conducted in tandem with the formal evaluation of a related STEP grant (0336596) to further increase the number of biology majors at this university.  This study has two purposes. The first purpose is systematically uncovering outcomes of the two programs under study. The second purpose is discovering processes that lead to successful outcomes. The Outcomes Study relies on extant institutional and departmental records. These data are being treated with statistical analyses, both descriptive and inferential. The Processes Study utilizes a grounded theory approach, including numerous interviews with current students, field switchers, and alumni from the two programs. The objectives of this project are as follows:\r\n1. Document outcomes of the Biology and BNS programs and compare them to national outcome measures.\r\n2. Identify differences in outcomes, if any, for students who were under-prepared in high school.\r\n3. Identify differences in outcomes, if any, for students who were from traditionally underrepresented groups.\r\n4. Determine what factors, and with what relative significance, contributed to achievement of outcomes by the students who were under-prepared in high school and/or were from traditionally underrepresented groups.\r\n5. Identify processes that led to successful outcomes as identified by current students, field-switchers, and alumni.\r\n6. Identify the reasons and the points in time that students report experiences they perceived as transformative for their educational and/or career plans.\r\n7. Describe processes used by Biology and BNS faculty in teaching, mentoring, and guiding student research.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts; The Biology program at Andrews University has a record extending back more than a decade that demonstrates success with all students, including a fairly high percentage of students whose high school performance would not predict success in STEM fields at the college level. This group of under-prepared students includes many students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines, particularly in terms of ethnicity and gender. This project is  identifying the factors that have contributed to its success. Results from this study add to the literature which describes characteristics of effective  STEM education, particularly in terms of working with under-prepared students or students from traditionally underrepresented groups. The study results are being disseminated via reports, presentations at professional conferences, and publications in appropriate journals.\r\n",
