A research experience at NIST provides a positive impact at a critical point in the careers of these underrepresented students who have yet to be encouraged to pursue careers in science, math and engineering.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the students attend a variety of seminars, participate in ethics training, and present their own results at both local and national scientific meetings.  Through this REU program the students become aware of what a full time research career feels like and experience first-hand how they can make a difference through science and engineering research.\r\n\r\nThis REU program will focus its outreach to colleges and universities that demonstrate strong hands-on undergraduate science curricula and a commitment to the education of women, minorities, and students with disabilities.  The program will dramatically impact the undergraduate students and motivate them to pursue graduate education and to consider careers in teaching and research.\r\n\r\n",
