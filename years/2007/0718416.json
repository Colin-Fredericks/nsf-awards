 "awd_abstract_narration": "In birds, as in humans, young sometimes remain at home with their parents long after the usual age of independence.  In human agricultural societies, it is usually males, particularly first-born sons, that remain at home and the extent of family wealth, measured as farmland, is a key factor. Males also tend to be the gender that stays home in birds and this leads to a variety of interesting consequences, including cooperative breeding, where sons provide aid by feeding chicks in their parents' nest, or less obvious social behaviors such as communal roosting, cooperative defense of the territory, and food-sharing by family members.  Like humans, western bluebirds ?own? land in the form of defended territories with mistletoe, which provides a continuous supply of berries over the winter.   Like farmers, the bluebirds ?plant? the seeds of mistletoe by passing the berries through their guts, leaving the seeds still viable and surrounded by a sticky coating that helps them to adhere to limbs and grow.  Western bluebird sons and some daughters tend to stay home with their parents during their first year of life.  When mistletoe abundance was reduced by half, fewer sons stayed home, suggesting that in western bluebirds, as in humans, wealth plays a role in delayed dispersal.  The current work will determine whether parental favoritism also provides advantages to sons staying at home and whether in staying, sons incur fitness costs in the form of increased competition with relatives, genetic costs of reduced offspring viability due to incest, and reduced mate availability due to incest avoidance.  Studying these factors will complete the picture of delayed dispersal for western bluebirds and help tease apart which is more important to sons staying home ? resources or the increased access to those resources that comes from living with nepotistic parents.  It will also establish the extent to which mistletoe is a keystone resource that is critical for western bluebird conservation.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiologists and anthropologists have long sought to understand how animals become social and the role that kin relationships and living in groups plays in survival and reproduction in species ranging from ants to humans.  This grant focused on how western bluebirds become social, which means wintering in family groups, having sons stay nearby, and thus living in kin neighborhoods where male offspring maintain connections to their family and natal territory for life.  As for 19th century farmers living in Massachusetts, wealth plays an important role in the delayed and localized dispersal of sons.  When parents have large holdings of oak mistletoe, sons tend to stay home for winter and are more likely, having done so, to disperse nearby.  This localized dispersal allows sons to go home and help their parents raise young in the event that they are unable to breed. But not all parents can afford to share with sons and nonparents shouldn't share at all.  We found that having parents present was also critically important to the dispersal decisions of sons, so it's not just sons with wealthy parents that stay home, but sons with surviving wealthy parents.  The way that bluebirds space their territories in winter means that sons staying on wealthy territories almost always survive to their first spring.  In other words, the mistletoe-dependent dispersal mechanism that leads sons to stay home is based, not on variation among territories and decisions to trade up in territory quality, but instead is a mechanism to keep enough sons in habitat where their prospects for survival are extremely high, releasing sons to the uncertainties associated with long distance dispersal only when their local prospects are poor.
