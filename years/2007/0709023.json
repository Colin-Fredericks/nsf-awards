 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project exploits an innovative nanomanufacturing process, solid-state superionic stamping to realize a suite of ionically modulated active nanostructures. The convergence of this electrochemical nanoimprint technique with the nano-ionic devices with enhanced transduction and information processing using superionic conductor materials opens up new routes to economically viable, active nanostructures. Specifically the team is exploring: (a) tunable nanowire resonators/antennae for THz frequencies, which will potentially lead to a new generation of high speed opto-electronic interconnects; (b) plasmonic devices for  chemically sensing sub-femtoliter analytes    and (c) mechanical actuators that require dramatically lower voltages and operate with much  higher  strain rat es   and  are amenable to harsh environment. In addition, we undertake fundamental research in computational and experimental characterization of ionic transport in (solid-state) superionic conductors at nanoscale, leading to a fundamental understanding of nanostructure growth by ionic conduction and strategies to actively control and modulate it. This, along with the ability to fabricate such nanostructures, creates a whole new platform for practical design and manufacturing of future mechanical, chemical and electronic circuitry.\r\nThis project also contributes to educational goals of nanomanufacturing by introducing students to advanced optics and photonics, nanoscale systems design, integration and manufacturing processes. Efforts include research opportunities to undergraduates, participation in outreach activities and programs of research centers within the college of engineering at the University of Illinois and to identify and engage underrepresented minority and female students in engineering research and education. In addition, the PIs are organizing a focused symposium on the Nanomanufacturing at the 2007 ASME MSEC meeting in Atlanta.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
