 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to make the responsible conduct of research (RCR) education pervasive and continuous at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras by preparing current and succeeding generations of researchers to understand and use the social, moral, and ethical perimeters of research, from inception through dissemination.  The project works with graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and graduate faculty hired within the past 5 years in a variety of ways, including on-line delivery of bilingual modules, workshops for new faculty members and graduate students, faculty and student participation in creating and sustaining an RCR environment and RCR topics in required courses and seminars.   The RCR training focuses on four themes: essentials of research ethics and societal implications; mentor-trainee relationships and responsibilities; best practices across the professions, and regulatory and support environments. Students at two partner UPR institutions will participate in all RCR activities, and faculty at those institutions will serve on the Advisory Committee. Formative and summative evaluation will be used, with a major element of outcomes measurement being pre- and post-tests using the Defining Issues Test from the University of Minnesota.",
