However, while helpful,\r\ntype systems used in practice verify relatively weak safety properties; they fall far short of program correctness.  This inexpressiveness is partly by design---full verification is expensive, not fully automatable, and often unwarranted.  Nevertheless, there are many situations where the ability to specify rich program properties would be useful. Among programming-language researchers, there is recent argument that techniques from dependent type theory provide a spectrum of possibilities between simple type safety and full verification\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to advance the design of practical dependently-typed functional programming languages. In particular, the research focuses on two approaches:\r\n  * To design a fully dependently-typed language, using an\r\n    effect-type system to ensure soundness.\r\n  * To employ a combination of global and local type inference so\r\n    that programming with dependent types may be done concisely.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation of these approaches is through the design of a prototype dependently-typed language.  As well as the contributions listed above, this project aids the education of both graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\n",
