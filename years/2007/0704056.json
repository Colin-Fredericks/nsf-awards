 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThis renewal project provides an opportunity for deaf and hard of hearing students\r\nto participate in classroom and laboratory research work in the field of polymers. A\r\nsmall group of college-age students will perform an internship at Tufts University for six\r\nweeks during the summer. The classroom and laboratory components address the\r\nmaterials chemistry and physics of polymers and polymer-based nanocomposites,\r\ncrystallization and melting of polymers, the interaction of X-rays and light with\r\npolymers, mechanical properties of polymers, and the connection between thermal\r\nprocessing, structure, and ultimate properties of polymers. To prepare the students for\r\nparticipation in the scientific community, a strong component of pre-professional training\r\nis incorporated, including discussion of ethical issues in the performance of research and\r\nin scholarship. The goals of the laboratory research component are to: expose the\r\nstudents to the laboratory environment; introduce them to the concepts of formulating and\r\ntesting hypotheses; assist students to conduct systematic studies while controlling\r\nvariables; illustrate the use of modern analytical equipment; and demonstrate the\r\nconnection between processing variables, structure, and properties.\r\nThe students will make and characterize polymer-based nanocomposite films\r\ncomprising a semicrystalline polymer matrix and an additive, which will be either\r\norganically modified silicates (clay) or glass nanospheres. This research will contribute\r\nto a fundamental understanding of the effects of nanoparticles on the structure and\r\nproperties of semicrystalline polymers. In this renewal, we will emphasize mechanical\r\nproperty measurements, using newly available instrumentation.                                                                   \r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe program is aimed at a disadvantaged minority population, of deaf and hard of\r\nhearing college age students. The unique attributes of this program are its emphasis on:\r\n1. Teamwork; 2. Performance of a start-to-finish research project; 3. Materials sciencebased\r\napproach; and 4. Diversity. Students of all disability levels are candidates for this\r\nprogram, including those students who neither hear nor voice. The broader impact will\r\nbe to bring deaf and hard of hearing students into the larger scientific community as\r\nprofessionals, by providing positive scientific experiences at a formative time in their\r\neducational lives. The long-range goal of the proposed program is to increase\r\nparticipation of deaf and hard of hearing students in science and engineering, and provide\r\nenrichment and mentoring for these students.",
