 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main aim of this collaborative project is an in-depth study of \r\nthe homological mirror symmetry conjecture. Auroux, Katzarkov, \r\nKontsevich, Orlov and Seidel will lead a concerted effort to formulate \r\nand understand homological mirror symmetry in systematic manner, and \r\nextend it to varieties of general type and to noncommutative varieties. \r\nThis will require some foundational work in homological algebra, \r\nnoncommutative geometry, and symplectic geometry. Another goal is to \r\ninvestigate applications of mirror symmetry to classical problems in \r\nalgebraic geometry (for example studying the rationality of certain \r\nalgebraic varieties) and symplectic topology (in particular, Lagrangian \r\nsubmanifolds). \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a wider perspective, the project aims to provide a mathematical \r\ncounterpart to some recent advances in theoretical physics. The \r\ncontribution that mathematics can make is to verify the soundness and \r\nconsistency of physical intuition, and to prepare the general ground \r\non which further development can occur. This is particularly important \r\nin those situations where developments in physics suggest the presence \r\nof deep and complex structures, which are difficult to detect by direct \r\nexperiment. At the same time, this effort will make it possible to answer \r\nsome purely mathematical (geometric) questions, some of which have been \r\nopen for a long time. \r\nThe collaborative effort will be carried out through regular meetings \r\nand workshops, and by fostering interaction between leading experts in \r\nthe field and younger mathematicians (graduate students and postdocs); \r\ndissemination of knowledge in this rapidly evolving area of mathematics \r\nwill be facilitated by regularly held winter and summer schools and \r\nconferences.",
