 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Targeted Infusion Project will add an Associate of Science Degree to the existing Liberal Arts, Business, and Religious Studies programs at Clinton Junior College, a Historically Black College in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual mert: An Associate of Science Degree provides Clinton Junior College students the opportunity to compete with others in science, technology, and mathematic fields. In addition, an Associate of Science Degree option will strengthen the mathematical and science foundation of our students who plan to matriculate to four-year institutions. Traditionally, students at Clinton Junior College can only take the required mathematics and science classes for a Liberal Arts Degree, however many students express interest in STEM areas as a major but have no choice for an Associate of Science degree. The Targeted Infusion Project will provide support to hire professors in the STEM areas to develop and teach new courses as well as learn best practices at two-year and four-year institutions with Associate of Science Degrees in order to develop a strong Associate of Science Degree program at Clinton Junior College.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts: An Associate of Science Degree at Clinton Junior College will increase the number of African American undergraduate students who major in chemistry, biology, physical science, mathematics, and computer science. Approximately 70 % of the students at Clinton Junior College are African American males. Collaborative efforts with the middle and high schools throughout York County in the state of South Carolina will encourage more minorities to pursue STEM degrees at the College. Currently approximately 12% of Clinton's students volunteer at local elementary schools in science or mathematic classes and adding the Associate of Science Degree to Clinton Junior College should increase this number.  As part of this project articulation agreements with four-year institutions for transferring Clinton Junior College students with an Associate of Science Degree will be formed with a minimum of two institutions. In addition, summer internships with four-year institutions will be provided which will increase the probability of these students continuing in the STEM areas ultimately increasing the number of students obtaining masters and doctorate degrees in STEM related fields.     \r\n",
