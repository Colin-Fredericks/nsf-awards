 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) is for the acquisition of a thermo-hydroforming stamping press capable of forming sheet materials of varying thickness and composition under high pressure and temperature at varying strain rates. The research to be conducted includes design and synthesis of multifunctional composite materials (MCM) through incorporation of nano-reinforcements at both the interlaminar and intralaminar levels. The key principle will be to control the nanoparticle concentration, orientation and morphology through the thermo-hydroforming stamping process. The emphasis of the research would be on the development of fundamental materials-processing-property relationships that lead to polymer and composite multifunctional properties, particularly mechanical stiffness and toughness, reduced weight, thermal conductivity, dielectric properties, electrical conductivity, enhanced barrier performance, fire resistance and self-diagnostic capability. Examples of materials to be tested with the thermo-hydroforming press are (a) nanomaterial-reinforced composites, (b) engineered materials for RF devices, (c) tailorable materials and structures, (d) biobased structural composites, and (e) to shape-set and perforate thin nitinol shape memory alloy sheets for biomedical applications. \r\n\r\nThe thermo-hydroforming press will provide numerous educational and research opportunities for faculty, post-doc fellows, graduate and undergraduate researchers to learn more about forming of biobased composites, nanocomposites, and lightweight metals, as well as to verify the accuracy of existing material models and to develop new models for the forming simulation of nanocomposites. Through various workshops sponsored annually by the college of engineering, participation of first-generation, low-income and/or underrepresented college juniors and seniors in the thermo-hydroforming research will be encouraged. The multicultural apprenticeship program (MAP) will provide for the participation of underrepresented women high school students to learn more about career opportunities in biobased materials and nanotechnology. The new thermo-hydroforming press will also provide opportunities for local small businesses to have access to a research instrument. Finally, using summer workshops sponsored by the Society of Plastic Engineers (SPE), practicing engineers will be trained on the benefits of stamp thermo-hydroforming as a unique process for forming composite materials.\r\n",
