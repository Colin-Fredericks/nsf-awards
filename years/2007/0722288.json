 "awd_abstract_narration": "The HarambeeNet project's goal is to change courses and perceptions of introductory computer science.  The incredible growth in statistics courses at all levels, in contrast with the decline of students taking computer science courses, points to the potential for introducing computer science in variety of venues without emphasizing the process of programming: leverage the expertise and role-models provided by educators from other fields by studying topics that arise from the science of networks and modeling to introduce computer science as an alternative to the traditional programming approach.  The project team will develop modules that will be incorporated into existing courses in math, statistics, computer science, sociology, economics, and related fields.  These modules will be developed and evaluated by faculty learning communities based at Duke. The work from these faculty learning communities will be supplemented by educators who will attend workshops at Duke and use a social network model to disseminate the modules to colleagues who will continue to assess and develop them. An advisory board with expertise in computer science and social networks will oversee module development which will ultimately lead to a new paradigm for introducing computer science at a wide variety of schools at all levels.",
