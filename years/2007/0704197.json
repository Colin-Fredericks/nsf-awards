 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This project addresses two related research areas: 1) use of photophysics to explore specific defects in single wall carbon nanotubes, to determine their specific behavior as a function of laser excitation energy and defect size, and 2) related research involving double wall carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) stimulated by their potential for practical applications, and by their conceptual relation to double layer graphene; the approach focuses on the behavior of a given (n,m) tube when it is the constituent of a DWNT as compared to its behavior when it is a single wall nanotube (SWNT). The fundamental issue under scrutiny is the difference between the behavior of one or two graphene sheets as they exist in their planar structure or when they are rolled up to form SWNT, DWNT or eventually multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). Resonance Raman scattering is utilized to probe the effect of tube curvature and the effect of whether a tube and its neighboring tubes are semiconducting or metallic. \r\nNon-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science and condensed matter physics with technological relevance, and is expected to provide unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate training in an interdisciplinary field. The project is also expected to have broader impacts through the training of women and men leaders in this research field through mentorship by a female PI role model who has established a world wide reputation as a research leader. The PI will continue her multiple approaches and activities to describe advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology to the public through invited talks to general audiences, through advisory work for the US Government (as a member of the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Committee of the DOE), industrial laboratories and professional societies (as Chair of the Board of the American Institute of Physics), and through her co-chairmanship of the Decadal Study on Condensed Matter and Materials Physics 2010 of the National Research Council. Her service in holding mentoring sessions for undergrads and graduate students at numerous universities will continue. This project is co-supported by the DMR Electronic Materials and Condensed Matter Physics Programs. \r\n",
