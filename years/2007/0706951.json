The\r\nmethod consists of minimizing a least-squares functional which\r\nquantifies the difference between theoretical and experimental\r\nsedimentation speeds for a given collection of fragments, and its\r\nnumerical implementation requires the repeated solution of an\r\nexterior Stokes-type problem around various slender,\r\nthree-dimensional domains.  The research effort is centered on\r\nthree areas: (1) the study of the theoretical sedimentation speed\r\nof a stiff polymer in a Stokes-type fluid with thermal\r\nfluctuations in different asymptotic limits, (2) the design and\r\nanalysis of fast, provably convergent boundary element methods\r\nfor computing the theoretical sedimentation speed based on the\r\nnovel idea of a kernel-adapted Nystrom method, and (3) the design\r\nand analysis of fast, reliable methods for minimizing a\r\nleast-squares sedimentation functional over a space of\r\nsequence-dependent curvature parameters. \r\n\r\nThe sequence-dependent curvature and flexibility of DNA is\r\ncritical for its packaging into the cell, recognition by other\r\nmolecules, and conformational changes during biochemically\r\nimportant processes.  However, few experimental methods are\r\navailable for probing these properties at the basepair level. \r\nThe objective of this project is to exploit the stiffness of DNA\r\nat short length scales and develop a method for estimating local,\r\nsequence-dependent curvature parameters from hydrodynamic data on\r\nshort fragments.  The method is based on the observation that\r\nsmall, relatively stiff fragments of different shape typically\r\ntravel at different speeds when forced through a viscous fluid or\r\nthrough a dilute gel.  The investigator seeks to develop a\r\nsufficiently refined mathematical relation between shape and\r\nspeed and further use this relation to develop a computational\r\nmethod to estimate shape parameters from measurements of speed. \r\nResults from this research lead to new tools for quantifying the\r\nintrinsic sequence-dependent curvature of DNA, which in turn may\r\nlead to an enhanced understanding of important genomic regions\r\nand of how DNA interacts with other molecules.",
