 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to its inherent multidisciplinary nature, and its reliance on\r\nmodern observational and experimental techniques, theory, and\r\ncomputation, the field of geophysical turbulence is difficult for\r\ngraduate students and postdoctoral researchers to master. Advancement\r\nin the field, by-and-large, requires a collaborative effort involving\r\nscientists with diverse backgrounds having an understanding of the\r\nmethodologies utilized and an appreciation of all the component parts.\r\nYoung researchers are thus often required to be proficient in\r\nobserving, applied mathematics, advanced scientific computing, and\r\ndata analysis. In recognition of this fact, the University of Colorado\r\nand the Institute for Mathematics Applied to the Geosciences at the\r\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research will host a three week summer\r\nschool on Geophysical Turbulent Phenomena.  The school will attract\r\n25-30 of the most competitive students in three important synergistic\r\nfocus areas associated with Geophysical Turbulent phenomena:\r\n\r\n(a) Observation and Experimentation;\r\n\r\n(b) Theoretical Methodology for and Modeling of Geophysical Phenomena;\r\n\r\n(c) Computation Methods, Scientific Computing and Visualization.\r\n\r\nThe students will come from a wide array of disciplines including\r\napplied mathematics, computational science, atmospheric and oceanic\r\nscience, and applied and fundamental physics.\r\n\r\nGeophysical turbulent phenomena are the foundation for a broad range\r\nof poorly understood processes that are critical to the climate\r\nsystem. Advances in these areas require collaborative research between\r\nmathematicians, computational scientists, and geoscientists. The\r\nproposed three-week summer school will devote one week to each of\r\nthree crucial areas of the field: 1) observations and experimentation,\r\n2) theoretical and modeling issues, and 3) computational methods,\r\nscientific computing and visualization. Students will attend lectures\r\nby principal lecturers and research lecturers in each of the three\r\nareas. In addition, significant time will be devoted to practical\r\nexercises in geophysical turbulence, were the students will work in\r\nsmall multidisciplinary collaborative groups. The skills and\r\nexperiences students gain in the school will have a direct and\r\nsignificant impact on their current and future research, enhancing\r\ntheir ability to achieve important results in their thesis research.\r\nThe school will be co-sponsored by the National Center for Atmospheric\r\nResearch, which will share half the costs.  By providing young\r\nscientists with a solid foundation in this fundamental area of\r\natmospheric, oceanic, and climate science, the school will serve to\r\ncontribute to future excellence in the field.  A diverse group of\r\nstudents and lecturers will be recruited, broadening diversity in the\r\nscientific community. Students will receive interdisciplinary\r\ntraining, and practice working in an interdisciplinary collaborative\r\nsetting. Students will be trained in important areas of active\r\nresearch. The cross-disciplinary relationships built in this school\r\nwill enhance the students' careers and improve their ability to become\r\nsuccessful researchers.\r\n",
