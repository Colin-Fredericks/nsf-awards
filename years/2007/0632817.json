Smaller, discovery-based sections have replaced large, lecture-format classes not only for majors in Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering but also for required classes in the general education program. Specifically, the purchase of 1) twelve laptop compatible lab stations with ultraviolet-visible or visible-near infrared spectrophotometers and 2) four FT-IR spectrometers is increasing the number and variety of inquiry-based and project-based laboratory experiences for students. Nineteen experiments are being adapted from modern, best-practice sources. Eleven new discovery-based experiments are under development, and twenty-one more traditional experiments are making use of the instruments. \r\n\r\nThe impact of this project: each year, eighteen classes taught by nine faculty serving 180 general education students and 300 science and engineering students utilize the equipment; in all, more than half of all Loras College students in a four year time span. The success of the project is being evaluated in three ways: 1) by the college-wide institutional Assessment Committee; 2) by a program review mechanism that employs both internal and external reviewers and 3) by direct assessment, coordinated by an external consultant.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
