 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is obtaining planar, selective area doped, highly conductive p-type gallium nitride (GaN) and aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) layers for developing efficient optical, high-power, and high-frequency devices. The proposed approach involves subjecting magnesium (Mg) and beryllium (Be) ion-implantation doped GaN and AlGaN epitaxial layers, protected by pulse laser deposited aluminum nitride or magnesium oxide capping layers, to ultra-fast high-temperature microwave annealing treatment.   \r\n                                           \r\nIntellectual Merit: This work has two main components: (1) solving the implanted acceptor (Mg and Be) activation problem in GaN and AlGaN using ultra-fast, high-temperature (=1300 C) microwave annealing, and (2) finding the defects responsible for poor acceptor dopant activation in GaN and AlGaN. A theoretical study of the role of defects in acceptor impurity activation behavior also will be performed based on first-principles calculations. Experimental results on as-grown and implanted acceptor doped layers and p-n junction diodes will be correlated with theoretical results to gain a better understanding of the various factors that limit implanted acceptor activation in GaN and AlGaN.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Successful results of this work may lead to a drastic improvement in  the performance of nitride based devices, whose market share is growing with time. The proposed work is a collaborative research involving George Mason University, Naval Research Laboratory, and National Institute of Standards and Technology. A female Ph.D. student, a high school science teacher, and undergraduate and high school students will be involved on the project. Results of this work will be included in a special topics graduate course. \r\n\r\n",
