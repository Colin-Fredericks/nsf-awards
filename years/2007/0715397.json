 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing the notion of Virtual Node Layers (VNLayers) as a foundation for implementing embedded applications in dynamic networks, such as mobile wireless networks. VN Layers are programming abstraction layers consisting of abstract machines called Virtual Nodes (VNs), plus Client Nodes, which are counterparts of physical computing nodes, plus a local communication service connecting Virtual and Client Nodes. VN Layers vary in their assumptions about timing and failures. A VN Layer may be emulated over a physical network, using replicated-state-machine, leader-based, or quorum-based strategies. Such a layer can provide a simple, well-behaved platform for programming dynamic network applications, a task which is currently difficult.\r\n\r\nVirtual Node Layers appear to be especially well suited for implementing control and coordination applications, including mobile robot coordination, intelligent highway management, and air-traffic management applications. Here, VNs can collect real-world information, exchange information with other VNs, plan activities for real-world entities, and disseminate the plans.  For example, a system of VNs programmed as traffic lights can be used to manage the activity of cars in a highway system.\r\n",
