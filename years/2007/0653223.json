 "awd_abstract_narration": "The weak force is responsible for the beginning of the solar cycle, the conversion of protons into neutrons that then allow the production of Helium. The weak force, contrary to the other forces of nature, is not the same when viewed with different systems of coordinates; this means that it does not conserve parity, giving us a unique signature for its manifestation. This research program will study the weak interactions among the components of the nucleus as it manifests itself in parity non conservation on atomic properties. The experiment involves the heaviest alkali atom: francium, to ensure a large number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, as well as the possibility to understand and manipulate the atomic properties of the atom. The strategy for measurement requires microwave spectroscopy of laser-cooled and trapped francium atoms on-line with TRIUMF accelerator. The results with a chain of isotopes will broaden our understanding of the weak interaction in the nucleus.\r\n\r\nThe research will be carried with the help of two graduate students in the boundary between Nuclear Physics and Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics. This is part of an international collaboration that will take place at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada. Undergraduates will participate in the research effort during the academic year, and in the summer. International collaborations include a program for undergraduate research in conjunction with the Sociedad Mexicana de Fisica.\r\n\r\n",
