  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntroduction\n\nIncreasing the quality of proposal submissions is a goal of any granting agency.  Improved grant submissions indicate an improvement in the scientific research conducted by those grants.  The purpose of this grant is to help imrpove future NSF grant submissions in the field of computer science education.\n\nThe SigCSE Symposium is an annual conference in the spring that is the most attended computer science education conference.  This grant is to organize and hold a showcase of NSF grant awardees at the SigCSE Symposium each year.  The showcase allows for conference attendees to learn about successful grant applications, as well as talk with both the grant awardees and NSF program officers about how to improve their ideas for a grant application.  There are five showcase sessions, with each session having four preseneters.\n\nProject Outcomes\n\nThis grant covered three showcases in full (2008, 2009, and 2010), as well as half of the 2007 showcase (the other half of the 2007 showcase was covered  by a different grant).\n\nThroughout the granting period, the quality of the showcase steadily improved, allowing for a better dissemination of NSF grant knowledge.  A number of aspects allowed for these highly successful showcases:\n\nstrategic positioning of the showcase booth, as well as an innovative booth design, allowed for increased traffic flow\nstrategic timing of the showcase sessions maximized the amount of traffic \na high quality program increased awareness of the showcase\ninclusion of the showcase preseters in the main conference program further increased awareness of the showcase\ninclusion of other NSF granting programs allowed for awareness of other NSF granting opportunities\n\n\nThe net result was four highly successful showcases, allowing for an improved set of grant applications.\n\n?Broader Impact\n\nThe SIGCSE Symposium is an international conference held annually in the United States, and it is one of the few dedicated solely to issues of undergraduate computing education. The conference attracts over 1000 educators from primarily the United States and Canada with a growing worldwide participation. The audience that the conference attracts is the same audience that these granting programs reach out toward. Thus, this showcase allows for the PIs to present their work to an appropriate group of individuals.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nWhile everybody can propose a funding idea to the NSF, creating a worthy proposal is a difficult task. The goal of the showcase is to improve upon the quality of proposals that are currently submitted. It achieves this by allowing showcase attendees to see the existing grants that have been funded, as well as speak to the NSF program officers about their individual funding ideas.  This will have the effect of increasing the quality of future proposals.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/24/2010\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron S Bloomfield"
