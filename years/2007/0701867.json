 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will consider the best possible role of randomized field trials in\r\nresearch projects in STEM education research projects. Two workshops and one\r\nSummative Convocation will direct the attention of scholars to addressing the benefits of\r\nrandomization for large- and small-scale STEM education research, impediments to\r\ncarrying out research designs that use randomization, and important ways in which\r\nrandomization could be adapted to real-world logistical constraints of schools as well as\r\nlocal needs. The project's intellectual merits arise from the intended value of the\r\nworkshops and Convocation for clarifying research designs that best yield actionable\r\nknowledge in STEM education. Broader impacts are foreseeable through clarifying\r\nresearch processes that are most compatible with the interests of school-age learners.\r\nThrough the two workshops and a Summative Convocation, the distinctions, issues, and\r\ndebates about randomization in STEM education can be clarified and disseminated to\r\nresearchers and to the professional staff of funding agencies.\r\n",
