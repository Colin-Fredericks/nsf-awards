 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this award is to plan and hold a two-day workshop\r\ninvolving representatives from academia, industry, and government to\r\ndiscuss the feasibility of developing a center-based partnership\r\nbetween industry and academia in the area of human language technology\r\n(HLT).  Although currently this research area does not have such a\r\ncenter, given the success story of Linguistics Data Consortium and the\r\nfact that there are many potential industrial partners, the time is\r\nripe to build a better understanding of how to create a center that is\r\nnot only mutually beneficial, but supports work that simply could not\r\nbe done by either partner alone.  Such collaboration would be\r\nimportant for stimulating research excellence at the university while\r\nenhancing the quality of the intellectual property of US HLT\r\ncompanies. The participants are meeting to develop a strategic plan\r\nfor building a mutually beneficial research center. Generally center\r\nvehicles at NSF require strong commitments from industry. This\r\nworkshop will focus on evaluating the feasibility of building\r\npartnerships for two of these programs: Industry/University\r\nCooperative Research Centers and Engineering Research Centers:\r\nPartnerships in Transforming Research, Education and Technology.  The\r\nintellectual merit of the proposed activity is specific to the\r\nplanning of the workshop. The broader impacts of such a center would\r\nbe to stimulate HLT research at the university, while enhancing the\r\nintellectual property of industrial affiliates.\r\n",
