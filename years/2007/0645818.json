 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports research by Professor Katrina Miranda at the University of Arizona to establish fundamental aspects of the chemistry of NO and its one electron reduction product, HNO, under biological conditions. The objectives are to elucidate the mechanisms of NO autoxidation and to establish the mechanisms of the fundamental reactivity of HNO, including autoxidation, dimerization and association with NO or thiols. Such studies will clarify the specific reactivity of NO and HNO in vivo and will contribute to identifying biological targets. \r\n\r\nThe educational activities described include training and mentoring research students at all levels, teaching a special topics course on bioinorganic chemistry and participating in an innovative multidisciplinary graduate program.  Outreach activities include directing an NSF-funded REU program at the University of Arizona, implementing a sabbatical program for chemistry faculty employed in the Arizona Community College system and mentoring perspective students from Arizona high schools and freshman enrolled in the UA College of Science. The research and educational activities are integrated through the research experience offered to students and to educators at primarily undergraduate institutions. Additionally, a group web site will be established to provide a supplementary avenue for dissemination of research concepts in the chemical biology of nitrogen oxides.\r\n",
