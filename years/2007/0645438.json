 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor LeGrande Slaughter at Oklahoma State University to investigate a unique type of self-assembly based on metallo-click reactivity of metal-bound isocyanides.  Novel synthetic methods are used to construct a diverse array of diaminocarbene ligands with varying electron-donating properties and chiral structures.  These ligands will be systematically modified to discover and optimize Lewis acidic late-metal catalysts for chiral [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements and Nazarov cyclizations, synthetically valuable reactions for which conventional ligands are not broadly effective.  New tools for the conversion of inexpensive, readily available precursors into medicinally important complex molecules are an anticipated outcome of this research.  A focus on catalyst discovery will link this research with an educational outreach program targeting rural high school students.  In partnership with an existing Upward Bound program, students from rural schools that have high percentages of American Indian students and students from families with no history of college education will be recruited for participation in two interrelated activities.  First, a series of experiments entitled Catalyzing Discovery will introduce students to the excitement of research through hands-on experimentation involving catalysis.  Second, Web-based Cyberspace Research Summits (CReS) will emphasize the broader impacts of basic research through interactive cyber-enabled videoconferences that bring students together with industrial and academic catalysis researchers.  The ultimate goal of this program is to increase attainment of research careers by rural students, positively impacting both their communities and the scientific workforce. \r\n",
