Artery buckling creates significant vascular problems. The educational objective is to integrate the proposed research into the education of undergraduate and graduate students, with a special emphasis on recruiting Hispanic students.  The project is a combination of experimental and theoretical work. In the long term, the project can have a significant impact on the study, treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases, with possible applications to other biological tubular systems (e.g. veins, ureters).\r\n",
