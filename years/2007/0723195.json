MANMOOTH, UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission at the University of Arkansas will make use of state-of-the-art regeneration drives to enable a highly flexible 6,000 kVA electric power test facility that provides unique capability to evaluate, in a realistic manner, new and emerging power electronic devices and circuits being envisioned to sustain reliable electric power supply through wide adoption of distributed energy systems, energy storage systems and fast electric utility protection devices. The test facility will be a national resource for small and large businesses, national laboratories, and other universities to test their prototypes at rated power in a flexible and programmable, but safe and secure environment. This will be a unique test facility for research involving our nation's power grid. The objectives of the research include the development of advanced power electronics systems for applications in the power grids of the future, the establishment a state-of-the-art test facility for advanced power electronic systems for distribution-level voltages (15 kV-class) and high currents (300 A), and providing much needed human resource for the electric power sector with understanding of emerging technologies and the future needs of the nation's power grid.\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research include: (a) a nationwide user facility for universities and industry for distribution-level testing and prototype evaluation enabling validation of research findings and thus accelerating the adoption of new solid-state equipment in the power grids, (b) training of students and practicing engineers who will be able to develop the next generation of power systems, (c) integrating research with education to establish new courses to take our students beyond being competitive to that of possessing unique skills and knowledge, and (d) innovative power electronics research (design, modeling, controls, and packaging) that ultimately helps to provide reliable electric power for all households in the United States.\r\n",
