 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stanford University continues operating a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with the Center on Polymer Interfaces and Macromolecular Assemblies (CPIMA), a multi-institutional Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) which includes, in addition to Stanford, UC-Davis, UC-Berkeley, and IBM-Almaden Research Center. Twelve students are recruited nationwide with a focus on undergraduates from two-year and four-year institutions, as well as members from underrepresented groups including students with disabilities. REU Students are involved in research in polymer science at all four partner institutions as well as at some of CPIMA's industrial affiliates and at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany. In addition, REU students participate in professional development and group social activities, and receive information on possible science and engineering career opportunities. This REU Site includes a Research Experience for Teachers (RET) component. Four teachers are recruited every year for an 8-week summer research experience and develop plans to incorporate their research experience in classrooms, which will be posted on a website for broader dissemination.  This REU/RET Site is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate.",
