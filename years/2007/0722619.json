 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - MRI: Acquisition of an Inductively Coupled Plasma Etch System\r\nThe objective of this research is the acquisition of a modern Inductively Coupled Plasma etching\r\ntool with submicron dimension control. Multiple research projects at the University of Cincinnati\r\nrequire a submicron etch capability, in areas ranging from photonic device and biosensor\r\nfabrication to etching for basic physics research. The approach is to combine the etch capability\r\nof the ICP etcher with the recently acquired and fully functioning Raith 150 e-beam lithography\r\ntool, to enable expanded research efforts in micro- and nanofluidics, sensors and devices.\r\nIntellectual Merit. This equipment acquisition will contribute to meeting the University of\r\nCincinnati's research and educational goals. Central goals of the University strategic plan are to\r\ngrow our research excellence by developing research and discovery, and to place Students at the\r\nCenter ?and thus enhance the university's ability to attract the highest-quality students. The\r\nrequested etch system will expand the research capabilities for a wide range of faculty and\r\nliterally scores of graduate students in their thesis and dissertation research, and would expose\r\nundergraduates and summer program students to state-of-the-art fabrication techniques.\r\nBroader Impact. Acquisition of the Inductively Coupled Plasma etcher will enhance\r\neducational opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students. It will have a direct and\r\nstrong impact on the development and training of our nation's future scientists and engineers in\r\nnanoscale science and engineering, a critical segment of the nation's workforce. Undergraduate\r\nstudents are exposed to the nanoscale science through a series of structured laboratory\r\nexperiments integrated with an existing NSF Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education\r\nprogram. Significant collaborative efforts currently exist between the University of Cincinnati,\r\nXavier University (an undergraduate institution), Miami University, and the University of\r\nDayton.",
