Readers share the experiences of a young girl struggling with the typical (and some not-so-typical) experiences common to the preteen years. Placed in the unusual situation of finding out that she is a merperson, for the first time in her life thirteen-year-old Molly is introduced to an aquatic environment. Through Molly's imaginary adventures, readers come to understand the delicate balance of life under the sea, the challenges sea creatures face as they struggle to survive in the ocean, the impacts of man on the environment, and the importance of scientific discovery to conservation and the responsible use of our planet's resources.\r\n\r\nValance press has committed to publishing this fourth book, which will include a study guide that will introduce Antarctica's wildlife, geography, natural resources, and climate to the reader.
