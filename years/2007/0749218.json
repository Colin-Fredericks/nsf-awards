 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for support of a conference. The activities proposed are designed to provide a sustained approach to nurturing interdisciplinary appreciation and expertise among young scientists interested in the problem of aggression and violence. The approach involves development of a series of events centered around the biennial conference of the International Society for Research on Aggression that accomplishes the following: 1) highlight important, integrative research on aggression through a featured plenary talk by a scientist working on the cutting edge of interdisciplinary research and through the involvement of that scientist in other activities throughout the conference; 2) identify promising young researchers (pre-doctoral and post-doctoral) in aggression, support their attendance at the conference, and involve them in activities designed to foster an interdisciplinary awareness and appreciation; and 3) establish a senior mentoring program and networking opportunities with an emphasis on interdisciplinary connections for interested young researchers. The institutional context for this program is the Biennial World Meeting of the International Society for Research on Aggression, the only interdisciplinary and international organization dedicated to the dissemination of information regarding the causes and consequences of, and solution to, aggressive behavior, in all of its forms and contexts.",
