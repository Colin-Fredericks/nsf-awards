 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-0723027  Cardoso     This proposal describes a multi-user advanced imaging facility at The City College of New York (CCNY). It comprises a microfocus X-Ray Computed Tomography (micro-CT) scanning system, a dedicated server for images acquisition and four workstations for reconstruction, treatment and analysis of 3-D data. The imaging facility will provide service to four of the five engineering departments in the Grove School of Engineering (GSOE) at CCNY, Biomedical Engineering (BME), Mechanical Engineering (ME), Chemical Engineering (ChE) and Electrical Engineering (EE) and research partners at major medical research institutions in New York City. The micro-CT scanner and acquisition system requested in this proposal will be housed within the Biomechanics Laboratory in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. This space is located within the Grove School of Engineering at CCNY, thus providing convenient access to all the users. \r\nHigh resolution micro-Computed Tomography is a recent technology that has revolutionized the nondestructive assessment of materials and tissues. It provides a unique means for visualization of complex structures composed by substances with different densities. In particular, it permits the analysis of high-density tissues (bone, calcified arteries, neoplasias, etc) and structures filled with high-density contrast agents. It also produces detailed 3-D images of soft tissue, lipid, and air within blood vessels due to its remarkable high sensitivity. Several disadvantages associated with classical histological processing of tissue, such as infiltration, dehydration and serial sectioning is avoided with micro-CT. Virtual nondestructive histology is rapidly obtained as a stack of consecutive images (cross sections) with each image a few microns in thickness. Moreover, the analysis of several histomorphometric features is automatic, reducing measurement errors, and permitting construction of complex numerical models. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
