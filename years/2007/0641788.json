 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wood decay is essential for carbon recycling and maintaining a healthy forest. However, it is a complex, poorly understood and economically costly phenomenon caused not by one microorganism but by a community of microorganisms.  The identity of the community of organisms that colonize and decay resistant and non-resistant wood species over time in a soil ecosystem has not been revealed.  The predominant microorganisms responsible for wood decay are fungi called basidiomycetes. These fungi degrade wood by secreting a suite of enzymes that breakdown the principle components of wood: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.  To better understand the dynamics of the microbial activities that lead to wood decay, this research seeks to identify the bacteria, actinomycetes and wood decay fungi and their enzymes that are responsible for the initial decay of different wood species in a high decay soil ecosystem over time.  Microbial identification will be determined by cloning and DNA sequences of the 16s and ITS fragments and monitored over time by terminal restriction fragment polymorphisms (T-RFLP). Gene expression profiles will be determined by quantitative PCR. At the conclusion of this study it is anticipated that a better characterization of the microbial community and the  enzymes involved in wood decay will be obtained which will lay the foundation for revealing the true picture of the complex microbial interactions that are responsible for wood decay.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nAn educational outreach component will be conducted in conjunction with the scientific work of this research.  African-American undergraduate and high school students will be recruited to participate in this research and given an opportunity for \"hands on\" experience in conducting this two year project. It is anticipated that these students will gain a better appreciation and understanding of how molecular tools can be used to answer biological questions, develop their professional presentation skills, and serve as role models to others potential students.",
