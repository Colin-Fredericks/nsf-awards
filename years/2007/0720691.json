 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project reexamines systems problems in interactive client/server computing through the concept of having systems software optimize directly for the expressed satisfaction of the individual user. Satisfaction with a particular configuration or choice of parameters at the system software level varies dramatically from user to user. The project tests the hypothesis that a thin, nonintrusive user interface, in some cases combined with learning algorithms, can convey the individual user's satisfaction level, or other guidance, directly to the systems software with sufficient detail to allow the systems software to effectively customize its decisions to that individual user. To gather evidence about the hypothesis, the project is applying the concept to several systems problems that arise in contexts such as thin clients, desktop replacement systems, and modern web applications. These include: dynamic voltage and frequency scaling algorithms in power management; speculation in remote display systems; thread, process, and VM scheduling; and thread assignment/migration in multicore processors. The work in these areas is unified through: (1) the design, implementation, and evaluation (through user studies) of effective user interfaces to systems software, (2) seeking to determine an appropriate mix of explicit and implicit user feedback, and (3) determining the role of learning to minimize the amount of explicit feedback. If the hypothesis holds, it will illustrate a new way to build systems that are more satisfying for individual users.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe core focus of this project was on how to incorporate user satisfaction feedback into systems, architectural, and network-level decision making for client/server systems.  Our premise was is that such feedback can lead to improved satisfaction and lower resource costs by tailoring system performance characteristics that are visible to the user to the specific user.  \n\nWhy should users care about such low-level decision making?   These decisions affect the user experience because they change the performance delivered to the user.   Also, they affect the resource consumption of the user, which can manifest itself to the user through, for example, battery lifetime on mobile devices, or prices for cloud computing or networking.  \n\nFor the most part, low-level decision making has traditionally been done without any feedback from the user, on the assumption that a one-size-fits-all model of the user is sufficient.   What led us to our project, and what we demonstrated consistently via user studies throughout the project was that this view does not hold up well.  For the systems we studied, for any non-extreme operating point, the satisfaction with that operating point varies considerably across users.  For example, for one user, a low CPU frequency on a laptop computer (and concomitant long battery lifetime) may be entirely satisfactory, while for the next, completely unacceptable.  Picking a single operating point based on a canonical user irritates some users with low performance and uses more resources than needed for others.  What is needed is a way to tailor the decisions to the individual user, dynamically, and continuously.\n\nThere were two main threads of effort in the project.  One thread was about garnering information about the user with minimal or no cognitive load.  Here we designed, implemented, and evaluated a wide range of techniques to measure satisfaction, from simple push-button feedback, to using machine learning to correlate user satisfaction and machine measurements,  to biometric approaches.  We also considered the user\u00c6s environment and location, inventing several techniques based on sound.  We evaluated our techniques using careful user studies, both under completely controlled situations in the lab, and by releasing software to let the public participate.  \n\nThe second main thread of effort in the project was on developing techniques in which systems-level decision-making can incorporate user satisfaction feedback , and the evaluation of these techniques.  We considered scheduling and assignment on servers, power management on clients, and scheduling of flows on network links.
