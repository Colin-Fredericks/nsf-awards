 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent invention of microstructured optical fibers has brought fiber optics into a new era.  Flexible fiber designs using air holes have enabled many exciting applications unattainable with normal fibers. \r\nIn this CAREER research project, the PI proposes to fully exploit microstructured fiber design flexibility and to develop fiber sensors with unprecedented functionalities and performance. By controlling shapes, geometry, and compositions of the fiber core, air holes, and filling materials in microstructured fibers, major enhancement in sensitivity, frequency response, and power consumption for both active and passive fiber sensors can be achieved. Multi-functional sensors and enabling technology developed from this project is expected to dramatically expand the applications of fiber sensors beyond their traditional roles.\r\nThe PI recognizes the far-reaching potential of photonic devices in modern technology and proposes an interdisciplinary training plan for all engineering students. It includes a general optical engineering course and industrial motivated senior design projects on photonic product innovation and manufacturing automation. Through undergraduate extracurricular activities in robotics, the proposed outreach activities aim to attract more female and under-represented minority students to study engineering in colleges. Overall, this program will foster interdisciplinary-trained engineers, who will understand and use photonics as part of life-long career of engineering innovation. \r\n\r\nThis is a FY07 CAREER grant of DMMI/ENG.\r\n",
