 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lamar University, Beaumont proposes the INcreasing Student Participation In REsearch Development Program (INSPIRED) to engage and develop female and minority computer scientists. The program includes an enriched undergraduate research experience that includes mentoring, tutoring, and other support, and activities that are designed to dispel some of the misconceptions that make computer science unpopular for women and minorities.  INSPIRED students are paid to perform research and participate in mentoring and outreach functions for an average of fifteen hours per week.  The students can earn research credit hours for their work. They work in teams under the direction of Computer Science faculty members who serve as mentors and role models.  The teams include students from all levels, freshmen through seniors.  Graduate students help lead the research teams.  The higher-level students help to train and mentor the lower-level students and inspire them to reach the next level.  INSPIRED students get experience not only in research but also in teamwork, leadership, writing papers and making professional presentations, all of which contribute towards their professional development.  Career Counseling and Graduate Study Seminars help bridge graduating INSPIRED students to professions or advanced study in computing.  Participation in Computer Science conferences, CS Research Seminars and CS Careers Forums exposes students to the richness, breadth, and many beneficial applications of Computer Science and dispels the misconception that CS is by nature a narrow, non-inclusive endeavor.    \r\nINSPIRED also has outreach components for middle and high school students and entering freshmen. These activities include one and five day summer camps and visiting road shows.  INSPIRED students play an active role in the summer camps and road shows, thus inspiring others to engage in Computer Science.  INSPIRED students also gain teaching experience in conducting workshops during the Week of Welcome.  The focus of these workshops is exposing entering first time freshmen to the diverse field of computer science.  INSPIRED students have the opportunity to share their research experiences and accomplishments, while encouraging other female and minority students to explore computer science as a field of study.  \r\n",
