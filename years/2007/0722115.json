 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging infectious diseases present a broad challenge to humans, other animals and plants, in both human-dominated and natural communities. Anticipating effects of emerging diseases will require synthesis of ecological, epidemiological, genetic, and evolutionary data, and solutions must address issues such as pandemics, species jumps, drug resistance, and roles of immunity and vaccination. The leading edge of infectious disease research will move with development of mathematical models and the enormous capacity of genome projects to gather data. This demands a step change in training the next generation of scientists, by integrating quantitative analysis from ecology and evolution with more traditional analyses in epidemiology and biomedicine. This project will fund workshops to train the next generation of infectious disease researchers in quantitative analyses, to form interdisciplinary teams to synthesize the growing mountain of data, and to link research in ecology, evolution, genomics, epidemiology, microbiology/parasitology, and immunology. The project will use a flexible curriculum integrating state-of-the-art modeling approaches with analysis of data sets provided by workshop participants.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include bringing together students and instructors with diverse backgrounds, and training students from underrepresented groups by targeted recruiting. Collaborative projects arising from the training will lead to advances in public health and epidemiology, including understanding of pathogen emergence in the face of changing human populations, drug therapies, vaccination strategies, and global change. \r\n",

California Santa Barbara and Univ. Michigan (with thanks to local organizers):\n\n 2008    Colorado  State University  (Mike Antolin)\n\n2009    University  of Georgia  (Sonia Altizer, Pej Rojani)\n\n2010    Cornell  University  (Drew Harvell, Colin Parrish)\n\n2011    University  of California, Santa Barbara  (Cherie Briggs, Kevin Lafferty)\n\n2012    University  of Michigan  (Aaron King, Pej Rojani)\n\nA major objective of the workshops was to provide cutting-edge analytical techniques for the analysis of ecological and genetic data related to infectious diseases.  Equally as important was the emphasis on original analyses of data set provided by workshop participants.  As we will see, a number of those have resulted in peer-reviewed publications.  But even more, the goal of providing a framework for \"vertical\" integration of our field was overwhelmingly successful.  A post-workshop survey sent to all participants shows how important these workshops were in forging lasting relationships that participants view as beneficial to their development as scientists.\n\nThe full schedules and workshop materials are available online on a web page maintained by Ben Bolker (currently McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada). \n\n http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/eeid/\n\n \n\nThe analyses developed for and during workshop focused on the program R, and the web page contains not only lecture notes, but R-scripts that provide further examples and templates for additional analyses by participants.  The web page also includes an R Tutorial (primarily written by Stu Field, with contributions by others) that provides a basic education in using R.  We have used this as the warm-up for students on the first day of the workshop, but have found that its necessity has been reduced over the years because of the greater facility of using R by the entire ecology and evolution of infectious diseases community.\n\n Demographic Summary of Workshop Participants\n\n A table summarizing the workshop participants appears below. Some highlights:\n\n 1.)  Overall, 299 participants attended workshops, a total of 254 persons when those who attended more than once are accounted for.  Generally attendance in the Ecology workshops was greater than in the Evolution ones.\n\n2.)  Participants came from 31 states and Puerto Rico, and from seven countries besides the U.S. (Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, United Kingdom). \n\n3.)   We provided financial aid to 215 participants (course fee plus $500 for travel), and financial aid was provided only to graduate students and post-docs.  We had originally budgeted to support 200 (40 per year), but were able to extend funding to an additional 15 because of income generated from course fees paid by 46 participants who paid their own way.\n\n4.)  In terms of diversity, the population was 55% female, and 16.6 % diverse (African American, Hispanic, Asian).
