 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project focuses on the feasibility testing of an innovative use of wireless mobile ad hoc networking (MANET) technology for automating many of the most burdensome aspects of applied behavior analysis (ABA). Discount usability engineering will be brought to bear on improving the implementation of ABA programs in the classroom and home setting. The technology also enables a remotely-located behavior analyst to monitor individual data and modify the treatment plan on-line, providing further labor savings and better tracking of treatment effectiveness. This research program will improve the usability of the technology through a series of iterative laboratory-based experiments. The resulting technology will then be compared to traditional methods of implementing intensive ABA in special education classrooms. \r\n\r\nAutism spectrum disorders (ASD), a collection of development disorders that limit the affected child's future ability to live independently, is a common and impairing developmental disorder. Outcomes for individuals with ASD can be greatly improved with intensive behavior therapies that are, unfortunately, difficult to implement in real-world settings. The proposed research is for the testing of an innovative use of wireless technology for improving implementation of intensive behavioral therapies for children with ASD. Completion of this research will increase educational opportunities for children with ASD, reduce labor costs associated with intensive behavioral therapies, translate wireless networking technologies to special education, and bring usability engineering to bear on the implementation of behavioral therapies in applied settings.\r\n\r\n",
