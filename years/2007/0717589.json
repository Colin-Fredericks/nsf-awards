 "awd_abstract_narration": "What do students understand about geological processes? Does instruction impact student conceptions, and if so, how? Many students can recite common terminology and speak authoritatively about such important concepts as plate tectonics, but emerging research suggests that very few students truly understand underlying concepts. Within this project, we are revising and expanding the Geoscience Concept Inventory (GCI), a comprehensive multiple-choice test that assesses underlying foundations of the most important concepts in Earth Science. Both the questions and the answers on this inventory are subject to extensive research and statistical analysis to determine which non-scientific ideas are most prevalent in entry-level college students, if questions are worded appropriately, and if there are any unexpected biases.  Ultimately, questions and incorrect responses included in the Geoscience Concept Inventory will not be invented by scientists but will be based on commonly held student misconceptions.  Faculty nationwide will be able to access and customize the inventory through a webcenter, and compare their courses against students across the nation. Geologists interested in contributing to GCI development also have the opportunity to participate in workshops exploring question development strategies. Our efforts to involve the geoscience community in GCI expansion are serving as a model for other STEM disciplines and researchers.",
