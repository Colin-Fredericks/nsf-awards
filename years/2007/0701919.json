Evolution of new enzyme functions, together with the co-evolution of additional biochemical and cell biological traits, has provided hundreds of potentially useful chemicals in seed oils, including the hydroxylated, conjugated and cyclopropane fatty acids to be studied in this project.   Providing a detailed description of genes and proteins required for optimal pathway function will require the integrated deployment of four strategies:  a) Investigate and optimize the activities of enzymes for unusual fatty acid synthesis using bioinformatics and protein engineering.  b)  Carry out extensive sequencing of seeds sampled through the period of oil synthesis, and use functional genomic screens to identify co-evolved enzymes (and other protein functions) required for incorporation of the novel fatty acid into the oil.  c)  Perform biochemical analysis of the identified proteins and quantify their contributions to the accumulation of unusual fatty acids through expression in transgenic plants. d)  Analyze protein-protein interactions in membranes to gain insight how these pathways are physically organized.  Finally, the accumulated knowledge will be tested through experiments to reconstruct the native pathways in transgenic plants using expression of multiple genes and pathway engineering. The discoveries that result from this project will yield an understanding of the underlying principles of how pathways evolved for the synthesis of novel seed oils.  Information and results will be available from the project website: www.genomics.msu.edu/Oilseeds  \r\n\r\nThe basic knowledge from this project will enable the design of a new generation of specialty crops that will become the green factories of the future, providing for the production of industrial lubicants, solvent oils and biodiesel.  The project will help to educate young students and the general public through collaboration with the St Louis Science Center. Hands-on experiments will be developed in a new K-12 Learning Lab, and in the main gallery, exhibits on \"Plants as Green Factories\" will be developed.  Through the project's REU program, that will continue to make special efforts to include underrepresented groups, undergraduate students will participate in multi-disciplinary research projects that bring plant genomics together with biochemistry to solve complex but exciting challenges.\r\n",

Project Outcomes Report\n\nA grand challenge in biology is to understand how plants operate as chemical factories, and to use the knowledge gained to provide solutions to critical societal needs. Declining fossil carbon reserves and the high capital cost of conventional chemical plant present an imperative to develop plant-based feedstocks for industrial processes. To harvest these natural resources by biotechnology, it is essential to understand the genetic and biochemical mechanisms underlying this diversity in oilseeds, including the enzymes that facilitate synthesis, targeting and packaging of products in seeds.  To provide the expertise required, this project brought together plant lipid scientists with strong complementary research capabilities, and documented success in functional genomics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, enzyme engineering and pathway engineering.\n\nResearch from this grant has resulted in discovery of five new enzymes and processes that contribute to the synthesis of industrially valuable chemicals in oilseed plants.  We have also identified and partially mitigated biochemical barriers to the production of specialty lipids by expressing appropriate combinations of genes specifically in the oil producing seeds of plants.  The research has formed the basis for training 15 graduate and undergraduate students and 13 postdoctoral scientists.  Discoveries made during the research resulted in filing of five patents as well as publications of more than 40 scientific articles and book chapters.\n\nThe project has also contributed to broader understanding of the role of plant genomics in society. We have helped to educate young students and the general public through collaboration with the St Louis Science Center. Hands-on experiments were developed in a new K-12 Learning Lab, and in the main gallery, exhibits on \"Plants as Green Factories\" were developed and visited by more than 100,000 people.\n\nPlant oils are increasingly used in renewable industrial applications including biomaterials.
