 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will investigate feasibility of producing hermetic hollow gas encapsulating spheres (Plasma-spheres) with shells fabricated from phosphor compositions processed with modified processing methods. One application of Plasma-spheres is pixel elements used in displays. Plasma-spheres are placed on flexible electrically addressable arrays. When a voltage is applied across the Plasma-sphere the encapsulated gas ionizes and glows. UV radiation produced by the glowing gas will excite the phosphor shell form the inside. The phosphor shell will convert UV to visible light. The successful completion of this SBIR will result in advancing the company's current monochrome display technology to full color. The current Plasmasphere shell is dielectric and an encapsulant. The proposed Plasma-sphere shell will be a dielectric, an encapsulant and a lumiphor.\r\n\r\nPlasma-sphere arrays are produced with a unique low cost process. This process will eventually allow carpet size displays to be produced at a fraction of the cost of rigid glass displays. The roll-to-roll production method allows flexible manufacturing and responsiveness to changing consumer demands. A single wide-web can be cut to a variety of sizes and aspect ratios. The entire Plasma-sphere array production process is environmentally benign. It uses a minimum of materials, and eliminates harmful materials including lead, which is commonly used in the manufacture of electronics. Other advantages include longer life, smaller form factor, and a greater percentage of biodegradable materials. \r\n",
