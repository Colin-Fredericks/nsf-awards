 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is the advancement of microdevice technology for applications in the chemical, biological, electronic and optical sciences, and the fundamental and technological investigation of new nanomaterials. The approach is to acquire an inductively coupled plasma etcher that will be used, in concert with other existing shared equipment, to create the specialized micro- and nanostructures that are integral to this research.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The Montana Microfabrication Facility (MMF) provides an excellent environment for research and training involving the fabrication and testing of microdevices and nanostructures. The requested equipment will facilitate productive, cross-disciplinary research in the areas of MEMS, MOEMS and micro-optics, integrated optics, microsensors, THz waveguide devices, neuro-electrical recording devices, magnetic thin film materials and nanowire research.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Access for regional researchers to the new equipment will be assured through its incorporation into the MMF. Because it is a user facility where the operational model is for students and scientists to do their own work, the MMF plays an important role in education and training. Undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral scientists receive in-depth research training and experience with modern fabrication equipment. Undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in microfabrication and MEMS receive hands-on instruction on the same tools. Students and faculty in MSU's summer research experiences program, including students and faculty from Montana's tribal colleges, also have the opportunity to receive training on this new ICP etching tool. Additionally, the MMF is committed to supporting industrial users from our geographic region.\r\n\r\n",
