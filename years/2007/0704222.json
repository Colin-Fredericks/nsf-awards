 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nPolymer surfaces and interfaces control the properties that define function in the emerging areas\r\nof biotechnology and nanotechnology. Although the general topic of polymer surfaces and\r\ninterfaces has a long and rich history, the evolution of new polymer chemistries, fabrication\r\napproaches, characterization methods, and targeted applications provides unquestionable\r\nmotivation for an inter-disciplinary symposium to foster discussions and cross-breeding of ideas\r\nand understanding to push this critical field forward. Accordingly, I and three co-organizers\r\n[Professor Jeff Youngblood (Purdue University), Professor Rigoberto Advincula (University of\r\nHouston), and Dr. Ying Chang (Academia Sinica Taiwan)] are leading the organization of a\r\nfocused symposium entitled: Polymer Surfaces and Interfaces at the upcoming national meeting\r\nof the American Chemical Society in Chicago during March 2007.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis symposium will consist of six focused topic sessions that will not only demonstrate the\r\ncommon foundation of polymer surfaces and interfaces across a wide range of applications and\r\napproaches, but most importantly the program will encourage the development of collaborations\r\nand cross-breeding of ideas. The focused topic sessions include: 1.) Polymer Brushes, 2.)\r\nMacromolecular Assemblies, 3.) Responsive Surfaces, Interfaces, and Films, 4.) Biopolymer /\r\nBioactive Surfaces, 5.) Chemistry at Surfaces and Interfaces, 6.) Adhesion and Interfacial\r\nPhysics. These six topics represent the current state-of-the-art research in the field of polymer\r\nsurfaces and interfaces. The range of chemistries, processes, characterization methods, and\r\napplications within each of these focused sessions will provide a unique program to encourage\r\ncollaboration and education among established and young researchers. The foundation for this\r\nprogram has been set with an extensive and diverse list of invited speakers that represent the\r\nleaders in research in the topics covered by the six focused topic sessions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe broader impact of this symposium will emerge from the diversity of the co-organizing\r\ncommittee, the diversity of the invited speakers, and the diversity of the general participants at\r\nthe national meeting of the American Chemical Society. This symposium will encourage the\r\nexposure of young researchers in the field of polymer surfaces and interfaces by inviting several\r\nspeakers that are either young professors or post-doctoral researchers, while also providing a\r\nposter session for the general participation of graduate student researchers. Furthermore, the\r\nparticipation of women and under-represented minorities will be encouraged through direct\r\ninvitations and widely-distributed advertisements. This organization will not only provide\r\nopportunities for research scientists from all backgrounds to discuss current challenges and\r\napproaches in polymer surface and interface research, but it will provide an opportunity for\r\nyoung researchers to be educated and prepared for their future careers.\r\n\r\n",
