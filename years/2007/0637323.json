 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation & Research (SBIR) Phase I project offers a novel approach for producing a hard, uniform coating on the surface of lightweight aluminum.  The technique uses a modified \"micro-arc\" approach for applying protective ceramic coatings that are much more uniform, denser and harder than conventional micro-arc approaches.  This will increase the mechanical reliability, dimensional predictability, and wear-resistance of aluminum.  The surface-treated aluminum can be used as a replacement for heavier steel in various applications. In a broader scope, novel methods are needed to produce adherent, wear-resistant oxide coatings on the surface of the aluminum alloys and other types of metals. The coating will find use in a wide variety of commercial applications involving the aerospace, defense, automotive, marine, medical, electronic, chemical, hydraulic/pneumatic, and textile industries. This novel surface modification approach will create a durable uniform coating that will exhibit high hardness, wear resistance, corrosion resistance and electrical resistance.",
