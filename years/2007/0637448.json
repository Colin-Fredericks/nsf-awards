 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the technical and commercial feasibility of an innovative multimedia streaming P2P platform called HYPP. HYPP is Hybrid P2P platform designed to support real time, high quality videos and audios delivery for \"one-to-many\" and \"many-to-many\" applications over the Internet.  By integrating advanced techniques in network coding, source coding, and channel coding, HYPP will be able to deliver data on time and reliably and cost-effectively for Digital Subscriber Loop (DSL) customers.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, there has been a surge in the number of media streaming applications over the Internet. Video conferencing, video broadcasting, remote presentations, distance learning, and video on demand are the prime examples of such applications. Among many technological challenges, the enabling technology for a large scale proliferation of these applications is the ability to deliver data efficiently from one source to many destinations on the Internet. Current architectures to support one-to-many applications are constrained by the transmission bandwidth of a single source, and thus these approaches are not scalable. \r\n",
