The information flow guarantees of security-typed\r\nlanguages provide a practical avenue to achieving system security by\r\nproducing proofs of an implementation's compliance with a specified\r\npolicy.  However, these languages are simply tools for restricting\r\ninformation flow through source-code annotations: they provide no\r\ntheory or practice to indicate how such annotations can be used to\r\nimplement security in real systems.  This work bridges the theoretical\r\nand practical gap between systems security and security-typed\r\nlanguages.  In this, the following three central research thrusts are\r\nunder investigation: a) the mapping of high-level policies to secure\r\nimplementations through models and algorithms that enable the\r\ngeneration of semantically equivalent policies and the automated\r\ninstrumentation of code to enforce them, b) the study of services and\r\nlanguages that govern application and infrastructure information flow,\r\nand c) the exploration of tools to instrument legacy systems with\r\ninformation flow policy.  Demonstrative stand-alone, distributed, and\r\nmulti-user applications and systems are being be developed and\r\nevaluated with respect to a broad range of security goals.  The\r\nevaluation efforts include pursing formal proofs of correctness and\r\nempirical analysis of performance and security tradeoffs.\r\n",
