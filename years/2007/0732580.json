The proposed symposium will bring together the senior scientists who led the developments of the last decades, and talented junior scientists who represent the future of the field. The senior scientists will present authoritative evaluates and the latest developments. The junior scientists will participate in extensive discussion periods and will present their own research in a set of subject-specific poster sessions. \r\n\r\nTopics to be covered include developments in nonlinear physics and statistical mechanics of complex systems, scaling dynamics of high-Reynolds number turbulence, multiscale approaches in fluid mechanics, wall-bounded turbulence, and high Rayleigh number convection and cryogenic turbulence. The proposed symposium is entitled FLUID SCIENCE AND TURBULENCE, and will be held on the Homewood campus of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore at the end of May 2008. \r\n\r\nA special issue is planned in the peer-evaluateded journal Physica D. Participants of the symposium will be invited to submit papers to the special issue. The symposium banquet at the end of the first day will include presentations honoring Prof. K.R. Sreenivasan, a most influential figure in nonlinear physics, fluid mechanics and turbulence. \r\n\r\n",
