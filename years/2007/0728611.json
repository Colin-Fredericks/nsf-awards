 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures and programs. Students from underrepresented groups are being especially targeted for support. The region served by this project is rural and most students are first-generation. Students are targeted for participation in two departments: mechanical engineering and mathematics. The students participate in student-student, faculty-student, and industry-student mentoring opportunities and are being encouraged to participate in guided undergraduate research projects. The project is well-integrated with a STEP program on campus. The project is built around the natural cohort relationship that occurs among engineering and mathematics students in their twenty-four credit hours of required mathematics instruction. Students are being supported by project personnel who have expertise in five areas: mentoring, academic counseling, career counseling, research/internships, and professional interactions.",
