 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) proposes two linked conferences that will build more effective connections between research and practice.  Specifically, the conferences will bring together researchers, practitioners and policymakers around improving students' mathematics proficiency by ensuring that researchers are investigating the most urgent problems of practice and that practitioners are connected to the research in ways that makes the knowledge useful to instruction. \r\n\r\nThe project supports the following activities:\r\n\r\n*Pre-conference preparation that includes all 40 participants organizing focus groups with practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to identify priority research issues;\r\n*Implementation of a five-day working conference that outlines a list of preliminary research questions and conducts a preliminary survey of current knowledge;\r\n*Follow-up focus group meetings;\r\n*A two and a half day second working conference that incorporates the information gathered from the second focus group meetings; and\r\n*Publication and promotion of the research agenda by NCTM.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
