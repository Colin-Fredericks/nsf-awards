 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. ATLAS Operations Program aims to provide U.S. university scientists with access to the unique\r\nLHC science opportunities through a balanced program that encompasses: (1) the technical effort\r\nassociated with maintenance and operation of the U.S.-built detector subsystems, essential in achieving a\r\ndetailed understanding of the detector for physics results; (2) the maintenance and refinement of software,\r\ncomputing and physics analysis support, critical in allowing scientists at U.S. universities to fully exploit\r\nthe physics potential of the LHC, in part through the establishment of university-based Tier 2 computing\r\ncenters in the U.S. and the expansion of the existing worldwide grid of resources; (3) an R&D program\r\nfor detector upgrades, to maximize the physics output during the long period of running expected for the\r\nLHC and maintain U.S. intellectual leadership in accelerator-based particle physics; and (4) a strong\r\neducation and outreach program. The ATLAS collaboration, consisting of 151 institutes from 34\r\ncountries, is completing construction of the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at\r\nCERN, and preparing for initial data taking in 2007. The 34 institutions of U.S. ATLAS, with the support\r\nof NSF, have made major and unique contributions to the construction of the ATLAS detector, and\r\ncontinue to provide critical support for the ATLAS computing and software program, and pre-operations\r\ntasks as the detector is commissioned at CERN.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The goal of the U.S. ATLAS Operations Program is to empower U.S. physicists to\r\naddress some of the most profound questions in particle physics today: what is the physical origin of\r\nmass? Do supersymmetric particles exist and will they shed light on the nature of dark matter? Does\r\nspace-time have extra spatial dimensions? Answers to these questions would provide a major advance\r\ntoward completing a unified view of the particles in nature, the forces with which particles interact, and\r\ntheir role in the past and future of our universe. This is a time when particle physics researchers have\r\nunusually compelling indications that the step to be taken by the LHC, leading to collision energies far\r\nbeyond those available at existing facilities, will lead to especially important discoveries with\r\nimplications over a broad field of fundamental science. This program rests on the especially strong\r\nscientific case for investigating the energy regime that will be accessed by the LHC, and benefits from a\r\nprogram in which the international community is providing a major part of the investment. The bold\r\ninitiative of the NSF, in partnership with the DOE, to carry out a very significant portion of the\r\nconstruction and operations of the ATLAS detector has opened up this opportunity for U.S. scientists.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This proposal will enhance the computing infrastructure for research, education and\r\nbeyond. The LHC computing requirements are driving a paradigm shift towards global computing with\r\npotentially significant economic impacts, and our students will be at the forefront in using these new\r\ntechnologies. NSF-ATLAS groups continue to expand their education and outreach programs, with a\r\nparticular focus on high school teachers and students (closely coordinated with QuarkNet), and on\r\noutreach to under-represented populations. We plan on strengthening and expanding our outreach efforts\r\nin the run-up to ATLAS data taking, including plans to help establish a computing center in Africa as part\r\nof our expanding network of worldwide grid facilities. This site will provide a platform on which to\r\nlaunch a program of Grid-based outreach in Africa. Starting in a few years the LHC will be the major\r\naccelerator-based program in which to train the next generation of physicists. Support for R&D activities\r\nwill lay the groundwork for new technologies that might be adopted by other fields.\r\n",
