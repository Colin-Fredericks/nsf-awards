 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-0707969  Winter     The applicant is creating intracellular nanoprobes for the physical manipulation\r\nof cells using magnetic nanoparticles (i.e., supraparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles\r\n(SPIONs)). SPIONs are excellent candidate materials for mechanical cellular nanoprobes\r\nbecause they can serve as physical actuators, producing a controlled, investigator-triggered\r\nforce in response to a magnetic field. Previously, SPIONs encapsulated in magnetic\r\nmicrospheres have been used to examine the response of cells to extracellular force. These\r\nstudies demonstrated that the cytoskeleton, a biopolymer network responsible for the mechanical\r\nintegrity of cells, is part of an elaborate mechanotransduction system that can influence many\r\ncell functions. However, these studies use large particles, nearly half the size of a cell, which\r\nindirectly interface with the cytoskeleton through extracellular cell surface receptors. Although\r\nsome attempts have been made to use smaller SPIONs inside a cell, these methods rely on\r\nparticle endocytosis for delivery. Particles remain trapped in endosomes, unable to interact with\r\ncytoplasmic structures. Thus, the potential to manipulate the cytoskeleton directly remains\r\nlargely untapped.\r\nIn this proposal the investigator will employ SPIONs as physical intracellular nanoprobes for direct, targeted manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton. As a model system, the role\r\nof targeted versus untargeted cytoskeletal manipulation in fibroblast cell migration will be explored. Cell migration is a critical factor in embryonic development, nerve regeneration, tumor metastasis and wound healing repair. The ability to control cell migration using nanoparticles could have substantial implications for developmental biology and provide new therapeutic avenues for chronic or catastrophic wound care.\r\n",
