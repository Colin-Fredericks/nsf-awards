One such instability is buckling. \r\nBuckling is ubiquitous and very important in engineering and\r\nmechanics.  Modern engineering models of buckling, though very\r\nsuccessful, are not related to 3D hyperelasticity, which is\r\nsupposed to contain a description of all elastic phenomena,\r\nincluding buckling.  The project initiates a systematic study of\r\nall elastic instabilities, putting buckling in its proper setting\r\nwithin a general theory.  Another interesting and important\r\ninstability studied by the project is nucleation of a new phase\r\nin martensitic phase transitions.  This study is also related to\r\nrate-independent hysteresis -- an unexpected phenomenon of\r\nhistory dependence, that does not yet have a universally\r\nagreed-upon explanation.  The energy-based model of martensitic\r\nphase transformations was very successful at predicting many\r\naspects of behavior of shape memory alloys.  Hysteresis, however,\r\ncould be explained by this model only if one assumes that the\r\nmaterial \"gets stuck\" in metastable states, modeled as local\r\nenergy minima.  The project provides a hitherto missing general\r\ntool for identifying metastable states, allowing one to construct\r\nand analyze continuum mechanical models with hysteresis\r\nquantitatively on the basis of the energy-minimization principle.\r\n\r\n     This project aims to advance our understanding of\r\nnonlinearly elastic materials, such as polymers and rubbers and\r\nmaterials with shape memory effect.  When loads are applied to\r\nthese materials, they deform in such a way as to minimize the\r\ntotal energy stored in the deformed system.  When the loads\r\nincrease, the nonlinear nature of these materials often manifests\r\nitself in the appearance of new ways to decrease the energy. \r\nWhen this happens, physicists talk of instabilities.  One of the\r\nmost common instabilities is buckling, which occurs when the load\r\non a slender column exceeds a certain critical value.  Recent\r\nwork of the investigator with Lev Truskinovsky produced a new\r\nunderstanding of buckling that is used in this project to explore\r\nnew methods of computing buckling loads for structures with\r\ncomplex geometries, such as elastic shells and composite\r\nmaterials.  The systematic study of elastic instabilities that is\r\nperformed in this project also sheds some light on\r\nrate-independent hysteresis -- a still poorly understood\r\nphenomenon, whereby a shape memory alloy follows different\r\ndeformation paths upon loading and unloading.  The project's\r\ncontribution towards better understanding of instabilities\r\npermits a quantitative analysis of one of the proposed\r\nexplanations for hysteresis, that the material \"gets stuck\" in\r\nlocal minima.  The project also presents educational and training\r\nopportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.  Parts of\r\nthis project form the cores of doctoral dissertations of the\r\ninvestigator's graduate students, while other parts inform the\r\ncontent of advanced undergraduate classes and independent\r\nstudies.\r\n",
