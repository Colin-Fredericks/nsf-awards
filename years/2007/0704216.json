This involves working\r\ndirectly with the groups needing such frames such as Siemens\r\nCorporate Research, the Bio-Medical Engineering Center at\r\nCarnegie Mellon University, and the Digital Signal Processing\r\nCenter in the Electrical Engineering department at Rice\r\nUniversity. One project involves designing frames and algorithms\r\nfor doing signal reconstruction without phase. This project is\r\ndesigned to remove certain background noises from a signal so\r\nthat the voice signals are clearer. Another project involves\r\nanswering the question: What is the role and what can imaging do\r\nfor systems biology?  The goal is to have distributed yet\r\nintegrated large bioimage databases that would allow researchers\r\nto upload their data, have it processed, share the data, download\r\ndata as well as having platform-optimized code, all in a common\r\nformat. A third project involves doing signal reconstruction with\r\nerasures.  The investigator has designed a system that accounts\r\nfor erasures without any extra coefficient calculations, which is\r\nboth fast and accurate.  This method needs to be custom designed\r\nfor the myriad of applications where there are transmission\r\nlosses or erasures.  Another project involves designing \"fusion\r\nframes\" for problems in distributed processing.  This requires\r\ndesigning localized frames that globally fuse data both quickly\r\nand accurately -- especially in the face of losses. These are\r\nused for a variety of problems including sensor networks. \r\nAnother project is geared to finding equal-norm equi-angular\r\nParseval frames and mutually unbiased bases. These frames are\r\nused in quantum state tomography, quantum cryptography and\r\nfoundational issues in quantum mechanics.\r\n\r\n     The signal reconstruction project is designed to clean up\r\ncertain types of audio signals that have noise embedded in their\r\nphase to present a clearer signal.  Another project involves\r\nsensors that are used to observe the world around us.  The amount\r\nof sensed data that is currently being collected is more than can\r\nbe collected in one place for analysis.  The investigator and his\r\ncolleagues are designing intelligent ways to reduce the amount of\r\nraw data that is analyzed, and this necessitates understanding\r\nthe nature and role of the redundancy in the measurements. \r\nMaking mathematical contributions to our fundamental\r\nunderstanding of redundant information could advance the\r\nengineering solutions to problems in environmental monitoring\r\n(including agricultural technology), military surveillance,\r\nunderstanding the operation of sensory neural systems, and\r\nimproving general data collection methods that efficiently turn\r\nthe analog events in the natural world into digital signals ready\r\nfor analysis. Bioimaging has a serious need for accurate\r\nclassification, some of which involves life and death decisions\r\nand are currently very sensitive to misclassification (such as\r\nfalse negative decisions in detecting cancer).  The goal here is\r\nto design systems that are able to classify with close-to-perfect\r\naccuracy.\r\n",
