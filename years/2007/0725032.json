 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vocal learning has evolved in such distantly related animal groups as whales, bats, songbirds, hummingbirds and parrots. The ability to learn vocalizations may enable the development of more complex communication systems at the cost of metabolically expensive brains and extended periods of development.  Examining the benefits and costs of vocal learning in a range of species will provide insights into how and why human language has evolved. One common manifestation of learning is a patchwork pattern of geographic variation termed 'dialects'. Dialects may be maintained over time either by limited movements of individuals from one dialect to another or by immigrants learning local call types after dispersal, termed 'vocal convergence'.  Previous work in the yellow-naped amazon in Costa Rica has suggested that vocal convergence is important for maintaining vocal dialects in this parrot species. This project will document when, how and why birds immigrating from one dialect to another learn new call types. To better monitor movements in these wide-ranging birds, biologists and engineers at New Mexico State University (NMSU) will collaborate to develop novel telemetry methods utilizing Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Juvenile yellow-naped amazons will be fitted with the GPS tracking devices and followed for 12 months to document natural patterns of dispersal. Other birds will be moved from their natal dialect to a neighboring dialect to allow close observation of vocal learning and integration into new flocks. These experiments will provide critical data for understanding the benefits conveyed by vocal convergence in this species. In addition, NMSU will partner with the World Parrot Trust and the Area de Conservac\u00edon Guanacaste in Costa Rica to develop an integrated parrot conservation program that includes biological education and nest protection and a website on parrot nesting behavior that features live video feeds from parrot nests. These activities will provide training and mentoring opportunities for students at NMSU, a Hispanic-serving land grant university.",
