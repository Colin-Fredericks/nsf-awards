 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight students will be involved for 8 weeks, from June 1 -July 27, 2007 in doing undergraduate research at The University of West Florida. They will conduct research in mathematics and statistics related to biology under four mentoring faculty from this institution. The objective of the project is to provide a research experience for undergraduates in a realm that is considered the next big thing in mathematics- to wit biology.\r\nThe research projects are:\r\nClustering and classification of medical data; \r\nReconstructing evolutionary trees using information about genes;\r\nProblems in combinatorics of permutations;\r\nProblems in Latin Squares;\r\n\r\nParticipants will select a research topic and  work in groups of two or three under the guidance of a faculty member. They will make presentations of their progress during weekly seminars and at the end of the program each student will submit a report written in adherence to professional standards. Students will be encouraged to publish their works and make presentations at professional meetings.\r\n\r\nRecruitment will predominantly be at 4-year institutions in the south-eastern United States that are not major research centers. Qualified students from under-represented groups will be especially encouraged to apply. Participants will be awarded a stipend, on campus housing, meal allowance and travel expenses.\r\n",
