 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automated telephone dialog systems rely disproportionately on  accurate transcription of the speech signal into readable text. When   the system has low confidence in the automatic speech transcription\r\n(ASR) of a caller's utterance, a typical dialog strategy requires the system to repeat its best guess, and ask for confirmation. This leads to unnatural interactions and dissatisfied callers. The current project focuses on developing better dialog strategies given  current ASR capabilities by learning automatically from contrasting\r\ncorpora, and comparing the results. Using a novel methodology, wizard ablation, simulated human-system dialogs are collected that vary in controlled ways. The testbed application, an Automated  Readers Advisor for New York City's Andrew Heiskell Talking Book and Braille Library, has appropriately limited complexity, and\r\npotentially broad social benefit.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for wizard ablation is that research is needed into the problem-solving strategies humans would use if the human communication channel were restricted to be more like a machine's.  In conventional wizard-of-oz studies, unsuspecting users interact with human wizards \"behind-the-screen\", thus providing data on the way humans interact with (what they believe to be) machines. Unlike a conventional wizard, an ablated wizard is restricted to seeing the ASR input to the system dialog manager. Under a further ablation\r\ncondition, the wizard must choose actions from the repertoire that the system uses, but can combine them freely. The book-borrowing scenarios for the wizard interactions have been designed to be realistic, and Heiskell Library patrons participate in the studies.  The collected dialogs will be made available to the community.\r\n\r\n",

This is why people tolerate repeated requests from the system to confirm its understanding and to repeat themselves.\nCommercial spoken dialogue systems can achieve high reliability with relatively small vocabularies and deliberately rigid dialogue strategies. A commercial spoken dialogue system avoids the more fluid ways that people speak with one another. Such a system makes certain that it has understood the speaker\u00c6s meaning. A commercial system with moderately accurate speech recognition often asks users to repeat themselves. This approach fails, however, when overall recognition is poor.\nResearch spoken dialogue systems are typically more ambitious: they contend with large vocabularies and learn their dialogue strategies from experience. A typical research system, while its strategies are less rigid, may be more successful with poor speech recognition.

The results point to a clear need for mechanisms that generalize across applications, and that adapt general dialogue strategies to specific contexts.\nThis work represents ongoing research at Hunter College of The City University of New York and at Columbia University to support people and computers in dialogue about knowledge bases. Its potential uses are quite broad.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan L Epstein"
