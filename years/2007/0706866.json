 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses several challenging problems about high-dimensional probabilistic \r\nobjects, that are related to the concentration phenomena. Part one is devoted to the study \r\nof probability distributions on linear spaces under certain convexity hypotheses of the\r\nBrunn-Minkowski kind. It focuses on general dimension free geometric and analytic \r\nproperties of measures with heavy tails,  expressed in terms of dilation, isoperimetric, \r\nand weighted Sobolev-type inequalities. The uniform distribution of mass in a convex body \r\nand more general log-concave distributions describe another important family in the \r\nhierarchy of convex or hyperbolic measures. As a closely related direction,  the PI is also \r\nplanning to consider some new aspects of the concentration phenomenon on product \r\nspaces of a large dimension. Part two deals with applications of different concentration \r\nphenomena to the randomized models,  such as a partial summation of data,  spectrum of \r\nstochastic matrices, etc., under minimal assumptions on the dependence of the observed  \r\nrandom variables. Of a particular interest is an asymptotic behavior of typical distributions, \r\nresulting in a given randomized scheme. Part three is devoted to analysis of geometric \r\ncharacteristics of Markov kernels and associated random walks on graphs and other \r\ndiscrete structures. Discrete isoperimetric and modified forms of logarithmic Sobolev \r\ninequalities are planned to be considered in connection with the problem on the rates of  \r\nthe convergence of the Markov semi-groups.\r\n\r\nThe study of the concentration phenomena is strongly dictated by various problems \r\nof  Probability and Statistics on general global properties of stochastic processes. \r\nThe Asymptotic Convex Geometry is another field,  where a number of hard problems \r\nabout high-dimensional convex bodies appeal to the concentration results and techniques. \r\nThis study is also stimulated by problems in Combinatorics and Computer Science \r\n(such as computation of the volume) and in Mathematical Economics (optimization of \r\nthe transport costs). The present proposal continues research in this direction and is aimed, \r\nin particular, to explore the role of the weak dependence in concentration phenomena, \r\nas well as its range of applicability in spaces of large dimensions.",
