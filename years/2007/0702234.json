 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrative, Hybrid and Complex Systems\r\nVictor M. Lubecke\r\nUniversity of Hawaii\r\nGOALI:  Radio Transponders for Life Monitoring\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  \r\n\r\nBoth Doppler radar and radio frequency identification (RFID) involve modulated backscatter technology.  This project combines these technologies to transcend the human life sign monitoring capabilities of both technologies.  This will be achieved through two different Doppler radar applications of passive radio frequency (RF) backscatter tags.  First, body worn \"band-aid\" transponder tags are proposed to modify Doppler radar return signals in time and frequency to isolate a subject's cardiopulmonary motion from other motion and subjects, while facilitating the sensing and telemetry of additional biomedical data.  Combining these wireless tags with Doppler motion sensing allows detection and isolation of untagged subjects among tagged subjects.  Second, backscatter tags as environmentally distributed \"radar node\" transponders are proposed, which would form a bi-static radar system to suppress transmitter phase and \"shake\" noise effects to enable cardiopulmonary motion sensing at large distances, while also allowing passive sensing by exploiting RF signals already present in the environment.  The design and fabrication of RF tag circuit components that are sensitive to additional biomedical parameters such as body temperature, will also be investigated along with tag circuit fabrication, and packaging for disposable sensors.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  \r\n\r\nThe outcomes of this project can lead to valuable tools beneficial for society in the areas of healthcare, emergency response, and military applications.  The research would, also, present a particularly motivating educational opportunity that leverages Hawaii's unique needs for remote healthcare tools, and reaches out to a diverse population of ethnic minority students that have been traditionally underserved by local educational and industrial opportunities.  This research program would particularly benefit the graduate and undergraduate students participating in interdisciplinary research involving biosensors and wireless telemetry.  An important aspect of this program will be the interactions of University of Hawaii at Manoa students with the industrial co-principal investigator, including extended periods of training at the industry partner.\r\n",
