 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer science is, in many ways, a design discipline. Computer scientists design algorithms, interfaces, interactions, specifications, programs, systems and simulations.  The studio method of instruction is prevalent in the preparation of professionals within a variety of other design disciplines, such as architecture and industrial design.  Although a few innovative computer science programs have implemented the studio method, and the logistics and procedures involved have been well-documented, little is known about which components of the studio experience are critical to successful outcomes.  Research on effective learning strategies and the characteristics of innovative work groups could further illuminate the group processes and classroom environment that contribute to successful design studio experiences.  We have much to gain by examining techniques that are effective in the preparation of other designers in order to strengthen the preparation of computer science professionals who are capable of meeting the critical software design challenges of the 21st century.  Toward this end, the PIs will leverage knowledge about design education from architecture and industrial design, to develop new educational models and materials for the design of software-intensive systems, specifically in the area of Human Computer Interaction (HCI).  In the first two years of the project the PIs will focus on research involving data collection and analysis to examine in detail the impact of the studio method on how students learn HCI design.  The data analysis will be informed by the literature on cognitive apprenticeship teaching methods and characteristics of innovative work groups, in order to illuminate the group processes and environment that contribute to successful outcomes within design studio experiences.  Through an investigation of the design process used within an interdisciplinary studio-based project and HCI courses that incorporate a modified studio method, the PIs will formulate guidelines for implementing the studio method in HCI courses and will derive principles that can be applied to the education of future computer science professionals.  In the third year, the effectiveness of the curriculum guidelines will be evaluated through pilot testing in HCI classrooms, and revised based on the results of the formative evaluation.  Research outcomes and curriculum guidelines will be disseminated through presentations, publications, and a project web site.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Based on an investigation of factors that contribute to creative group processes and products within an academic design studio environment, the PIs will advance software design research and education through the development of new models and methods that are supported by empirical evidence and that are teachable.  In this way, the PIs will develop a strong intellectual foundation for teaching software design, which has the potential to transform the teaching of HCI, and ultimately for improving the processes of constructing, evaluating, and modifying software-intensive systems across a variety of computer science specialty areas.",
