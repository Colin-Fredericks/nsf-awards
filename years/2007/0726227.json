 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for student travel to and participation in the 2007 Gaseous Electronics Conference.  The meeting focuses on combining aspects of atomic, molecular, and optical physics with electric gas discharge physics and chemistry, as well as various applications related to these themes. The Gaseous Electronics Conference brings together members of the atomic, molecular, and optical physics communities with researchers interested in applications of gas discharges and plasmas.  The conference is being held in Arlington, VA from 2-5 October, 2007. Support is limited to students enrolled in a Ph.D program in the United States, and all students who receive support are required to present a paper at the conference. Support is competitive and will be based on the anticipated contribution by the individual to the success of conference.",
