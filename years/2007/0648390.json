 "awd_abstract_narration": "In attempting to remain one of the Southwest's premier centers for undergraduate mathematics, the\r\nMathematics Department at Trinity University will continue for the next three years our Summer Undergraduate Research Experience in Mathematics Program. The program has been previously funded by the\r\nNational Science Foundation during the summers of 1997-1999 and 2001-2006. We will offer 12 students per year projects in 4 of the following 6 areas: Abstract Algebra, Combinatorics, Dynamical Systems, Mathematical Biology, Number Theory, Topology. Our goals for this program remain consistent with those expressed in our previous proposals, with some additions that have developed through years of experience and program evaluation.\r\n- To provide our student participants with an understanding of, an appreciation for, and an experience\r\nin the nature of mathematical research and the life of a mathematical researcher, to a degree that\r\nencourages them to pursue the study of the mathematical sciences on the graduate level.\r\n- To offer these experiences with a special eye toward students who do not typically have these opportunities.\r\nOf particular interest are students who are either female or a member of an under-represented group.\r\n- To develop in each participant superior skills in mathematical writing, oral mathematical presentation\r\nand poster design.\r\n- To produce quality mathematical work appropriate for publication on our web site or in undergraduate\r\nresearch journals and, when possible, in higher level research journals.\r\n- To extend the research experience beyond the 9 weeks at Trinity by motivating the students to present\r\ntheir REU research at either their home institution or at a regional/national meeting.\r\n- To gain experience in the use of computers and their interaction in mathematical research.\r\n- To immerse the participants in the culture of mathematics and instill in each member a lifetime value\r\nof the importance of collegiality and group interaction.\r\nWhile our recruiting efforts for students will be nationwide, we will continue to emphasize the recruitment\r\nof students from under-represented groups. Of particular interest to us are Hispanic students enrolled at\r\nthe many heavily Hispanic colleges and universities in South Texas. We propose some significant changes\r\nover our previous programs, including the inclusion in the Program of two Graduate Assistant Mentors, the\r\ncreation of a part-time Administrative Assistant/Secretary position, and a shift in the weekly Colloquium\r\nSeries from faculty speakers to talks given by a weekly \"Visiting Graduate Mentor\" who is an alumni of the\r\nTrinity REU Program.",
