 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research plan integrates several research projects\u00a0of the PI, unified by the relation to topological\u00a0field\u00a0theories which controls the answer to the various\u00a0questions.\u00a0One\u00a0project builds on the PI's\u00a0structural\u00a0classification of\u00a02-dimensional (closed string) semi-simple\u00a0topological\u00a0field\u00a0theories, with implications\u00a0for several\u00a0standing conjectures\u00a0on Gromov-Witten invariants. Beyond a careful treatement of\u00a0the result\u00a0and its implications, the aim\u00a0is to extend it\u00a0to more general theories;\u00a0this seems to\u00a0relate to the factorization properties for\u00a0GW invariants\u00a0(Ionel-Parker,\u00a0Li) and to the structural results in the\u00a0open/closed\u00a0string case (Kontsevich, Costello). A second\u00a0project is\u00a0the study\u00a0of gauged Gromov-Witten theory, where\u00a0twisted\u00a0K-theories and representations of\u00a0loop groups appear.\u00a0Loop groups also feature in the third project, pertaining\u00a0to the geometric Langlands programme, where the cohomological calculations of the PI (with E. Frenkel) offer a way forward form the results of Beilinson-Drinfeld, toward the 'derived' version of the Langlands correspondence. (Recent work of Gukov-Kapustin-Witten suggest a controlling topological\u00a0field\r\ntheory.) Current work by the PI (with C.Woodward)\u00a0extending to Higgs bundles results of coherent cohomology\u00a0previously\u00a0known for principal bundles is an important step. Other, and more speculative\u00a0projects include\u00a0a study of\u00a0non-semisimple 3-dimensional TFT's associated to\u00a0derived\u00a0categories. \u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nTopological Field theory is a spectacular and unforeseen application\u00a0of ideas from modern quantum physics to\u00a0topology: that is the field of mathematics which, broadly speaking, studies the\u00a0properties of\u00a0shapes that are stable under\u00a0continuous deformations. Previous applications of the\u00a0foundational\u00a0problems of quantum physics to\u00a0mathematics\u00a0had dominated\u00a0development in mathematical analysis for\u00a0decades,\u00a0but their emergence in topology in the 1980's\u00a0came as a surprise. Crudely put, the new\u00a0ideas exploit a\u00a0topological irreversibility of time flow: a topological\u00a0change in space-time can usually not be 'undone' in the\u00a0future. This led to the encoding of information in new kinds of algebraic structures (technically, they are monoids rather than groups).\r\nThe new methods succeeded in unifying\u00a0existing\u00a0invariants of knots and\u00a0links with those of 3-and\u00a04-dimensional structures\u00a0(manifolds).\r\nNew invariants\u00a0could\u00a0be defined that bear\u00a0stunning relations to other fields of\u00a0mathematics which\u00a0study finer, but less robust structures\u00a0(algebraic geometry and complex analysis).\u00a0The PI's research\u00a0focuses on instances of these structures where, in addition, a continuous group of symmetries is present in the system,\u00a0and studies the refined structures that emerge.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n",
