 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project continued development of nano-crystalline tungsten carbide-cobalt coatings by integrating two novel processes: i) a low temperature spray deposition process (kinetic metallization), and ii) a nano-crystalline powder deposition process. The results of Phase I research demonstrated that the two proposed methods can be synergistically combined to synthesize unique new compositions of powders for thermal spray coating process. The Phase II work is focused on the scaling and optimization of the powder manufacture and deposition techniques. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the process and material system can provide an environmentally acceptable replacement for chromium-based coatings. A nc-WC-Co coating system with good fatigue properties will certainly provide an alternative to hard Chrome coatings, if it can be fabricated cost effectively. The environmental benefit resulting from this will be significant. The proposed technique is also claimed to result in a deposition equipment at a lower cost of ownership as compared to curently available equipment. The technique has significant broad applications in a number of key industries, including aerospace, power generation, oil and gas drilling, defense and medical industries.\r\n",
