 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecological adaptations enable species to utilize or acquire resources in new or different manners and are tightly linked to the origins of biodiversity, yet the genetic basis of the origins of these adaptations is poorly understood.  The predatory marine gastropod genus Conus is an extremely diverse group of tropical snails with over 500 species, with tremendous differences in diets.  These specialized hunters use a venom with neurotoxins, termed conotoxins, to capture prey.  Conus venoms are amazingly diverse both within and between species and conotoxins are proven sources of novel pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various human neuromuscular disorders.  Because venoms are intricately related to the ability to subdue prey, the evolution of Conus venoms is likely to be strongly influenced by dietary specializations.  The main objective of this research is to test hypotheses about the link between venom composition and dietary specializations of Conus and to examine the correlations between genetic and ecological differences and venom composition among populations of Conus species.  This project includes field and laboratory work to examine and compare diets and venoms of individuals of different populations of three closely related Conus species.  \r\n\r\nUndergraduate students of historically underrepresented groups from colleges and universities near study sites in the tropical Pacific as well as students from the University of Michigan will participate in field and laboratory studies.  This work will greatly boost our understanding and appreciation of ecological adaptations, species interactions and molecular and organismal evolution. Moreover, knowledge of the evolution of Conus venoms should speed the development of pharmaceuticals from Conus.\r\n",
