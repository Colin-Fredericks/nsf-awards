 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to obtain new algorithms and insights for\r\nsome fundamental problems in graphs and networks with a focus on\r\nrouting and network design. A prototypical question in routing is to\r\nfind paths that connect a given set of source-destination pairs while\r\nobeying the link and node capacity constraints of an underlying\r\nnetwork.  Similarly, a prototypical question in network design is to\r\nbuild a minimum cost network to support a given communication\r\npattern. Problems in these two areas are at the core of combinatorial\r\noptimization with many applications.  They also play a crucial role in\r\nthe development of algorithms and structural graph theory.\r\n\r\nThe problems considered in this project are NP-hard and the approach\r\nis to obtain polynomial time approximation algorithms as well as\r\nbounds on the integrality gaps of linear programming based\r\nrelaxations. Questions central to the agenda are disjoint paths\r\nproblems in undirected graphs, buy-at-bulk network design, and\r\norienteering.  In addition to improved algorithms for these and\r\nrelated problems, new broadly applicable algorithmic techniques are\r\nexpected to be discovered. There are several applications that can\r\ndirectly benefit including VLSI design, bandwidth and resource\r\nallocation in networks, design of optical networks, and vehicle\r\nrouting. The project will support and train PhD students and help in\r\nthe dissemination of advanced algorithmic ideas via new classes and\r\nlecture notes.",
