 "awd_abstract_narration": "While researchers have considered tracking annotations on 2D physical surfaces, this project explores the issues for tracking annotations on 3D physical models to accommodate complex objects, track annotations in difficult conditions, and consider the compatibility with 3D printing technology. During the early stages of design, designers do not want to work within the complexity of a CAD system and prefer to work with physical models. Linking the edits and annotations on a physical model with a digital model allows the benefits of digital models to be available while working with physical models. The intellectual merit of this project is in evaluating the feasibility for tracking annotations on physical objects in comparison to fully digital interfaces for early stage design. A new passive optical tracking method will be developed to accommodate complex objects, tracking in difficult conditions, and 3D printing technology. This project will impact the way in which designers use rapid prototyping by integrating edits on physical models with digital models. These techniques will be used in teaching architecture students and influence the expanding  role of physical models in design.",
