A unique focus of the project is on increasing the numbers of Native American STEM majors.  The project is identifying Native American students and involving them in research while they are in high school; mentoring and preparing the participants for their freshman year through a summer bridge program; providing a complete tuition waiver, mentoring and a support network through the student's undergraduate experience; and involving the participants in active and dynamic summer undergraduate research experiences.\r\n\r\nThe project is also refining an existing environmental science minor into a major field of study.  Faculty are developing new courses that are being team taught and focusing on interdisciplinary approaches to environmental studies.  Several of the courses are focusing on the institution's existing sustainability efforts.\r\n",

In fall 2009, the first \"official semester\" of the Environmental Science major, 16 students enrolled. The number of Environmental Science majors is now 58 &ndash; 34 are female, 24 are male, 15 are Native American and four are Asian. Eight students have graduated with a B.A. in Environmental Sciences (three female and five males); of the projected seven Environmental Sciences graduates for 2014 &ndash; four are female, three are male and three are Native American.\n\nThis new major draws predominantly from existing UMM courses, but some new courses have also been developed.

UMM Institutional Research metrics indicate the number of Native American STEM majors has increased from 33 in Fall 2007 to 94 in Fall 2013 (with a peak of 101 in fall 2012).

The UMM STEP summer research projects have yielded both impressive research results (28 abstracts co-authored by STEP participants and presented at national meetings) and positive mentoring relationships between student participants and faculty mentors.\n\nWind-STEP program: The UMM Wind-STEP program is a two-week residential program for rising Native American high school juniors and seniors who are interested in STEM careers. Developed in 2010, the focus of Wind-STEP is wind energy and its application to the needs and wants of reservation communities. Participants learn about opportunities for careers in the sciences, discuss science ethics and interact with Native American college STEM majors. For the capstone project, Wind-STEP participants complete research using GIS to identify a potential site for a wind turbine on a nea..."
