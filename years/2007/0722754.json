 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical abstract:\r\n\r\n\"In this Major Research Instrumentation Program proposal, the University of Texas-Pan American is requesting funding to purchase an Ar ion laser system for the fabrication of three dimensional photonic band-gap materials (photonic crystals).  The Ar ion laser can provide up to eight laser lines in the visible range needed for the nano/micro-structuring of photosensitive materials. The fabrication of the photonic crystal is based on the laser phase mask lithography technique, which provides a highly efficient approach, of unprecedented simplicity, for the mass production of large-scale three-dimensional photonic band-gap materials. Further photonic crystals will be functionalized as optical circuits by adding optical waveguides and resonators using two-photon lithography. University of Texas-Pan American is a minority-serving university, which is second in the nation in the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to Hispanics. The supported research will foster their desire to pursue advanced degrees, increasing the number of under-represented scientists.\"\r\n\r\nNon-technical abstract:\r\n\r\n\"In this Major Research Instrumentation Program proposal, the University of Texas-Pan American is requesting funding to purchase a very strong light beam called laser in the visible range. The laser will be used to fabricate optical materials with a feature size 100 times smaller than a human hair. The small structure in the optical material can manipulate (control) photons as silicon material did to electrons (so the optical material is also called photonic crystal). These optical materials will be used to fabricate optical chip (similar to computer chip) by adding light path and enhancing the light inside. The fabrication is based on a mask technique. When the laser beam goes through the mask, it will produce a dark and bright pattern behind the mask. Photosensitive materials will record such pattern. When it is developed in chemical solution, the structure with very small feature is formed in the material. The mask technique is much simpler than other methods. It will significantly reduce the fabrication cost from $500,000 down to $100,000 (cost of laser). The proposed research can make optical circuit manufacturing commercially feasible and contribute to the United States' global competitiveness in photonics technology. University of Texas-Pan American is a minority-serving university, which is second in the nation in the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to Hispanics. The supported research will foster their desire to pursue advanced degrees, increasing the number of under-represented scientists.",
