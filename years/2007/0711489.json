 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Graduate Workshop on Inverse Problems and Applications at Colorado State University, July 30th - August 3rd, 2007, will bring together graduate students from eight countries including the United States to learn about theoretical and computational aspects of inverse problems from seven world-renowned experts.  Inverse problems is an active area of contemporary mathematics with applications in engineering, biology, geophysics, medicine, finance, and chemistry.  Students at various levels in their graduate degree programs will attend a series of minicourses developed by the experts, in each of which they will study a specific topic through lectures and assigned problems.  Some topics will be tied to a specific application, while others will be more generally applicable.  Participants will have access to the computational facilities at Colorado State University for working on computing problems.  Students will have the opportunity to discuss the assigned problems as well as other topics with the experts during the interaction sessions, which are time allotted during the day for students to work on the problems and talk to the experts in a less formal setting than the lecture hall.  The goals of the workshop are to provide instruction in inverse problems and to provide a venue for interaction between senior researchers in inverse problems and graduate students at both a technical and personal level.",
