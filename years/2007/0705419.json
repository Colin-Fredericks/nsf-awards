 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flapping flight provides high maneuverability for indoor environments.\r\nTo achieve robust intelligence for tasks such as search and indoor\r\nnavigation, the maneuverability of an ornithopter will be combined\r\nwith a learning approach which makes minimal assumptions about the\r\nnature of disturbances and obstacles.  We propose to develop\r\nalgorithms for ornithopters to cooperate in sensing and navigation in\r\ntypical indoor environments without prior maps.  Our research will be\r\nverified with full three dimensional dynamic simulation, a\r\nmulti-tethered laboratory test-bed, as well as with actual indoor\r\nflying ornithopters.\r\n\r\nThe key research issues to be addressed in this work are:\r\n1) improved ornithopter mechanics and aerodynamics\r\n2) robust ornithopter flight control strategies\r\n3) learning algorithms for cooperative navigation\r\nof ornithopters using only simple sensor information\r\n\r\nThis research will advance understanding of high maneuverability\r\nflapping wing vehicles for indoor flight.  By combining research from\r\nthe levels of mechanics to learned behavior in a real indoor\r\nenvironment, we will test how performance at each level can be\r\nintegrated to achieve robust intelligence.\r\n\r\nOur project will provide interdisciplinary education for students in\r\nachieving robust intelligence through the combination of mechanics,\r\nsensing, control, and learning.  This research can lead to flying\r\nrobots which can robustly enter unknown and hazardous indoor\r\nenvironments, potentially keeping rescue workers out of harms way.",
