 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology will acquire a Raman microscope with this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi User (CRIF:MU) program. The instrument will be employed in research projects related to carbon nanotubes in light of their potential as gas sensors, the development of nanoparticles for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and the identification of dissolved organic matter adsorbed on colloids using SERS. Raman spectroscopy will further aid in structural investigations of surfactant films on natural zeolite surfaces and efficient chemical protective materials. \r\n\r\nA Raman microscope is an instrument that employs a laser to observe vibrational transitions of molecules absorbed on surfaces and to observe vibrational spectra of novel substances such as nano-materials and carbon nanotubes.  The vibrational spectra that are obtained provide information on the identity and structure of the substances.  The requested instrument will also enhance science teaching and learning at New Mexico Tech through usage in regular laboratory courses in analytical and physical chemistry, in the mandatory senior research program for chemistry undergraduate students, and in graduate student research. \r\n",
