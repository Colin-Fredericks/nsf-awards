 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Richard G. Weiss of Georgetown University.  This research will involve a multidisciplinary investigation of static and dynamic molecular interactions in micro-environments of anisotropic materials.  Diverse analytical techniques will be required to collect the pertinent data.  Information collected over selected temperature and pressure ranges will be used to establish correlations between changes at the molecular and macro levels.  A primary objective of the coordinated studies is to obtain comprehensive pictures of how the materials respond internally to a range of different externally-applied perturbations, how the materials affect internal probe molecules, and to what extent the materials can be employed to influence the properties of embedded guest molecules.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research include the training of young scientists, including undergraduates and those in underrepresented groups and from developing countries.  The PI has established collaborations with scientists in several developing countries and will use them as part of the students' education about how science is performed in less developed environments and the challenges that face the U.S. to help development.  Further, the students will be exposed to a very broad spectrum of multidisciplinary research and will be given opportunities to attend scientific conferences and to present their research results.  Although the approach to the research will stress 'fundamental' discoveries, there will be practical implications and potential for developing new materials and demonstrations of potential utility for industrial purposes are planned.\r\n",
