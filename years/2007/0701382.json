Understanding the genomic architecture of domestication and the effects of selection on the structure and variation of crop species genomes remain key areas of interest in plant biology.  This project will fine-map domestication genes and examine the role of evolutionary selection in the origin of cultivated rice identifying genomic regions that show signatures of positive selection in approximately 53 Mb of the rice genome associated with 15 quantitative trait loci for six domestication traits.  This project will assess the nature of selection under domestication in crop genomes, investigate the evolutionary dynamics of domestication trait genomic regions in rice and its wild ancestor, provide genomic sequence for approximately 5 Mb of O. rufipogon spanning 10 regions that contain domestication loci, create near-isogenic lines to facilitate positional cloning of domestication genes, undertake a comparative genomic analyses of domestication genomic regions between cultivated and wild rice, and develop new statistical methods and models to study crop evolution under domestication.\r\n\r\nBy identifying genomic regions associated with key domestication traits and developing new resources for further characterization of these loci, this project will provide the foundation for new genetic targets towards crop improvement. This project will also collaborate with the New York University Science, Health and Environment Reporting Program to train graduate-level science journalism students in plant genomics, and also work with the Laboratory Investigations with Model Organisms (LIMO) program at Washington University to provide meaningful laboratory internship positions for St. Louis city public school students.

Asian rice feeds more than half of the global population and has become a key model system for plant biology. Several genetic studies have shown that Oryza rufipogon, which remains extant in South and Southeast Asia, is the wild progenitor of domesticated rice. Our study has focused on understanding molecular variation in the rice genome, studying the origin and spread of rice and the impact of selection on shaping plant genome variation.\n\nWe re-sequenced portions of 630 genes on rice chromosomes 8, 10 and 12 at ~100 kb intervals in multiple accessions of O. sativa indica and tropical japonica as well as O. rufipogon.  Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and two different computational techniques to analyze data from molecular variation, we provide new evidence for a single domestication of rice.  The approaches we use, one of which was developed by this project, support a single origin for rice, and we are also able to estimate a date for the domestication of rice consistent with the previously-published archaeological studies. \n\n How nucleotide variation is distributed across the genome is a central question in molecular population genomics and has been a subject of considerable interest since the earliest surveys of molecular polymorphism.  While recombination rate is a major factor that contributes to the genomic distribution of polymorphism, hitchhiking effects may occur in any genomic context where opportunities for recombination between selected mutations and linked neutral sites are limited.  In principle, genomic regions with a greater influx of selected mutations have an increased proportion of neutral sites linked to sites under selection and genetic hitchhiking is expected to occur provided that linkage associations are sufficiently strong.  Gene-rich regions or other genomic contexts with high densities of functional sites may therefore be subject to the diversity-reducing effects of selection even if crossing-over occurs frequently.

In rice, maize and other cereal grass species, recombination has been observed to initiate in gene regions, which explains the strong correlation of recombination rate and gene density in these species.\n\nFinally, another major area of study for the project was to identify regions of the genome that show evidence of recent positive selection. Using our SNP data, we identified a total of 20 such regions within the three chromosomes. We found that ..."
