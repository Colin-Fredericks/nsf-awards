 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: The project involves addresses atomic level understanding of composition and structure of thin dielectric films on semiconductor materials, with emphasis on buried interfaces of materials. The approach includes epitaxial growth and analysis of high dielectric constant films on Ge, GaAs and InGaAs alloys. Medium energy ion scattering experiments play a central role in characterization,  and are complemented and correlated with scanning probe microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrical measurements; isotope experiments will also be conducted in special circumstances to assess mobility of atomic species during growth. The project will benefit from established collaborations with industrial scientists.\r\n\r\nNon-technical: This project aims to develop an atomic level understanding of materials interfaces in electronics with impact on industrial processes. The research provides excellent opportunities for hands-on experience for undergraduate and graduate students in the development and use of sophisticated scientific equipment. It will also broaden their scientific horizons through collaborations with scientists in industry and from Latin America. Outreach activities involving middle school students and their teachers constructing and using learning modules will be conducted as part of this project. Direct and visually oriented information will be obtained to communicate understanding and excitement of materials science to students and teachers.\r\n",
