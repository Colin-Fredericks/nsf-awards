The program focused in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) will engage undergraduate students in undergraduate research projects which will involve faculty from more that one ECE specialization area.  The students will also participate in discussions, seminars and laboratory tours with faculty members representing different specializations.  The program will join eleven other undergraduate research programs at NCSU that work together to enhance the research experience of more than one hundred undergraduates each summer. \r\n\r\nIn addition to individual research, the program includes features on research ethics, diversity, laboratory safety, graduate school preparation, as well as a number of social functions. Also, included in this REU site is an assessment component which will be coordinated by an education expert from the Department of Psychology. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the program lie in the effort to attract the nation's best undergraduates to pursue graduate work in the sciences and engineering.  \r\n\r\n",
