 "awd_abstract_narration": "Binghamton University in general, and its Computer Science (CS) Department\r\nin particular, are successfully complementing an outstanding reputation\r\nfor undergraduate education with vibrant and growing graduate-level\r\nresearch programs.  This combination provides fertile ground for\r\noutstanding undergraduate research experiences in the area of experimental\r\ncomputer systems.  The combination of a high quality research environment,\r\ndedicated and talented Faculty Research Mentors, and a feedback loop driven\r\nby a local educational evaluation professional, ensure the strong\r\nintellectual merit of this REU site.  An attractive high-quality Web space,\r\npapers published in high-profile venues, and faculty talks describing\r\nstudent research, will demonstrate that undergraduates can be valuable and\r\neffective researchers, thereby encouraging other CS departments to\r\nincreasingly employ them in this capacity.\r\n \r\nCurrent research projects directed by Binghamton CS faculty include improving\r\nthe performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability of modern microprocessors\r\nand memory systems; using Grid computing to solve computationally complex\r\ndistributed scientific applications; combining and scaling wide-area Web-based\r\ninformation retrieval techniques; advancing face recognition, processing,\r\nanalysis, and animation research; and creating new combinatorial optimization\r\ntechniques for VLSI computer aided design problems.  Specific goals of the\r\nBinghamton REU Site include exposing students to high-quality computer systems\r\nresearch, training them to be effective and productive computer science\r\nresearchers, and attracting them through exciting and positive experiences\r\nto continue to pursue a research-oriented career path.\r\n",
