 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses expanding workforce expertise in computing to meet the needs of the Sacramento region of California. It has the potential to serve as a national model for collaboration among two and four year academic institutions, govenment, and industry for improving American competitiveness. Involving faculty and leadership at Folsom Lake College and Sacramento State University, the project responds to the expanding national and local need for computing experts by exploring regional trends and workforce requirements. Using multi-organization collaborative activities, the project team will address: 1. What types of expertise should academic institutions be developing -- what skills and competencies do institutions need to develop in students in order to create a thriving computing workforce for the 21st century in the Sacramento region? 2. What are effective strategies for transformation of the educational experience -- how can students be re-engaged? What resources are needed? This project will initiate dialogue about these issues and build linkages between educators, professionals, and employers that are necessary in preparing for the effective transformation of undergraduate computing education in the Sacramento region. The interaction between faculty members from multiple disciplines, and across institutions, are expected to result in new perspectives on instruction and collaboration, shared research interests, and innovative interdisciplinary-cross institutional projects that are effective in re-engaging the minds and interests of students in the region. This project includes activities at both a two-year college and a four-year university, maximizing the reach of the project to include the large and highly diverse community college student population of the California Community College System which serves over 2.5 million students each year.",
