 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe proposed research plans aim at utilizing the available data coming from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well as neutrino experiments to answer long-standing questions in particle physics. \r\nThe goal of this research is to further our understanding in the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking as well as the origin of flavor mixing and CP violation. The PI will approach these outstanding questions in particle physics by constructing various candidate models for beyond the standard model physics and by examining the experimental consequences of these models at the LHC and in underground experiments for proton decays and neutrinos. New data from Collider experiments will be utilized to guide the construction of models that solve the gauge hierarchy problem, including those with Supersymmetry, extra dimensions and \r\na strongly coupled Higgs sector. Methods to analyze the data distinguish between competing models will be developed. Properties of the neutrinos and implications for proton decays in these models will be analyzed. The results of these studies may point to the right route to the further unification of GUT and the family symmetries. Novel origins of CP violation in extra dimensions or in a strongly coupled Higgs sector will be searched for, and their implications for leptogenesis will be studied. The outcome of this investigation willhopefully shed light on the origin of the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter in the Universe. Possible connections between the mechanism behind the electroweak symmetry breaking and the dynamics for flavor mixing will be investigated. \r\nThe broader impacts of this research are to promote the public interests in and appreciations for the upcoming exciting results in particle physics, through an active participation of the PI in the UC Irvine's Quark Net Program. These efforts are complemented by the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers as well as by introducing undergraduate students into the frontiers of research in particle physics. \r\n",
