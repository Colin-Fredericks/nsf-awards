Organized by Dr. Miguel Jose Yacaman of the University of Texas-Austin, this PASI will include lectures, hands-on laboratory modules, and poster sessions for postdocs, graduate students, and junior faculty from the American continent.  Participants will include 25 students and junior researchers from the United States and 25 from Latin American institutions, as well as 15 lecturers.  Lecture topics will include: tomography, diffraction, and calculation methods, confocal and other techniques that will increase familiarity with new nano-characterization microscopy-based methods.  In addition to the lectures, activities will include hands-on instruction and discussion of new optical microscopes, as well as presentations of advances and holographic techniques for nanostructures characterization, all with the goal of providing participants with an up-to-date review of this field of research.\r\n\r\nThis PASI on microscopy techniques for the characterization of nanomaterials will provide the participants with knowledge of the latest transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques and will increase the quality and impact of their research.  The PASI results will be disseminated through the web and in CDs to promote the advance of microscopy in the Americas.",
