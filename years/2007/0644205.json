Such unsupervised infrastructures \r\nare characterized by uncertainty in their resource availability caused by \r\nfailures, varying load conditions, and node churn, thus putting undue burden on\r\napplication writers and system administrators for the successful\r\ndeployment and execution of applications. This project is developing a \r\nself-managing resource allocation framework that would hide\r\nthe infrastructure uncertainties and dynamics from applications, \r\nwhile transparently adapting to changing conditions within the infrastructure.\r\nAs part of this framework, this project is developing techniques for:\r\n(i) Predictable resource aggregation to provide resource guarantees to \r\napplications in the presence of dynamic loads and changing resource availability,\r\n(ii) Reliability-aware resource management to provide desired levels\r\nof reliability and availability, and\r\n(iii) System inference and prediction to enable decentralized inference\r\nof global system conditions for proactive response to dynamic infrastructure changes.\r\nThese techniques are based on cooperation and redundancy among nodes in the \r\ninfrastructure to provide scalability and decentralization. \r\nThe proposed research will have significant impact on distributed \r\ncomputing by enabling effective deployment of large-scale scientific \r\nand commercial applications on resource-rich but unreliable infrastructures.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProcessors, the computational heart of computer systems, have been changing rapidly over the past five years.  With single-threaded performance increasing much more slowly than it did in the 90s and early 2000s, manufacturers have been increasing core counts.  But making use of these increasing core counts has been an engineering struggle.\n\n\nCNS-0644205 is a CAREER grant intended to address software support for increasing core counts by developing the technology of memory transactions.  Memory transactions allow the programmer to specify that certain data structure updates must complete as a unit, without partial results visible to other computational threads in the system.For example, a memory transaction would allow a programmer to add an item to a queue, which is an operation that requires several memory updates.  Other threads would be able to observe only the legal beforestate and the legal after state, i.e., the state without and then with the new item.  Threads could not observe the queue state as it isbeing updated.\n\n\nTransactions in database systems have been a historically successful programming abstraction, so memory transactions should help make multicore programming easier.  Transactions should improve performance, reduce implementation complexity, and most importantly reduce the conceptual complexity of implementing system services.\n\n\nThe project accomplished its goals via the following major findings.\n\nOur work on TxLinux establishes how a modern operating system (OS) could use memory transactions, and how it must support memory transactions with modified scheduling policies. \n\n\nOur work on dependence aware transactions demonstrates a provably safe optimization that allows more memory transactions to safely commit.\n\n\nTxOS is a version of Linux that provides transactions as part of its system call interface.
