 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports \r\nthe work of Professor LuAnn McNulty from Butler University.  This research \r\nis focused on the syntheses of dihydropyrans via novel and convergent synthetic methods.  Substructures of these compounds are found in many\r\nnatural products, some of which have interesting biological activities. \r\nDr. McNulty and coworkers will use microwave technology to assist in \r\nthese syntheses.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The Broader Impacts of this research is considered \r\nto be outstanding, as all of the students working on the projects are undergraduates.  These students will be doing cutting edge research, \r\nand will be encouraged to present their work at conferences.  Thus, the training and education of the undergraduate students working on these \r\nprojects will provide a valuable contribution to society via at least \r\ntwo avenues: an increase in more highly trained and skilled scientists; and the discovery of new synthetic methods to prepare compounds that may have useful medicinal properties.",
