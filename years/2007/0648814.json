As consequence, the usage of digital imagery has also expanded. In this context, preparing tomorrow's scientists who would further advance and support imaging applications is essential for any country whose goal is to stay at the forefront of the technological developments.\r\n\r\nThe Montclair REU site (iMagine) will involve eight undergraduate students each year (for three years) in an eight-week intensive summer program to perform research and develop new computer applications for imaging and computer vision. The students will be immersed in an active environment that involves research and educational interactions as well as social activities. The site has the distinct characteristic of being located within the greater New York City area, one of the largest metropolitan concentrations in the US. The project will organize activities taking place at various Montclair units as well as renowned imaging companies and world class museums. The site's objectives include encouraging and motivating undergraduate computing students to engage in research and follow through with research oriented careers and graduate studies, providing an enriching educational experience by exposing the students to non-classroom faculty-student interactions, academic- industry and multidisciplinary research interaction, increasing the number of women, minorities and students from institutions with limited  research infrastructure, improving oral and written communication and knowledge dissemination skills.\r\n\r\nThis REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
