 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to create a collaborative geocoder allowing end-users to find a geographic location using a street address, add and correct road data to increase coverage and decrease errors, and share those improvements with others. The project includes development of a data-source reputation-system that manages multiple road segment data contributors. It will gather road data from consumers and others in the location-based services value-chain, augment an existing public road database, and provide road data back to the stakeholders in a more complete, more accurate and less expensive form.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will reduce the cost of geocoding and improve accuracy and coverage. Geocoding is a pervasive activity, contributing to emergency response effectiveness, epidemiological studies and transportation planning, as well as consumer activities and travel planning. Impacts to these sectors will depend on the accuracy and coverage achieved and market penetration. Consumer travel could be rendered more efficient, emergency responsiveness more effective, epidemiological studies more accurate. Overall, reduced costs should improve productivity in these sectors as well.\r\n",
