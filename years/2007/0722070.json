 "awd_abstract_narration": "A growing consensus among experts is that the routing system is \r\napproaching a critical architectural breaking point.  The Internet \r\nArchitecture Board has tried to identify the factors that limit \r\nrouting scalability and reached the conclusion that the most acutely \r\nscale-limiting parameter of the current routing system is routing \r\ntable size, not so much for its memory requirements as for its \r\nreaction to network dynamics. This conclusion is not surprising in \r\nlight of recent research demonstrating that no routing algorithm can \r\nprovide reasonable scalability bounds on dynamic Internet-like graphs. \r\n\r\nThese findings offer the ominous but definitive lesson: to scale \r\nefficiently and indefinitely, we must learn how to route without \r\ntopology updates. Updateless routing seems impossible at first \r\nglance, but Milgram's 1967 experiments showed that such routing is \r\nin fact a reality of greedy search strategies in social networks. \r\nJon Kleinberg provided the first model formally demonstrating \r\nefficiency of such greedy routing strategies. However, both the \r\nKleinberg model and its subsequent variations deal with graph \r\ntopologies vastly different from scale-free topologies of observed \r\ncomplex networks, including the Internet. \r\n\r\nThis project proposes a new model of Greedy Routing on Hidden \r\nMetrics, the GROHModel, which generalizes the Kleinberg model and \r\nnaturally yields scale-free topologies. The model employs the \r\nconcept of a hidden metric space (HMS) existing behind every complex \r\nnetwork, including the Internet. The project thoroughly investigates \r\nthe hypothesis that the observable scale-free structure of complex \r\nnetworks is a consequence of natural evolution that maximizes the \r\nefficiency of greedy routing on these HMSs. \r\n\r\nThe research agenda of the project is two-fold: (1) demonstrate the \r\nexistence of HMSs, thus validating the GROHModel premises; and (2) \r\nbuild methodologies to explicitly re-construct the HMS for the \r\nobservable Internet topology, and more generally for any given \r\ncomplex network. As soon the Internet's HMS is reconstructed, one \r\ncan use it to deliver addressing schemes for updateless, \r\nindefinitely scalable Internet routing architectures based on greedy \r\nrouting strategies. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project involves concerted \r\ncross-fertilization across fields of networking, theoretical \r\ncomputer science, physics, and mathematics. The project develops a \r\nnovel network modeling methodology that is elegantly generic in \r\nnature, mathematically sound, and promises a solution to one of the \r\nmost challenging problems of future large-scale networking. \r\n\r\nSince the Internet is just one of many complex networks that form \r\nessential fabrics of human life, the potential advances of this work \r\nare profound. Navigability of complex networks, i.e., efficiency of \r\ntargeted information propagation in them, has a fundamental \r\nrelationship to their structure. Proved faithful to reality, the \r\nfundamental understanding advanced with the GROHModel may also result in \r\nadvances in understanding of structure and function of biological, social\r\nand language networks.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  the effects of scaling limits of conventional routing\r\non current networks include performance drops, loss of reachability and \r\nhigh cost.  As the networks grow, these are worsened.  In present times,\r\noperators and enterprises are attempting a transition to IPv6 in order\r\nto allow virtually limitless sites to connect directly to the Internet.\r\nThis transition is expected to worsen routing strains.  This project's \r\ninnovative reexamination of the routing solution space is relevant and\r\ntimely.",
