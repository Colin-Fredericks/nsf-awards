 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intent-based Network Management\r\n\r\nThis research is developing a framework for better managing IP\r\nnetworks using an intent-based network management approach to address\r\nthe performance and robustness issues associated with managing complex\r\nIP networks. The goal is to automatically generate needed network\r\nconfigurations by requiring only high-level objectives as input while\r\nalso ensuring network-level objectives such as performance and\r\nreliability. The research develops design principles applicable to\r\nmanaging both current and future networks and provides insight into\r\ndesigning networks for manageability. Using abstraction-based\r\nrepresentations, the framework enables high-level specifications to\r\nautomate low-level tasks, so that one can directly manage the network.\r\nThree main obstacles in today's network management are addressed:\r\ninsufficient visibility, inability to predict the outcome of network\r\nconfiguration changes, and hidden errors in configurations due to\r\nassembly-language-like interfaces.  The research develops these key\r\ntechniques: (1) Measurement-based derivation of network protocols'\r\noperational models to elicit undocumented limiting behavior. (2)\r\nMethods to quantify limitations of measurement methodologies to enable\r\nmore accurate result interpretation. (3) Privacy-preserving,\r\nincentive-compatible data sharing across networks. (4) Systematic\r\nevaluation of trade-offs by developing metrics for quantifying network\r\nproperties and abstractions encapsulating device details. (5)\r\nReal-time decision support for what-if analysis and automated\r\nintent-based configuration generation. (6) Joint control and data\r\nplane management.\r\n\r\nThe research will advance the state of the art in managing IP networks\r\nby addressing key challenges in achieving automated, evolvable, and\r\nrobust network management. Any developed software will be publicly\r\navailable. The research results will be integrated into undergraduate\r\nand graduate curriculum. \r\n",
