The project is defining several course models for further development and connecting individuals with interest in each model so that they can continue to work on the model after the workshop.  Ultimately, the investigators plan that these subgroups will create course materials for both students and instructors to allow easy adoption and widespread use.  The primary outcomes of the workshop are preliminary materials describing several models for technological literacy courses, a community focused on developing each of these models, and a dissemination effort to promote the models to a broader audience.  The broader impacts include the focus on developing courses that promote a technologically literate citizenry and help recruit students of diverse interests and backgrounds into science, mathematics, and engineering careers.\r\n",
