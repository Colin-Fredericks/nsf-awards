 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a joint COST-IST (EU) and NSF (USA) NeXtworking 2007 Workshop on Future Internet Architecture held on April 19-20, 2007, in Berlin, Germany. There are three main objectives for the workshop:\r\n.\tIdentifying networking research challenges: The workshop focuses on identifying the main research challenges that must be addressed to lead to a future Internet architecture that addresses the many challenges of today's networks and the promising capabilities of tomorrow's technologies.\r\n.\tIdentifying requirements for experimental facilities: A closely related goal is to investigate the role of experimental facilities in supporting the research and the capabilities these facilities should have, as well as documenting the strengths and limitations of existing research testbeds.\r\n.\tFacilitating collaboration between EU and US researchers: By bringing together researchers from the EU and US, the workshop will build stronger ties for joint research including organizing joint efforts on the design, and particularly the federation, of future experimental facilities. \r\nThe workshop targets key research areas in networking represented by premier researchers from the EU and USA, with an emphasis on the needs of future network architectures rather than summaries of mature research results. The workshop organizers are Christophe Diot (Thomson), Serge Fdida (U. Paris), Anja Feldmann (TU-Berlin), Jennifer Rexford (Princeton University), and Ioannis Stavrakakis (University of Athens), Jennifer Rexford will handle the NSF funding and Scott Kirkpatrick is handling the 30,000 Euros that COST is providing for the workshop. After the conclusion of the workshop, the organizing committee will furnish a report to the COST-IST (EU) and NSF (USA) and will make it publicly available to participants and others via the workshop Web site and any relevant funding-agency Web sites.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe workshop focuses on the intellectual challenges of designing a future Internet architecture that is worthy of society's trust (in terms of important metrics such as scalability, reliability, security, manageability, usability, and other so-called X-ities) and expands the capabilities available to end users (including support for mobility and large numbers of wireless and sensor devices). At the NSF, these research challenges lie at the heart of the FIND (Future INternet Design) initiative. In addition, the workshop will include discussion of tools and techniques for evaluating new architectural ideas, including modeling, simulation and experimental tools and techniques for connecting multiple experimental facilities to enable larger-scale evaluation. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The importance of the Internet for the economic, political, and social well-being of the nation, and the world, cannot be overstated. The workshop will play an important role in outlining a larger research agenda for the design of a future Internet. In addition, the workshop will enable a strong collaboration between EU and US researchers in networking research and the design and operation of global experimental facilities for evaluating new network architectures.\r\n",
