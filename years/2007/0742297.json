 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will pioneer a technical, social, and aesthetic grammar for fully immersive interactive installations. This project will identify breakthroughs in the grammar of interactivity analogous to the development of cross-cutting in cinema, which transformed cinema from a diversion to a powerful communication medium; or the introduction of hyperlinking to digital texts on the Internet, which transformed reading from a passive linear activity to an interactive nonlinear one. The intellectual advances will include: \r\n? New systems and technologies for full-body interaction with projected interactive installations that go beyond simple physical cause and effect, including real-time computer vision analysis of viewers? body language, culture and mood; and analysis of large crowds? movements. \r\n? High-level principles of this medium for effective communication. Communication will be explored in the educational (science themes) and the cultural (art and humanity themes). \r\n? Human-Computer Interface analysis of immersive interactive media, including a comparison with passive media and studies with psychologists for independent analysis (pending human subjects review). \r\n\r\nThe broader impact is the development of a new medium which is as powerful as cinema, and yet where the viewers remain aware of themselves and the people around them as active participants in a mutually created narrative story. This medium may become the dominant means for education and communication in public institutions as the internet subsumes traditional \"kiosk\" and \"wall text\" installations. \r\n",
