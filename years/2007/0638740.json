The theme of the project \"Tracing a Drop of Water\" has linked the program with efforts to increase teacher content knowledge in under-performing schools and provides fellows with an example of how scientists can excite students about science while still having a career in research. \r\nThe intellectual merit of the program established a partnership between scientists and the K-12 community by focusing on interdisciplinary environmental and watershed sciences.  There will be creative links between mathematics, science, social science and technology in order to address important social issues in inland and coastal watersheds.  The broader impacts of this program not only strives to increase students STEM knowledge in grades 5-8 but also encourages students to think about STEM career options.  The K-12 schools involved in this project are high-needs schools with typically over two-thirds of the students from underrepresented groups.  Also, the overall theme of water is critical to all people.  The sustained program aims to change the culture of K-12 outreach in the university research community and to serve as a model for other institutions of higher learning. \r\n",
