Professor Vasundara Varadan, Department of Electrical Engineering  and Director of the Microwave & Optics Laboratory for Imaging and Characterization has proposed a research collaboration with Indian counterpart, Dr. Saluru Krupanidhi, a leading researcher in ferroelectric and superconducting materials, who has set up a state-of-the-art fabrication and characterization facility at the IISc.  The student research projects are designed to leverage the complementary strength of the MRC researchers in fabrication of novel, functional materials that will enhance UAF's strength in design and simulation, device fabrication and characterization.  Student researchers will spend the academic year on design and simulation and then use the six-weeks at the IISc in Banglaore to work with collaboratively on realizing their design goals for new microwave  devices.\r\n\r\nMicrowave devices are widely used in civilian and defense communication systems as well as in transportation systems such as automobiles, airplanes, ships and satellites.  In addition to strengthening their research skills, students participating in this project will benefit by broadening their contacts and developing deeper insights into global R&D issues.  They will have the opportunity to visit the research laboratories of General Electric and General Motors located in Bangalore. Collectively, these opportunities \r\nhave the potential to positively impact international collaborative activities in the future.  Students not directly participating will gain from the experiences of their peers through presentations and possibly the publication of the results of their international research.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
