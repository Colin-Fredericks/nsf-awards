 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Improving Network Operations with a View From the Edge\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Kaleidoscope project is developing techniques, tools, and systems to\r\nfacilitate network operations---a class of tasks that includes\r\nmonitoring network conditions, detecting actionable problems, and taking\r\nsteps to remediate them.  We focus on two areas of network operations:\r\n(1) network security (specifically, unwanted traffic) and (2) network\r\nmonitoring, diagnosis, and troubleshooting.  The results from this\r\nproject will both streamline today's network operations tasks and\r\nprovide design insights for network operations in the next-generation\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\nKaleidoscope specifically focuses on improvements to network operations\r\nthat rely on cooperation between users (or edge networks) and operators.\r\nUsers and operators have common goals but, more importantly, they have\r\ncomplementary perspectives. Operators typically have broad views of\r\nnetwork traffic but have little fine-grained information about\r\ncompromised hosts or end-to-end performance.  End users possess\r\nfine-grained security and performance information, but they have neither\r\nvisibility the into network internals (e.g., configuration) nor a\r\ncomprehensive perspective of network conditions.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the project involves performing measurements and\r\nanalysis on the current Internet to better understand both the extent of\r\nnetwork operations problems today and the degree to which cooperation\r\nbetween users and operators can mitigate them.  Based on these findings,\r\nthe project will propose new approaches to network operations both for\r\nthe current Internet and for future networks.  This research leverages\r\nrecent advances in streaming data management, machine learning,\r\neconomics, and privacy and may inspire new work in these areas, as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
