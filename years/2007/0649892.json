 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the further development of CARS microscopy. CARS microscopy provides image contrast based on molecular vibrational frequencies, which are intrinsic to small molecules, such as lipids.  CARS microscopy does not require the addition of fluorophores. To image small molecules in cells, higher sensitivity is needed. Higher sensitivity is to be achieved by developing frequency modulated CARS to remove the non-resonant background and increase the sensitivity by one or two orders of magnitude so that small molecules can be probed and mapped as vibrational oscillators at concentrations of approximately 10-100 mM in vivo.\r\n\r\nCARS microscopy is a non-invasive technique for 3D imaging of living cells and tissues with chemical selectivity. The sensitivity of the CARS microscope will be increased 10- to 100-fold through the developments with this award.  The principal investigator runs annual CARS microscopy workshops to train new users from around the world.  This award is aimed at pushing the state-of-the-art of bioimaging with the ability to have a point-by-point chemical map in a living organism in noninvasive manner with no staining; and it will open exciting possibilities for biological research.",
