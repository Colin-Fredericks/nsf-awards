Various media-related groups (print, broadcast, electronic gaming, etc,) usually have professional conferences in isolation from each other with little sharing of information and research findings.  Despite the rapid blurring of boundaries between various media types in the marketplace, researchers and practitioners remain within traditional silos. This conference will bring together 80 media practitioners and researchers for a two-day national conference in order to consolidate and synthesize the research-based theories presented in a pre-conference publication.  A series of 3 post-web conferences will build on the momentum generated during the initial conference and generate broader participation within the science learning media community.  Rockman et al will evaluate the conference and post conference web community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Role of Media in Informal Science Learning, directed by the Institute for Learning Innovation in collaboration with Grunwald Associates, was designed to bring together a wide range of media specialists with informal science educators to explore how they might jointly provide greater public access to science learning.  The project had two key components:  an in-person conference of 30 experts from both fields, and a follow-up, online set of conversations and public interactions.  The conference, seeded by papers from six media and learning experts, focused on examining the most fruitful intersections between media and more place-based science learning institutions.  It also helped develop face-to-face relationships among the core group that would carry over into the ongoing virtual conversation.\n\n \n\nThe cornerstone of the project became the development of an online community that had three major elements:  a stand-along website (www.mediasciencelearning.com), a LinkedIn group, and a similar group on Facebook.  The two social media sites became the places for the most active conversations around the theories that would support collaboration.  The website provided the concrete examples of media-based projects that would support learning in many settings.  The stand-alone site took shape around a series of \"case studies\" &ndash; new, innovative, media-based initiatives, each of which had strong science content.  Visitors to the site were invited to explore the initiatives, which included games, mobile applications, videos and others, and add their comments and critiques.  A wiki on the site focused on best practices, based on the papers delivered at the conference.\n\n \n\nParticipation in the site has been remarkable.  More than 8,000 visitors, representing 84 countries, have explored the offerings and added numerous observations, sometimes as suggestions or improvements, other times as links, either to similar work underway or to other researchers with shared interests.  The site also served as a virtual \"campfire\" for the social media users to gather around and discuss.  Having both concrete examples and connections to current research greatly enriched the conversations.  In addition, engagement with the online community has been supported by a regular e-newsletter that has reached as many as 30,000 people.\n\n \n\nOne of the most important findings of the project has been an understanding of how best to keep a vital online conversation active and growing.  It has clearly required a combination of excellent content and day-to-day thoughtful management.  The latter required frequent moderation, the seeding of new cases and comments, and significant outreach.  The constellation of online offerings, including the social media sites, has also been effective.  LinkedIn and Facebook have been the leading referrals to the site.  Visitors, then, are rewarded with rich and compelling information.  Keeping the site fresh, adding a new case each week, has also been key to both attracting repeat visitors and maintaining a focus on generating new ideas.\n\n \n\nThe project has far surpassed the original expectations of its organizers, fueling new conversations, supporting new collaborations, and providing evidence of the impact of bringing curious and intelligent people into a well-managed forum.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2010\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Beverly K Sheppard"
