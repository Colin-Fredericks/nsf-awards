The intellectual merit of this project focuses on answering the questions \"How can GIS software be employed to best address the needs of teachers and students in secondary school STEM education?  How can community partners best use their resources to aid science-themed small schools in meeting national, state and local science standards?\"  Broader impacts include but are not limited to expansion of graduate fellows' skills, improvement of research skills of K-12 teachers, and improvement of 9-12 STEM education.\r\n",

The Fellows also gave high marks to the impact of professional development seminars on leadership, networking, developing credentials for professional success, learning negotiation skills, and making good use of mentors, as well as learning about new initiatives in the scholarship of teaching and learning.

The collaboration also yielded a rich set of active-learning curriculum materials based on using the Borough of Brooklyn and other locations in New York City as venues for research activities that supplemented the standard science classes taught in the high schools. These materials include research activities spanning topics in earth and environmental science, biology, chemistry, psychology, forensics, research design, research writing and presentation and professional development.
