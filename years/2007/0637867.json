 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will employ a staged pyrolysis and combustion process as a method to \"recycle\" mixed solid waste materials (paper and plastic packaging, and food scrap) from restaurants.  The hydrogen-rich fuel gases generated from these solid waste streams can then be burned to produce heat and power.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed technology can be used for most solid and liquid biomass waste oroducts and can be more easily adapted  to changes in feedstock composition than alternative approaches. An environmental benefit of the proposed work includes the substitution of waste materials for fossil fuels as a means for producing electricity.  Since a large portion of the waste material is paper and food scraps that are considered renewable sources, there will be no net contribution to carbon doioxide emissions except for any fossil fuel used in the manufacturing process.  The proposed technology would also help reduce large quantities of solid waste.\r\n",
