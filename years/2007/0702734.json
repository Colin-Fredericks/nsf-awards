 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Victor Zhdankin of the University of Minnesota-Duluth. This research will involve the continued study of the synthesis and chemistry of iodine and hypervalent iodine containing compounds. The goals include the development of new reagents for the use in organic synthesis, as well as for the production of materials containing iodine or hypervalent iodine. The long-term goals of this research are the improvement of basic knowledge of the structure and reactivity of hypervalent organic compounds, the creation of new reagents and synthetic procedures useful for organic chemistry, as well as the search for new products with useful properties.\r\n \r\nSince this institution is a RUI,  one of the main objectives of this research program is also to provide excellent training in modern research to the B.S. and M.S. students and to further strengthen undergraduate research at University of Minnesota Duluth. The participants in this program will receive excellent training in organic synthesis. All student participants will present their results at scientific meetings and university seminars, and will be involved in the preparation of manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals. This project will provoke and stimulate non-traditional thinking and advance an undergraduate researcher to the frontier of modern, fundamental chemistry.\r\n",
