 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Division of Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Alabama (UA) for the summers of 2007-2009.  John Vincent, the program director, will be assisted by co-PI, Stephen Woski.  Students will participate in well-defined interdisciplinary projects in environmental, materials, and biological chemistry, areas in which the UA Chemistry Department has significant strengths.   Students will be exposed to high-level research, provided access to advanced equipment, and experience the excitement of scientific discovery.  A rich program for student development, including bi-weekly research seminars and sessions exploring ethical issues pertinent to chemical research, will enhance the research activities.  Students will be recruited primarily from Southeastern undergraduate institutions with limited research facilities, with a particular emphasis on the participation of women and students from underrepresented groups. The recruitment process will build on relationships being developed between UA chemistry faculty and faculty at regional HBCUs.",
