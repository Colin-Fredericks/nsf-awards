The teams will conduct a biotic survey of North America by collecting tardigrades at the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. Student researchers will be trained to collect, identify, sequence, and report on tardigrades. Their results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and available over the internet on the Tardigrade Reference Center (TRC) at the Academy of Natural Sciences with keys, descriptions, images, DNA sequences, and distribution maps.  \r\n\r\nThe project will discover new species, expand the continental diversity, and link DNA sequences to voucher specimens, in order to ascertain species associations, distributional patterns, and genetic variation of the tardigrades.  The TRC will target scientists, educators and hobbyists who use the Internet to find data, facts, and teaching activities. The project models the collaboration between the undergraduate, research, and museum communities. It also fosters communication among specialists, and demonstrates the blending of morphological and molecular approaches to species identification.  The project will expose many students to scientific inquiry such that they will be prepared for careers in science, education, and government.\r\n",

The team collected more than 25,000 tardigrades from 2,500 samples from 500+ sites across the continent.  The team has expanded the known species diversity of seven states, extended the known distribution of more than a hundred species and described a new genus and four new species.  We pioneered the use of DNA as part of a species description and developed new SEM techniques.\n\nWe have fostered the development of undergraduate research at our institutions.

Student research has compared urban and rural tardigrades and looked into the impact of pH on distribution.  Students investigated an altitudinal transect in the California, tardigrades in the canopy of a Kansas tree, and found a new species of marine tardigrade in Florida. At the North Temperate LTER students found rare species and in Utah, a plesomorphic tardigrade genus was recovered.  In Alaska, students discovered and described a new species of a genus known only from the southern hemisphere; complicating the biogeography and the evolution of the phylum.\n\nWe developed two web sites. The first is our specimen management system at Fresno City College, which has more than 15,000 records. Many with multiple images and coded onto Google maps.
