 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybridization, introgression (movement of genes from one species into another\r\nvia hybridization), and polyploidization (chromosome doubling) are important\r\nphenomena in plant speciation and evolution. A well-resolved genealogical tree,\r\ndepicting the species relationships, is fundamental to understand these phenomena, but\r\ncan be extremely challenging to construct. This research has two aims. The first is to\r\ndevelop strategies for resolving such genealogical trees. The second is to use these\r\nmethods to untangle the evolutionary history of the Verbena complex, a group\r\ncharacterized by the prevalence of hybridization, introgression, and polyploidization. By\r\nthe comparing sequences of four independent DNA regions from the chloroplast and\r\nnuclear genomes, genealogical trees will be constructed to infer relationships. In\r\naddition, hundreds of transposable elements (SINEs and MITEs), genetic elements that\r\ncan move from one location to another on chromosomes, will be identified and used to\r\ntrace the evolutionary history of the organisms that host them.\r\n\r\nAnticipated outcomes include a well-resolved evolutionary tree of the Verbena\r\ncomplex, which will be incorporated into an updated taxonomic treatment in\r\ncollaboration with botanists at the Instituto Darwinion, Argentina. Using transposable\r\nelements to trace evolutionary histories is a novel application to plant evolutionary\r\nstudies and may have great impact on such studies. Results from this research will be\r\npresented at annual scientific meetings and submitted to peer-reviewed journals for\r\npublication.",
