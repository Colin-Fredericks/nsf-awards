 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every decision we make has consequences for the future. Whether that future is the next hour of work or planning to stay healthy for the next 30 years, all decisions have an impact on individuals' future experiences. Three experiments will examine effects of shifting focus to long-term information and test the hypothesis that staying mindful of an abstract goal can occur via manipulations that induce strong linkage between immediate small steps in the present to the abstract goal in the future. These hypotheses are tested in a number of domains, including cancer risk reduction through regular self-examination and healthier diet.\r\n\r\nOne experiment will examine differences in preferred thinking styles and whether situational factors can induce people to think about the long-term consequences when their preferred styles would otherwise limit such focus. A second study begins with the assumption that because focusing on a large goal can be intimidating, it may be necessary to focus instead on the simple daily steps that will eventually lead to completion of that goal. On the other hand, if those tasks are the sole focus, and are performed in isolation from the larger goal, the tasks may lose their motivating force and fail to be completed. To address this paradox a second experiment will examine if completion of small tasks can be used to increase abstract goal mindfulness. That is, the study will test whether it is possible to focus on both the long- and short-term goals at once. A final experiment will test the combined processes of both inducing a long-term focus, and creating mindfulness through linkages, examining the consequences of decision-making processes for the important health behavior of reducing cancer risk through diet.",
