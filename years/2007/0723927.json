 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Informatics Research Institute (IRI) at Idaho State University and Hampton University are engaging in faculty capacity building at Hampton University (an historically Black institution) and other colleges and universities nation-wide. IRI is working with faculty members in the Hampton University Department of Computer Science to conduct information assurance (IA) and computer security research. These newly acquired abilities are fostering IA and computer security research based on several interrelated IA models. Project workshops are enhancing the ability of the Hampton faculty to provide IA instruction and collaborate with the research on the learning effectiveness of the IA instructional modules. Hampton faculty members are acquiring additional knowledge of both the IA principles and the necessary tools of instructional systems design to develop curricular instructional modules that are being integrated throughout the computer science curriculum. IRI is providing direct support for the development of Hampton University's capacity as a CNSS certified information assurance training institution and the institution's effort to become a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAEIAE). Project activities include faculty development workshops, individual training, and laboratory and facilities development. The development workshops are open to faculty from other local and regional institutions and are particularly focused on attracting participants from other minority serving institutions.",
