 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCopolymerization metathesis polycondensation chemistry is being pursued to create refined, practical models of high-volume polymers such as low density polyethylene, metallocene polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride.  The objective of this aspect of the research is to better understand polymer structure and thus enhance the performance of the world's largest volume synthetic material (polyolefins).  The effort focuses on macromolecular synthesis discovery research, including fundamental exploration of polymer structure.\r\n\r\nIn addition, different metathesis polymerization strategies will be employed to synthesize a variety of complex polyolefin structures: core/shell nanoparticles using nonaqueous emulsion ADMET chemistry, thin film laminates via solid state metathesis chemistry, nanoblends using dual heterogeneous catalyst systems, precision ionomers/carboxylic acid polymers using tailored diene monomers, and peptide modified polyolefins using melt polymerization techniques. Each of these new materials represents opportunity for discovery; specific applications targeted for them include pro-drug delivery, tissue engineering, high strength ionomers, conductive polymer laminates, and materials offering enhanced gas transport.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe common theme for the proposed activity is to improve the behavior of a class of plastics known as polyolefins.  During the past 60 years plastics have become a major industry that affects everyone in society from providing better packaging to new textiles to cutting edge technologies found in sophisticated applications such as televisions, cars, computers, and medical devices.  In fact, plastics have become the most used synthetic material in the world.  This NSF supported research can lead to new plastic materials such as biosensors, lightweight conductors, high strength nanocomposites, even tailored pharmaceuticals.  The work will be conducted at the graduate research level in collaboration with major research facilities in the USA (at University of Pennsylvania, Florida State University) as well as the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Germany.\r\n\r\nFrom an educational perspective, the research will enhance the \"Florida Opportunity Scholars\" (ROS) program at the University of Florida. This program targets undergraduate students who are the first generation in their families to attend a university and is available when family income is less than $40,000.  The goal is to attract these talented yet disadvantaged students into the fields of science and engineering.\r\n",
