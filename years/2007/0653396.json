 "awd_abstract_narration": "This international collaboration brings together experimental and computational scientists from the U.S. (California Institute of Technology and California State University Fullerton) and Brazil (State University of Campinas and the  Federal Universities of Juiz de Fora and Paran\u00e1), who will apply their complementary capabilities to fundamental problems in low energy electron interactions with molecules. The area of focus is electron interactions with molecules of biological and technological significance. As part of the research, a novel method of accurately measuring the basic collision parameters will be applied. The project involves the investigation of elastic scattering of low-energy electrons, i.e., collisions in which the electrons scatter without losing any energy, as well as inelastic scattering, in which the electrons lose kinetic energy and in turn impart energy to the target molecule. Investigations of the production of negatively charged fragment ions by very low energy electrons that attach themselves to the molecule, causing it to break apart will also be carried out. Such technologically and biologically relevant molecules as methanol, ethanol, water, and the DNA bases will be the subjects of the research.  The research to be undertaken will enhance the understanding of electron transport and electron-driven chemistry in biosystems and will aid in understanding electron-initiated reactions, such as spark or plasma ignition, in alcohol-fueled engines.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project has a strong pedagogical component. Undergraduate students from California State University Fullerton will spend 8-week periods conducting theoretical or experimental research at one of the collaborating Brazilian institutions.  Participation in the project will thus enhance both students' hands-on experience in experimental physics research and their understanding of the multicultural, international environment of modern science.\r\n\r\n",
