 "awd_abstract_narration": "Initial data for the Einstein field equations are specified by solutions to the Einstein constraint equations.  The P.I.'s project fits into a broad program to understand the space of solutions to the constraint equations, often with specified asymptotics.  The P.I. has developed local deformation and asymptotic gluing techniques that have proven fruitful, both for understanding the asymptotic structure of solutions of the constraints, and for performing localized gluing constructions on solutions to the constraints.  For example, joint work of the P.I. with R. Schoen showed that solutions to the vacuum constraints which have exactly Kerr asymptotics are dense in the space of asymptotically flat solutions.  Part of the project involves studying the extension of the asymptotic results to the asymptotically hyperbolic setting, which would have application to the Positive Mass Theorem in this case (following recent work of Andersson-Cai-Galloway).  Results on both asymptotics and localized gluing constructions will be extended to the case of gravity coupled with matter fields.  Related aspects of the project include: the study of small-data solutions of the constraints (relating to, for example, the Penrose compactification); local deformation properties of the constraints in conjunction with quasi-local mass minimizers, in the sense of Bartnik; the existence of horizons and isoperimetric profiles in asymptotically flat spaces; some problems in Lorentzian comparison geometry.  \r\n\r\nA more thorough understanding of the space of solutions of the Einstein constraint equations would lead naturally to a better understanding of the space of solutions to Einstein's field equations, which are commonly used to model the large-scale structure of the universe.  To understand the dynamics of gravitational systems, one might construct initial data with desired properties, like multiple horizons, or specified asymptotic structure, and then use such data for numerical modeling of the evolution into the resulting space-times.  Natural physical questions often become interesting geometric and analytical problems involving the relevant partial differential equations and geometric quantities.  A key component of the project is to introduce and attract undergraduates to this wonderful interplay of physics and geometric analysis, through course work, independent study and research.  Students will undertake research with the PI during the summer (occurring simultaneously with Lafayette's REU program, thus, enabling a broader discussion and sharing of results) and during the year as independent study and honors theses work.\r\n",
