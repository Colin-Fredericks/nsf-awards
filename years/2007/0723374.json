 "awd_abstract_narration": "The annual IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, has become the premier annual conference in robotics and automation worldwide, and has served as a forum gathering international researchers together for the exchange of ideas on technical problems and their solutions. This proposal requests group travel funds from the NSF to assist approximately 40 US graduate students and junior faculty, in the form of partial airfare reimbursement, to participate in the 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, which will be held in Rome, Italy, April 10-14, 2007.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Group Travel Grant Proposal is two-fold:\r\n. To assist U.S. participation in this key international conference, and\r\n. To help U.S. researchers who could not otherwise attend the Conference.\r\n\r\nA three member Selection Committee will be formed to select applicants according to a set of criteria such as applicant's technical area of interest, the expected impact of the conference participation on the applicant's professional development, the opportunities for planned visits, talks, interactions before, during, and/or after the Conference by the applicant, and the additional funding that the applicant may have available for traveling.\r\n\r\n",
