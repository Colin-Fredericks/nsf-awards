The investigator undertakes the following\r\nspecific projects:\r\n -Heteroepitaxial thin films.  The investigator studies from the\r\nvariational point of view a mathematical model for the epitaxial\r\ndeposition of a film onto a relatively thick substrate in the\r\ncase of a mismatch between the lattice parameters of the two\r\ncrystalline solids. \r\n -Strain gradient plasticity.  The investigator derives, in a\r\nmathematically rigorous way, a strain gradient theory of\r\nplasticity starting from a variational formulation of the\r\nequilibrium problem for a finite number of dislocations in a\r\nplane domain. \r\n -Water waves.  An alternative approach for the existence of\r\nregular water waves and of Stokes wave of greatest height is\r\nundertaken. \r\nOther projects include image segmentation problems and\r\nmicromagnetics. \r\n\r\n     The central theme of this project is the application of\r\nmodern techniques in mathematics to various problems in materials\r\nscience, mechanics, and hydrodynamics.  When a thin film of a\r\ncrystalline solid is deposited on a substrate, a common\r\nindustrial process, difficulties can arise if the crystal lattice\r\nstructures of the film and the substrate do not match.  The\r\ninvestigator studies this problem.  A fundamental question in\r\nmaterials is the effect of dislocations in the material\r\nmicrostructure on larger-scale behavior.  Classical plasticity\r\ntheory does not address this issue well.  The investigator\r\ndevelops a theory of strain gradient plasticity that incorporates\r\ndislocations and their interactions.  He also considers problems\r\nin water waves, image processing, and micromagnetics.  The\r\nresults and methods developed in the project will be incorporated\r\nin new graduate courses, and some will be included in a series of\r\nbooks that the investigator is writing in collaboration with I.\r\nFonseca,",
