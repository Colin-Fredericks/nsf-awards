Goodwillie\r\n\r\nAll of the proposed research is connected with the calculus of\r\nfunctors in its various forms. First, the main results of\r\nhomotopy calculus will be extended to a natural and high degree\r\nof generality.  Geometric language will be used to develop the\r\nanalogy with ordinary differential calculus, so that a suitable\r\nhomotopical category gets something like tangent and cotangent\r\nspaces, spaces of tensor fields, connections, differential\r\noperators, and so on. The language should be useful both for\r\nclarifying the ideas and for suggesting new directions. Second,\r\nthe derivative of algebraic K-theory will be investigated in a\r\ngeneral setting. Third, the part of manifold theory which in some\r\nsense comes next after stable pseudoisotopy (it could be called\r\nmetastable pseudoisotopy) will be explored from the calculus\r\nviewpoint. Its derivatives will be studied by methods analogous\r\nto the Hochschild and cyclic homology methods that were relevant\r\nto the stable theory; where loops in a manifold were involved,\r\nnow there should be maps of rank two graphs into the manifold. In\r\naddition to working out the metastable analogue of cyclic\r\nhomology, there is the more fundamental question of seeking to\r\nunderstand the metastable phenomena in non-manifold terms as\r\nWaldhausen K-theory does for the stable theory, and calculus may\r\nhold clues to this. There is a sequence: (0) homotopy theory,\r\nwhere calculus leads to trees, (1) algebraic K-theory, where\r\ncalculus leads to circles, and (2) metastable theory, where\r\ncalculus leads to rank two graphs. One thing to be worked out is\r\nthe relevant kinds of interactions between all these kinds of\r\ngraphs in a manifold.\r\n\r\nFunctor calculus involves extremes of abstraction, but it has\r\ndown-to-earth roots. It is an organizing principle named for\r\nresemblance to the ordinary calculus of Newton and\r\nLeibniz. Sometimes a fact about numbers is best proved by placing\r\nit in a context where the number is part of a huge family of\r\nnumbers -- a numerical function. Properties of the function can\r\nlead, by general theorems of calculus that at first seem like\r\nmagic, to a computation of the number. The story here is similar:\r\nsometimes a fact about some mathematical entity -- not a number\r\nnow, but perhaps a geometric object of some kind -- is best\r\nproved by placing it in a context where the object is part of a\r\nhuge family of such objects -- a functor -- and using some magic\r\nof more recent vintage. One area of application of functor\r\ncalculus is manifold topology. Another is homotopy theory. A\r\nmanifold is a kind of mathematical system involving many\r\nvariables. These are ubiquitous in science and\r\nmathematics. Manifold topology studies such systems for their own\r\nsake, treating them as geometric objects; an N-variable system is\r\nviewed as an N-dimensional object. Homotopy theory studies\r\nmanifolds and other objects from a point of view in which a great\r\ndeal of information is ignored, leaving only the coarsest\r\nfeatures to consider. This change in viewpoint is a powerful\r\nidea, because this process of distillation leads to conceptual\r\nclarity and new methods.  Besides being a key tool in the study\r\nof manifolds, homotopy theory is a branch of topology in its own\r\nright. Thus geometry grows, surprisingly and naturally, as the\r\nyears go by. In functor calculus it becomes possible in a sense\r\nto view all of homotopy theory as a geometric object.\r\n",
