 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to study knot and link concordance using tools from\r\nHeegaard Floer homology, a powerful set of techniques in low dimensional\r\ntopology introduced in 2000 by Ozsv\u00e1th and Szab\u00f3. In its short lifespan,\r\nHeegaard Floer homology has already been used to solve numerous problems in\r\ntopology, many of which had resisted mathematicians' efforts for decades.\r\nSpecifically, it has provided new insight into knot theoretic questions\r\nrelated to the Seifert genus, fibered knots, Legendrian and transversal\r\nknots, the 4-ball genus of knots and the smooth concordance order. Knot\r\nconcordance, introduced by Fox and Milnor in the 1960s, spans the whole\r\nspectrum (of dimensions) of low dimensional topology: concordance studies\r\nknots, 1-dimensional objects in 3-dimensional spaces, up to an equivalence\r\nrelation (concordance) which is defined using surfaces and 4-dimensional\r\nmanifolds. Despite many efforts, very little is known about the structure of\r\nthe concordance group.  This project will apply tools from Heegaard Floer\r\ntheory to a number of aspects of knot concordance.  We will study smooth\r\nconcordance of topologically slice knots, concordance of two-component\r\nlinks, torsion in the knot concordance group.   We will also generalize the\r\ncurrent Heegaard Floer techniques by utilizing higher fold branched covers.\r\n\r\nTopology is the study of abstract spaces, called manifolds, of various\r\ndimensions. Low dimensional topology focuses on spaces of dimensions up to\r\nfour. Knot theory is the study of knottings of loops in 3-dimensional\r\nspace.  With a long history reaching back to the 19th century, it is\r\nfundamental to many areas of mathematics and physics, and also has\r\napplications in biology and chemistry. Knot concordance encompasses the\r\nstudy of a series of questions about knots and surfaces bounded by knots.\r\nHeegaard Floer techniques grew out of a synergistic interaction between\r\nmathematics and physics, specifically gauge theories from quantum physics.\r\nResearch in the last 30 years has shown that low dimensional topology is in\r\nmany ways more mysterious than topology in higher dimensions. The study of\r\nknot concordance reflects much of this complexity inherent in low\r\ndimensions, and advances in our understanding of concordance are likely to\r\nhave far-reaching impact in topology.",
