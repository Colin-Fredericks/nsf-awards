 "awd_abstract_narration": "Life Science Biological (61) The Biology Curriculum Enhancement Project (BioCEPT) is improving student success by building the capacity of faculty to implement course and laboratory enhancements and to assess the impact of innovative instructional technology. The Lifelines OnLine and the BioQuest Curriculum Consortium approaches are being implemented in the core biology course, General Principles of Biology. Comprehensive evaluation of BioCEPT is fostering a climate of evidence, while contributing to science education scholarship with plans for both local and broad dissemination.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project builds upon an existing community established by previous funding for a regional Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (CETP). The proposed activities incorporate established models and practices known to advance teaching and learning in undergraduate science. The BioCEPT project adapts those models to a community college context where the initiatives are expected to engage diverse and multicultural student communities in ways that genuinely support deeper learning to improve student success.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: A longitudinal study of the students' persistence in science is being conducted by the community college faculty with external expertise from faculty of the regional San Francisco Bay Area CETP network to form a community for evaluation and dissemination beyond the local community college.",
