 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for a 5-day workshop to be held in June 2007 at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado.  The workshop focuses on constructing numerical models of crustal deformation that address a variety of geophysical challenges including: constraining the rheological behavior of faults and the surrounding crust and upper mantle, determining the ability of geodetic data to constrain fault loading rates, and developing a link between processing occurring on time scales of the seismic cycle (seconds to 100s of years) and those associated with longer term geologic evolution of the lithosphere (105 to 106 years). This workshop builds on the success of several previous workshops on the same topic.  These workshops attract a large contingent of graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty with a strong representation of women scientists.  Beyond the specific geophysical challenges, this workshop also provides a venue for building consensus on key directions to be taken in communal software building project.",
