 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, New Undergraduate Engineering Minor in Nanotechnology Risk Assessment and Public Policy, at the Johns Hopkins University, under the direction of Dr. Justin Hanes, will create a new undergraduate minor entitled, Nanotechnology Risk Assessment and Public Policy.  The minor will represent a collaboration between multiple departments in the Whiting School of Engineering, the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics.  The minor represents an interdisciplinary approach to the training of undergraduate students in the basics of nanotechnology risk assessment (including both the environment/ecosystem and human health), legal and ethical issues, and public policy implications.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal for this awrad was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering Program Solicitation (NSF 07-554) and is being co-funded by the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG).",
