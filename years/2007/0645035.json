 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of uncertainty analysis and stochastic modeling\r\nhas received increasing amount of attention in recent years,\r\nespecially from the Computational Mathematics society.\r\nExtensive research efforts have been devoted to uncertainty\r\nquantification and stochastic computations, and novel numerical \r\nmethods have been developed to efficiently deal with large and \r\ncomplex systems with uncertainty. Although these methods have been \r\ndemonstrated to be highly effective in predicting the behavior of \r\ncomplex stochastic systems, the design industry has not taken full \r\nadvantage of these developments, and the design procedures in many \r\ndisciplines remain almost exclusively deterministic. The research \r\nobjective of this proposal is to develop new mathematical and \r\nnumerical methods for multidisciplinary design problems with \r\nuncertain inputs, with an emphasis on the efficiency and accuracy\r\nof the new methods so that they are applicable to large-scale, \r\nrealistic engineering applications. This objective will be attained \r\nthrough three major efforts: (1) employing rigorous mathematical \r\ntheory to form a unified framework that allows one to conduct \r\nsystematical analysis and error estimates; (2) employing the \r\nstate-of-the-art stochastic algorithms to construct a set of high \r\nperformance design algorithms for two major classes of \r\nuncertainty-based design: robust design and reliability design;\r\nand (3) extending the new methods to large-scale complex systems\r\nand developing fast and parallel solvers.\r\n\r\nQuantifying uncertainty is of paramount importance in almost all \r\naspects of science and engineering. It is of particular significance \r\nin modern-day strategic planning and risk management where decisions \r\nare made in a constantly changing landscape with many unknown \r\nfactors. Examples such as epidemic control, aircraft optimization \r\nunder extreme conditions, optimal response following natural \r\ndisasters, etc, are abundant. Such problems are essentially design \r\nand optimization in a complex and multidisciplinary environment, \r\nwith substantial uncertainty interacting in a highly nonlinear fashion \r\nin the systems and parameters. While simulation based design tools \r\ncontinue to be advanced at rapid rates, little attention has been \r\npaid to incorporation of state-of-the-art mathematical techniques \r\nin stochastic analysis and uncertainty quantification. The traditional \r\napproaches, e.g., those by using safety factors to accommodate \r\nuncertainty in a gross manner, are becoming increasingly obsolete and \r\noften result in overly conservative decisions. This project is valuable \r\nfor its multi-disciplinary influence, its fundamental contribution to \r\nuncertainty-based design problems, and more importantly, its high \r\nperformance stochastic design algorithms the provide better and sharper \r\nanalysis for decision makers. The project will unite a collection of \r\nuncertainty-based design techniques scattered over various engineering \r\napplications with the cutting-edge stochastic computation framework.\r\nIt is a true synergy of Computational Mathematics tools and practical\r\ndemands, and can be extended to a large class of design and optimization\r\nproblems.\r\n",
