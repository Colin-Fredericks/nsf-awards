 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate, c-di-GMP, identified in the 1980s as an allosteric activator of the bacterial cellulose synthase, has emerged in the last few years as a ubiquitous second messenger in Bacteria. C-di-GMP affects exopolysaccharide synthesis, biofilm formation and structure, flagella- and pili-based motility as well as gene expression. This makes c-di-GMP an important regulator of the transition from the motile, single-cellular lifestyle to a sessile, multicellular (biofilm) lifestyle. In addition, c-di-GMP affects symbiotic and parasitic interactions of bacteria with animals and plants. Considering the scope of its effects on bacterial physiology and behavior, c-di-GMP appears to be at least as important as the better-known cyclic nucleotide second messenger, cAMP. Therefore, understanding how c-di-GMP operates is of fundamental importance in bacteriology. However, with the exception of bacterial cellulose synthases, the identities of c-di-GMP receptors, end-targets and mechanisms of action remain essentially unknown. The objective of this project is to elucidate molecular mechanisms through which c-di-GMP operates, using bacterium Escherichia coli as a model. To achieve this objective the PI's lab will identify and characterize c-di-GMP receptors and end-targets in this bacterium. The PI also intends to uncover mechanisms by which c-di-GMP affects gene expression in E. coli. These advances will ultimately result in the comprehensive picture of c-di-GMP-mediated signal transduction in a model organism.  Society in general may benefit significantly from this project because the knowledge obtained here will provide important insights into bacterial physiology and behavior, which will allow manipulation of various bacteria of medical, agricultural, and biotechnological significance. This project will provide interdisciplinary training opportunites (in bioinformatics, bacterial genetics, protein-ligand biochemistry, physiology, transcriptomics and proteomics) to the graduate student(s) and postdoctoral fellow(s) involved. Research experiences will be provided to undergraduate students and to minority high school students enrolled in the Summer Research Apprenticeship Program. A key microarray experiment will be carried out by undergraduate students enrolled in the lab course taught by the PI and will be supervised primarily  by a highly qualified postdoctoral fellow supported by this project. This will allow students to address a real-life research problem using modern (and expensive) approaches, which otherwise would be inaccessible to them. The graduate student(s) and postdoctoral fellow(s) involved in this project will give lectures on c-di-GMP in the Microbial Physiology and Metabolism course taught by PI. Results of this project will be presented at scientific meetings and articles will be published in peer-reviewed journal(s).",

C-di-GMP is synthesized and degraded by bacteria in response to various environmental factors. C-di-GMP controls flagellar motility, production of exopolysaccarides and adhesive proteins, the processes that are important for establishing infections by many pathogens, for contaminating food and food-processing equipment as well as for symbiotic relationships between bacteria and plants. At present, the mechanisms through which c-di-GMP operates are poorly understood. Gaining understanding of these mechanisms may help us control bacterial behavior in diverse medical and environmental settings. This project shed light onto several mechanisms of c-di-GMP-dependent signaling and thus improved our ability to manipulate bacterial behavior. First, we uncovered a new mechanism through which c-di-GMP controls transition from the motile state to the surface-attached state in enteric bacteria, e.g. Escherichia coli. When intracellular c-di-GMP levels increase, one of the c-di-GMP receptors changes how bacterial flagella rotate, and this change promotes bacterial attachment to surfaces. Second, together with our collaborators from Germany (I. Schlichting, Max Plack Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg), we characterized how an enzyme involved in c-di-GMP degradation (EAL domain phosphodiesterase) works. We obtained the first crystal structure of such an enzyme and characterized its catalytic mechanism. This knowledge will help us controlling bacterial lifestyle decisions by modulating c-di-GMP levels. Third, together with the collaborators from Ireland (J. O&lsquo;Gara, University College Dublin), France (A. Darfeuille-Michaud, University of Clermond-1) and Sweden (U. Romling, Karolinska Institute), we derived new mechanistic insights of regulation of motility and surface-attached growth in several bacterial species. These insights are expected to ultimately improve our ability to control or prevent important bacterial infections (caused by Staph, Salmonella and E. coli).</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project allowed us to train several postdoctoral and graduate students in the interdisciplinary environment (involving bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry, microbial physiology).
