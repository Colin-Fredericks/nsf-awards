 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposes a longitudinal study that investigates the development of an understanding of measurement across 7 grades-from pre-K through Grade 5.  Specifically, the project will establish clear cognitive accounts of the development of students' strategic and conceptual knowledge of measurement on increasingly demanding sets of length, perimeter, and area measurement tasks.  The research questions are:\r\nHow do students develop coherent knowledge and integrated strategies for measurement across the developmental span from pre-K though Grade 5?\r\nHow are students' developing cognitive abilities for perceptual and numerical comparison, for coordinating and discriminating, for deductive logic, and for ordering and nesting sequences related to the development of knowledge and strategies for measurement?\r\nHow are students' developing abilities for spatial thinking, algebraic reasoning, or proportional reasoning related to their measurement knowledge and strategies?\r\nHow might students' developing representational fluency for measurement relate to their mathematical and scientific understanding of measurement?\r\nHow is the development of students' developing knowledge of measurement (especially their use of rulers and other tools, with accuracy and precision) related to the development of their scientific modeling and reasoning across varying contexts?\r\n\r\nTwo longitudinal studies will be conducted at two different sites:  a New York site will address the early development of children's understanding and strategies, while an Illinois site will focus on later elementary level development.  The researchers propose design cycles with clinical interviews, written interviews, and classroom teaching experiments.  \r\n",
