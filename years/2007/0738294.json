 "awd_abstract_narration": "Latika Menon\r\n\r\nThe objective of this SGER is to develop an advanced nanodevice for recording electrical activity in neurons. The device will consist of an array of conducting nanowire arrays which will record electrical signals from neurons at the nanoscale level. This will provide a fundamental understanding of learning and memory processes in neurons and will lead to important clinical applications in neural implants and future brain machine interface devices. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis SGER has many features that will be very useful for learning about recording electrical activity in neurons. This will be the first demonstration of a nanowire-array based device which will allow recording of electrical activity from simultaneous locations in a single neuron thus leading to high spatial resolution. In addition, nanowires will cause minimal damage to the cell due to their small size with respect to the neuron (typically of the order of several microns). This research will provide an excellent integration of nano/microfabrication with biology, laying the groundwork for other novel devices in the future using similar principles. Use of nanowire-arrays for electrical recording from neurons is clearly a novel approach  opening a number of possibilities for studying neuronal activity at the nanoscale level. The nanowire-neuron device proposed here will be a model system to study biophysical interactions between nanowires and cells.  Nanowires provide the platform for functionalization with appropriate biorecognition molecules, ensuring cell immobilization and a more stable 'cell-attached' electrical recording. \r\n\r\nBroad Impact: Due to the small size of the nanowires with respect to the neuron sizes our device will allow a fundamental understanding of neuronal functions which will impact our understanding of changes in neural circuits that underlie neurological disorders and stroke. A more direct impact of our work will be related to a fundamental understanding of cell interaction with nano-environment which will relate not only to neurons but also to other cells such as cancer cells, stem cells, etc. In the area of education, one graduate student will be involved in the work and the project will lead to development of new laboratory facilities, particularly those pertaining to cell culture and cell characterization. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
