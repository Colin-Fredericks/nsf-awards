A common problem in\r\napplications is data fusion, the combination of data representing\r\ndifferent aspects of the same item.  For example, in attempting\r\nto sharpen a picture, treating the foreground and background\r\nseparately may produce a better overall image.  The investigator\r\nstudies frame-theoretical formulations for data fusion,\r\nemphasizing applications in multi-spectral image fusion and\r\nrelated mathematical and computational issues.  He also studies\r\nfused parallel sparse representation using fusion frames,\r\nexamining issues of optimality and expected computational\r\nefficiency.  Fusion frames are an extension of frames to deal\r\nwith a set of overlapping subspaces; the aim is to fuse together\r\ninformation from overlapping subspaces into the composite total\r\nspace.  Fused sparse representation involves ways to obtain\r\nsparse representations of a signal in (overlapping) subspaces in\r\na parallel fashion followed by a fusion operation.  The\r\ninvestigator also studies pseudoframe duals of B-spline Riesz\r\nsequences having either minimum support or both minimum support\r\nand maximum approximation order.  Limiting behavior of the small\r\nsupport of pseudoframe duals is considered.  Here pseudoframe\r\nduals arise from a notion of pseudoframes for subspaces (PFFS). \r\nPFFSs are frame-like systems for the linear analysis and\r\nsynthesis of a subspace.  They differ from frames in that both\r\nanalysis and synthesis sequences are not necessarily contained in\r\nthe subspace. \r\n\r\n     Signal processing generally refers to making the signal easy\r\nto handle or of better quality.  It is everywhere seen in our\r\nmodern society.  In this project, the principal novelties\r\nintroduced to signal processing are a new frame-theoretical\r\napproach to data fusion applications and ideas of performing data\r\ncompression using a notion of fusion frames.  Data fusion\r\ncombines data sampled in different ways or represnting different\r\naspects of an item in order to obtain a better representation of\r\nthe item.  The investigator aims at developing methods of\r\ncombining images obtained in different type of cameras (such as\r\ninfrared and conventional) into one single image with all\r\ninformation presented.  In particular, he works to provide a\r\ncombined image of much greater precision without ad-hoc\r\nprocedures of conventional techniques.  Advances here are\r\nimportant for such areas of information technology as commercial\r\nimaging, geographic surveys, geographic survey, mapping, and\r\nsensor array data processing.  Similarly, the investigator\r\ndevelops tools to improve the efficiency of data compression by\r\nreducing a costly compression task into a set of parallel smaller\r\ntasks followed by a precise combination mechanism governed by the\r\ntheory of fusion frames.  More generally, the methods can\r\nincrease the speed of information transmission in a broad range\r\nof communication and signal processing environments. \r\n",
