 "awd_abstract_narration": "0736045\r\n\r\nThis exploratory project is to prototype the development of a Community Environment for Advanced Oceanic Modeling (CEAOM). An environment is a framework of protocols, software,  documentation, resources and experience that facilitates i) the assessment of ocean models and techniques; ii) the interchange of concepts, capabilities and software (parameterizations, numerical algorithms, forcing, etc.); iii) test beds for the exploration of different modeling approaches; iv) estimates of uncertainties by ensembles of ocean models; v) easier access to \"best practice\" ocean models; vi) maintenance and continued development of ocean models. For these reasons, a Community Environment benefits both ocean model developers and ocean model users, as well as Earth System science as a whole. This project will examine and prototype certain aspects of such a broader environment.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe work proposed focuses on developing methods and establishing strategies for collaboration on ocean model development with biogeochemistry. The essential goals are to devise protocols to facilitate model interoperability (e.g. grid formats, forcing and initial condition specification); examine experimental design for comparison of models within the environment; examine the module/subroutine interfaces and protocols for adding bio-geochemical modules; explore the interoperability and inter-comparison of models for bio-geochemical studies; test the method using a proto-biology (simple NP) model in significantly idealized physics configurations; understand the impact of physical parameterizations on the bio-geochemical systems; propose a framework to compare and evaluate models in realistic global scale configuration.\r\n\r\nThe specific inter-comparisons will address significant outstanding questions: What is the source of the differences between the CLIVAR-sponsored global \"Common Ocean Reference Experiment\" (CORE) ocean climate simulations? What effects do the representation of the physical ocean circulation and processes have on the portrayal of bio-geochemical processes in ocean models? The results will be highly informative and relevant for societally important questions. Moreover, the proposed activities are clearly the correct initial steps for organizing the community for the subsequent development of the graceful, flexible and reliable Community Environment for Advanced Oceanic Modeling, which would meet clear needs for so many critical areas.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe proposed work is a preliminary step toward the development of a community-based Ocean Modeling Environment. The need for such an environment has been repeatedly emphasized in high profile nationwide planning documents. In the long-run, this environment is likely to provide the essential ocean modeling tools to address well-documented national needs in such areas as ecosystem-based resource management, public health (e.g. harmful algal blooms), marine transportation, national defense, and regional and global climate and ocean weather forecasts. At the same time, it will speed our understanding of the ocean system by improving the modeling tools available to academic researchers. Additionally, this approach will greatly accelerate the improvement of these tools themselves by facilitating more direct collaboration between developers and exchange of techniques. In short, this project stands a high likelihood of leading ultimately to significant improvements in our ability to model the ocean, while at the same time streamlining the human efforts required to use and utilize ocean models.\r\n\r\n",
