 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine how a part of the brain, called the prefrontal cortex, is\r\ninvolved in controlling behavior. The prefrontal cortex controls behavior much\r\nlike a business executive controls a company. \"Top-down\" control signals are\r\nsent from the prefrontal cortex to lower brain areas, such as the motor cortex, to\r\ncontrol when animals respond to external stimuli. These signals might convey\r\ninformation to the motor cortex about the expected timing of stimuli or might\r\nsimply control the timing of motor action by sending a \"go\" signal to the motor\r\ncortex. To investigate this issue, recordings of neural activity will be made in\r\nthe prefrontal and motor cortices as animals learn to time stimuli in a behavioral\r\ntask. Anatomical methods will be used to determine if conversations between the\r\nprefrontal and motor cortices occur through a special part of the motor cortex,\r\ncalled the premotor cortex.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This project will be one of the first to examine interactions between\r\nneurons in prefrontal and motor areas of the cerebral cortex by recording\r\nin the two areas simultaneously. This project is also unique in that interactions\r\nthese areas are studied during learning. Finally, the project will be the first to resolve\r\nif the rodent premotor cortex receives information from the prefrontal cortex\r\nand thus might provide the first evidence that rodents have a cortical area that is\r\nanalogous to the premotor cortex of higher animals, including human beings.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: All experimental protocols and procedures will be made available\r\nto the neuroscience community and the general public. A novel Linux distribution\r\nwill be developed that contains programs needed to reproduce this research.\r\nUndergraduate students will support these efforts. Students in Yale's\r\nSummer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program will take part in\r\nthe project and will be supervised by graduate students working in the PI's lab,\r\nwho will acquire training that goes beyond normal graduate student research activities.\r\nIn addition, the PI has initiated a neuroscience program for young children\r\nthrough a local public library and is taking part in the Neuroscientist-Teacher\r\nPartner Program of the Society for Neuroscience. All materials from the library\r\nprogram and the PI's interactions with local teachers will be made available at\r\nhttp://spikelab.jbpierce.org.",
