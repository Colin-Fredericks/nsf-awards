 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding what determines how fast and why organisms age is a fundamental question of interest to many biologists.  This research will address the question of how age and behavior interact to determine senescence, the deterioration of physiological performance, and longevity.  The PIs will test major models of aging theory by experimentally manipulating the onset, intensity and duration of a metabolically-expensive natural behavior (foraging) in a free-living organism (honey bees) whose social complexity rivals our own.  The oxidative-stress theory predicts that early onset, high intensity and/or long duration foraging effort will accelerate senescence and decrease longevity, and that late onset, low intensity and/or short duration foraging should have the opposite effects.  This research takes advantage of the experimental tractability of the honey bee model system and integrates molecular, genetic, physiological, and behavioral perspectives to advance the understanding of factors that limit lifespan. \r\n\r\nThis project will promote teaching, training, learning and the participation of underrepresented groups.  This project will include a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, a technician and several undergraduates, many of whom are members of underrepresented groups and currently working in the laboratories of the PI and co-PI.  The findings and perspectives of this research will be integrated into the diverse array of university courses, K-12 presentations and outreach opportunities for the general public that are routinely offered by the PI and co-PI. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
