 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMR-0738331       Peidong Yang          University of California at Berkeley\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) has chosen Peidong Yang, a chemist at the University of California, Berkeley, to receive the 2007 Alan T. Waterman Award (DMR-0738331). A materials chemist and nanotechnology expert, Yang has pioneered research on nanowires that show promise for a range of high-technology devices, from tiny lasers and computer circuits to inexpensive solar panels and biological sensors. The annual Waterman award recognizes an outstanding young researcher in any field of science or engineering supported by NSF. Candidates may not be more than 35 years old, or 7 years beyond receiving a doctorate and must stand out for their individual achievements. In addition to a medal, the awardee receives a grant of $500,000 over a 3-year period for scientific research or advanced study in their field.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis project aims to advance nanowire based science and technology. It includes addressing the bio-nano interface, and developing nanowire based optical nanoprobes that can deliver and extract an optical signal in a highly localized fashion to probe individual cells. The aim is to use these nanoprobes to deliver genes and proteins into cells, to extract chemicals from cells, to deliver light and extract optical signals from within the cells with high spatial resolution, and finally to establish the capability of electrically stimulating individual cells. Electrical stimulation will be used to examine the feasibility of guiding stem cell differentiation in a non-invasive manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThis research project includes elements of materials synthesis and characterization, surface chemistry, device fabrication, and biological sample processing. The project will provide core training in these areas for graduate students and undergraduates. The students will utilize state-of-the-art micro- and nanofabrication, materials synthesis, structural, optical and electrical characterization infrastructure available in the Professor Yang''s laboratory and throughout the Berkeley campus. These students in particular will benefit from the interdisciplinary nature of the research project. The multidisciplinary research will include a strong educational component that will have a broad impact on undergraduate and graduate students. It not only will introduce students with different backgrounds and interests to the technologically vibrant field of the bio-nano interface, but it also will provide experimental and analytical skills needed for these graduate and undergraduate students to build strong future careers in nanoscience and engineering. The nanowire based science and technology developed in this research project will have a significant impact in many different technology areas ranging from solid state lighting, integrated photonics, and energy conversion, to biochemical sensing, imaging and spectroscopy.",
