 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nFaculty members at Oakland University are introducing problem-based learning (PBL) in the Microprocessor-Based Systems Design course required in the Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering undergraduate programs. Previous studies have shown that the PBL method significantly improves important skills such as evaluating and using appropriate learning resources; analyzing and solving open-ended, real-world problems; working cooperatively in teams; and communicating effectively. \r\n\r\nThe newly structured design course is replacing the lecture component with a mixed PBL and lecture-based method of instruction. This mixed approach of instruction has been successfully used in other disciplines; examples include the Engineering Measurement course in Mechanical Engineering at the North Dakota State University (NSF DUE Award #0126671) and the Honors General Chemistry courses at the University of Delaware. In the second half of the semester, students are being engaged through four PBL modules. A set of measurable outcomes has been identified and an evaluation criterion is being developed to assess the impact of the PBL method in the course.\r\n\r\n",
