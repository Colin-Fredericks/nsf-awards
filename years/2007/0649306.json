 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports this renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Montana for the summers of 2007-2009. Garon Smith and Earle Adams direct this site, which focuses on environmental chemistry and the formation of science policy.  Faculty members from Chemistry, Biology, Geology, and the Center for Environmental Health Sciences will mentor eight students over an eight-week period. Research projects include the training of honeybees to detect explosives, studies of the toxic emissions from forest fires, and the development of new approaches for the removal of toxic metals from the environment. Participants and their mentors begin with a three-day course on the ethical conduct of research.  Throughout the program, students will experience how environmental research is incorporated into public policy by taking part in meetings and public hearings of the local health, air quality, and water quality boards.  An enriching dimension of the program has Native American student participants bringing their tribal college science faculty to the University of Montana as research partners.",
