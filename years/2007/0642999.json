Siegal\r\nIOB-0642999\r\nCAREER:\tPhenotypic Robustness and Diversity: Integrating Theory and Experiment in Genomics Research and Teaching\r\n\r\nLiving things develop and function reliably, despite experiencing a range of environmental conditions, and despite genetic differences caused by mutations. Understanding how organisms achieve this robustness is an important goal of modern biology. A key related goal is to understand how robustness affects evolution. The central aim of the PI's project is to identify genes that buffer environmental and genetic variation, and that might therefore affect how novel traits evolve. This project builds on the PI's previous work using computer simulations, which led to the prediction that a large number of such genes would exist. The project takes advantage of a comprehensive collection of single-gene mutants in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as a method for measuring physical traits of individual yeast cells using fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis. Analysis of data from 4700 mutant strains will identify genes whose impairment causes greater physical variation. Such genes are inferred to contribute to robustness. In a complementary experiment, the PI will analyze physical variation in progeny from a cross between laboratory and wild yeast. This will permit identification of genes that modulate robustness in nature. The merging of computational and experimental approaches in biological research is increasing in importance. The educational goal of this project is to develop two new courses that use computers to enhance learning of difficult quantitative concepts. For the first course, the PI will develop intensive, hands-on computer exercises to teach advanced biology students how to analyze large data sets. For the second, the PI will develop multimedia learning tools to convey quantitative concepts to non-science majors. The broader impacts of these efforts will be to prepare the next generation of biologists to tackle increasingly complex problems, and to enable non-scientists to evaluate technological advances that will have increasing importance in their lives.\r\n",
