 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop an effective atomization-based cutting fluid application system for micro-machining that reduces friction and cutting temperatures. The approach to this research is to study the mechanics and dynamics of the atomization-based cutting fluid application system for micro-scale machining operations, in particular, to understand: (1) the manner in which the complex environment at the tool/workpiece interface influences the impingement dynamics of atomized droplets; (2) the nature of the tribological properties of the atomized cutting fluids during rubbing/ploughing and their influence on the cutting mechanisms in micro-machining, and (3) the effects of the droplet characteristics and cutting fluid properties on the performance of the micro-machining process.  \r\n\r\nThis research will increase tool life, improve surface quality, and increase productivity in micro-machining. The enhanced understanding of the tribological behavior of the atomized droplets at the tool/chip/workpiece interfaces will drive advances in micro-tool design and manufacturing and improvement in other processes such as macro-scale \"minimum quantity lubricant\" machining, grinding, and rolling. The informed application of cutting fluids in micro-machining will lead to a significantly more robust process, which means that a much broader user community can form around this technology. The fundamental nature of the knowledge developed in this research on the lubrication aspects of spray atomization for cutting fluid application in micro-scale machining has the potential to open up the utilization of sprays for a wide range of lubrication-based problems, particularly at the nano- and micro-scales.",
