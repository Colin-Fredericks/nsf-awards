 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project addresses the critical problems of tracking and monitoring firefighters or other first responders inside structures. Whereas many key components of first responder systems such as GPS fail indoors or require an overwhelming number of access points to obtain accurate information, this system requires only a base station that can be quickly set up outside of a building. The system initiates a mesh network to communicate data amongst responders, as well as between the responders and the command post outside the structure, which extends the range of the base station by allowing data to be relayed through another team member if a responder goes out of range. The research project will focus on improving tracking algorithms such that complex motions can be recognized and accurately tracked. In addition to improvements will be made to the command center and first responder interface, and tests will be carried out within the user community. \r\n\r\nThis research has a broad impact on the safety of first responders. As an example, firefighting is one of the most dangerous jobs with a loss rate of over 95 firefighters annually over the last decade. Some of these deaths could have been prevented if only the firefighter's distressed condition and exact position were known. This technology will have a broad impact on pin pointing firefighters and other first responders that serve society during crises and natural hazards. \r\n",
