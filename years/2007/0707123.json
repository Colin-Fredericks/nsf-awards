 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gokova Geometry-Topology Conferences founded in 1992 with the purpose of creating a lively informal environment where the latest results of Geometry and Topology are discussed by  active experts and young researchers along with  enthusiastic graduate students. Though many world experts  frequently visit Gokova, the main emphasis  of these conferences have always  been on the young researchers and graduate students. By looking back on its 15 years old history, we can now proudly say that many young now-well-known mathematicians of the field got their early international exposure in these friendly conferences, many instances by giving their first  talks there. We hope to continue these conferences.\r\n\r\n  In these conferences we plan to discuss the most recent discoveries in the field of Topology and Geometry. By putting together the experts along with young researchers and graduate students,  we hope to energize these fields and create a new environment for further study, and train future experts. Topology and Geometry has not just helped to settle deep problems in mathematics, it has been also a prime tool for solving deep problems in physics (e.g. quantum topology, string theory).\r\n",
