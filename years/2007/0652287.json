An important issue in designing such net-works is to develop effective survivability schemes that can continue to carry critical traffic in the event of network failures. Traditionally, different survivabil-ity mechanisms have been implemented at various layers, independently. This project investigates the survivability schemes in which survivability mecha-nisms may be implemented simultaneously at multiple layers within the net-work in either a coordinated or independent manner. The work focuses primar-ily on multi-layer dual-homing techniques in the wireless and IP layers, protec-tion schemes in the optical layer, and the effective integration of these schemes. By establishing appropriate models and developing new algorithms, the project will provide insights into the trade-offs between coordinated and independent survivability schemes with respect to cost, complexity, and service levels pro-vided in the wireless and IP layers. \r\n\r\nDr. Admela Jukan\r\nProgram Director, CISE/CNS\r\nAug 4, 2004.\r\n.\r\n",
