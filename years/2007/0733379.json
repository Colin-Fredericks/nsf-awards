 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory proposal submitted by the Association for Computing Machinery aims at developing a community of individuals and organizations working together to address critical issues in K-12 computer science education by broadening the awareness of the need for curriculum computer science standards, providing multiple levels of professional development, conducting and disseminating research in computer science education, and promoting this subject as a unique field of study in schools. Specifically, the objectives are (1) to identify and select individuals with demonstrated commitment to computer science, (2) to provide professional development on effective tools and strategies for the improvement of K-12 computer science, (3) to develop a toolkit of materials aimed at increasing awareness in computer science, and (4) to facilitate mentoring between K-12 leaders and post-secondary faculty, with a focus on high school computer science teachers. Dissemination efforts include the Computer Science Teacher Association?s (CSTA) website to promote the use of successful projects, participation in the National Educational Computing Conference, and publication of articles in CSTA?s Voice and Advocate. Program assessment plans identify the use of an evaluator to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of proposed activities, and to provide frequent feedback to the project?s leadership for appropriate modifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
