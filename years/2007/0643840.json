 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Exploring Congruence of Fossil and Molecular Estimates of Macroevolutionary Divergence Times in Ostracoda (Crustacea)\"\r\n\r\nPI- Todd H. Oakley\r\n\r\nThe PI will conduct an empirical study of origination times of numerous evolutionary lineages of Ostracoda, a crustacean group with an excellent fossil record. A primary goal is to examine causes of observed differences between fossil and molecular divergence estimates, while considering molecular, statistical and paleontological explanations.  The project includes collection of new data from five gene sequences from numerous Ostracoda, selected as the most clock-like genes of a larger panel of candidate genes.  To ensure a balanced approach, the PI (whose primary training is in molecular phylogeny) will collaborate with postdoctoral researchers with primary training in morphology/taxonomy and paleontology.\r\n\r\nThis study will have broad implications for understanding methods of evolutionary divergence time estimation, and produce important new data for these studies.  These studies are prerequisites for understanding the relationship between organisms and environmental factors like climate change.  The results will serve as a foundation for the PI's career investigating evolutionary phenomena in Ostracoda.  In addition, the PI is developing a network of opportunities for teaching and learning. First, the research results will be integrated into the PI's primary undergraduate course, which will also be improved in numerous other ways.  The research also includes specific, modular projects for undergraduate research and community outreach.  The PI is an active participant in multiple organizations that promote advancement of under-represented groups in science, often recruiting from these organizations to assist in research and outreach.\r\n",
