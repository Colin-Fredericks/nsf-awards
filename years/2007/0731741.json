The Symposium's scope encompasses research and education activities in the fields of computer vision, artificial intelligence, human robot interaction, multi-agent systems, robot mechanisms, and robot locomotion.  The 11th annual RoboCup International Symposium will be held in conjunction with RoboCup 2007 in Atlanta, July 9-10, 2007.\r\n\r\nScientific Merit: The symposium offers an excellent opportunity to introduce new techniques to disciplines and people who have not been exposed to them before. The experimental, interactive and benchmark character of the RoboCup initiative creates an opportunity to present, learn and evaluate novel ideas and approaches across a variety of disciplines. If promising, these ideas are rapidly adopted and field-tested by a large (and still strongly growing) community.\r\nFinally, the introduction of RoboCup@Home in 2006 provides additional opportunity to expand the areas of discussion at the Symposium.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: RoboCup offers a significant opportunity to provide international impact in science and technology.  RoboCup draws participants from over 20 countries.  This year's event marks the first time that the event will be hosted entirely on a university campus and only the second time the event has been held in the United States.  One impact in this case is the opportunity for introducing international students and faculty to a leading U.S.  \r\nacademic\r\nenvironment that will encourage them to pursue additional collaborations in the U.S.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.robocup-us.org/\r\n\r\n",
