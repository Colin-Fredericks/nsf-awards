 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\nCorrelated-electron materials provide myriad opportunities to discover and study novel fundamental magnetic, structural, and electronic phenomena and phases, and it is likely that only a small fraction of their scientific and technological potential has been realized so far. Neutron and X-ray scattering experiments play invaluable roles in this endeavor, since they provide essential structural and magnetic information about new phases of matter and the transitions between them. The PI and his students will address some of the most timely and intellectually challenging physics issues in the field of correlated-electron materials by pursuing crystal growth and scattering studies that are likely to hold the key to resolving such pivotal questions as the role of disorder in low-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets and high-temperature superconductors, especially the electron-doped and Hg-based hole-doped compounds. The PI's materials-based research program will continue to provide rich educational opportunities to train the next generation of materials physicists. The crystals grown by the PI's students will continue to enable them to collaborate with, and learn from many experts using complementary experimental techniques. \r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abatract\r\nComplex materials provide myriad opportunities to discover and study novel fundamental magnetic, structural, and electronic phenomena and phases, and it is likely that only a small fraction of their scientific and technological potential has been realized so far.
