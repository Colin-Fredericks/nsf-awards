The project advocates a different approach\r\nthan previous work in this area by formally defining comprehensive\r\nrequirements for protocol security, rather than imposing new\r\ntechnologies to address one or two specific exploits.\r\n\r\nThe Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) provides best-effort connectivity\r\nbetween the component networks of the Internet, a task called\r\ninterdomain routing.  However, BGP lacks any security mechanism,\r\nallowing accidental router misconfiguration or intentional attacks\r\nthat have far-reaching effects on network stability and traffic\r\nflow. Furthermore, simply adding security mechanisms is insufficient\r\nbecause BGP also lacks the guarantee that specification-compliant\r\ninputs always produce stable routes across the network.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses these shortcomings through research on various\r\nassumptions that guarantee good routing behavior and on methods to\r\nverify or enforce these assumptions to prevent deviation from that\r\nbehavior.  We identify and address attacks that have previously been\r\nstudied as well as new attacks that have not yet received attention in\r\nthe literature.  We target incremental-deployment benefits and\r\ncomputational efficiency as primary desiderata; thus, our solutions\r\ncan offer incentives for immediate adoption without system-wide\r\nchanges. Through its educational component, our project introduces\r\nstudents to cross-disciplinary research. This encourages collaboration\r\nin research projects and allows development of coursework integrating\r\nsecurity, networking, and theory for a timely application domain.\r\n\r\n",
