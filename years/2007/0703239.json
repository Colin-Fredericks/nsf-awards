The SPA meetings, held under the auspices of the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics, are one of the premiere international forums for dissemination of new results in probability and stochastic processes. These meetings are an important part of the continued development of the probability community, and present an invaluable opportunity for the development of young scientists.\r\n\r\nThe conference features 17 invited speakers from most major areas of stochastic processes. The conference also hosts the annual Levy Lecture (sponsored by Elsevier), which will be given this year by Martin Barlow, and two IMS Medallion Lectures (supported by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics), given this year by Victor de la Pena and Russell Lyons. The conference will also host the inaugural Doob Lecture, supported by the Illinois Journal of Mathematics, which will be given by Marc Yor.",
