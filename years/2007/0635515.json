NICL SMO serves as the primary point of contact for scientists interested in access to ice cores and is responsible for the coordination and facilitation of the Ice Core Working Group (ICWG), a group of scientists who represent ice core researchers and those in related disciplines whose research utilizes or applies to ice core research. The ICWG investigates a wide range of topics related to ice core research including scientific oversight of the National Ice Core Laboratory (NICL), sample access and distribution, inventory, policy issues and the development of plans for future ice core activities. NICL SMO proposes to continue assisting the ICWG in working with the scientific community, developing reports, planning workshops, oversight of NICL operations and coordinating educational outreach activities.  The intellectual merit of this activity is that ice cores play a critical role in the science of global climate change. NICL SMO fills a unique role in allowing investigators a central point of contact to find information on current research being done and how to access ice core samples. NICL SMO assists new investigators in techniques for extracting samples, suggesting the use of de-accessed ice for method development and is readily available for consultation. By providing this service to the scientific community NICL SMO helps to increase the dissemination of scientific information preserved in ice cores.  In terms of broader impacts, ice core science addresses questions of human interest related to the earth's climate system including global warming, abrupt climate change, changes in sea level, and biogeochemical cycling, among others. The NICL-SMO provides a service to the ice core community and helps facilitate further research on ice cores.  The data and interpretations derived from NICL's archive will give policymakers the information necessary to make better decisions and will therefore benefit society.\r\n\r\n",
