 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this proposal is to characterize the adaptation of tissue engineered blood vessel subjected to mechanical loading such as increases in pressure, flow, or axial stretching in a bench-top bioreactor. The engineered vessels will be derived by seeding cells on a porous biodegradable scaffold. In addition, the role of the scaffold mechanical properties on the adaptation of the engineered vessel will also be characterized. The research objectives are to develop a mathematical model to describe how tissue engineered blood vessels adapt in response to mechanical loading and perform experiments to test this model. The model and experimental data will be used to optimize the design of tissue engineered blood vessels with the ultimate goal of designing a graft suitable for coronary by-pass surgery.  \r\nOver half a million coronary by-pass procedures are performed in the United States each year. Often veins or arteries from other locations in the patients body are used to 'by-pass' clogged arteries; long-term complication rates for these procedures, however, remain at 30-50% and many patients lack adequate grafting vessels. Tissue engineered blood vessels offer promise towards providing a suitable coronary by-pass graft; however, to date strategies for developing a small diameter graft with adequate strength and resistance to blood clotting remains elusive. This work will support undergraduate and graduate students to conduct research. Emphasis will be given to minority students in the dual degree 'Partners in Transitioning to Tech' program between the Georgia Tech and several historically black colleges in Atlanta. \r\n\r\n",
