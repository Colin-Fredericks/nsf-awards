 "awd_abstract_narration": "The idea that life is a delicate balance of chemical processes that can occur only within a narrow range of conditions is changing as scientists continue to discover life in extreme environments. The thermal features of Yellowstone National Park are one example. Pools of nearly boiling acid, once thought to be void of life, are now known to contain thriving populations of unicellular organisms and their viruses. Of the three domains of life (Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea), the Archaea are the least understood. Currently archaeal organisms are the focus of a wide range of research projects as their members include many extremophiles, or organisms that live in extreme environments. One of the most productive and insightful means to unraveling the details of their biochemistry and cellular regulatory networks is by examining interactions between the host and its viruses. The specific objective of this project is to gain insight into Sulfolobus-virus  interactions using an integrated genomic and proteomic approach. This will provide a global view of host and viral gene transcription and protein production during infection, leading to fundamental insights into the biology of archaeal extremophiles. In addition to scientists and students at Montana State University and the Thermal Biology Institute, students from Montana's Tribal Colleges and local high schools will participate in this project.",
