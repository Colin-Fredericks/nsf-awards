 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Society of Engineering Science (SES) technical meeting is held annually to provide a forum for the discussion and dissemination of recent advances in research, development, and education with topics from all areas of engineering science. The meeting provides a unique forum for scientists and engineers from various disciplines to communicate their ideas on problems of common interest. The SES 2007 meeting will be held October 21 - 24, 2007 on the campus of Texas A&M University - College Station. The meeting will consist of approximately 350 talks covering a wide range of topics.\r\n\r\nThe financial support from NSF will be used in support of expenses for travel, registration, and the student paper competition for students attending the SES meeting. The financial support and sponsorship of the National Science Foundation is vital for the success of the meeting and the encouragement of young scientists to be engaged in scientific forums and present their research in front of their peers. The research areas/symposia covered by the meeting are expected to be of significant interest to NSF and its scientific mission. Topics on the science and mechanics of solid and fluid media covered at the meeting have significant impact on the future of engineering sciences and are of extreme importance to the Nation's research competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
