 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the West Virginia University that focuses on providing intellectually stimulating research experience in the field of nanoscience, including Chemistry, Physics, and Materials Science with biological applications.  The program targets economically disadvantaged and underrepresented minority students from the Appalachian region.  It will support 12 undergraduate students each year for three years, bringing them to the campus of the University of West Virginia for ten weeks during summer and engaging them in multidisciplinary research projects in several well-funded research groups.  Regular professional and social meetings to promote interactions among participating students, faculty and other senior researchers as well as technical presentation practices are included in the program. The students will also have the opportunity to visit nearby large national scientific facilities. The overall experience is expected to motivate the participating students to pursue graduate education and science careers. This Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.  Within the NSF, Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate and the Division of Engineering Education Centers in the Engineering Directorate are funding this REU Site.",
