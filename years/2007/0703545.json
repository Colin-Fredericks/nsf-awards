Such\r\ninteractions not only determine the fate of these clusters but are also believed to be the origin of\r\nexotic objects such as blue stragglers, binary pulsars, and x-ray sources. The investigators and\r\nstudents at Vassar will use a 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics code developed under previous\r\nNSF funding and complete its adaptation to include magnetic fields (a 3D smoothed particle\r\nmagnetohydrodynamic code). This new tool will then be used to simulate stellar collisions/mergers\r\namong a variety of types of stars (main-sequence, subgiant, red giant, and stellar remnants).\r\nSpecific topics that will be addressed include stellar collisions in globular clusters (and the origins\r\nof blue stragglers, i.e., collisions versus mergers), binary mergers, and common envelope evolution.\r\nIncluded in this project is significant involvement by students with the goal of setting up self -sustaining student research programs (in which new students are trained by seniors). There is also\r\nthe opportunity for students at either school to become involved in collaborations with\r\nstudents/postdoctoral fellows/faculty at the other. Likewise, useful skills in programming,\r\nmodeling, hydrodynamics/fluid mechanics, etc., will be developed among the participants.",
