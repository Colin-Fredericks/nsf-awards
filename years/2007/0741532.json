 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, NUE-Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education and Student Research at Jackson State University (JSU), under the direction of Dr. Wilbur Walters, is a collaborative interdisciplinary effort to integrate nanoscale engineering research and education at JSU.  The project aims at the extension of the Nanoscale Engineering and Technology (NET) program.  The main educational goal of this project involves the development and addition of new modules into existing courses and the development of a new course.  The project will involve a wide spectrum of undergraduate students majoring in Engineering, Technology, Applied Physics, Biology or Chemistry.  The JSU NET program will expose a large number of underrepresented students to advanced research and will enhance their opportunities in the current job market.  The program is also designed to attract significant interest of faculty and students from local colleges and high schools.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering Program Solicitation (NSF 07-554), and is being co-funded by the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) and the Directorate for Engineering, Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).",
