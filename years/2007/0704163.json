 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This project addresses fundamental materials science issues related to p-type doping of ZnO. The approach is to assess the role of compensating defects, and to explore novel schemes for introducing acceptor dopants. Project objectives include: determine the microscopic structure of hydrogen-related complexes in ZnO; investigate and devise novel routes to p-type doping of ZnO; and to evaluate the kinetics and vibrational dynamics of hydrogen in ZnO. Hydrogen donors and acceptor-hydrogen complexes will be studied using vibrational spectroscopy in conjunction with electrical measurements. To probe vibrational dynamics, kinetics, and microscopic structure of impurities, infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy will be used to measure local vibrational modes (LVMs) of impurities in ZnO. Hydrostatic pressure will be used as an experimental variable to gain information about the structure of hydrogen-related complexes as well as vibrational interactions between LVMs and lattice phonons.\r\nNon-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance, and is expected to provide unique opportunities for student training. Planned educational activities will benefit a range of students from elementary (K-12) to graduate students. Related efforts include community outreach programs to local schools and home schooled children, the development of lecture demonstrations for solid-state physics courses, and undergraduate research opportunities. In conjunction with research, these activities are expected to encourage students from diverse backgrounds to enter fields related to materials science and solid-state physics. Graduate and undergraduate students will have an opportunity to perform forefront research and, upon graduation, make significant contributions to science and engineering.",
