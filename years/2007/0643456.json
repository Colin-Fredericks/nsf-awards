 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this CAREER project, jointly supported by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, is to continue development and use of novel computational approaches for equilibrium sampling of biomacromoleces, especially proteins.  The final goal is to generate ensembles of canonically sampled protein structures, exhibiting full fluctuations. While it is widely appreciated that the full sampling of protein configurations is an extremely challenging problem, recent technical advances suggest the goal may finally be reachable.  The Resolution Exchange algorithm and its variants, recently developed by Zuckerman and co-workers, represent a particularly promising class of algorithms for employing coarse-grained models to greatly accelerate rigorous statistical sampling (based on the Boltzmann factor) of standard atomically detailed representations of proteins.  The use of coarse-grained protein models is critical, because these can be shown to permit extremely rapid full sampling of configuration space requiring less than one week of single-processor simulation for proteins with fewer than 100 residues.  In addition to the Resolution Exchange approach, novel convergence assessment and re-weighting approaches will be employed.  High-temperature sampling, moreover, can be directly incorporated into Resolution Exchange simulations.\r\n\r\nThe education plan is to continue writing an introductory text on statistical mechanics for students of biophysics aimed at beginning graduate students or advanced undergraduates.  Although statistical mechanics is arguably the fundamental science of molecular biophysics and simulation, there is an outstanding need for a text which is accessible to students from a wide variety of backgrounds (i.e., enrollees in inter-disciplinary graduate programs) and which also maintains the rigor and generality needed for students to grasp the fundamental concepts.  The text will therefore focus on the molecular phenomena pertinent to biophysics, avoiding the emphasis on spin systems and phase transitions in many graduate statistical mechanics texts.  Further, the text also will rely primarily on basic probability concepts rather than the more abstract terminology of thermodynamics, as has been traditional.  The probability concepts are broadly applicable, permitting the student a strong grasp of concepts ranging from entropy and free energy to the connection between dynamics and equilibrium.  Throughout the text, the correspondence with traditional nomenclature will be made clear, since this is absolutely necessary for scientific communication and the understanding of the literature.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA, constitute much of the cellular machinery of life.  Although many aspects of such molecules are well understood, much more remains to be discovered.  The project had two overall goals: (i) to improve computer simulation methods used for studying biomolecules and (ii) to write a textbook explaining the physics of biomolecules.\n\nComputer simulations for biomolecules were enhanced in several ways as a result of the project.  New algorithms and software were developed that were demonstrated to be superior at \"sampling\" functional motions of proteins compared to older methods.  (\"Sampling\" refers to the ability to determine the various conformations/shapes of a molecule in the correct proportions.)  The new software included approaches which could generate and employ computer models of biomolecules at different levels of resolution, such as including all-atoms or a simplified description.  Furthermore, the project led to novel methods for quantitatively assessing sampling.  Such yardsticks are crucial for evaluating new methods.  The preceding advances represent the \u00e6intellectual merit\u00c6 of the project, and to the extent employed by other researchers, also indicate \u00e6broader impact\u00c6 as described by the NSF.\n\nAs proposed, the project led to a single-author textbook, Statistical Physics of Biomolecules: An Introduction, written by principal investigator.  The book was published in 2010 by CRC Press, targeting advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students and suitable for students from an array of scientific backgrounds.  The only pre-requisite is one year of calculus.  The book has sold over 700 copies to date, which does not make it a bestseller, but shows it is having an impact on the fairly narrow audience targeted.  This is further evidence of the \u00e6broader impact\u00c6 of the project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel M Zuckerman"
