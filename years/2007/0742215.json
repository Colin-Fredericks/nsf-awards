The objective of the conference is development of research and economic infrastructure in EPSCoR states through enhancing linkages between universities and small businesses.  Research focus areas of alternative energy, environmental science and engineering, and communication technology will be featured in the conference sessions, and were chosen to correspond with NSF, USDA, and commercial opportunities.  Presentations within these focus areas will be made by people from a variety of successful small businesses, federal agencies, state government organizations, economic and social development organizations, and private and public research centers and universities.  Specific sessions will also be allotted to technology transfer and incubator programs, finding seed/venture/angel capital, instrumentation, and protecting technology through contracts and patents.  Conference presentations and materials will be publicly disseminated via the Maine EPSCoR website.\r\n",
