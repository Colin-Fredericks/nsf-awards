 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bazant\r\n0707641\r\n\r\n     The investigator develops timely new mathematical models for\r\nnonlinear \"induced-charge\" electrokinetic phenomena, where\r\nelectro-osmotic flows or particle motions are driven by electric\r\nfields acting on induced double-layer charge at polarizable\r\n(metal or dielectric) surfaces.  The investigator and his\r\ncolleagues have worked for five years on a unified theory of such\r\neffects, as well as related experimental studies in microfluidics\r\nand colloids.  In spite of a number of successes in predicting\r\nnew types of flows, however, the existing theory fails to predict\r\nsome crucial features of the experiments, such as flow reversal\r\nat high voltage and flow suppression at high concentration.  The\r\ntheory is based on the classical Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations,\r\nwhich are strictly valid only for \"small\" voltages (< 25 mV), but\r\nexperiments typically involve much larger voltages (> 1 V), which\r\ncondense counterions near the surface and violate the dilute\r\nsolution approximation.  The investigator builds a mathematical\r\ntheory for this regime by modeling steric and correlation effects\r\ndue to ion crowding, nonlinear permittivity and viscosity of the\r\nsolvent, and Faradaic reactions.  The theory is tested against\r\nexperiments and applied to design new microfluidic devices. \r\n\r\n     This work has fundamental relevance for nanotechnology and\r\nbiotechnology.  Induced-charge electro-osmosis (ICEO) is a\r\nrecently identified nano-scale phenomenon with many applications\r\nin microfluidics and colloids.  Because ICEO can be exploited to\r\nmanipulate fluids and particles with battery voltages, it could\r\nenable revolutionary new portable or implantable biomedical\r\ndevices, such as tiny drug infusion pumps and diagnostic\r\nlabs-on-a-chip.  The mathematical work of the investigator seeks\r\nto advance our understanding of ICEO flows, especially in\r\nbiological liquids, by exploring consequences of molecular\r\ncrowding on the dynamics of electrolytes near highly charged\r\nsurfaces.",
