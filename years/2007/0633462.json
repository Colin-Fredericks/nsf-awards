 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nChemistry faculty at Doane College, are revising laboratory experiences to incorporate the use of circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to improve student understanding of chirality. This project is examining whether hands-on experience with CD spectroscopy helps students develop a better understanding of chirality as a feature of molecular structure.  The project evaluation activities include an examination of the relationship between students' spatial ability and their success with CD experiments.  Students in organic chemistry and biochemistry are engaging in new experiments based on recent literature in chirality and participating with each other in research collaborations.  Using the laboratory techniques learned in their coursework, students also are engaged in faculty-mentored research projects that have high relevance for educational, scientific and social impact.\r\n\r\nStudents at Doane College are generally from highly rural backgrounds with limited experience in laboratory research and little exposure to science careers.  Outreach demonstrations and participation events are involving selected high school students from the local area, many from Hispanic immigrant families, and regional college faculty and students without other access to CD spectroscopy instrumentation.  Results will be shared through regional and national professional meetings and publications such as the Journal of Chemical Education.\r\n\r\n",
