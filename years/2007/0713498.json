 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe Digital Age has brought about unprecedented growth in the amount\r\nof data being generated, the number of data consumers, and the\r\ndiversity of their interests and locations.  Traditionally, users poll\r\nsources for information, but for many applications, polling is hardly\r\nscalable and may miss important events.  The alternative offered by\r\npublish/subscribe systems is to push notifications to users with\r\nmatching interests.  This approach suits many applications, ranging\r\nfrom personal, commercial, medical, to environmental, military, and\r\nsecurity.  However, traditional publish/subscribe systems are becoming\r\ninadequate for advanced applications, where users want to receive\r\ninformation that has been filtered, joined, and summarized, and only\r\nwhen certain conditions are met.\r\n\r\nThis project aims at building a next-generation publish/subscribe\r\nsystem to face the new challenges.  The PIs propose an end-to-end\r\nsolution consisting of techniques from subscription processing and\r\nindexing to dissemination network design, which work together to\r\nsupport efficient and powerful subscription functionalities, allowing\r\nusers to control precisely what they want and when they want it.\r\n\r\nOne main feature distinguishing the proposed approach from previous\r\nwork is joint consideration of subscription processing and\r\nnotification dissemination.  Traditionally, these problems are\r\nconsidered separately by database and networking communities.\r\nHowever, there exists a wide spectrum of interesting alternatives for\r\ninterfacing processing with dissemination.  The PIs propose a\r\npromising approach that allows complex, stateful subscriptions to be\r\nhandled by simple, stateless dissemination mechanisms, with a clean\r\nsystem design that is easy to implement and scale.  A cost-based\r\noptimizer, inspired by database query optimization, chooses the best\r\nprocessing and dissemination strategies jointly and dynamically.\r\n\r\nBesides system building, this project tackles many new algorithmic\r\nchallenges, including, e.g., scalably processing a large number of\r\ncomplex subscriptions; exploiting event and subscription\r\ncharacteristics to combat worst-case complexity; balancing semantic\r\nsimilarity and network proximity in dissemination network design; and\r\nefficiently maintaining statistics for high-dimensional events and\r\nsubscriptions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nBringing together their expertise in databases and algorithms, the PIs\r\nhave a track record of collaborating with each other and with\r\nresearchers outside computer science.  A planned application of the\r\nsystem is to help ecologists with environmental monitoring.\r\n\r\nThe PIs are committed to integrating research and education, and in\r\nparticular undergraduate research, by following their tradition of\r\ninvolving undergraduates through REU and department fellowships.  The\r\nPIs are collaborating on an effort supported by the Department of\r\nEducation, to increase workforce diversity for women, minorities, and\r\npersons with disabilities.  They also participate in an internship\r\nprogram for underrepresented groups, which provides minority students\r\nopportunities to perform paid summer research with Duke faculty\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nProject URL: http://www.cs.duke.edu/dbgroup/prosem/\r\n",
