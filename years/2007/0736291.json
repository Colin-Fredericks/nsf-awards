 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyberinfrastructure is positively impacting learning and workforce development throughout the country as exemplified by the projects funded through the CI-TEAM program of the Office of Cyberinfrastructure of the National Science Foundation. The projects are engaging diverse audiences and communities, and are disseminating excellent resources that will benefit others. The projects have a desire and a need to share lessons learned with one another and other national projects to allow each project to become stronger and more effective. The primary objective for this project (CI-TEAM-Community) is to conduct a workshop to foster community building. The workshop will occur June 27-28, 2007 in the Washington, DC area. The workshop focuses on engaging current and previously funded CI-TEAM projects, program officers in all NSF directorates, other nationally recognized projects pursuing similar goals, as well as aspiring projects seeking funding through the next CI-TEAM solicitation. This workshop will fulfill NSF's commitment to bring together the PIs for the FY05 and FY06 CI-TEAM awards. The CI-TEAM projects address the learning and workforce needs described in the Cyberinfrastructure Vision for 21st Century Discovery [OCI-1]. \r\nThe project is led by Scott Lathrop (U Chicago), Alex Ramirez (HACU), Diane Baxter (SDSC), Edee Wiziecki (NCSA), Henry Neeman (U Oklahoma), Roscoe Giles (Boston U), Mike Wilde (U Chicago/ANL), Ann Redelfs (Consultant). This team has been coordinating similar events for diverse audiences for many years. Wiziecki and Redelfs organized a similar event for NSF's BPC program in 2006.  \r\n",
