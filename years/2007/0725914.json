 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  Wireless communications, at present, relies on a multiplicity of wireless access technologies.  However, the distinct communication capabilities of these technologies present significant barriers for interoperability and migration between different network infrastructures.  Network assimilation is necessary to bridge the gap between the infrastructure networks and the diversity of end-user communication devices.  This research investigates a software-defined radio (SDR) solution to support concurrent execution of multiple communication systems on a single SDR platform, which functions as the base station, through hardware and software reconfiguration.  The research challenges to be addressed at the physical layer and the networking layer of the SDR platforms include:  (i) reconfigurable and adaptive architectures based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology to change the communication capabilities of the SDR platform; (ii) concurrent and time-shared execution of multiple communication systems on a single SDR platform; and (iii) mobility context definition and transfer to support seamless mobility.  The project contributes to the state-of-the-art of SDR architecture, proposes new mechanisms for dynamic reconfiguration of SDR platforms, advances the protocol engineering research for wireless mesh networks with reconfigurable SDRs, and provides new approaches to supporting seamless mobility in mobile networks.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The reconfigurable base stations have potential application to civil disaster situations and the investigators will seek collaborations with industry and related research to increase impact.  Aspects of the research involving hardware devices and software packages for running tests on SDR systems provide an opportunity for students to conduct experiments and learn about the next generation of wireless network technologies.  Results will also be incorporated into a new project-oriented graduate course on adaptive wireless communication and architecture.\r\n",
