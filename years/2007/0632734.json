 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)\r\n\r\nThis is a CCLI Phase 1 Exploratory Project that is adapting existing nondestructive evaluation (NDE) educational material to emphasize manufacturing, welding, and aviation maintenance NDE techniques in an ultrasound imaging laboratory course for applied engineering technology students. The project is also developing an internet-based course that targets community college students. The hands-on laboratory course is covering the foundations of NDE and illustrating nondestructive evaluation techniques of parts and materials with real-life problems. The curriculum fulfills Levels I & II NDE in theory and training requirements, according to American Society for Nondestructive Testing Recommended Practice No. SNT-TC-1A (2001). The NDE laboratory is serving as a training center for engineering technology students, community college students, and incumbent workers. Area employers are emphasizing the urgent need for employees with knowledge and experience in NDE. The evaluation plan is measuring the effectiveness of the laboratory exercises and the internet-based course as well as student competence in ultrasound imaging and NDE. The project is being disseminated through presentations, workshops, professional journals, and a website. A university, four community colleges and a number of industry partners are collaborating on the project. \r\n",
