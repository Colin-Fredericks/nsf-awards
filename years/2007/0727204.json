 "awd_abstract_narration": "The revival of nuclear energy requires the development of novel reactor materials that are resistant to failure under severe environments (e.g., intense radiation and high temperature). Nanostructured materials, in the form of composites or alloys for example, are very promising for this purpose. Much expertise already exists in composite mechanics, and many novel nanostructured materials emerge on monthly even daily basis. Incorporation of such expertise (and knowledge) in the development of nuclear reactor materials would catalyze and speed up the revival of nuclear energy. This symposium aims to bring together experts from three communities: mechanics of composites, nuclear energy, and nanotechnology. Learning from the past and taking full advantage of nanotechnology advancement, this symposium will try to identify key scientific and technological issues of making and applying nanostructured materials under radiation, high temperature, and high strain rate deformation. Such identification will serve inputs for both National Science Foundation and the scientific community in general.\r\n\r\nThis symposium will have also positive impacts on the revival of nuclear energy, which in turn enhances the nation's energy independence. While educated nuclear engineers are in serious short supply, as a co-sponsor Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has a large (one of the largest in the nation) population of nuclear engineering undergraduate students. The forum will provide these students a great educational opportunity. \r\n\r\n",
