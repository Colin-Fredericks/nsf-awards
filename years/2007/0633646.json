 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12).  This project is using the inclusion of a modern chromatographic method, GC-MS, to facilitate change the way undergraduate chemistry is taught.  This change includes using real-world applications and inquiry-based learning laboratory experiments in General, Analytical, Environmental, and Organic Chemistry Courses.  Environmental, forensic, and biomedical themes that represent realistic situations are being used to engage and motivate students as well as develop problem solving and critical thinking skills.  Collaborative experiments are being developed that will allow students from Analytical and Organic Chemistry classes to work together in investigating real-world issues.  In addition, the GC-MS is being used in an undergraduate research program, in a well-established community outreach program, and in the ACS Project SEED which introduces disadvantaged high school students to chemistry research during the summer. A new program is also being developed in cooperation with a local high school chemistry teacher.  This program is bringing high school students to the campus for an afternoon in the laboratories to participate in appropriate inquiry-based experiments with undergraduate students and faculty.  An evaluation plan with both formative and summative components is being developed to assess the success of the program.  The project is being used to enhance the chemistry education of undergraduate and high school students who will go on to careers in a variety of fields.  The research, outreach, and collaborative aspects of this project are being used to benefit women, minorities, and groups who are traditionally under represented in science. Workshops for STEM faculty, local high schools, and community colleges well as publications and presentations are being used to disseminate project results.\r\n",
