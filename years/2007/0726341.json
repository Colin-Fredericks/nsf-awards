 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to institutionally advance the study of ethical issues in science and technology among professional philosophers through the American Philosophical Association (APA).  The APA is the largest organization of professional philosophers in the U.S.  While it has previously worked with the NSF on issues concerning diversity in the development of science and technology, the APA hopes now to expand these efforts to include the professional development of philosophers working on ethical issues concerning technology in broader areas of inquiry.  In consultation with several advisors, the principal investigators will organize a special Advisory Committee on Ethics and Technology as part of the standing APA Committee on the Status and Future of the Profession.  Activities of the Advisory Committee on Ethics and Technology will include (1) featuring research on ethics and science and technology at the next APA supported special conference on ethics in the 21st century at the University of Delaware in October 2004, (2) organizing a series of sessions at the annual meetings of the APA over the next three years on ethical issues in science and technology with a focus on educating the membership of the association on the importance of these issues and on strategies to increase the profile of philosophers and philosophy departments working in these areas, (3) sponsoring a graduate student award and travel stipend competition for the best submitted paper on ethics and technology at annual meetings of the APA, (4) advising the Executive Director of the APA on strategies to improve relations between philosophy departments and faculties of engineering and applied science throughout the US, (5) encouraging the formation of a coalition of research centers in applied philosophy working in areas relating to ethical issues in science and technology, and (6) strategizing means to create a permanent presence in the meetings and publications of the APA on the ethics of science and technology. \r\n \r\nThe potential impact of this project on the future of work in this area is quite strong.  While more specialized philosophical organizations have long been active in the promotion of research on ethics and science and technology, the scope and reach of the APA has even greater potential to influence the profession as a whole and possibly help in the creation of new job opportunities for philosophers working in this area.  In turn, the \r\nproject will help to connect the research of philosophers already working in this area to the larger profession, as well as to public venues where philosophers may be more influential on the discuss on of ethical issues in science and technology policy.\r\n",
