 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project, a collaboration between Mound Laser and Photonics Center and the Manufacturing Research Center at Western Michigan University, will develop a novel, synergistic method for precision machining of brittle materials and semiconductors by combining laser processing diamond turning.  The method has the potential to greatly reduce wear of diamond machine tools, improve the surface quality of finished ceramics, and reduce overall process costs for machining and smoothing these notoriously difficult to process yet critically needed materials.  \r\n\r\nDeveloping a successful technology will immediately impact the areas of silicon carbide mirrors for aerospace applications, and single crystal silicon carbide wafers for high temperature electronics.  Other potential uses include fabrication of structural aerospace components, sensors, and ceramic bearings and seals.  Exploitation of high performance ceramics in all of these areas is currently limited by the state of the art in cost effective, damage-free fabrication of engineered ceramics.  The project will provide a valuable opportunity for students to participate in the advanced, state-of-the-art materials processing technology development.",
