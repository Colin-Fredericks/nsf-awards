 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many practical problems in civil engineering and structural engineering that can be mathematically characterized by diffusion equations of different degrees of complexity. Penetration of de-icing salts in concrete structures is a typical example. It is proposed to develop a computational model that will provide accurate long-term prediction for multi-components ionic and moisture penetrations into large-scale concrete structures. A complete set of governing equations for the multi-components transport processes will be established. Coupling effects between the ions, between moisture diffusion and ion diffusion, and between ions and the pore surfaces of concrete will be considered. Multi-scale models for the material parameters involved in the governing equations will be developed. The effective material parameters at meso-scale will be determined based on the constituent phases of the microstructure. Specific effort will be made to determine the transport parameters using high order correlation functions of mathematical morphology which capture statistical feature of spatial distribution of the multi-phase microstructure of concrete. Statistical analysis for the penetration processes in concrete will be performed. Numerical algorithms for solving the stochastic transport equations will be developed, in which the material parameters, initial condition, and boundary conditions are considered random. Finite element simulation techniques will be employed to analyze the penetration of multi-components de-icing salts in large-scale concrete structures. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide several new methods in mathematical morphology and statistical analysis. The research findings can be readily incorporated into structural analysis programs to simulate long-term performance of reinforced concrete structures, which can be utilized by universities, public agencies and private companies for design, construction, maintenance, management, and research of highway and roadway systems. It will help to improve quality and efficiency of infrastructure maintenance and management. This project also provides a unique opportunity for the students in civil engineering to study analytical and numerical methods from the mathematics department. On the other hand, the students in mathematics and statistics will have an opportunity to apply their knowledge in a very important practical problem and have some insight on the operation and management process of our nation's infrastructure. Both graduate and undergraduate students from science and engineering majors, particularly students from underrepresented groups will be hired to participate on the proposed work. \r\n",
