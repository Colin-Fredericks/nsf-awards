 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through efforts and strategies employed during Phase One of the TCUP grant Chief Dull Knife\r\nCollege has seen remarkable results in the area of student interest in, enrollment in and\r\ncompletion of math and science courses. During Phase Two the college will develop a\r\n?connected learning network? with local partner schools and the universities to address several\r\nongoing endeavors begun in Phase One of the TCUP project. The use of research to expose\r\nstudents to STEM careers and the improvement of students' capabilities in gatekeeper courses\r\ncan have a combined effect of positioning the student for continued success in STEM\r\nundertakings. The college seeks to broaden and enhance the accomplishments of Phase One by\r\ncontinuing to offer research opportunities to our students on the university campus, but also to\r\nexpand these research experiences to the home campus and Chief Dull Knife College. Research\r\nconcepts, processes, and outcomes will be incorporated into science and math course work at\r\nthe tribal college. Research findings will be presented by students at national meetings. The\r\nresearch carried out will be shared with surrounding high schools and the university partners\r\nthrough an Interactive Video system linking the laboratories and classrooms at the remote sites.\r\nThe college will broaden the scope of computer-delivered mastery based math courses delivered\r\non campus, as well as, assist local high schools in implementing a similar methodology for\r\nmathematics delivery. Transferring what we have learned in Phase One about math preparation\r\nand retention to the high schools and helping them adopt changes can have a huge effect on\r\ncompletion rates and level of ?math preparedness? for incoming college students. Increased\r\npreparation results in more choices in all areas of science, technology, and mathematics for the\r\nstudent. The curriculum in math and science at the college will be reviewed and revamped to\r\nreflect increased math-science integration. The faculty will also work closely with the Project\r\nDirector to incorporate research into current curricula in science and mathematics. The college\r\nwill also continue to offer summer workshops designed to interest students in STEM related\r\ncourse work and careers. Students will interact with instructors from NASA and local faculty on\r\nprojects ranging from 3D animation and design to Lego Robotics. Throughout the various projects\r\nthe students and interns will be asked to take on increasingly complex leadership roles with\r\nstudents in other levels of the program. High school students will model for the younger grades,\r\ntribal college students will model for high school students and university students will model for\r\ntribal college students. Connecting the campuses together through Interactive TV will afford a first\r\nforay into this type of mentor/leadership interaction for Northern Cheyenne students. Students\r\ninvolved in research at the tribal college and their high school associates will be able to link with\r\nsiblings and relatives at the university research labs.",
