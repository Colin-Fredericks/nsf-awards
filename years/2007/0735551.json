Pruitt \r\nInstitution: Stanford University \r\nProposal Number: 0735551 \r\n\r\nEFRI-CBE: Engineering of Cardiovascular Cellular Interfaces and Tissue Constructs\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n\r\nCardiac cells and tissue are ideal targets for regenerative medicine and fundamental studies of the interplay of cellular and biomolecular level signaling and response for several reasons. First, observation of successful stem cell differentiation to cardiac myocytes is facilitated by readily identifiable immunohistochemical markers as well as characteristic electrical action potentials and mechanical contractions. Second, explanted cells in culture lose their morphology and organization in the absence of drugs or electromechanical stimulation, suggesting that cellular organization is dependent on these cues. Last, myocardium damaged during a heart attack does not regenerate and the weakened muscle results in heart failure. Fundamental understanding of how cardiac myocytes and heart tissue can be regenerated is essential to creating successful therapies for patients with heart disease (affecting 71 million Americans). Recently, several studies have shown that stem cells may offer regenerative potential through direct injection of cells into the damaged myocardium or in situ repair using engineered tissue grafts.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this project lies in the development of basic knowledge and models for cell response to environmental cues. Pluripotent cell responses to changes in environment offer a testbed for characterizing the thresholds and mechanisms of environmental adaptation and remodeling. The outcomes of the baseline and coupled experiments will be made available as a database for other researchers. Models and results will be disseminated by publication and seminars for researchers in the field as well as public seminar forums.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of this work lie in the enhanced knowledge of cell signaling and differentiation, the role of culture environmental parameters in tissue engineering, and the enhanced design guidance and technology developed which will ultimately enable regenerative therapies for victims of heart disease. Topics of this research will be incorporated in modules for teaching basic engineering and materials courses and the Principal Investigators (PIs) will recruit undergraduates for research experiences in their labs. The PIs actively participate in outreach, undergraduate research opportunities, and research experience for teacher programs and will expand these efforts related to this project. A workshop on the research topics will be held in the final year of the project.",
