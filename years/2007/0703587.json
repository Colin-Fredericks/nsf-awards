At any given time,\r\ntwo cohorts of 11 students each participate: they begin the\r\nprogram at the start of their junior year and complete it at the\r\nend of their senior year (i.e., after 4 semesters).  Incoming\r\nstudents, whose expected preparation includes multivariable\r\ncalculus, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations,\r\nparticipate in a 1-credit seminar course for two semesters to\r\nprepare them for the upcoming summer's projects.  Summer projects\r\nconsist of 8 to 10 weeks of full-time work on a research project\r\nunder the supervision of an experienced faculty mentor.  Students\r\nwho have completed their projects give practice talks in the\r\nseminar and are expected to present their work at appropriate\r\nprofessional conferences as well as to write an honors thesis or\r\nresearch paper. \r\n\r\n     Student research projects involve timely problems in\r\natmospheric sciences, including weather and climate forecasting;\r\nsupply-chain modeling; mathematical techniques for improved\r\nmedical imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging); and\r\nmathematical biology (e.g., models for human cellular processes). \r\nThe students, who must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents,\r\nhave an opportunity to work on massively parallel (2000+\r\nprocessor) machines through ASU's Fulton High Performance\r\nComputing Initiative and to do high-performance graphics at ASU's\r\nDecision Theater.  These experiences prepare students for\r\nadvanced work in climate dynamics, drug discovery, aerospace\r\ndesign, and similar topics at top graduate schools across the\r\nUnited States.  Special efforts are made to recruit students who\r\nare first-generation college students, women, and members of\r\nother underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences.  The\r\nproject is supported by the MPS Division of Mathematical\r\nSciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the\r\nEHR Division of Undergraduate Education. \r\n",
