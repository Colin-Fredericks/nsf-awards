 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research builds a unified computational framework for scalable and high \r\nefficiency solution of elliptic partial differential equations. The \r\ninvestigators develop a novel high-order multiscale multigrid computation \r\nmethodology, which combines high accuracy computation and fast computing methods \r\nin a seamless way. This research work may impact many computational science \r\nand engineering and industry modeling and simulation applications. As U.S. \r\nhigh-tech industry moves from experiment-based design and development to \r\ncomputer-assisted design and development, higher performance numerical \r\nmethods and faster computer simulation techniques will benefit U.S. industry \r\nby enabling design and development engineers to conduct quick verification \r\nto test their new ideas on computers, before committing to expensive \r\nexperiments. These technologies are essential for the U.S. industry to \r\nmaintain its leadership position in the competitive world market. Graduate \r\nstudents, including members from underrepresented groups, are trained to \r\nbecome the next generation researchers and educators with solid scientific \r\ncomputing skills.  \r\n\r\nThe technique simultaneously advances the numerical solution \r\nof partial differential equations in two fronts. One is to compute high \r\naccuracy solution by using high-order discretization methods, another is \r\nto compute the discrete solution in a minimum amount of computer time \r\nby using the fastest sparse linear system solvers. This unified framework \r\nadvances the two fronts collectively by fusing the ideas and advantages \r\nof multiscale discretization and multigrid computations, to achieve \r\nthe ultimate goal of computing accurate numerical solution at the \r\nminimum computer costs. It is the convergence of years of research work \r\nby many researchers in several different areas. This computational \r\nframework possesses high accuracy, high speed, high scalability, and \r\ndelivers optimal efficiency for computing the numerical solution of \r\nelliptic partial differential equations.\r\n",
