 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project considers the problem of simultaneously solving multiple\r\ncomponent-level natural language processing problems.  Such\r\ncomponent-level tasks are necessary as building blocks for large-scale\r\napplications (eg., automatic document summarization, machine\r\ntranslation, etc.), but are typically solved independently.  These\r\nindependent solutions ignore the natural connections that relate the\r\noutput of one problem to the output of the other.  This research\r\nexplores the ability to exploit such output correspondences to aid\r\nmachine learning algorithms, termed \"Cross-Task Learning.\"  These\r\noutput correspondences provide strong prior information about the\r\nrelationship between the desired outputs of multiple problems.  This\r\nprior knowledge can potentially serve to improve task-level\r\nperformance, even when large amounts of training data are unavailable.\r\nThe research exploits such prior knowledge using a k-best methodology\r\nso as to maximize the applicability of these techniques.  It also\r\ndevelops new techniques for semi-supervised learning based on the idea\r\nof output correspondences in order to capitalize on the vast amounts\r\nof unannotated data that are available. In addition, the proposed techniques\r\nare analyzed in the context of computational learning theory. The outcome \r\nwill be a set of techniques for learning across multiple natural language processing\r\ntasks.  This technology will be empirically evaluated in the context\r\nof low-level tasks such as shallow parsing and named entity\r\nrecognition, as well as the high-level tasks of discourse analysis and\r\nautomatic document summarization.  \r\n",
