The workshop, co-organized by the PI and Drs. Gregg Zellmer and China Chen of Academic Sinica, will foster enhanced U.S.-Taiwan collaboration in earth sciences while also promoting interdisciplinarity between scientists in igneous and gas geochemistry. Key themes for discussion will be: 1) Volcanic Gas Emissions: Implications for Magmatic Processes and Time Scales; 2) Uranium-series, Short lived Isotopes and Volatiles in Volcanic Rocks: From Global-Scale to Magma Chamber-Scale Ascent Rates; and 3) Modeling Magma Dynamics: Using Physical Constraints on Volatile Emission Rates. The workshop will enable U.S. and Taiwanese scientists to take advantage of complementary expertise and facilities and also bring U.S. early-career U.S. scientists into a fruitful area for international research collaboration. Visits to the analytical facilities of the Institute of Earth Sciences, a field trip to the Coastal Range in Eastern Taiwan, and field trips to other sites of volcanological and geological interest will be included in the program.\r\n\r\n",
