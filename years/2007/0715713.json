 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational methods, in particular, those for partial\r\ndifferential equations, have experienced major developments over the past\r\nthirty years in both algorithmic advances and applications to other fields.\r\nComputational simulation of physical phenomena has now fully joined\r\nengineering experimentation and theoretical/analytical\r\nanalysis as the third method of scientific investigation.\r\nAs the application problems become ever complicate and challenging,\r\nit becomes more and more difficult or even impossible to solve\r\nthese problems by isolated individuals. The magnitude and complexity\r\nof the problems often require various expertise (such as field data\r\nacquisition, modeling, mathematical analysis, computational methods,\r\ncomputer programming and visualization, and data analysis), hence,\r\ntheir solutions require persistent collective effort of international\r\nscientific communities of various disciplines. Also, because face to\r\nface interaction is important to effective exchange of ideas and\r\ncollaborations, it is vital to bring together researchers with similar\r\nresearch interests to  conferences of various scales.\r\nTo meet the need and to facilitate such an interaction,\r\nthe principal investigator (PI), together with colleagues from U.S., China,\r\nand Korea, will organize the ``International Workshop on Computational\r\nMethods in Geosciences\", which will be held from July 5-7, 2007\r\nat Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. The requested funding will be\r\nused to support U.S. researchers, in particular, graduate students\r\nand postdocs, to attend the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated international workshop is expected to contribute\r\nto promoting, enhancing, and stimulating the cross-continental\r\nresearch interactions and collaborations in mathematical sciences.\r\nSuch community-wise research activities often\r\nserve the purpose of enhancing and promoting collaborations\r\nbetween U.S. and international researchers in mathematical\r\nand applied sciences, which in turn contributes critically\r\nto the course of solving challenging scientific problems\r\nsuch as flow and transport in porous media, weather prediction,\r\nnano-materials design, genome sequencing and analysis.\r\nIn addition, organizing such a workshop in China will\r\nbring prominent researchers from U.S. and Europe working in such\r\nan active scientific research area to Asia, consequently, the anticipated\r\nworkshop will do a good service to and have a positive impact on\r\nthe international applied and computational mathematics community.\r\n",
