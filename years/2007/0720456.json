 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent resurgence of research in server virtualization \r\nhas created a lot of interest among providers of large-scale\r\ndata centers in employing this technology to design improved \r\nsolutions for managed hosting. Virtualization holds the promise of increased\r\ndegrees of resource consolidation with accompanying reduction in\r\noperational costs of administration, repair, and electricity. \r\nDesigning efficient virtualized data centers  \r\nis therefore a desirable and worthy endeavor in multiple ways. \r\nThe transition from traditional hosting models \r\nto a virtualized model is, however, not a trivial one. Realizing\r\nthe consolidation-related benefits that virtualization has to\r\noffer requires a re-consideration of: (i) schedulers within the VMM,\r\n(ii) mechanisms for resource usage monitoring and accounting, and \r\n(iii) system-wide dynamic resource provisioning mechanisms. \r\nThis proposal identifies the key challenges that arise on\r\nall these fronts in a virtualized data center,  and \r\ndevelops a comprehensive solution, called River, to address them. \r\n\r\nRiver will make the following specific contributions: (i) improved\r\nresource management algorithms \r\nwithin the virtual machine monitor (VMM) that use both \r\nhorizontal (between the schedulers in the VMM) and vertical \r\n(between VMM and hosted OS schedulers)  co-operation, \r\n(ii) efficient and stable dynamic resource provisioning, and  \r\n(iii) systems primitives that would provide new opportunities\r\nto the provisioning algorithms for improved cost-cutting via \r\nreduction of virtualization overheads. A prototype River data center based\r\non Xen will be developed and resulting code \r\nmade available to the community. Finally, we will\r\nre-design the labs associated with the systems courses at Penn State to \r\nemploy virtualized hosting of class projects. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
