 "awd_abstract_narration": "The InterGridSolve project is developing an environment that will enable scientists to easily harness Grid resources provided by Computational Services Providers (CSPs) ranging from federally funded TeraGrid to commercially available services such as those provided by Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).  In order to support the Scientific Computing Environments (SCEs) that many scientists use in their work (e.g., Matlab, Octave), and to incorporate flexible computing models, the research is enhancing GridSolve, a pre-existing brokered RPC environment.  GridSolve is based on the GridRPC API proposed by the Open Grid Forum (OGF) and uses function handles and sessions to make remote procedure calls on Grid resources.  GridSolve includes resource scheduling, execution monitoring and fault tolerance.  General purpose data movement mechanisms (i.e., data handles) are being designed and added to GridSolve in order to enable workflow applications.  The data handle mechanisms are to be proposed as extensions to the GridRPC API.  Tools to enable workflow applications on Grid resources using data handles in GridSolve are being explored, and several classes of workflow applications (such as simple DAGs) are being implemented.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  This project will enable computational scientists across multiple domains to use their accustomed SCEs to access Grid resources made available by various service providers, and to run computationally intensive, workflow jobs on these resources.",
