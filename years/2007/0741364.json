 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education:  A Spiral Curriculum Approach, at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, under the direction of Dr. Ishwar Puri will create a nanotechnology curriculum based on the well-established spiral theory that instructs undergraduate engineering students in current and emerging topics in nanotechnology, thus enhancing their scientific literacy and helping prepare the nanotechnology workforce of tomorrow.  To accomplish this goal a collaborative effort will be undertaken between the Engineering Education (EngE) and Engineering Science and Mechanics (ESM) Departments within the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech in collaboration with its Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science to develop and integrate multiple nanotechnology-based learning modules and courses into the first year General Engineering (GE) and sophomore through senior ESM curricula using a spiral approach.  This approach will expose all engineering undergraduates in the nation's seventh largest engineering program to basic fundamentals of nanotechnology including its ethical considerations.  The nanotechnology option within the ESM program will provide opportunities for advanced nanotechnology research and instruction.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering Program Solicitation (NSF 07-554), and is being funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).",
