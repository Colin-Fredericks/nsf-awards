 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the third Conference on Indigenous Languages of Latin America (CILLA-III) to be held at the University of Texas at Austin. The conference brings together indigenous scholars working on their own languages, other Latin American scholars working on the languages of the region, and scholars from the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere who work on Latin American indigenous languages. Four keynote speakers have been invited and 46 papers have been accepted.\r\n\r\nThis conference contributes to the exchange of information among these scholars, to linguistic and international activities at the University of Texas at Austin, and to the continuing education of speakers of indigenous languages who are engaged in linguistic research. Because they come from many different countries, it is difficult for scholars who work on these languages to meet.  CILLA-III gives them the opportunity to do so, thereby creating a valuable research network among U.S. and Latin American scholars.",
