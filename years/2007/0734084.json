The U.S. principal investigator is Stanley Napper from Louisiana Tech University.  The Kazakh counterpart is Gennady Piven, Rector of KSTU.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this planning visit is to establish a basis for collaborative research in nanotechnology and trenchless technology, and economic development principles which can assist in the commercialization of university research. \r\n\r\nDr. Napper and his Kazakh collaborators have laid the groundwork for this activity through previous reciprocal university visits.  The current visit will provide the US and Kazakh teams an opportunity to discuss the logistical and support resources needed for future collaborations.  Possible research projects currently include utilization of trenchless technology systems and materials for the mining industry, adaptation of mining technology for underground infrastructure problems, development of environmental sensors for the mining industry and transportation materials and systems.   While in Kazakhstan the Louisiana Tech team will also provide lectures and information on current research projects so that future exchanges may produce specific research collaborations in fields that utilize unique strengths at both institutions.\r\n",
