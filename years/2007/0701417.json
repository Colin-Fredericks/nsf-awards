The approach uses advances in ion and photon beam processing to make these structures, to understand them using advanced techniques such as Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy, and to exploit their properties in a novel device such as a Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetector.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activities\r\nThe recent discovery of semiconductor materials whose properties depend dramatically on very low levels of alloying has opened unexplored opportunities for the synthesis of these structures using ion and photon beam processing. This method is uniquely suitable for the fabrication of integrated, laterally patterned quantum structures of well-controlled size, shape, location, and connectivity.  Structurally, these materials will appear as defect-free single crystals with small variations in alloy composition; however, from an electronic point of view, they will exhibit quantum confinement.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of the Proposed Activities\r\nThis program will pave the way for future applications in chemical sensing, thermal imaging, night vision, medical diagnostics and space applications.  Several key concepts from the research will be integrated into the Research Experience for Teachers summer program, the Nanotechnology Symposium for Teachers and Guidance Counselors at the Boston Museum of Science, and the training of undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\n",
