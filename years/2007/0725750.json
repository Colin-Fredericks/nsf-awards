 "awd_abstract_narration": "The East Coast Computer Algebra Day, ECCAD'2007, meeting, will be held at Washington College in Chestertown, MD on Saturday April 21, 2007. The meeting is the fourteenth of the series of ECCAD meetings that have been held annually since 1994 at a variety of US East Coast locations. We estimate a turnout of about 80-100 participants from the Computer Algebra research community, doing either theoretical research or important applications in science and engineering.  There will be three very distinguished invited speakers: David Stoutemyer (Hawaii), Evelyne Hubert (INRIA), and George Labahn (Waterloo).  Participants will come mainly from the eastern half of North America and especially from the East Coast of the United States. In addition to the invited talks there will be contributed poster and software demonstration sessions, and a moderated panel discussion: \"What IS Computer Algebra?\".",
