In particular, the\r\ngoals of project are to study the relation between a variety of\r\nplate theories and three-dimensional elasticity theory by\r\nderiving the asymptotic limit of three-dimensional nonlinear\r\nelasticity, to justify the limit of a singularly perturbed\r\nfunctional as an Aviles-Giga functional, to investigate the\r\nevolution of interfaces in multi-phase polymer crystals growth by\r\naddressing the stability of moving fronts, and to deepen\r\nunderstanding of the homogenization limit of parabolic equations\r\nand of systems of elliptic equations in cell biology and polymer\r\nsciences. \r\n\r\n     The investigator studies nonlinear pertial differential\r\nequations that describe important behaviors of systems in\r\npolymers, materials, and cell biology.  Clear understanding of\r\nthe stability of moving interfaces helps control the interface\r\nbetween the melt and crystal to ensure high quality of polymer\r\nproduction.  Theoretical guided computation of the Young modulus\r\nin polymer nanocomposites is important to measure the strength of\r\nmicro-packaging material for computer chips.  Identifying the\r\ncorrected diffusion process for protein IP3 from cell membrane to\r\nhighly convoluted endoplastic reticulum can save huge amounts of\r\nmoney and time in fundamental scientific research in cell\r\nbiology.",
