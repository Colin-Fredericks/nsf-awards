 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, NUE: An Integrated Multidisciplinary Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education Program at the University of New Mexico, under the direction of Dr. Marwan S. Al-Haik, will develop new experiments and pedagogical methods that introduce undergraduate students to the field of nanotechnology with emphasis on nanosystems and nanodevices.  This novel approach will include the utilization of hands-on experience in the field of nanotechnology in every course developed or revised.  \"Nanotechnology Discovery Courses\" will be introduced that comprise two interlocking undergraduate Engineering Materials Science core courses enriched with three nanotechnology modules.  The fundamental nanotechnology concepts and the experimental skills acquired by the students in the discovery courses will be tied to a \"Nanosystems and Nanodevices Design Course\" course offered to four engineering departments.  Finally, nanosystem/nanodevice education and research will be meshed via the incorporation of undergradutes into the PIs nanotechnology research activities.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering Program Solicitation (NSF 07-554), and is being funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).",
