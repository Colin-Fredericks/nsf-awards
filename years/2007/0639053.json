 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi User program (CRIF:MU), the Chemistry Department at Stanford University will upgrade their infra red and fluorescence spectrometry equipment for teaching and research with acquisition of an infrared microscope with spatial resolution, FTIR monolayer analysis and diffuse reflectance accessories, and upgrade a fluorimeter with a stopped-flow module for rapid mixing capabilities and time resolution measurement of reaction rates down to the millisecond regime.  The instruments will be used in various research projects including the study of protein conformational changes using single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to make comparisons with ensemble measurements; investigations of  a wide range of biological systems include green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants, vibrational Stark effect (VSE) spectroscopy, and the analysis of model membrane surfaces with spatially resolved FTIR;  investigations to spatially resolve carbon nanotube hydrogenation chemistry at the ends and sidewalls with potential applications in hydrogen storage and nanotube nansensors; studies to develop surface functionalization chemistry for carbon, including graphite and carbon nanotubes, important to fuel cells, batteries and biosensor developments.  The instruments will be used to introduce a nanotechnology element into undergraduate teaching in the chemistry department with experiments planned for a laboratory course. The instruments  will be used by undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in their research and will benefit various outreach programs such as RET, REU and SURE, and the research of NSF-funded centers at Stanford including CPIMA and NSEC.",
