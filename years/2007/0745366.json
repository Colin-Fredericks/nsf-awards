 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed workshop provides a forum to discuss Biological Communications Technology, an emerging interdisciplinary field that integrates molecular biology and communications technology into a new computing and communication paradigm. The proposed workshop will bring together leading researchers from Biology, Nanotechnology, Communications Technology, Network Engineering, Information Theory areas to discuss key technologies, the current state of the art, and future directions of this important emerging field. The specific\r\nareas of interest of the proposed workshop are (1) design and development of networking components for biological communication systems, (2) architecture and system design methodologies for biological communication systems, (3) information and coding theory of biological communication, (4) applications of biological communications technology, (5) mathematical modeling and simulation for biological communications systems, and (6)understanding of biological communication.\r\nThe workshop is being proposed as part of the Emerging Models and Technologies for Computation (EMT) Program of NSF; and through exploring the above mentioned areas, the proposed workshop is expected to suggest what directions the CISE/CCF community and EMT program are to seek in order to create a new integrated science from Biology, Nanotechnology, Engineering and Information Science.",
