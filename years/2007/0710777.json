 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visual images that describe the location, size and shape of embedded defects provide direct\r\ninformation about the condition of a structure. Many individual data are needed to construct an\r\neffective image however, and the inherent large size of concrete structures results in an enormous\r\namount of data needed to construct an adequate image. One approach to empower the application\r\nof ultrasound for such imaging is to eliminate the need for physical contact between the sensor\r\nand tested structure. The PI has recently completed research on air-coupled ultrasonic testing for\r\nconcrete. The research findings illustrate that ultrasonic waves traveling through concrete can be\r\ndetected with a fully contact-free configuration using air-coupled sensors. In this project, the\r\nefficacy of air-coupled ultrasonic tomographic imaging will be investigated. The methods will first be\r\nevaluated experimentally using reduced-scale (fifth-scale) concrete column samples. Both\r\nrectangular and circular cross-sectioned column samples will be considered for each scan\r\nconfiguration. Some concrete samples will contain embedded artificial volumetric (void) and\r\nplanar (crack) defects. Other defect-free specimens will be subjected to simulated seismic loads,\r\nusing the fifth-scale test facility at the University of Illinois. Application to full-scale concrete\r\ncolumns, which are currently being tested as part of a NEES small group project at the University\r\nof Illinois, will then follow; the columns will be non-destructively imaged before and after the\r\nmechanical (seismic) loading is applied as part of the NEES project.\r\n Successful completion of the work will enable unparalleled internal\r\ndefect characterization for concrete structures. At the same time, the effort provides a unique\r\nopportunity to extend development of an emerging technology that is currently being developed\r\nby the PI: air-coupled sensing for concrete structures.\r\n",
