 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a novel thermal spray coating process called \"Hybrid Spray,\" for producing nano sized particulate dispersed metallic coatings. The introduction of nanoparticulates into the metal matrix is desired to improve creep strength as well as high temperature wear and oxidation resistance. This work will target the development of coatings for power generation industry where the ability to operate at higher temperatures will enable greater efficiencies and the longevity of coatings will reduce the operating costs. Midwest Thermal Spray (MTS) will develop the `Hybrid Spray' technology conceptualized at the University of Michigan. \r\n\r\nThe process offers the benefits of low cost wire stock and high productivity combined with noticeably improved coating density. Current techniques for fabricating nano particle embedded engineered materials involve multiple processing steps leading to high manufacturing cost. As a result, the widespread application of nano particulate dispersed coatings in commercial applications is severely limited. The \"Hybrid\" spray system to be developed can be a generic system for creating and introducing nanoparticles into variety of matrix materials for different applications. \r\n\r\n",
