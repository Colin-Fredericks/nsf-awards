 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nECCS-0725613\r\nSigfrid Yngvesson, University of Massachusetts, Amherst\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: This proposal combines two research areas: terahertz technology and nanotechnology. 'Terahertz' refers to electromagnetic waves with frequencies that are of the order of 1012 Hertz, faster than any transistors can operate. The researchers from the University of Massachusetts have developed terahertz detectors for space science applications, and now aim at developing detectors for terahertz radiation that are potentially useful for non-astronomy applications. Their novel idea for a terahertz detector takes advantage of the exceptional electronic transport properties of   metallic Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes, with diameter of typically 0.6-1.5 nm, much smaller than previous detectors. The device consists of a short carbon nanotube, connected to a photo-etched terahertz antenna on a silicon substrate. Terahertz radiation is converted either to DC or (when two terahertz frequencies are incident) to a microwave frequency which can be further amplified. The unique property of the proposed SWNT detector is that it is predicted to be able to operate one hundred times faster than previous detectors, and function at higher temperatures. The group has demonstrated prototypes of such detectors for microwaves and terahertz radiation. A very important component of this proposal is ab-initio simulations of the devices, literally atom by atom, performed by Co-PI Polizzi, internationally recognized expert on simulations of nano devices, and his students.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The University of Massachusetts researchers have a long record of   involving students at all levels down to high school in their research. The students also are exposed to the broader nanotechnology program at the university. Unique terahertz and nano-technology infrastructure is being built up. The potential applications for the proposed device are to Terahertz Imaging Systems for security-related detection, as well as medical imaging.  The devices could also be applied in terahertz spectroscopy for detection of chemical species. These applications can potentially provide substantial benefits to society.  \r\n",
