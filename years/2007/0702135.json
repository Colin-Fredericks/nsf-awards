 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Richard Castenholz (University of Oregon), Timothy McDermott (Montana State University), and Scott Miller, and Frank Rrosenzweig (both of University of Montana) to study the unicellular algae of the order Cyanidiales that thrive in extreme environments in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). The sheer numbers, biomass, and brilliant blue-green color establish these algae as a dominant feature of the microbial communities inhabiting acidic geothermal springs and are especially conspicuous in YNP.  There is considerable interest in studying how these simple plant-like microorganisms tolerate the extreme environmental features [high temperature, acidity, heavy metal(loid)s] that define their habitat. These algae contain nearly the smallest numbers of genes of all photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms and are also structurally relatively simple. Current efforts have resulted in major discoveries regarding population diversity and dynamics, generating evidence that strongly suggests that UV radiation is a keystone environmental factor that governs the general health and activity of these algae in these harsh environments. The experiments to be conducted in this study will continue to explore the genetic and physiologic mechanisms and processes of these algae with the goal being to better appreciate how these algae thrive in such extreme environments.  Gene expression will be studied in response to UV irradiation in pure cultures and in YNP geothermal springs inhabited by these algae. The study of these algae occupies a key link in the study of the thermophilic microorganisms in Yellowstone, and will align closely with the work of other scientists in YNP to maximize research synergy and discovery. This work should also result in an improved understanding of factors that limit the environmental range of plants in general.\r\n\r\nYNP is a World Heritage Convention Site and an UNESCO Biosphere Preserve; however, there is a paucity of information for use in assessing the ecological health of YNP (including any temporal changes due to natural or anthropogenic activity).  Work in this study represents a critical resource evaluation tool for YNP managers, who depend almost entirely on academic scientists to document the diversity and richness of species within the park.  Furthermore, information generated in this study will be used in YNP's education and outreach efforts to educationally enrich the millions of park visitors who marvel at YNP's geothermal pools and springs, with some of the most obvious and frequently viewed springs being those that are home to extensive Cyanidiales mats.  Finally, work to be completed in this study also bears on human resource development.  Graduate and undergraduate students will obtain important training, helping them acquire positions that are consistent with their early career goals (private sector, graduate school, academia).  \r\n",
