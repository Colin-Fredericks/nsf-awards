Wang, Southern Illinois University of Carbondale\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop network analyzer on chip (NAoC) for biological and chemical sensing in frequency domain through microwave dielectric spectroscopy.  Integrated tunable radio frequency (RF) signal sources and broadband six-port networks will be developed and characterized from ~ 1 GHz to ~ 10 GHz.  The performance of the integrated NAoC system will be characterized and demonstrated through on-chip sensing and analysis of water, DNA and other chemical agents.   Self-calibration capabilities will also be developed. Approaches to balance the trade-offs among NAoC performance, costs, complexity, and convenience to use will be established for the targeted sensing applications.\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This is the first effort to systematically develop tunable, broadband and miniaturized integrated microwave circuits and components in complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology for NAoC applications; this is the first effort to develop an integrated broadband vector NAoC for on-chip scattering parameter measurements; this is the first effort to incorporate self-calibration capabilities into an integrated dual six-port network analyzer in CMOS technology; this is the first effort to demonstrate NAoC for on-chip sensing through microwave dielectric spectroscopy.  \r\nBroader Impact:  The obtained six-port network also opens a new avenue for potential applications in broadband communication systems and software defined radio.  In addition to the integrated graduate and undergraduate curriculum development and improvement, the project will promote diversity in engineering research and education.\r\n",
