 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this (SGER) is to develop the foundation for investigating the selective deposition and opto-mechanical characterization of chitosan biopolymer material on the InP optical MEMS/NEMS detection platform. . The following three tasks will be conducted for this SGER program: \r\n(a) Chitosan electrodeposition conditions will be characterized using a combinatorial approach to achieve optimal morphology and thickness of the film on the InP microstructures, \r\n(b) Design of the InP Optical MEMS/NEMS platform will be modified based on the optimum chitosan electrodeposition results to maximize displacement sensitivity, \r\n(c) DNA hybridization detection with probe DNA molecules conjugated to the chitosan film will be demonstrated for the first time using InP optical MEMS/NEMS devices. \r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe major advantage of our proposed design is that it will enable single-chip portable detection of biohazards. Microcantilever sensors have been shown as powerful analytical tools that do not require labeling of the sample. The on-chip optical detection will provide a miniaturized yet highly sensitive readout scheme appropriate for portable devices. In addition, the use of chitosan as a biointerface will increase the target biomolecule density of the cantilever, resulting in large resonant frequency shifts. The detection system proposed  is compatible with batch microfabrication. Large numbers of sensors can be fabricated in parallel on the same chip to screen for different analytes with very low cost and high throughput. \r\nBroader Impact \r\nThe resulting devices will be small, inexpensive, and will require minimal sample preparation and no external readout equipment. This technology will result in developing microcantilever sensors to screen for diseases and biohazard agents at remote locations without the need for highly qualified laboratory technicians or equipment. This project will also have considerable educational value at the University of Maryland (UMD). Primarily U.S. undergraduate and graduate students will be recruited for this work. The concepts of this research will be transferred to the two graduate-level project-based MEMS courses, ENEE 605 and ENEE 719F, in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department (ECE) at UMD.   The outcome of this research will also be used for K-12 outreach activities including Maryland Day in spring semesters. \r\n \r\n1\r\n",
