 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iowa State University (ISU) and Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC) are partnering on this project to increase the number of students graduating with a bachelor's degree in engineering at ISU and the number of students in STEM areas of study at DMACC. Retention is being increased by a new learning community model, called a learning village or meta-community. The learning village model incorporates various learning communities as well as service learning projects for engineering students in their second and third years of study. First-year and gateway engineering courses are being reviewed to better engage students, to provide flexibility, and to support transfer students. The ACCESS program makes gateway courses available through distance education. Student-centered advising broadens the diversity of students enrolled in engineering and makes students aware of the various paths to successfully completing an engineering degree, including transfer from a community college. ISU Extension is a partner on the project to develop the STEM TEC (Talent in Every County) initiative.\r\n",
