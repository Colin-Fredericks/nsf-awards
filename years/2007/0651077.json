 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for the support of work to study a broad class of stochastic processes,\r\nboth classical and quantum, involving noise-induced escape from the basin of attraction\r\nof a locally stable state. The proposed research involves the development of new\r\nmathematical techniques for analyzing these processes, and their application to a\r\nvariety of open problems in condensed matter and nuclear physics associated with\r\nnucleation processes in systems both at and away from equilibrium.\r\nIntellectual merit of proposed activity. The choice of research projects described herein\r\nis guided by three objectives. They are: development of techniques that broaden the\r\nvariety of systems and situations accessible to theoretical analysis; application of these\r\ntechniques to the solution of open problems in physical systems; and testing, both\r\nexperimentally and numerically, of the resulting predictions. The overall research\r\nprogram aims towards a significant advance in our understanding of nonlinear\r\ndynamical systems perturbed by weak noise, a class of systems that cuts across many\r\nscientific disciplines.\r\nBroader impact of proposed activity. Mathematical methods developed by the PI and\r\ncollaborators will be applied to a broad range of systems that, put together, are of\r\nfundamental scientific importance in a variety of scientific fields, and at the same time\r\nhave promising future technological applications. These include magnetization reversal\r\nin nanomagnets, stability and lifetimes of monovalent metallic nanowires, decay of\r\nhigh-angular momentum superdeformed nuclear states, the thermal activation$quantum\r\ntunneling transition, and electroconvective pattern formation in liquid crystals. These\r\nproblems are accessible through a unified mathematical approach resulting from the\r\nwork of PI and collaborators. Training will be provided to postdoctoral researchers,\r\ngraduate students, and, if possible, undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds.\r\nFor example, the proposal includes an experimental/numerical/theoretical collaboration\r\nin the study of thermally induced magnetization reversal in submicron-scale\r\nferromagnetic annuli. The experiment, already in its initial stages, is designed to test\r\ntheoretical predictions of the PI and others, and is largely being carried out by a\r\ngraduate student towards a Ph.D. thesis. There should also be several resulting\r\noutreach activities, including presentations to classes at local K-12 schools, science\r\nprojects for NYC high school students participating in science competitions for\r\nscholarships, and lectures to graduate students in other fields at multidisciplinary\r\nsummer schools. Finally, the applicability of the PI?s work to areas of potential\r\ntechnological importance has already led to one patent application, and is likely to lead\r\nto more.\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nDiary Note\r\nProposal:0651077 PI Name:Stein, Daniel\r\nPrinted",
