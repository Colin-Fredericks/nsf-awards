 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent introduction and rapid growth of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) technology provide a platform to exploit the huge capacity of optical fiber in computing and communication systems.  The main difficulty of optical packet switching is how to resolve packet contention while minimizing packet loss. In this SGER project, a novel packet buffering scheme is explored for WDM optical interconnects which combines optical switching with electronic buffering. In the proposed scheme, arrived packets that do not cause contention are switched to output fibers directly; other packets are switched to shared receivers and converted to electronic signals and will be stored in the buffer until being sent out by shared transmitters. This project focuses on exploring the feasibility of the proposed buffering scheme. The performance of the scheme is studied through analytical modeling and simulations, and several related implementation issues are also investigated. The outcome of this project will be the foundation on which subsequent research on WDM optical packet interconnects will be launched to provide high-performance interconnects that enjoy both fast switching and large buffering capacity for \r\nfuture computer systems.",
