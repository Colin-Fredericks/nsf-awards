 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an international research collaboration between the University of Delaware (USA), the University of Bochum (Germany), and the German Aerospace Center (DLR, Germany), investigating the high temperature response of material systems with interfaces of dissimilar materials.  Understanding the high temperature response for such systems has important implications on many applications, ranging from high temperature materials such as thermal barrier coatings, to the new generations of electronic components, such as Nano/Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (N/MEMS).  Multi-material systems exhibit time and temperature dependent materials evolution, such as interdiffusion, precipitating and dissolution of phases, along with chemical reactions at elevated temperatures.  In addition to such complex material evolution, most high temperature applications are subjected to both thermal and mechanical cyclic loading.  The interaction between the time-dependent processes and the degradation due to cyclic loads is highly non-linear.  Thus, it is difficult to use common approaches of accelerated testing for lifetime assessment under realistic loading conditions, as well as reproducing realistic load spectra and realistic time scales in a laboratory environment.  This work aims to develop a combined experimental and numerical technique for accelerated testing and life-time prediction of material systems with interfaces of dissimilar materials subjected to high temperatures.  Complementary expertise from the three organizations  provides a unique synergistic research environment, enabling the research goals to be reached.   \r\n\r\nA major broader impact of the proposal lies within a significant education component, including involving about five undergraduate students  in particular from underrepresented groups  in the research.  Furthermore, a key part of the project is a transatlantic student exchange, where two graduate students from the University of Delaware spend up to six months each at state-of-the-art research laboratories in Germany.  Reciprocal visits from the German counterparts enhance the international experience. \r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\n",
