 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award funded by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program in the Chemistry Division will support the group of Dr. W. Andy Tao of Purdue University to devise novel strategies based on nanotechnology and proteomics to target, identify, and quantify proteins in low abundance in vitro and in living systems. The cornerstone of this strategy is a soluble, globular nanopolymer which can be chemically manipulated to target subsets of the proteome, and to facilitate the isolation of tagged biomolecules for highly efficient mass spectrometric analysis. The proposed technique will take advantage of the homogeneity of solution-phase reactions, the convenience of solid-phase capture and release processes, and the unique characteristics of cell-permeable nanoparticles. Potential applications include a broad range of important biological issues such as enzyme activities, chemical toxicity, and ligand-protein interactions in the most physiologically relevant settings possible. \r\n\r\nProfessor Tao also proposes an innovative educational approach to involve a large number of undergraduate freshmen and sophomores in authentic scientific research within their regular laboratory curriculum. This aspect of the effort will aim to enhance interest in the physical sciences by including more research experiences in the educational process, especially early on when many students are making or adjusting their choice of majors.",
