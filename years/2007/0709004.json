 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding star formation requires that one understand the physical conditions in molecular clouds - the nature of turbulent motions that can oppose gravity, the effects that newborn stars have on their natal clouds, and the physics and chemistry of dust and molecules. Outflows from protostars are a primary candidate for driving turbulent motions in star-forming clouds, and the shocks from those outflows can significantly alter chemistry, temperature, density, and dust properties.  To this end, Drs. Remy Indebetouw and Michael Skrutskie (University of Virginia) and Michael Meyer (University of Arizona) will carry out a near-infrared survey of protostellar outflow activity to better understand the mechanical feedback of protostars on their natal molecular clouds. Narrow-band images of 16 star formation regions will be obtained, simultaneously in emission lines from Fe+ (at 1.257 and 1.644 microns), and H2 (at 2.122 microns). The regions will be chosen to span protostellar mass, evolutionary state, and environment. These measurements will provide a complete survey of atomic (stronger) and molecular (weaker) shocks in each star-forming cloud.\r\n\r\nThis research will result in a data legacy, a hardware/facility legacy, and education and training.  Calibrated narrow-band images will be made publicly available.  An astronomy postdoc and several undergraduate and graduate students will receive training on instrumentation, large project design and implementation, and observing techniques, as well as star formation physics.  The survey will be carried out by combining an existing camera (the Two-Micron All Sky Survey camera, currently in storage) and telescope (the Steward 61-inch on Mt. Bigelow) to enable interesting science at modest cost. At the same time, making available a capable bright-time instrument on a well-maintained telescope that is currently used primarily during dark time will provide a useful new facility for the community. The 61-inch telescope is also used by the University of Arizona's \"Astronomy Camp\", which offers science and engineering astronomy experience to teens, adults, and educators.  Infrared observing offers an interesting contrast in technique to optical observing, so this project will expand the opportunities and educational activities. This project will specifically fund a Virginia teacher to attend the Camp, work with this hardware and science, and then return to work with Dr. Indebetouw to be a lead astronomy educator, spreading their experience and knowledge to other local teachers.",
