 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project assesses magnetic recording as a technology for parallel assembly of\r\nnanostructures into larger devices with < 10 nm resolution, determines the fundamental\r\nlimitations of this approach for nanomanufacturing, and investigates its societal and\r\nhistorical context as a nanotechnology. In this approach, a nanopositioning system scans\r\na magnetic recording head, which records bits onto media underlying a microfluidic cell\r\ncontaining magnetic nanostructures. An array of these media/cell structures allows cell\r\nrecording in parallel, and with different patterns. Bottom-up assembly will be\r\ndemonstrated by using the stray fields emitted by these recorded patterns to temporarily\r\nimmobilize the nanostructures, followed by permanent fixing through curing the cell\r\nfluid. The spatial repeatability of resulting nanostructure assemblies will be related to\r\nvariances in instrument stability, nanoscale positioning, assembly process, and the\r\nfundamental limits of the recording process. As a societal corollary to the technical\r\ncomponents, the nano-community's awareness of the spatial tolerances currently\r\nachieved in magnetic recording will be investigated. In conjunction, a historical study of\r\nthe magnetic recording community will produce a model of the interactions and isolations\r\nof nanotechnology sub-communities (silos), to identify where current and future\r\nnanotechnologies fail to connect, and the impacts on nanomanufacturing innovation. \r\n     If magnetic recording enables nanometer precision in aligning nanostructures over\r\nmicrometer dimensions, potential applications range from building active nano-optical\r\nstructures, assembling next-generation solar cells for alternative energy production,\r\nforming biological and chemical sensor technologies, to building implantable medical\r\ndevices for disease diagnosis and treatment. Because of its scale, this technology could be\r\nincorporated into a device the size of a disk drive, allowing on-site customization by the\r\nend user. By leveraging the electronics for error rate control, mechanical positioning, and\r\nother attributes already available in commercial disk drives, this technology could emerge\r\nwith proven reliability, increasing its chance of acceptance by consumers. Understanding\r\nhow the demand for information storage, enabled by technology scalability, rapidly\r\nmoved magnetic recording to the nanoscale, will help increase communication among\r\nengineers and scientists, as well as industry and academia. This project will extend\r\nUSC's South Carolina Citizen's School of Nanotechnology by adding a classroom\r\ncomponent about technology manufacturing for the general public, as well as for students\r\nacross different disciplines.",
