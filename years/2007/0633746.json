To appeal to diverse learning syles, the investigators are developing instructional materials based on a hybrid of Problem-Base Learning (PBL) and Active/Cooperative Learning (ACL) techniques that incorporate both visual, interactive teaching methods and extensive use of modern computational approaches.  They are mapping the department's objectives and ABET outcomes to the electromagnetic courses to identify objectives and outcomes for each course.  Each course has a \"Course Portfolio\" with six or seven PBL modules containing instructional and assessment materials along with suggested teaching strategies. MATLAB-based interactive programs and in-class ACL activities are being developed and included in the material.  The evaluation effort, led by an local expert in evaluation, uses quantitative and qualitative techniques to assess instructional materials, the learning process, student learning, and retention. The materials and results are being disseminated through conferences, journal papers, and websites and through a faculty workshop.  The broader impacts include the dissemination of the materials and the involvement of a substantial number of Hispanic students at this institution.\r\n",
