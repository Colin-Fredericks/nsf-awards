The site-specific modification of particle surfaces, i.e., patch particles, and subsequent molecularly directed assembly advance the area of self-assembly by providing guidelines for the choice of binding energies, particle concentrations, and patch sizes. The T-structure assembly serves as a model system for achieving branched structures containing the elements crucial for three-dimensional assembly. Further, the patchy particles may also serve as surfactants, sensors, and particle probes for the advancement of the understanding of colloidal suspensions and emulsion stabilization. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nCCNY is a recognized minority-serving institution, which serves a diverse undergraduate student body of Hispanic (36%), African American (30%), Asian (23%), and White (21%) students. The students will profit from the active research in the area of molecularly directed particle assembly. The organization of an IREU program provides CCNY undergraduates with exposure to research at an international level. Further, the individual mentoring proposed will provide female and minority students with a mentoring network early on in their careers. Collaboration with the Louis-Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) will channel students from underrepresented groups into the program. The exposure of future journalists, writers, and producers to nanotechnology is likely to have a strong impact on our media-oriented society and will help to increase the awareness of non-technical writers to the potential applications of nanotechnology and the effect of public opinion on the development of the area.\r\n\r\n",
