 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to the national need to improve the quality of science learning, instruction, and assessment, the five-year WestEd-submitted proposal aims at pioneering simulation-based, curriculum-embedded, inquiry formative assessments with immediate, individualized feedback and supporting reflection activities for middle school students in life, physical, and earth science. In a joint effort with AAAS Project 2061, WestEd plans to scale-up exemplars from Calipers I - an ESI-funded demonstration project focused on using simulations to assess complex science learning - and build on a REC-supported project - Validities of Standards-Based Science Inquiry Assessments: Implementation Study. The proposal's objectives are: (1) to develop formative and benchmark simulation-based assessments of science knowledge for key content in physical, life, and earth science, and for science inquiry strategies; (2) to enhance formative assessment simulation modules with immediate, individualized feedback, reflection activities, and supplementary instructional hints; (3) to develop and document technology-based assessment designs and exemplars that take advantage of simulation environments to provide assessment of science standards for formative and summative purposes; (4) to document the technical infrastructure and re-usable designs and processes employed; (5) to provide evidence of the technical quality, feasibility, and usability of the new assessments; (6) to study the influence of formative assessments on complex science inquiry learning; and (7) to link the enlarged collection of Calipers II benchmark and formative and embedded assessments to national science standards and the AAAS item clusters.\r\n\r\nAnticipated products include six sets of validated simulation-based formative assessments, and a scalable model for middle school science assessment. AAAS' reviews (standards alignment), an Advisory Panel, and an external evaluator characterize the proposed evaluation. Dissemination plans include presentations in major professional organizations, sharing of exemplars through WestEd's Center for Assessment and Evaluation of Student Learning site, and linkages to other websites (e.g., AAAS). \r\n",
