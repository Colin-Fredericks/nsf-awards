 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to describe the interaction between visuo-spatial\r\nand analytical strategies during learning and problem solving in science. Recent studies\r\nhave indicated that some scientific problems that had been assumed to require a spatial\r\nvisualization strategy, in fact are often solved by analytic strategies. Therefore, the PIs\r\npropose a three-phase project to characterize the use of cognitive strategies during\r\nspatial problem solving in both general and organic chemistry. They aim to identify the\r\ndifferential use of visuo-spatial strategies and the availability of analytical strategies for\r\nscientific problem solving by students and instructors, individuals with high and low\r\nspatial ability, and men and women. They will also develop and evaluate methods of\r\ntraining these strategies. In Phase I of the project they will conduct task and protocol\r\nanalyses of student and instructor problem solving in the domain of chemistry and in\r\nspatial ability measures. In Phase II, they will collect data on students spatial abilities,\r\ngender, and educational background to identify the determinants of strategy use in\r\nvisuo-spatial problem solving, both generally and in the chemistry domain. In Phase III,\r\nthey will train chemistry teaching assistants to teach alternative strategies to students in\r\ntheir class discussion sections. They will examine the effects of strategy training on\r\nproblem solving by students of different levels of spatial abilities by assessing their\r\nstrategies before an after instruction.",
