 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nBased on the experience of the Network Performance Research Laboratory (NetPRL) faculty and feedback from the computer engineering industrial advisory board, a knowledge and skills gap exists between the engineering curricula and real world engineering experience. In this project, investigators at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) are advancing knowledge and understanding in the areas of project-based learning, multidisciplinary projects, undergraduate research, and teamwork. The researchers are developing a new electronics design and manufacturing course, a new introduction to systems design course, and are incorporating a scalable solution to project-based learning into the curriculum. All students are participating in the project-based learning capstone course using the hands-on Printed Circuit Board (PCB) model developed at Cal Poly. \r\n\r\nThis arrangement allows the students to experience true concurrent engineering through an integrated design, manufacturing, and testing experience. Students are learning how to communicate and overcome obstacles in a multidisciplinary team and they are gaining valuable skills needed to transition to jobs in industry and to participate in advanced research projects. The revised course sequence and project-based learning component is providing students with an enriched learning experience and is addressing ABET program assessment outcomes. \r\n\r\nCal Poly is partnering with a local community college to develop a lower-division PCB design and manufacturing module. The lower-division PCB module will make printed circuit board design accessible to a larger group of people including community college and high school students. The adaptation of the lower division PCB module is being introduced at Allan Hancock College, a Hispanic Serving Institution (TitleV). Developing and offering this curriculum in collaboration with the local community college faculty is fostering the growth of a community of scholars. \r\n\r\n",
