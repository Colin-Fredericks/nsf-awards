 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division Researv in the Division of Materials Research provides partial support to the Imaging and Neutrons (IAN2006) Workshop at Oak Ridge, TN in October 23-25, 2006. The goals of the workshop are three-fold: (1) identify the current needs and potential contributions of imaging with neutrons in a wide range of science and areas of applications; (2) recognize new imaging techniques that may be made possible by advanced next generation sources that go beyond established techniques of radiography and tomography; (3) produce a report identifying both potentially valuable imaging techniques and directions for additional research and investment to realize this potential worldwide.\r\nThe workshop is sponsored by a range of Federal and international agencies and it covers a broad range of topics in \"Imaging and Neutrons\", such as neutron radiography and tomography, imaging of dynamic systems, phase contrast enhancements, microscopy with neutron optics, imaging with spin-polarized neutrons.  New methods for whole human body imaging followed by gamma ray imaging will also be presented. These will have application in water distribution in sedimentary formations, oil flow in operating internal combustion engines, water plugs in hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells, swords and helmets in archeological studies, and structures of explosive devices. Funds from the National Science Foundation will support participation of young scientists and engineers particularly from underrepresented groups.\r\n",
