 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate an improved anode material for lithium-ion batteries using novel hollow carbon nanospheres. Li-ion batteries are currently the preferred form of rechargeable energy storage for many portable devices such as laptop computers and cell phones because of their high energy density, low weight, and high current discharge capabilities. This project seeks to develop new materials for these batteries that will improve the energy storage and lifetime while reducing the production cost. The proposed material is hollow carbon nanospheres which are highly structured graphitic spheres with approximately 40 nm diameters. The production process used to produce the nanospheres is unique from other nanomaterials in that the feedstocks are renewable or recyclable, reducing costs and mitigating the environmental impact caused by waste products. This project will demonstrate that improving the material structure of the anode on the nanoscale will improve the overall performance of the Li-ion battery. This is a demonstration of the promise of nanotechnology to improve products through the rational manipulation of material properties at the microscopic level. This Phase I SBIR project will involve collaboration between industry and academia, providing educational experiences in cutting edge science and engineering for both graduate researchers and undergraduate interns.",
