 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand how color diversity is organized in hummingbird communities. In tropical mountain forests, these communities have high numbers of coexisting species (i.e., up to 20 species in a squared kilometer) and a varied array of color phenotypes. Color variation among coexisting bird species is presumed to be the result of either species recognition or adaptation to the environment. These hypotheses will be addressed by analyzing patterns in the distribution of evolutionary relationships and color phenotypes among coexisting hummingbird species. \r\n\r\nPreliminary analyses indicate that color variation in different feather patches in hummingbirds is driven by different mechanisms. For example, coloration in feather patches involved in aggressive or breeding displays is variable among species and stands out from the background, whereas coloration in the back feathers is similar among species and to the background. These results emphasize the high lability of coloration in hummingbirds but also the different roles played by different parts of the body. Coloration is an important trait in avian evolution and it is the main character used to identify bird species. Results of this project will provide a baseline from which we can better understand the remarkable color diversity present in avian communities.",
