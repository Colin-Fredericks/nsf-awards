 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will study quantum groups, Hecke algebras, and the efficient description of particular bases of these which were introduced by Kazhdan, Lusztig, and Kashiwara.\r\nThese algebra bases, which facilitate representation theoretic computations, currently have somewhat cumbersome recursive descriptions.\r\nImproved descriptions will employ combinatorial interpretation, nonnegativity properties, and cluster algebras.\r\n\r\nThe importance of quantum group representations has been widely recognized since the 1980s, when Sklyanin and others found that these representations provide solutions to physical problems arising in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics.\r\nReformulating questions in different mathematical terms, Drinfeld and Jimbo then inspired a truly enormous volume of research in mathematics and physics. Physicists contributed substantial mathematical results and applied these to study a variety of physical phenomena.  Examples include rotations and vibrations in atomic nuclei, and, rather recently, mutations in genetic code.\r\nMathematicians too used their areas of expertise not only to help explain quantum group representations, but to apply new knowledge to other mathematical problems.\r\nThe PI will continue work, initiated by Kauffman and others, to efficiently describe quantum group representations by replacing certain cumbersome recursive procedures with combinatorial diagrams of wires and knots.\r\nHe will also continue his past work to construct, from these diagrams, mathematical tools  for studying inequalities satisfied by symmetric functions.\r\n",
