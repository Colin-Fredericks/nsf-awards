 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to support US-based participants in the conference \"Extremal Problems in Complex and Real Analysis,\" which will be held at Peoples Friendship University of Russia, Moscow, Russia, on May 22-26, 2007.  The unifying theme of the conference is the role that solutions of extremal problems play in various areas of function-theoretic research, such as Banach spaces of analytic functions and function-related operator theory and the interplay between approximation theory and complex and harmonic analysis. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the conference is twofold: it has an educational component and a research component. There will be three minicourses given by B.Bojanov (Bulgarian Academy of Science and University of Sophia), P.Duren (University of Michigan), and E.Saff (Vanderbilt University). Each minicourse will target a wide audience, including advanced graduate students.  In addition, there will be invited research talks and shorter contributed research talks.  It is expected that the conference will be attended by a large, internationally diverse group of experts in the field, with a special emphasis placed on participation by junior faculty, postdocs, and advanced graduate students. \r\n",
