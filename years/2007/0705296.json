 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to develop and install a 3-5micron imaging system in the 10microns Nulling Infrared Camera now under construction at the University of Arizona for operation at the coherent focus of the Large Binocular Telescope. Having two 8.4-meter mirrors separated by a 14.4-meter baseline on a single steerable platform enables Fizeau (direct imaging) interferometry with 30 milliarcseconds full width at half maximum at 4microns over a field of view limited only by the isoplanatic angle. The Large Binocular Telescope permits unprecedented angular resolution and that combined with the system's high infrared sensitivivity, 20 and 17.5 mag at L-prime and M band respectively, will permit a broad range of astronomical applications and potential groundbreaking science.  These include being able to detect warm Jupiters in nearby (d<50parsecs) young (t<1Gigagyears) systems, investigate local and distant star formation regions, and also study ultra-luminous infrared galaxies at larger redshift.",

The LBT is unique in the world in that it incorporates two giant 8.4-meter diameter mirrors onto a single platform.   These huge mirrors are precisely controlled (at a level corresponding to 1/100th the diameter of a human hair) to act in unison like a single telescope capable of delivering images equivalent to a 23-meter diameter aperture.   The instrument that makes this combination possible is the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) constructed by the University of Arizona and funded by NASA.   The instrument constructed with the support of this grant (LMIRcam - the Lbt Mid-InfraRed Camera) resides at the \"combined interferometric focus\" provided by the LBTI and is meant to provide the world's best sensitivity and image resolution at mid-infrared wavelengths.  At these wavelengths warm objects glow with copious quantities of infrared light but emit  little or no visible light.   At the wavelengths where LMIRcam operates the LBT can resolve angular detail as small as 0.03 arcseconds (the angular size of a penny viewed from 70 miles away).  This capability makes LMIRcam uniquely qualified to explore the environs of forming stars where warm dust,  warm enough to glowin the infrared, provides the raw material for forming new planetary systems.  LMIRcam is also a workhorse instrument for detecting and characterizing planetary systems around other stars.  Newly formed giant planets are warm and glow in the infrared - as Jupiter did when it was young and still does at a low level today.   Finding extrasolar planets is all about \"contrast\" - distinguishing a faint planet from the overwhelming glow of it's parent star (the moth in the searchlight problem) - LMIRcam represents the world's best contrast capability for detecting these planets thanks to the exquisitely designed adaptive optics secondary mirrors on the LBT.   NSF support for the LMIRcam project permitted astronomers from the Universities of Virginia, Minnesota and Arizona to collaborate in the design and construction of the LMIRcam camera system to realize the promise outlined above.  The system is designed around a Teledyne Imaging Systems 2048x2048 5.2um cutoff infrared array.    Each pixel on the array corresponds to a remarkably small 0.01 arcseconds on the sky.

At the same time, the project has achieved the broader impact of maintaining and extending US leadership in astronomy by delivering a capability unparalleled anywhere else in the world.   Another important promised broader impact of the proposal was student training in astronomical instrumentation techniques.   University of Virginia graduate student Jarron Leisenring earned his Ph. D. in 2011 based largely on his work integrating the LMIRcam hardward and developing the LMIRcam readout timing code and software.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast..."
