At the graduate level, under-representation among minority groups is even more striking than at the undergraduate level; for example, African Americans comprised fewer than nine percent of graduate school enrollments and Hispanics comprised just five percent of graduate school enrollments in the early 21st Century in U.S. universities. Under-representation may even be more important in California and Texas, which are the two largest states in the country in  terms of population and also two of the most racially and ethnically diverse states. Indeed, both California and Texas are now considered to be \"majority-minority\" population states. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative renewal project -- which includes proposals  from the University of Texas at Austin, Stanford University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Southern California -- will continue to address the under representation of Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans in graduate programs in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic (SBE) sciences at these four institutions. The project will continue to increase the enrollment, retention, and successful completion of under-represented minority (URM) graduate students in the SBE Sciences at alliance institutions, with the long-term intent to increase representation among URM groups on university faculties in the SBE sciences. Two principles continue to guide efforts. Alliance partners will: 1) share ideas, best practices, and resources, and create a network to recruit and retain students for alliance universities; and 2) build on successful initiatives that have already been developed on each of the campuses so that efforts can be as cost-effective and successful as possible.   Highly collaborative and innovative methods will be used to improve efforts in recruiting and retaining minority graduate students at the institutions.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this program is to influence the future of higher education in both\r\nCalifornia and Texas. The future of higher education in these two critical majority-minority states in part depends on the ability of universities in these states to diversify the racial/ethnic mix of faculty. The collaborative effort presents one model of how to do so within the SBE sciences.\r\n",

To assist in developing and institutionalizing recruitment, retention, and placement, each campus budgeted for a Diversity Director.\n\n Several strategies were employed to recruit the most promising URM students into our SBE programs.  To expand the pool of applicants, we built partnerships with minority serving institutions in California and Texas and implemented several successful strategies.  These strategies included visits by the EDGE Diversity Director and selected faculty members to selected institutions; presentations to undergraduate students promoting our graduate programs in the SBE sciences&mdash;both at our own institutions and at feeder institutions; assisting students with applying to our programs; discussions of the rewards associated with an academic career; and dissemination of written material on the EDGE program.  At Texas A&amp;M University, the Diversity Director and other faculty coordinated with the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, a program that draws talented undergraduates from minority serving institutions located around the state. \n\nOur retention efforts recognized that URM students often face challenges such as adjusting to graduate studies, gaining proficiency with writing and methodology for the discipline, living in a new location, having limited financial resources, and little experience planning an academic career.
