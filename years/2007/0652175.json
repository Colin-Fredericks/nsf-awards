NCED is a science and technology center funded by the\r\nNational Science Foundation. It was founded in August 2002 and is headquartered at the\r\nSt. Anthony Falls Laboratory at the University of Minnesota (UM).\r\nThe title of the funded project is Experimental Study of Bed Load Sediment\r\nSorting around Spur Dikes. The total amount awarded by NCED is $30,000, covering\r\nthe cost of one machinist, one instrument specialist, one junior technician, one graduate\r\nstudent, and the travel. NCED will also provide the experimental flume and all\r\nmeasurement equipment. Because NCED will not provide support for the PI's salary,\r\nthis proposal requests additional financial support to partially cover the PI's salary.\r\nThe funded project aims to conduct experimental study on hydrodynamic flow\r\nfield and bed load sediment sorting around spur dikes at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory\r\nat UM. The goals are to study the fundamental mechanism of bed load transport under the\r\ncomplex turbulent flow field, investigate the effect of turbulent intensity on bed load\r\nsediment sorting, and obtain an accurate dataset of flow field, scour hole geometry, and\r\nbed material gradation for the verification of sediment transport models.\r\nBroad Impacts:\r\nThe broad scientific impacts are four-fold: 1) This experimental study will\r\nprovide a dataset for the testing of fractional bed load transport models; 2) The dataset\r\ncan be used to analyze the impact of turbulent intensity on bed load sorting around spur\r\ndikes; 3) The experimental dataset will also be used to verify a two-dimensional sediment\r\ntransport model developed by the P.I. at the Desert Research Institute (DRI); 4) The\r\nexperimental dataset will be available to the public through the internet.\r\nThe project will bridge the collaborations between the state of Nevada, an\r\nEPSCoR state, and NCED. The collaborative research themes are 1) mechanisms of nonuniform\r\nsediment transport in complex flow fields; 2) application of computational\r\nhydrodynamic models in simulating earth surface dynamic processes; and 3) up-scaling\r\nnumerical models for the long-term simulation of morpho-dynamic processes.\r\n",
