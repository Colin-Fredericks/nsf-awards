Costello\r\n\r\nThe moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces play a central role in many\r\nareas of mathematics and theoretical physics, including geometric\r\nand algebraic topology, symplectic topology, string theory, and\r\nnumber theory.  This project explores another manifestation of\r\nthe moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, which is maybe not so\r\nwidely known.  This is their appearance in homological algebra,\r\nand more precisely in the study of cyclic A-infinity algebras (a\r\nkind of \"Frobenius algebra up to homotopy\").  The philosophy\r\nunderlying much of this project is that everything one can say\r\nabout the homotopy types of the various moduli spaces can be\r\nexpressed in terms of the homotopy theory of cyclic A-infinity\r\nalgebras.  One precise manifestation of this philosophy (which\r\nwill be proved in this project) is that the moduli space of\r\nsurfaces arises as certain \"homology operations\" for cyclic\r\nA-infinity algebras.  This theoretical result will be used to\r\ninvestigate some concrete higher-genus aspects of the mirror\r\nsymmetry conjecture, which plays a prominent role in current work\r\non algebraic and symplectic geometry.  In particular, this\r\nproject will attempt to compute the conjectural mirror partner of\r\nthe higher-genus Gromov-Witten invariants in some examples.\r\n\r\nThe space of all possible two-dimensional shapes -- known as the\r\nmoduli space of surfaces -- has long been a fundamental object of\r\nstudy in many areas of mathematics, from geometry to number\r\ntheory.  This space also plays an important role in string\r\ntheory, the putative \"theory of everything\".  This project is\r\nconcerned with setting up a correspondence between\r\ntwo-dimensional geometry (the moduli space of surfaces) and a\r\nkind of abstract algebra.  This correspondence will be used to\r\ntest certain mathematical conjectures coming from string theory.\r\nString theorists have predicted that two different simplified\r\nmodels of string theory-- known as the A model and the B model --\r\nare mathematically equivalent.  This prediction has stimulated a\r\ngreat deal of mathematical work in the last 15 years.  The PI\r\nwill tackle some computations in the B model which have been\r\nheretofore out of reach.  The results of these computations will\r\nthen be compared with known computations in the A model,\r\nhopefully leading to further verification of the predictions of\r\nstring theory.\r\n",
