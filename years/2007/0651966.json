The research team will use laboratory studies to delve into the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the activity of naturally occurring coagulants derived from food crops grown in developing countries, such as Zea mays and Okra as well as other plants such as Opuntia sp (Nopal).  The team will also investigate the filtration properties and inactivation mechanisms of colloidal silver-treated ceramic filters, which are being made in developing countries through the work of a non-governmental organization, Potters for Peace.  Although flow characteristics are a design parameter for the filter, the anti-microbial properties of the filtering systems have not been investigated to the degree necessary for a mechanistic understanding.  The combination of the ceramic filters and the natural coagulants will also be considered.  As a measure of the sustainability, a streamlined life cycle cost analysis (LCC) and a life cycle assessment (LCA) will be conducted for the point of use system developed and compared to conventional treatment methods using alum or ferric sulfate.  \r\n\r\nThe laboratory study will be followed by field work in the colonias in an around Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, in collaboration with the Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez (UACJ).  Researchers and students from UACJ will contribute their substantial expertise to the effort.  Past research in the region by University of Virginia researchers has resulted in more environmentally benign brick kilns, the emissions of which have been studied by researchers from UACJ.  Potters for Peace has established a ceramic filter manufacturing plant about 100 miles south of the location of the field study, which will supply the filters for the field study.  The team will also work with the Center for Housing and Urban Development of Texas A&M University.  Undergraduate students from the University of Virginia will work on various aspects of both the laboratory and field studies.  The project will likely provide extensive societal and educational benefits to the colonias, and the graduate and undergraduate students of both universities.  The discoveries of fundamental mechanisms for coagulation and pathogen inactivation will inform the engineering science of water treatment.  This award is being jointly funded by the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET), and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).\r\n\r\n",
