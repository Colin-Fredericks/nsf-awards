These institutions - public and private, large and small, undergraduate, comprehensive and doctoral, together determined to impact the region in the near-term by increasing substantially the number of underrepresented students who complete degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and, in the long-term, increase the numbers who move into related careers, including graduate school on the way to a professional or research appointment.",

While the causes of these concerns are multi-faceted and potential solutions subject to rigorous debate, irrefutable is that access to and success in higher education is influenced by numerous and often interconnected social and academic factors.

The Upstate Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ULSAMP) alliance was designed to tap into the rich potential of groups historically underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, and to respond to our nation\u00c6s goals and pressing local needs. The ULSAMP alliance partners are: Clarkson University, Cornell University, Onondaga Community College, Monroe Community College, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rochester Institute of Technology, and Syracuse University (lead institution).   \n \nDuring the first five years of the grant, ULSAMP was dedicated to maximizing the potential and increasing the number of underrepresented minority (African American, Latino American and Native American) (URM) students receiving bachelor degrees in STEM. The program supported student success by providing: funding, research and internship opportunities, academic enhancement, and mentoring services.  Over the past five years, ULSAMP activities have had a major impact on the students, faculty, staff, and communities affiliated with the alliance institutions.  ULSAMP has provided numerous opportunities for the growth and development of the people involved with the project.  ULSAMP also aimed to provide students with experiences that provided a strong foundation for their future and vitality of the U.S. economic competitiveness through increased/enriched STEM workforce.  Many of these initiatives would not have been possible without the support of the National Science Foundation.\n \nInitial Objectives:\n1.     Increase entry of URM students as ULSAMP scholars by 33% above the fall 2008 level;\n2.     Increase the retention (total enrollment as a proxy) of ULSAMP scholars in STEM disciplines by 14% above the 2008 level; and\n3.     Increase graduation of ULSAMP scholars in the STEM disciplines by 41% above the 2008 level\nOutcomes:\n1.     Entry of URM 2008 = 448; Entry of URM 2011/12= 621 (39% Increase)\n2.     Retention of URM 2008= 1,765; Retention of URM 2012= 2,182 (24% increase)\n3.     Graduation of URM 2008= 249; Graduation of URM 2012= 372 (49% increase) \n \nThe Upstate Alliance institutions have benefitted greatly by being a part of the national LSAMP program.  The LSAMP grant allowed institutions to focus on diversifying student bodies, which in turn impacted the U.S. STEM workforce.  At any given time during the academic year, over 200 students were directly participating in ULSAMP programs and activities.  Having ULSAMP on our campuses fostered an environment conducive to beginning the process of institutional transformation as it relates to underrepresented students and STEM education.  Changes on campus, made possible by LSAMP funds, not only benefitted LSAMP students, but also impacted students not affiliated with the program. The ULSAMP staff placed a major focus on undergraduate student research and students from all alliance institutions were encouraged to pursue research experiences early in their academic careers.  With an increasing focus on community colleges, a number of initiatives were dev..."
