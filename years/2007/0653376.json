 "awd_abstract_narration": "In addition to being among the most energetic of astrophysical events, core collapse supernovae are the most productive factories of the heavy elements that are necessary for life.  As a result, they are critical players in the origin and evolution of the chemical elements.  Supernovae have been, and continue to be, objects of great interest to a wide range of astronomical, nuclear and particle physics experiments and observatories, from radio and optical telescopes to nuclear accelerators and neutrino and gravity wave detectors.  Here Dr. Hix will continue efforts toward improving our understanding of the nucleosynthesis that results when a core collapse supernova explodes.  This work builds on previous NSF-supported efforts and is complementary to Department of Energy funded research into the core collapse supernovae mechanism occurring at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Efforts in recent years have shown that the details of the supernova mechanism can have a large impact on the composition and distribution of supernova ejecta.  Since many of the important observations of supernovae highlight the elemental composition, accurate calculation of the nucleosynthesis is essential.  Realistic nucleosynthesis can only be calculated in a self-consistent multi-dimensional fashion, quite different from current parameterized one-dimensional models.  Therefore a series of investigations into the nucleosynthesis of such models will be conducted with the ultimate goal of self consistent nucleosynthesis, calculated within the neutrino radiation hydrodynamic models. \r\n\r\nDr. Hix will continue giving public lectures on this topic as well as participating in the development of a Nuclear Astrophysics exhibit at the American Museum of Science and Engineering in Oak Ridge, TN.  Two graduate students will also be supported and trained in supernova research and provided with access to the world class scientific environment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  It is also expected that undergraduate students will be involved in this research during the summer (supported by the state of Tennessee).",
