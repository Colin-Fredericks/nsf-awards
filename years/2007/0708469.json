Enhancing curricula, the project facilitates research and education in wireless communication, cross-layer design, dynamic spectrum access, cognitive radio, sensor networks, and multimedia services over wireless. The project also facilitates development and demonstration of a software defined radio-based wireless communication and networking laboratories. Preliminary work utilized a GNU software platform. The technologies developed are expected to make aspects of wireless transmission, reception, and networking programmable by allowing intelligent exploitation of the portion of the spectrum that is allocated but unused or underused.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Successful exploration of the issues enabled by the instrument can have significant scientific and engineering impact; additionally, the project impacts curricula and may result in enhancement of courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels, strengthening the bond between research and education. \r\n",
