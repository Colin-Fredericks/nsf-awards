This forms the basis of a 'Synthesis and Assessment Report' (SAR2.2) which is expected to be a significant government document that details the current understanding of carbon sources and sinks, fluxes and changes as well as uncertainties in that information.  Content, methodology, contributors and other background is provided at this site: http://www.isse.ucar.edu/soccr/.\r\n\r\nThis report is expected to serve as the official government statement of current understanding of the science of the carbon cycle as it operates in North America, has changed in the past and may change in future.  As such it may influence government policies and funding priorities.  It will also serve as a basic resource for other scientists, industry, government and lay people.",
