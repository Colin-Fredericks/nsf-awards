 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to explore the use of mist-deposition process as a new nanomanufacturing technology for the efficient deposition and patterning of ultrathin films of semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) in the context of developing high-performance quantum dot light emitting diodes (QD-LEDs) and QD-LED matrix displays. The process variables that control the thickness, composition, surface morphology and uniformity of the emissive NQD film will be investigated in order to establish a NQD-deposition protocol through an understanding of the formation, charging, transport, and coalescence process of the nanoscale droplets in mist-deposition process. The processing of QD-LED devices will be optimized by tailoring the thickness and morphology of NQD-active layers with the mist-deposition process. The LED performance will be characterized and correlated to the process parameters in order to study the ultimate limits of the mist-deposition technology in QD-LED processing. The employment of sequential shadow-mask patterning in the mist-deposition process will be investigated to create RGB-pixel arrays of bright QD-LEDs over large surface areas. The target of this project will be the development of a versatile, efficient, and scalable technique for manufacturing of a full-color, passive matrix QD-LED display.\r\n\r\nThis research project will address two fundamental, interrelated issues related to QD-LEDs technology: fabrication method and devices. The synergistic approach employed in this study will significantly expand the understanding of nanocrystalline quantum dots processing and device mechanism. The broader impacts of the proposed project go beyond the realm of a purely technical endeavor and are related to the anticipated future role of nanocrystalline quantum dots based devices in everyday life. For instance, technical breakthrough such as flexible displays will have a profound impact on the way we transmit and receive information. A range of new applications that will be made possible due to the improved processing of nanocrystalline semiconductors will create new sizeable markets, and hence, may have a noticeable impact of nation's economy.  The proposed study will also provide focused research and learning experience to undergraduate students by involvement in experimental laboratory work, and help them to bridge the fundamental nanoscience with the real-world applications of nanotechnology. \r\n",
