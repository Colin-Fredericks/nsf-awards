 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will develop permanent, self-cleaning, anti-fog coatings for plastic and glass surfaces. Fogging on bathroom mirrors is a common phenomenon. Fogging on a moving automotive windshield, however, represents hazardous situation. Fogging often occurs when a cold surface suddenly contacts warm, moist air. Thousands of tiny water droplets condense on the surface. These droplets scatter light in random patterns, causing the surfaces to become translucent or foggy.  The proposed research  expects to demonstrate the feasibility of a cost-effective, manufacturing technology for durable, nanoporous, super-hydrophilic coatings as a permanent solution to the fogging problem. Complete resistance to fogging is critical in viewing windows, mirrors and windshields of aircraft, military vehicles and automotives and related personal protective gear for the safe operation of these equipments. \r\n\r\nPotential applications include automotive, aviation, sporting equipment, domestic, military and healthcare sectors. These coatings can be used as abrasion resistant, anti-fog and anti-reflection coatings on both glass and plastic surfaces. Preventing fogging of personal equipment like spectacles, skiing and swimming goggles, and scuba diving gear are other advantages. The proposed research will also offer a good opportunity for the education of postdocs, undergraduate and graduate students.  They will be exposed to applied research and trained in chemistry, materials science, and engineering.  In addition, they will gain knowledge and experience in developing a commercial product to meet societal and market needs.\r\n\r\n",
