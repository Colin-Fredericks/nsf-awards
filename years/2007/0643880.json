 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the face of current technology trends, the drive for faster, less power-hungry, and easier-to-program computers will fundamentally alter how we design computer systems.  Niche-based computer systems address these challenges by combining a diverse range of specialized and semi-specialized processors into a heterogeneous computing fabric.  The niche-based software components provide a uniform abstraction for this fabric that makes it easy for programmers to utilize.\r\n\r\nNiche-based systems contain a configurable, non-uniform set of computing elements (CEs) that vary widely in capabilities, performance, and power consumption.  The software runtime in a niche-based system provides a uniform abstraction and programming model for the non-uniform CEs.  The runtime dynamically partitions programs across the CEs and translates them for execution.  As a result, niche-based systems can exploit the power and performance advantages of specialized CEs to execute general-purpose computations more efficiently.  Furthermore, niche-based systems can address the unintentional non-uniformity that manufacturing defects and device wear-out will cause in advanced process technologies.\r\n\r\nThe PI is proposing exploring the design space for each of the hardware and software components in a Niche-based system and constructing prototype implementations.  These components include three key software systems: the Niche runtime system and the translators for generating executable code for a range of CEs, a partially automated system for specifying (and verifying via formal method techniques) the behavior of a CE and generating the required CE-specific translator, and a front-end compiler to generate executables for Niche-based systems.  The PI is also constructing a prototype Niche- based hardware system from commercially available hardware.\r\n",

Our approach has been to developed specialized co-processors that can sit along side a conventional computer processor and execute specific programs more quickly and/or more efficiently.\n\nIn the course of project, we developed several techniques to realize these goals.  We developed an automated system for creating the co-processors.  his dramatically reduces the cost of designing the co-procossors, an essential aspect of enabling the wide application of these co-processors, especially since a single system would contain many co-processors.  We also examined several different architectures, or ways of structuring, both the co-processors themselves and the interfaces that allow conventional processors and the co-processor to work together seamlessly.\n\nTo demonstrate the generality and usefulness of these techniques, we have created co-processors for a wide range of applications.  These include common \"benchmark\" programs that are commonly used to measure computer performance as well as portions of the widely-used Android smart phone operating system.  The latter is especially noteworthy given the ubiquity of Android devices and the importance of power efficiency in mobile computing.\n\nThe work undertaken as part of this project has the potential  provide siginificant gains in computer processing efficiency.
