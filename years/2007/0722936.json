GLOW-II spans ten domains--Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Sciences, Engineering Physics, Genomics, Genetics, Materials Science and Engineering, Medical Physics, Physics and Astrophysics--each with significant computational needs. The laboratory, consisting of eight physical sites, provides the necessary hardware, software, and support infrastructure for the development and experimental evaluation of grid-aware scientific applications. Within GLOW-II new HTC technologies will be harnessed and new organizational structures will be established to meet the computational needs of leading-edge research in the biological and physical sciences. GLOW-II enables cross-fertilization of active research pursuits within the CS department, particularly developers of distributed technologies and tools, providing the CS group with a larger and diverse real-life distributed environment that is an integral part of the national cyberinfrastructure. The technologies, applications, and organizational structures of this computing environment can provide the power to transform scientific processes and methodologies. The success of GLOW and the underlying High Throughput Computing (HTC) technologies that power it have inspired and influenced many campus grids helping shape the campus-grid centric vision of the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  GLOW-II interdisciplinary impacts span across all ranks of the scientific community. Computing throughput, and consequently the size and complexity of the problems studied, will be increased. The infrastructure enables development of new IT technologies in response to explicit needs and their evaluation in real-life settings. Changing the national cyberinfrastructure landscape and pioneering new scientific computing paradigms, new domains will be engaged and students and system administrators will be trained. Outreach, education, and training programs will ensure inclusion of students, educators, and next generation researchers.\r\n\r\n",
