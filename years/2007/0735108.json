The U.S. principal investigator is Michael Petronis from New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU).  The Irish counterparts are Valentin Troll at TCD and Brian O'Driscoll at UCD.  \r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this planning visit is to support US participant (PI, co-PI and two US undergraduate students) travel to Ireland to finalize writing a multi-year NSF Earth Sciences collaborative research proposal between researchers and students from NMHU, TCD, and UCD to investigate shallow level magma dynamics, magma emplacement mechanisms, and rift flank stability of the Teide Volcanic Complex, Tenerife, Island, Spain.  Understanding migration of magma and its emplacement into sub-volcanic levels is a fundamental volcanic process that remains poorly understood despite more than 150 years of field and laboratory research.  The results of this research will improve the understanding of magma flow at shallow, sub-volcanic levels, including better knowledge of the potential hazards associated with magma migration beneath active volcanic centers.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration is complementary in that the combined experience of the US PIs in rock-/paleo-magnetism, magma emplacement processes, igneous petrology and geochemistry integrates extremely well with the proficiency of the Irish participants' petrology, analog experiment, and numerical modeling expertise.  \r\n",
