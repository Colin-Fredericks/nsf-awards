The aim of this annual event is to bring together worldwide experts, young researchers and advanced graduate students with common interests in geometry and mathematical physics. This year, the meeting will feature recent advances in symplectic geometry, Lie group and groupoid actions, as well as their interrelations with Riemannian and Poisson geometry. \r\n\r\nThe cross-fertilization of geometry and physics has led to important developments in mathematics. This meeting includes several lecture series delivered by leading experts in the field. It will provide an opportunity for graduate students and postdocs to meet and interact with researchers from all over the world. \r\n\r\nMore information about the conference may be found at the website:\r\nhttp://www.math.psu.edu/wade/GAP5.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
