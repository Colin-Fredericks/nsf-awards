 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Willamette Valley REU-RET Consortium for Mathematics Research unites four institutions:  Willamette University, Lewis & Clark College, Linfield College, and the University of Portland, for an eight week summer mathematics research experience for undergraduates and teachers.\r\n\r\nEach of the four partner institutions  will host a research Team consisting of four students, one teacher, and two faculty mentors.  Each research Team will focus on a project  from faculty research interests in number theory, graph theory, combinatorial game theory, probability and statistics, geometry, computer science, or applied analysis.  All four research Teams will gather on Thursdays  for informal and formal talks about their projects, presentations  by invited speakers, and social activities.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the program are to\r\n(1)  engage mathematics students and teachers in  mathematical research,\r\n(2) build a network of mathematicians, students and teachers to advance the understanding of and opportunity for mathematical research, and\r\n(3) increase the participants' knowledge of the field of mathematics, in particular by raising  awareness about career opportunities in mathematics.\r\n\r\nWe invite applications from U.S. students and teachers from the Pacific Northwest.  We especially encourage applications from members of groups traditionally under-represented in mathematics, such as women and minority groups.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see our website:\r\nwww.willamette.edu/~ijohnson/REU-RET/index.html\r\n\r\nThis REU/RET project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).\r\n",
