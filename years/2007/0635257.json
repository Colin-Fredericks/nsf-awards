 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spectral Graph Theory or Algebraic Graph Theory, as it is also known,\r\nis the study of the relationship between the eigenvalues and\r\neigenvectors of graphs and their combinatorial properties. Random\r\nwalks on graphs, expander graphs, clustering, and several other\r\ncombinatorial aspects of graphs are intimately connected to their\r\nspectral properties.  Recent approaches to the analysis of\r\nhigh-dimensional data have exploited the fundamental eigenvectors of\r\nthe data. These data sets are large and ever increasing requiring\r\n``real-time\" accurate responses to the given queries. This creates the\r\nneed for very fast algorithms, that also provide strict theoretical\r\nguarantees on their output. Spectral techniques have been applied to image\r\nprocessing, both by computers and in the primary visual cortex of\r\nmonkeys.  Critical component to all these application is algorithms\r\nwith efficiency and accuracy guarantees for solving these linear system\r\nand finding their fundamental  eigenvectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nA multidisciplinary team consisting of Theoretical Computer\r\nScientists, Machine Learning Scientist, and Neuroscientist will\r\ndevelop and apply spectral graph theory to applications from data\r\nmining to clustering, and image processing.  Enabling technology\r\ndevelop will include: 1) linear-work or O(m log m)-work algorithms\r\nthat run in poly-logarithmic parallel time for computing extreme\r\neigenvalues and generalized eigenvalues of diagonally-dominant\r\nmatrices, including Laplacian matrices, as well as algorithms of\r\nsimilar complexity for solving the related linear systems. 2) Better\r\nestimates for Fiedler values and generalized Fiedler values.\r\nApplication development: 1) Improvements in spectral image\r\nsegmentation. 2) The use of generalized eigenvalues in data mining and\r\nimage segmentation to combine multiple sources of information. 3) The\r\nuse of preconditioners for approximate inference in graphical models.\r\nand 4) Combine insights into the problem of image segmentation gained\r\nfrom spectral algorithms with knowledge gained from recent experiments in visual system\r\nof monkeys to better understand how the primary visual cortex functions.\r\n",

The main goal of this research was to find new more efficient computer algorithms for many problems that arrise in Computer Science, Engineering, the Sciences, and Medicine. The research focused on three main algorithmic areas: combinatorial graph theory, linear algebra, and computational geometry. The first two areas combine to form an area called spectral graph theory.  We start by describing our work in this area first.\n\n\nSpectral graph theory uses both graph algorithms to help solve problems in linear algebra and linear alebra to help solve problems in graph theory.\nPossibly the most basic question in linear algebra is finding a solution to a system of simultaneous linear equations.\nHumans have been studying this problem for at least the last two thousand years.  The most famous method is Gaussian elimination.  \nUnfortunately as the systems have more degrees of freedom this method becomes both very slow and requires a lot of space  because it runs in time cubic in the number of variables being solved and quadratic in the space\nneeded. As an example as to what this means suppose we what to solve an image problem\ncoming from an iphone with about ten million pixels. Thus Gaussian elimination would take about\nthousand-billion-billion steps, a very large number even for a big machine.\n\nOur approach to this problem was to find methods for special yet useful cases of linear system solving.  \nThe class of systems we focussed on are called Symmetric Diagonally Dominate (SDD) systems.\nIn work partially funded by this grant and more recent NSF grants we have been able to find an algorithm that solves SDD systems to constant precision in approximately  m log m time,  were m is the number of nonzero coefficients is the system.  For our image example and ignoring\nconstants our algorithm wold take about a billion steps.\n\nThis improves on the fairly complicated algorithm of Spielman and Teng that\nran in m times some-large-number-of-logarithmic-factors time. \nThis new algorithm  is yet to be implemented. But an earlier algorithm that we developed, partially funded by this gran, has been implemented, made available to researchers, and used by us it to show the importance of solving the special case of SDD systems.\n\nThere has been a growing number of applications of fast SDD solvers.\nThe list includes  solving the heat equation,  images denoising, image segmentation, generating a random spanning tree of a graph, and  finding a flow maximum  in a graph.  \nFor each of these applications the best known asymptotic fast algorithm relies on the existence of  fast SDD solvers.\n\nThe second main research effort was in the area of computational geometry.\nIn particular, we focused on the problem of efficiently generating finite element meshes, more simply known as mesh generation.  \nAs an example, suppose one wants to simulated\nheat dissipation on a computer chip and determine the temperature at all points on the chip.   \nIn the finite element approach one needs to determine a method to represent this function of the approximate temperatures to be returned.  \nA standard approach is to decompose the chip into triangles for 2-dimensional simulation, or into tetrahedra for a full 3-dimensional simulation.\nAfter the appropriate system is solved the answer will be a function\nthat is piecewise linear on each element, triangle or tet. \nIn order that the function returned is a good approximation to the real solution\none also needs that the triangles and tets are well shaped.\nIn work funded by this and more recent NSF grants,  we have found an optimal time algorithm for the meshing problem.  \nThat is the algorithm runs in time n log n + m time up to constant factors where n is the description size of the domain and m the size of the mesh generated.\nThe mesh generation problem is a critical step in a l..."
