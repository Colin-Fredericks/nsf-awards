 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Materials Science (57)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing Smart Vibration Platforms (SVP) for distribution and utilization at several diverse types of institutions and undergraduate degree programs.  The SVP is being utilized to teach mechanical engineering dynamics concepts such as damping and structural vibration controls.  The \"Smart\" part of the platform is based on the utilization of two smart materials: a shape memory alloy, which changes stiffness with temperature, and a magneto-rheological fluid, which provides adjustable damping based on use of an electromagnet.\r\n\r\nThe SVP is a creative and easy to use device, and is advancing student knowledge and understanding by helping students experiment with smart materials, vibrations, and controls.  This project is developing and deploying SVPs at six different institutions and extending its implementation to civil, electrical, and materials engineering as well as engineering technology courses.  Using the SVP as a tool, the PIs are creating innovative teaching materials, including demonstrations, hands-on experiments, course modules, and new courses.",
