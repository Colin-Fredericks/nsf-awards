This is an IEEE Communications Society flagship conference on advanced communications technologies that attracts 1500 to 2000 researchers and practitioners from around the world to present the most up-to-date results and achievements of the field. IEEE GLOBECOM consists not only of technical paper presentations, but also a wide range of educational activities including workshops, panels, tutorials, industry presentations, posters and keynote speeches. This project provides funding to assist United States-based graduate students to attend this meeting. Students supported by this project are exposed to state-of-the-art research in the field and are able to discuss topics of interest with other students and leading researchers from all over the world. The support provided by this project enables the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend IEEE GLOBECOM 2006.",
