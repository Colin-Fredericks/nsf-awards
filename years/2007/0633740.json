 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) Intellectual Merit\r\nInteractive Lecture Demonstrations (ILDs) are a strategy for transforming the usually passive lecture environment into a more active one. They have been proven to be effective in improving conceptual learning in large (and small) introductory physics courses at colleges and universities. ILDs in most areas of physics have been published in the book, Interactive Lecture Demonstrations, distributed free of charge by John Wiley and Sons. Personal Response Systems (PRS) are becoming more ubiquitous on college and university campuses in the U.S. They are most often used in large lecture classes to administer ConcepTests on single concepts, in an attempt to stimulate student interest and motivate learning. This project is combining the efficacy of ILDs with the convenience of PRS to develop a series of learning materials for the introductory physics lecture. RSILDs are being developed in mechanics (kinematics and dynamics) and optics (image formation and polarization) by adapting the available ILDs for use with PRS. These materials are being tested for effectiveness in teaching physics concepts using the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) and the Light and Optics Conceptual Evaluation (LOCE), initially at the University of Oregon and Tufts University, and later at a variety of other institutions. Like the ILDs, the PRS-ILDs are expected to be effective for students from diverse backgrounds and for those who are poorly prepared for physics. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe PRS-ILDs developed and tested as part of this project are being disseminated to a wide audience of college-level instructors through the extensive program of talks, workshops and institutes already presented by the PIs. Since the majority of introductory physics students in the U.S. are taught in lecture classes, often fairly large ones, and since many campuses already have PRS available, the potential impact is very large. After initial testing at Oregon and Tufts, the PRS-ILDs will be implemented and tested at a variety of universities, 2-year colleges and 4-year colleges recruited from the PI's dissemination activities. Much wider dissemination is likely since John Wiley and Sons has expressed interest in publishing the PRS-ILDs. If the PRS-ILDs prove to be effective in teaching physics concepts, this strategy should also be useful in the other science disciplines.",
