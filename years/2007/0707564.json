 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bruno\r\n0707564\r\n\r\n     The investigator seeks development and analysis of accurate,\r\nrapidly convergent, high performance solvers for the types of\r\nchallenging partial differential equations that arise in\r\npresent-day materials science applications, as well as use of\r\nsuch solvers for design of concrete devices and prediction of\r\nproperties of realistic systems.  He creates algorithms to treat\r\ncertain types of problems related to potential theory and wave\r\npropagation, composite materials and optical devices, elasticity,\r\nacoustics, and electromagnetism.  Significant difficulties arise\r\nin these classical fields of numerical analysis and computational\r\nscience in the context of the materials science problems\r\nconsidered, which require treatment of microstructures,\r\nnon-coercive systems, geometric singularities, resonant\r\nstructures, high frequencies, multiple scattering, etc.  These\r\nare mathematical problems that, in spite of significant efforts\r\nand progress over the last century, remain elusive in a wide\r\nrange of important instances.  The combination of a number of\r\nsuch challenges often arises in the treatment of materials\r\nscience configurations, which has made materials problems\r\ndifficult to tackle.  In particular, most algorithms available\r\nfor the types of materials science applications considered in the\r\nproject lack in either accuracy, computational efficiency, or\r\nboth -- a circumstance that has hindered progress in the field. \r\n\r\n     The investigator develops effective, high-performance\r\ncomputational methods for solving partial differential equations\r\nthat model the properties and behaviors of various physical\r\nsystems, emphasizing features important for materials.  The\r\nproject has consequences for several areas of societal interest,\r\nincluding the medical field (tomography, imaging), electrical\r\nengineering (optics, electronics), military and civilian remote\r\nsensing (radar, sonar, stealth), communications (antennas),\r\natmospheric science, etc.  The project also provides training for\r\nstudents at both graduate and undergraduate levels, as well as\r\nfor postdoctoral associates.",
