 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this one-day symposium is to define the research agenda in Management of Technology as a contributor to Service Science Management and Engineering. It will be held on Sunday, August 5, 2007, immediately preceding the technical program of PICMET'07 (Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology) Conference. PICMET just completed its 15th year with a recent conference in Istanbul, Turkey. It is expected that around five hundred papers will be submitted and about three hundred of them will be accepted for presentation at PICMET'07. The papers are subjected to a double-blind review process with about one hundred ten referees around the world. The accepted papers are included in the PICMET Proceedings. Approximately seven hundred attendees from more than forty countries are expected to attend the PICMET '07 conference. Typically, 70% of  PICMET participants are researchers, 20% are industry executives and 10% are government officials. \r\n\r\nWe are targeting to invite 8-10 key leaders in the field to present their ideas in the morning and to lead the discussions in the afternoon. There will be open participation, and PICMET attendees will be given a discount for their participation in the Symposium. The discussions will be focused on identifying the critical research needs in Technology Management in the Service Sector. The results will be presented to the entire PICMET'07 participants toward the end of the conference, and will be published as a report to be submitted to NSF. \r\n\r\n",
