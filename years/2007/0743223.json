This project will be under the direction of Dr. Frank L. Huband.\r\n \r\nThe effort consists of a four stage collaborative project involving the principle stakeholders in engineering education to identify, analyze, and summarize existing knowledge and practices that are essential for an engineering education needed for the future. The proposed effort draws on a number of previous efforts related to engineering education and will have a strong focus on identifying best practices supported by research that can have a significant effect on the capability of graduates to practice in the global community and on the attraction and retention of groups underrepresented in engineering.",
