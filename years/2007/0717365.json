 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of a four-year study of the systematics of the wasp genus Heterospilus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae, Doryctinae) found in Costa Rica. The subfamily Doryctinae is one of the largest and most diverse groups of wasps.  They parasitize wood-boring insect larvae and play important roles as biological control agents, managing populations of these insects. The genus Heterospilus is estimated to comprise at least 250 species in Costa Rica.  Specific objectives of this study are: (1) to prepare species descriptions and identification keys to the species; (2) to produce a species-group level phylogeny of Heterospilus based on DNA sequence data from 3 genes;  (3) to publish these results in a monograph of the genus Heterospilus of Costa Rica; and (4) to develop associated web-based interactive identification keys linked to Tree of Life pages. \r\n\r\nThis study will result in the completion of the systematic treatment of the entire Costa Rican doryctine fauna. Because it is such a species-rich tropical group, the genus Heterospilus represents a valuable information source for broader studies of biodiversity, phylogeny, and biological control. A graduate student and postdoctoral associate will receive training in molecular and morphological systematic techniques, an understanding of braconid wasp systematics, and methods for the development of interactive keys.",
