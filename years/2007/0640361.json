 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIn this project, principal investigators will integrate DNA sequences and anatomical data from living and fossil species to study the evolution of Delphinida, the group that includes oceanic dolphins, most river dolphins, porpoises, belugas, and narwhals. Research objectives are to resolve evolutionary relationships among living and extinct species, estimate when the diversification of dolphins occurred, determine if behavior influenced the evolution of large brains in dolphins, and unravel the evolution of olfactory receptor genes in aquatic animals that lack the sense of smell. DNA will be sequenced in a state-of-the-art lab, anatomical data will be collected from museums worldwide, and computers will be used to analyze the large body of data collected.\r\n\r\nThis work will aid in the conservation of these federally protected species by stabilizing their classification, as well as by providing genetic tools to monitor threatened populations. Work on the evolution of brains in dolphins will be a case study with which to compare the evolution of large brains in primates. This study will engage undergraduate students in scientific research. Results will be disseminated on a website that educates the public about the remarkable evidence for evolution from fossils and the DNA of dolphins and porpoises.\r\n",
