 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adaptive radiations, like that of the Gal\u00e1pagos finches, can lead to a wide diversity of plants and animals in a short evolutionary time. But not all radiations are adaptive. The Cape flora of southern Africa is among the richest and most diverse in the world, but its diversity appears to involve both adaptive and non-adaptive evolution. This project will examine a group in the plant family Proteaceae to determine whether its radiation has been primarily adaptive or non-adaptive. Plant traits will be measured in experimental gardens and wild populations to determine their relationship to growth and reproduction and to identify traits associated with species differences. Variation in these traits will be compared to variation in neutral genetic markers to determine trait differences are the result of natural selection or of random differentiation associated with geographic isolation.\r\n\r\nScientists from the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) will collaborate on the project, and the project will enhance SANBI''s bioregional planning initiatives.  Field work will immerse faculty, students, and post-doctoral research associates in a rich multicultural environment. The project will engage both undergraduates and high school students, with special emphasis on high schools with large proportions of students from groups underrepresented in science. This award is co-funded by NSF''s Office of International Science and Engineering.",
