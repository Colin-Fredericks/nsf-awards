It is producing three products: a conceptual framework, a research agenda, and an instructional unit for elementary mathematics methods classes. A total of 35 participants are being invited to attend, and participating faculty members are asked to bring a graduate student. The conference is scheduled for 2.5 days supplemented with significant pre-conference and post-conference activities. There is significant support from the Center for the Mathematics Education of Latino/as at the University of Arizona and from the University of Texas-Austin.",
