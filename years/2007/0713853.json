 "awd_abstract_narration": "Claflin University, through funding from the HBCU-UP program, seeks to investigate the following questions: (i) How can high-risk mathematics courses deter students from majoring in STEM; (ii) What is the effect of success in mathematics to attrition rates in STEM; (iii) Can a research-intensive curriculum contribute to a career in STEM? (iv) Does the Claflin University curriculum meet criteria for exemplary mathematics and science teacher preparation?  \r\n\r\nClaflin's HBCU-UP project, Building Successful Models for Research and Inquiry Based Learning and Teaching, is a comprehensive project that seeks to improve mathematics competencies at the undergraduate level; prepare and train a research-based student population to be competitive for graduate school and/or the research workforce; and to improve mathematics and science teacher preparation through extending the interface between research and pedagogy.\r\n\r\nThe activities planned for addressing the questions and achieving the objectives of the project are based on research in STEM education.  Claflin will implement supplemental instruction in Calculus I, building on current success in College Algebra, Pre-Calculus, Chemistry and Physics, where they have seen decreases in failure rate of 10% - 15%.  They will also utilize mathematics software and a MathLab to provide additional online support for the students.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the enhancements aimed at student success, Claflin is also focusing on developing a research-based curriculum and building an interdisciplinary research infrastructure, especially in the area of Bioscience Technology.\r\n\r\nAn innovative aspect of Claflin's HBCU-UP project is its plan to build an exemplary model for science and mathematics teaching.  They will focus on mathematics education majors at the secondary level, and early, elementary and middle education majors.  For these students, a new Special Topics in Science and Mathematics Education course will be developed.  Claflin aims to make this course a model for the nation in STEM teaching.  The 4-week summer course will incorporate instrumentation, inquiry-based learning, molecular modeling and on-line delivery methods.\r\n\r\nThe University has assembled a distinguished and experienced group of faculty to lead this project, and is expected to go a long way toward answering the questions posed.",
