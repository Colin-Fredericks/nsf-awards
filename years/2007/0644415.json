 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study ways in which several collocated devices may be enabled to work together as a system and take advantage of the unique characteristics of collocation. Specifically, the research seeks to explore and evaluate the use of embodied mobile agents (EMAs) -- animated agents that can transfer seamlessly among different devices -- as one potential solution to the problem of multi-device interaction.  The move in many societies toward individuals using multiple networked computational devices -- workstations, notebooks computers, mobile phones, PDAs -- radically changes the ways in which people engage those devices. However, we lack interaction paradigms that support a coherent experience across these technologies and enable them to work as systems of collocated devices. Therefore, this research will develop technological and interactional solutions that promote learning, engagement, accessibility and collaboration across heterogeneous networks of collocated computational devices.\r\n\r\nThis work will integrate and build on previous research in a variety of research fields including autonomous agents, human computer interaction, computer graphics, mobile computing, computer supported learning, and other areas.  By expanding on these domains, the research will advance the state of the art in understanding how people can work simultaneously with multiple devices. By developing theoretical and practical foundations for collocated device systems, this research lays the groundwork for many new kinds of multi-device interactions. And by rigorously evaluating specific implementations, the research will help pave the way for wider-scale adoption of collocated device systems.\r\n\r\nThis research effort is closely coupled with two educational programs: a series of informal science education museum exhibits based on a system of collocated devices, and an interdisciplinary educational effort at the University of California, Irvine. The museum exhibits are being designed in collaboration with ecologists, educators and science centers around the country to help 8-12 year old children learn about restoration ecology. The educational work at the university involves the engagement of students from several departments in collaborative research projects and the design of several new courses.  The integration of computer science and applied fields will help make the research more relevant to the interests of female students.\r\n\r\nSystems of collocated devices enabled by this research could be applied to numerous areas including collaborative work settings, educational exhibits, and new entertainment media.  By producing innovative research, by developing a publicly available interactive educational tool, and by building partnerships both within the university and to the external community, this project will provide significant benefits to society.",
