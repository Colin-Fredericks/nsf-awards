 "awd_abstract_narration": "Timely delivery of data streams is important to time-critical\r\napplications relying on streams of dynamic data. Drastic reduction\r\non the sending rates of data streams typically has negative impact on\r\nthe operations of such applications. Effective rate adaptation is\r\nneeded to make data streams adapt to network congestion through slowly\r\nvarying their sending rate. This research project is motivated by\r\nthe need of streaming dynamic radar data at the required rates from\r\nradars to a control center in the surveillance application using ganged\r\nground-based radars. This application is crucial to the operation\r\nof the unmanned aerial vehicles.\r\n\r\nIn this research project, an adaptive data pulling framework is\r\nstudied to support stable data streaming. This framework consists\r\nof a transport-layer congestion control scheme and an\r\napplication-layer data pulling control mechanism. The\r\napplication-layer data pulling control mechanism allows the\r\napplication actively fetch data from sources. The transport-layer\r\ncongestion control scheme adopts a new rate control method which\r\nprovides weighted fairness to data streams. Weighted fairness\r\namong data streams is the desired feature for controlling the sending\r\nrates of streams carrying layered encodings. Weighted fairness\r\nmeans that the throughput of a stream is degraded reversely\r\nproportional to its priority when the network becomes congested.\r\nWeighted fairness brings new vision on rate control for data\r\nstreaming. Stability and responsiveness to congestion indications\r\nare the two key research questions of the new rate control scheme.",
