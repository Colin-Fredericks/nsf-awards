 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal tackles some very difficult yet contemporary problems in collision physics.\r\nThree-body recombination research will be extended to the heavier alkalis (Na, K,\r\nRb and Cs). A detailed direct comparison of the scattering results when one includes or\r\nexcludes nonadiabatic coupling terms and conical intersections will provide new insights\r\nfor interpreting observed phenomena. Study of coherently controlled bimolecular\r\nreactions will be extended to include nonadiabatic effects and laser fields. Energy\r\ndependent cross sections will be calculated over a large energy range from ultracold\r\nenergies to thermal energies. Threshold behavior and quantum resonances will be\r\nmapped out. The inclusion of electromagnetic interactions will provide cross sections as\r\na function of laser intensity. The range of laser intensities will be from very weak\r\nintensities to intensities of more than 1012 watts/cm3. Photon-system interactions will\r\nprovide a rich enviroment for studying chemical reactions especially at ultracold and\r\ncold temperatures. Time-dependent methods will be developed to watch the flow of\r\nenergy among different adiabatic states and regions of configuration space.",
