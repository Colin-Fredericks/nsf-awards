In the near-IR regime, signatures of \r\nprimordial galaxies in the background spatial fluctuations will be \r\nstudied. At far-IR wavelengths, clustering information of dusty, \r\nstar-forming galaxies will be measured. The main goal of this research \r\nprogram is to expand the science case for anisotropy measurements of \r\nIRB and to provide a strong theoretical background to interpret these \r\nmeasurements just as the case has been with respect to CMB anisotropy \r\nexperiments. \r\n\r\nAs a part of this research project, Dr. Cooray plans to provide \r\ntraining and research experiences for students, with an emphasis on \r\ncreating opportunities for undergraduate students.   This includes \r\ndirect involvement in international collaborations such as Akari, \r\nbased in Japan, and Herschel SPIRE, based mostly in the UK.  Students \r\nwill attend collaboration meetings in these countries and will be \r\ntrained to work with and learn from foreign partners.  The PI plans \r\nto integrate elements of this research program and other topics in \r\ncosmology into a Computational Physics course Dr. Cooray teaches at UC \r\nIrvine where the students are recruited for the research program. \r\nOver the next three years, Dr. Cooray will also develop a completely \r\nnew course on how to do \"Order of Magnitude Physics\" targeting juniors \r\nand will also make available the course material publicly from a \r\nwebsite.  Dr. Cooray will also update an existing Voyager-era \"Space \r\nScience\" course, in the introductory astronomy sequence targeting \r\nnon-science majors, to a course on \"Space Astronomy\" as a way to bring \r\nnew astronomical missions and their results to the classroom.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded by the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences",
