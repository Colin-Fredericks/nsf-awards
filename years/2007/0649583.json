 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor T. Don Tilley, Department of Chemistry, University of California at Berkeley is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to investigate metal-element multiple bonding and new methods for metal-mediated bond activations.  A first goal will be to develop hydrosilation catalysts that form a silene ligand by an alpha-migration of a hydrogen atom from silicon to the metal center. A hydrogen atom remaining on the silicon atom then adds directly to an olefin, in a highly anti-Markovnikov manner. The mechanism of this process will be studied to determine the range of substrates that undergo hydrosilation in this way. Structure-reactivity correlations then will be made for these catalysts. Transformations that take advantage of the silicon to metal hydrogen transfer will be developed. Finally, metal-silylyne complexes will be synthesized and their reaction chemistry investigated. \r\n\r\nThis research aims to establish a better understanding of fundamental reaction steps that occur at transition metal centers. The development of new strategies for chemical conversions is an important activity, given potential applications as diverse as drug development, polymer and materials synthesis, and the large-scale production of value-added chemicals. Hydrosilation reactions are of great importance in organic synthesis, and in polymer and materials chemistry. The development of highly regioselective hydrosilation catalysts is expected to contribute to a broader application of this reaction type. The research will train young scientists and provide them a broad set of technical skills. The PI and students involved in this project will take part in outreach activities to middle and high schools.\r\n",
