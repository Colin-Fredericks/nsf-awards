 "awd_abstract_narration": "(Biological Sciences 61) \r\n\r\nThe web based modules created within this project are designed to help undergraduate students in introductory classes understand the mathematical basis for upper level biology courses and the increasingly quantitative work required by current careers in biology. The materials being created can be implemented in a large Introductory Biology classroom. The key objectives are: (1) development and refinement of quantitative learning modules (QBLMs) for instructional use in introductory courses for biology majors; (2) evaluation of the student learning effects of engagement with the QBLMs; (3) identification of the modules' characteristics that support learning; and (4) creation of a faculty/staff study group that systematically studies the student learning outcomes associated with QBLM use and plans implementation strategies accordingly. Initially these modules are being implemented into selected sections of the Introductory Biology course at the University of Arizona. Upon completion of this project the materials being developed will be ready for implementation by other faculty in additional sections of the course. Ultimately, partnerships will be formed with other institutions with the goal of disseminating the materials more broadly. \r\n\r\n Intellectual merit: This project is developing and implementing new teaching materials that integrate quantitative concepts early in biology education and change the way students think about biology. The proposal builds on prior work in the development of student learning in two ways: it provides a variety of learning tools designed to engage students to become active participants in their own learning; and it employs a cyclic model for knowledge production and improvement of practice in undergraduate STEM education. In addition, the proposal serves to engage scholars from different disciplines (biology, mathematics and science education) in a dialogue that focuses on the common goal of enhancement of student learning and incorporates perspectives from these disciplines and serves to build a community of scholars. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: Dissemination is occurring through the following channels: on the website (http://dels.nas.edu/summerinst/index.shtml) of the National Academies Summer Institutes on Undergraduate Education in Biology; and publication of one or more articles describing the new version of our entry-level biology course in undergraduate education biology journals (eg Cell Biology Education); and presentations in conferences on undergraduate education.  Since durable changes in the way mathematics is taught to life sciences students involves the collaboration of mathematics and biology instructors, the material is also being shared with mathematics educators through articles in mathematics education journals. In addition, the data collected during the various stages of implementation of the project is being analyzed by the biology education co-PI, with the assistance of a graduate student. They are investigating student learning styles and assessing the efficacy of the modules, resulting in publications in journals on education research as well as presentations in conferences.\r\n",
