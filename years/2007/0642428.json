 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomechanical studies of frog jumping have the potential to provided key insights into the mechanical design of the vertebrate musculoskeletal system.  Frogs launch themselves into the air with a burst of mechanical power that is truly remarkable.  In many species, the peak power produced in a jump greatly exceeds the power-producing capacity of skeletal muscle.  It has been proposed that this discrepancy is explained by an elastic mechanism that amplifies muscle power, but this mechanism has not been observed directly and it is not well understood.  A better understanding of the interaction between power-producing muscles and the action of elastic elements in frog jumping may help define rules that govern the complementary function of muscles and tendons in locomotion.  In this project, the elastic mechanism used in jumping will be investigated with a number of biomechanical techniques.  It is expected that dynamic changes in muscle lever arms, as defined by skeletal lever systems, play a critical role in facilitating the effective storage and release of energy in elastic tendons.  The hypothesis that the elastic stretch and recoil of tendons improves muscle performance by uncoupling muscle fascicle shortening from movements of the body will also be tested.  This work has the potential to provide fundamental insights into how the conservative properties of vertebrate skeletal muscle may have shaped the mechanical design of tendons, bones and locomotor posture in terrestrial vertebrates. \r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of this project include the participation of local area high school teachers in the research project.  During seven-week internships in the laboratory, teachers will use their research experience to develop course modules and curricular enhancements to help bring the excitement of research back to the classroom.  This project will also include the training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates, and represents an integration of Biology and Engineering principles.\r\n",
