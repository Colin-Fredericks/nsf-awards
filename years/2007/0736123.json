 "awd_abstract_narration": "0736123\r\nKarwowski\r\nA number of techniques are being developed to detect nuclear materials in large cargo containers are based on using gamma-ray (\u00e3-ray) beams to identify specific isotopes by the detection of emitted gamma-rays and/or neutrons. High intensity \u00e3-ray beams with good energy resolution are expected to generate acceptable radiation doses to cargo and to enable scans to be performed in short enough times that make these techniques viable solutions. An ultimate goal is to apply this technology as the basis for systems that make isotope-specific images of high-Z materials in cargo containers. The proposed collaborative research will provide nuclear data and develop measurement techniques relevant to the mission of the DNDO to develop technologies for nuclear threat detection. Several undergraduate and graduate students will be involved, including two graduate students from North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University, an historically black university.",
