Although simulation has proven to be a powerful tool in encouraging active learning in other disciplines, it has not been fully adopted in transportation engineering to this date. The modules are also suitable for upper-division transportation courses and cover fundamental topics in transportation engineering such as travel demand modeling, geometric design, traffic flow, and traffic signal control. The web-based interface allows easy access for users without the high cost associated with commercially available simulation products. The simulation-based materials form an active textbook, which offers an interactive learning environment to undergraduate students. The modules are being rigorously evaluated and tested in course offerings from civil engineering programs across the country and are being disseminated to the general public through interactive exhibits at the Minnesota Transportation Museum and the Minnesota State Fair. \r\n",
