This project lies at the \r\ninterface of theoretical condensed matter physics and mathematics.\r\nMany interesting phenomena observed in the condensed matter physics\r\nlaboratory are dominated by strong interactions or strong disorder.  The\r\nunderstanding of such systems is typically very challenging, due to the limited\r\nnumber of  theoretical tools available for their description, standard paradigms\r\nincluding for example Fermi-Liquid or other independent particle-type\r\napproaches are often not adequate to capture the\r\nThe focus of the work supported under this award is the application and the \r\nDevelopment of novel theoretical methods aimed at treating such strong coupling problems.  The focus of the research includes Non-Fermi-Liquid behavior in\r\nQuantum Impurity Problems dominated by strong interactions, localization \r\nTransitions in disordered electronic systems, and systems dominated by the\r\nsimultaneous effects of disorder and interactions.  The PI will use methods\r\nranging from conformal field theory, to the functional renormalization group, and \r\nthe emerging field of the Stochastic Loewner Evolution.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and education under the umbrella of \r\nThe NSF-wide Mathematical Sciences Priority Area.  This project lies at the \r\nInterface of theoretical condensed matter physics and mathematics.\r\nThis research focuses on problems at the frontiers of condensed matter theory \r\nthat involve materials or nanosystems with unusual properties.  These often arise\r\nas a consequence of strong interactions among electrons.  Disorder, where the\r\npositions of the atoms deviate significantly from highly ordered arrangements,\r\nmay also play an important role.  Understanding the effects of these two factors\r\nworking in concert represents a formidable theoretical challenge.  The PI will,\r\ndevelop new theoretical tools, some that benefit from recent advances in the\r\nmathematical sciences, to advance research on the combined effects of strong\r\ninteraction and disorder in materials.  This research aims to advance fundamental\r\nscience and it interesting and important in its own right.  It may also contribute to\r\nthe discovery of new phenomena and contribute to our understanding of complex\r\nmaterials that hold promise for future technological applications.  This research \r\nactivity will contribute to the education of the next generation of condensed \r\nmatter theorist.\r\n\r\n",
