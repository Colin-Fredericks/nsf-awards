 "awd_abstract_narration": "OCE-0648016\r\n\r\nThis project will extend the now 52 year long series of the ocean hydrographic station near Bermuda, known as Station S or the Panulirus Station for another 5 years. These time-series data have already been extensively used by investigators in many disciplines to examine fluctuations at periods from weeks to years in the western Atlantic Ocean and producing over 100 publications over the past 10 years. Hydrostation S allows a bi-weekly context for the biogeochemical measurements that are part of the more complex multi-disciplinary Bermude AtlanticTime-series Station program and also helps provide a better understanding of the short term variability associated with mesoscale eddy dynamics in this region. Patterns of long term change and decadal variability have emerged from these data. In particular, long term warming of the deeper ocean (especially at the depth of mode water 200-400m) has been documented. However, a similar long term increase has not occurred in the surface temperature record over the whole 52 year period although there have been significant trends in both temperature and salinity over decadal time scales. Thus these data show the importance of sampling the full ocean depth over very long time periods rather than just using sea surface temperature for proxies of climate change. These data have proven to be an important link in global ocean monitoring and have allowed scientists to establish direct linkages with climate change. The extension of this time series will further deduce the significance of these climate related signals and to further understand processes effecting ocean variability. The bi-weekly sampling periodicity is essential to resolve various oceanographic processes and the unique position of this site off Bermuda means that each full ocean depth station can be accomplished with just one ship day. In addition to the core measurements, ancillary users have enhanced the measurements at this site to provide a rich array of data available to the ocean sciences community. The investigators propose to actively continue this collaboration. The only change to this time-series project is to sample the full ocean depth (~3300m) rather than the current bottom depth of 2600m. This change will require an additional CTD cast and will generate another six discrete depths for water samples. The availability of the new BBSR vessel R/V Atlantic Explorer will allow us to effectively implement this change without any impact on cruise logistics or funding amounts. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nDuring the past 5 years, numerous student programs have used the Hydrostation S project as resource for training and conducting student fieldwork. This interest continues to grow such that there are now have several Universities seeking to make use of the BBSR vessel R/V Atlantic Explorer and the Hydrostation S program as explicit part of their course work. This project will continue and extend this facilitation and further, a graduate student component will be added to this program. Hydrostation S cruises have also proved to be an invaluable resource for training oceanography technicians form BBSR (over 15 in past 5 years) and other institutions and this activity will also continue. Another advantage of the single day cruises is that it lends itself for the inclusion of journalists and media personnel from both Bermuda and international locations.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
