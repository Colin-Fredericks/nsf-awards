 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop the technology for the manufacture of complex 3-D micro-devices from an array of metal and ceramic nanometer-scale particulates.  In a novel lithographic gelcasting (LGC) process, multilayer molds will be made using standard photolithography techniques used in the semiconductor industry, and each mold layer cast with nanometer-scale particulate materials.  The resulting multilayer parts will then be sintered to fuse the particles into a dense solid.  The innovation will expand the suite of available micro-manufacturing processes, allowing more complex parts to be made from a much wider variety of materials.  \r\n\r\nThe broad impact of this research will be the manufacture of micro-surgical instruments to enable the next generation of minimally invasive surgical procedures. The technology developed under the NSF STTR funding will be transferred to industry via commercialization.  The technology could also have profound implications in a wide range of industries where ceramic and metal microscale devices are needed. For example, all the micro-mechanical systems being proposed such as micro air and land vehicles, micro robots, and micro surveillance system must be assembled from robust micro-components that can withstand the environments, stresses, and fatigue lives of their macroscopic counterparts.",
