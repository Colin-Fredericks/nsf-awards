To make the\r\nmatters worse, many networked embedded systems have much more\r\nconstrained resources such as storage, bandwidth, computing power and\r\nenergy than computers used in non-embedded applications, e.g. desktop\r\nmachines and servers.  Sophisticated computer security schemes\r\ndeveloped over the last few decades are often infeasible on networked\r\nembedded systems, at least not in their original forms.\r\n\r\nThe research team of this project\r\ndevelops a multi-grade monitoring scheme, supported by a new\r\nprogramming interface,\r\nin which low-cost monitoring activities\r\nare deployed in normal mode of operation of the systems\r\nto detect suspicious symptoms which are possibly, although\r\nnot necessarily, caused by security threats. \r\nThis effort will lead to much more effective, yet affordable, security\r\nmonitoring and defense on networked embedded systems,\r\n\r\n\r\n",
