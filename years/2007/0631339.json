This proposal addresses the importance of providing students, their families, and the communities with ways to further value math and science, both as a vital component in their daily lives and a career choice.\r\nThree Goals of O[ta'7 shohn7zingo d00 binaanish yaanidiy8'go 0hoo[aah: Taking a Math and Science Pathway:\r\n. Increasing STEM student recruitment by (1) engaging Middle (6-8 grades) and High Schools (9-12 grades) (2) increasing the availability of science laboratory instruction at the college and (3) creating certifications to encourage STEM workforce development (4) by recruiting interested freshman, undeclared majors and liberal arts majors into a science cohort program\r\n. Increasing STEM student retention by (1) enhancing the relevancy of STEM to family and community (2) improving math placement tools (3) STEM academic content reinforcement and (4) better academic advising.\r\n. STEM Faculty Development involving (1) more relevancy in course content for students (2) broader instructional options for teachers (3) more course delivery methods and (4) faculty career development.",
