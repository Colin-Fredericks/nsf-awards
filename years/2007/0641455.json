 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing appreciation of RNA as a crucial biopolymer demands more than ever a clear picture of how RNA molecules fold into their native structures, which are vital to their functional properties. The goal of this project is to use nanoparticle based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies to monitor RNA folding. The research applies an integrated approach combining surface chemistry, biophysics and theory to engineer interfaces that give quantitative information about biological activities at the nano interface. The spectrum of activities planned in this project includes 1) demonstration of the laser induced fluorescence (LIF) quenching by gold nanoparticle to monitor RNA folding and 2) to understand the role of size and shape of the nanoparticle as well as molecule-nanoparticle separation in the RET between molecular excited states and electronic states in metal that determines the resonance fluorescence (RF) quantum efficiencies. The project is of fundamental scientific interest as well as a crucial component in the development of state-of-the-art devices and sensors. Upon successful completion of the project, this research outcome will significantly impact US industry promoting innovation and the development of cutting edge research on the sensing of RNA. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nCritical to the success of this project will be the establishment of infrastructure for the education, training and mentoring of minority students through formal courses, workshops and laboratory rotations. The project will play an important role in the larger framework of the Jackson State University's College of Science, Engineering, and Technology and promoting inter-departmental collaboration between faculty members. The enhanced curriculum will provide a strong starting point for students willing to pursue a future career as biological scientists and will also train future biologists to interact with scientists in other disciplines such as the physical sciences and nanotechnology. Another activity planned in this project is to conduct outreach programs to high schools, helping science teachers in their mission of enhancing the scientific literacy of wider audiences",
