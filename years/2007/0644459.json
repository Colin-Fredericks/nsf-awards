 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal presents a research program for developing and evaluating dynamic policy models, adaptive composition approaches, and risk management strategies. The main\r\nthrust of his proposal is the development of proof theoretic reasoning and analysis algorithms to enable system integrators and end users to leverage diverse and heterogeneous Web services through local policy specifications. A primary focus of the work is web services workflow-related issues.  It has become increasingly difficult to build services-based systems that can effectively achieve distributed services composition and coordination in increasingly dynamic, uncertain and error-prone open system environments.  The research will develop one model which can  provide a means for specifying the interactive behavior of the underlying services to align their capabilities according to the requirements of their owners and consumers.  The policy enforced Web services composition can be an important conduit for information and event sharing in smart environments. The project will enable students at ASU to experiment with various aspects of information and Web services management, thereby increasing students' awareness of learning, computation, and research issues.  The Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing (CUBIC) at ASU will work closely with the PI and his development partner, Microchip Technology Inc, to test and disseminate prototype technologies, such as smart and aware environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
