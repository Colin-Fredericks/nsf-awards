 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, vegetation scientists seek to understand the long-term impacts of climate change on grassland ecosystems.  Through multi-decadal simulation of warmed soil and air temperatures, coupled with summer drought or elevated rainfall, researchers are identifying how the characteristics of different plant species allow predictions of how communities and ecosystem processes will shift in coming decades.  This project also extends research on climate change impacts to the genetic level, where recent evidence indicates that some ecosystems may be resistant to climate change because some species have a large local gene pool allowing rapid adaptation to new environments.\r\n\r\nTemperate grasslands are a key contributor to global productivity and their response to global climate change is of critical importance to the future of human welfare.  Existing studies from fertile grasslands have documented rapid vegetation shifts with simulated warming, but there is reason to believe that certain grasslands - those of less fertile soils, containing slower-growing species that are more diverse locally - may be more resistant to rapid climate change.  Because these systems account for a large majority of pasture and rangelands throughout the world, their recalcitrance to climate shifts will have significant ramifications for the future of food and fiber production.  \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant provided five years of support to a long-term, experimental study of how climate influences grassland ecosystems.  For nearly two decades we have artificially warmed, droughted, and increased rainfall in an experimental pastureland that is significant for agriculture (sheep and cattle production) and biodiversity conservation (containing rare plants and animals).  For the five years supported by this study, we wanted to better understand how this system would respond to the climate change expected in north temperate ecosystems over the coming decades, and whether there was any capacity for forage plants in this ecosystem to adapt, either by shifting to new dominant species that could remain productive in a new climate or through genetic changes in those species already abundant.\n\n \n\nOver the course of this grant period, we made several key findings that help us better understand how these ecosystems will be impacted by climate change.  First, we found that one of the most common plants in the system has remained abundant even under chronic summer drought by adapting genetically to water stress.  Such 'stress' genes probably remain in the population even in wet years in sites of very shallow (and thus stressful) soil, and thus this population and perhaps others have at least some capacity to evolve locally as the climate changes.  Second, we found that many species are able to adjust to new climates by changing where, locally, they grow&mdash;for example, some species persist under chronic drought by seeking 'refuge' in deeper, wetter, soils.  Third, we found that if we introduce new species from more southerly grasslands, they end up doing quite well, in some cases easily invading the existing grassland regardless of the climate scenario.  This may in the long term help maintain its agricultural productivity, but it poses problems for maintaining its current biodiversity.\n\n \n\nThe project also supported scientific training and infrastructure beyond its immediate scientific aims.  It directly funded the work of one postdoctoral researcher, one PhD student, and two undergraduate students, and indirectly supported the work of several other graduate and undergraduate students, many of which were of backgrounds underrepresented in the sciences.  It supported an international scientific collaboration between scientists in the U.S. and the U.K., produced a long-term dataset involving nearly two decades of ecosystem response to climate change that is now publicly available, and supported a site that has become a core location of the Ecological Continuity Trust, a non-profit that aims to increase public understanding of the value of long-term ecological experimentation and monitoring.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/12/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason D Fridley"
