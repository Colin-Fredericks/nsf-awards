 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education Research Traineeship (IGERT) project addresses the need for a coherent interdisciplinary graduate education and research training program on Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices.  Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices focuses on the novel design of architectures that interact with biological systems and promote a desired response.  These advanced architectures have numerous applications ranging from tissue engineering, to sensing systems, to drug delivery.  Successful development of these systems will depend on expertise not only in developing novel synthetic architectures through nanotechnology, self-assembly and hybrid systems but also on the interactions of these interfaces with biological systems such as cells and proteins.  Nearly all materials used today in biological applications are those that were originally designed for non-biological applications without any consideration for the interactions between the biological system and the synthetic interface.  The need for more advanced bioactive interfaces and for specialty applications has grown and successful development of these architectures requires the integration of the biological sciences and engineering disciplines.  This IGERT award addresses this need by educating and training the next generation of engineers and scientists working in this area.  Through the activities proposed, the student participants will further enhance their backgrounds in their primary disciplines and obtain a thorough, cross-disciplinary education at the interface of biological sciences and engineering using state-of-the-art instrumentation and methodologies.  Through outreach activities and undergraduate participation, this IGERT program will have a far-reaching impact. Young students, teachers and undergraduates will be encouraged to bridge the gaps between traditional disciplines when solving problems.   IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe University Kentucky is one of very few institutions that have a medical center/school, a college of pharmacy, and the engineering and science disciplines within walking distance of each other.  Prior to the IGERT, very little interaction occurred between the College of Engineering, the College of Pharmacy, and School of Medicine.   The IGERT program played a significant role in developing these interactions.   The research focus of the IGERT program, Bioactive Interfaces and Devices provided opportunities for scientists and engineers working in the area of synthetic interfaces and materials to interact with other scientists and engineers with expertise in biological components, such as proteins and cells.   Through IGERT support and trainees, collaborations across disciplines were initiated that have lead to very active and exciting research interactions.   The research collaborations involved a number of different disciplines including Chemical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Materials Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Medicine.   Each student had 2 advisors, one that focused on biological systems (cells and proteins) and the other on synthetic architectures.  The focus of the research was investigating interactions of biological systems with synthetic architectures for various applications including medical implants, drug delivery systems and sensors.   One example of a project includes a project with faculty members in Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering that focused on the development of a scaffold used to regenerate the growth plate following fractures in children.  In another project, trainees worked with investigators in Chemical Engineering and the Markey Cancer Center to develop peptide-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles for cancer therapy.  Another group developed a sustained release antimicrobial hydrogel wound dressing for treatment of serious wounds.   \n\n            The IGERT Program at the University of Kentucky has contributed immensely to the growth of interdisciplinary research in the area of Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices.   This interdisciplinary research has resulted in jointly funded federal grants.  Current funding to the IGERT faculty participants is nearly $21 million from 19 different federal, private, educational and industrial sponsors.  The majority of these grants stem from collaborations that resulted from the IGERT initiative. The IGERT program has also resulted in a number of entrepreneurial type activities among the IGERT faculty and trainees.   An example of this includes a recent start-up company by Drs. Zach Hilt and Thomas Dziubla (both IGERT faculty participants) call Bluegrass Advanced Materials, LLC to commercialize their antioxidant polymer technology.   Also, Dr. Eric Munson (IGERT faculty participant) is currently Co-Director and University of Kentucky Site Leader of the Center for Pharmaceutical Development, an NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center.   The center allows smooth transfer of technologies from the center to the pharmaceutical industry as well as evaluations of technologies developed by researchers.   The IGERT Program was instrumental in initiating these activities and has resulted in the submission of an NSF NRT to continue the IGERT theme with emphasis on entrepreneurial graduate training.   \n\nThe IGERT program has also resulted in a number of joint publications.  Since 2008, the IGERT research has resulted in over 45 publications in prestigious journals such as Journal of Controlled Released, Molecular Pharmaceutics, and Biomaterials. Close to 200 conference presentations resulted from this interdisciplinary research.   The IGERT Program also contributed to our University receiving a National Cancer Institute Cancer Nanotechnology Training Center.  Many of the participants in this new training program are IGERT faculty participants and a number of our IGERT trainees were accept..."
