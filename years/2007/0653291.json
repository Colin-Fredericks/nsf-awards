The target population is economically and/or educationally disadvantaged students in STEM fields. The goals of the this project are to increase retention of students in STEM disciplines and to increase the number of students who: a) pursue STEM academic and career pathways b) graduate with B.S. degrees in STEM fields and c) participate in STEM industry internships/research. \r\n\r\nThe institutions included in this collaboration are San Diego State University, San Diego City College, and Southwestern College. The project is incorporating the Math, Engineering, Science, Achievement (MESA) Program model at each partner campus. It is enhancing efforts to provide essential services that help students excel academically, develop leadership skills, and gain exposure to industry. Team internships are being facilitated through this project to provide students with opportunities to increase their knowledge and to develop skills for academic and workplace success, and ultimately to become part of the economic development of the region. A \"Guide to an Effective STEP\" is being developed to disseminate the outcomes and effectiveness of the SPSD program to contribute to the national effort to increase student participation in STEM fields. \r\n \r\n \r\n",
