 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: Antennas are widely used by radiowave and microwave devices (e.g. cell phones, television, satellite communication, etc.) to release and capture electromagnetic energy. However the optical analogue is basically non-existing in today's technology. Instead, optical radiation is manipulated by redirecting the wavefronts with lenses and mirrors. Consequently, because of diffraction, optical fields cannot be localized to dimensions much smaller than the optical wavelength. Antennas have a characteristic dimension on the order of the wavelength and for antennas to work at optical frequencies fabrication accuracies down to 10nm are required. With the advent of nanoscience and technology this length scale becomes increasingly accessible. This project focuses on the study of noble metal optical antenna structures which will be developed by both top-down nanofabrication techniques and bottom-up synthesis. Fundamental properties of these structures will be investigated using single molecule spectroscopy and near-field scanning optical microscopy. These studies will define critical design criteria, and provide an elementary understanding of antenna-coupled absorption and emission processes. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Optical antenna arrays are likely to be used for artificially enhancing the absorption cross-section or quantum yield of optoelectronic devices (e.g. solar cells). They will also find application for efficiently releasing energy from nanoscale devices (e.g. LED lighting) and for boosting the efficiency of biochemical detectors relying on a distinct spectroscopic response (Raman scattering, fluorescence, etc. ). This project will offer students and junior researchers the opportunity to participate in a collaborative research and education program established between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester. The resources of this project will also be used to implement new topics in an ongoing 'open house' program aimed at fostering scientific curiosity in elementary school children. \r\n",
