 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates a novel approach for assessing the fluency and\r\ngrammaticality of alternative translation hypotheses that are created within\r\nsearch-based Machine Translation (MT) systems.  This task, commonly termed\r\n\"\"Language Modeling\"\" (LM), has been explored primarily in the context of speech\r\nrecognition; however, current state-of-the-art language models (LMs) are not\r\neffective at distinguishing between more fluent grammatical translations and\r\ntheir poor alternatives.  In contrast, the proposed approach, \"\"Discriminative\r\nKnowledge-Rich Language Modeling\"\" (DKRLM), is explicitly designed to find the\r\nmost fluent and grammatical translations within the search space by comparing\r\nthe linguistic features of the translation hypotheses against very large\r\n\"\"clean\"\" monolingual corpora. The intuition is that more grammatical\r\ntranslation hypotheses should contain higher proportions of features seen in\r\nthe large corpora.  An important contribution of the project is in exploring\r\ndifferent types of linguistic features to identify those that are most\r\ninformative for the comparisons.  Moreover, discriminative training is\r\nperformed to incorporate the features into a system-independent scoring\r\nfunction, replacing traditional LMs in MT systems.  The broader impacts of the\r\nproposed work include both broader adoption for the methodology as well as\r\nwider use of the new DKRLM functions to other search-based NLP applications\r\nthat aim at generating fluent grammatical text.  This includes search-based\r\napproaches to Speech Recognition, Natural Language Generation (NLG), Optical\r\nCharacter Recognition (OCR), Summarization, and others.",
