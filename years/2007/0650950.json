 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Richard J. Saykally of the University of California - Berkeley and his graduate student colleagues will continue their study of the spectroscopy of water clusters.  These studies will use long-wavelength radiation to probe clusters of from two to five water molecules.  The experiments will be carried out with close collaboration with theorists in order to develop better interaction potentials for describing the intermolecular interactions in water.    \r\n\r\nWater is a uniquely important substance, yet much remains unknown about the precise molecular interactions that take place between individual water molecules.  The work of the Saykally group aims to build up accurate and precise models of these interactions which may then be used by others to model the important chemistry that takes place in aqueous media.  In addition to providing scientific training to his research students, Prof. Saykally continues outreach through his numerous public lectures and through other venues (e.g. the recent film/book/website series \"Sacred Balance,\" which includes a section featuring Prof. Saykally and his work on the nature of water.)\r\n",
