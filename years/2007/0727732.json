 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to recruit academically-excellent students to the STEM programs; to increase the retention of STEM majors; to improve student support programs for STEM students, and to increase the number of students graduating in STEM fields.  To meet these goals this project is awarding scholarships to academically-talented students with high financial need in order to allow them to remain in school and complete degrees in STEM fields.  This program is building upon the pre-existing Science & Math Living-Learning Community which is providing the scholars with greater interactions with the faculty, learning opportunities outside the classroom, and opportunities to attend and/or present at professional conferences in their discipline.\r\n\r\nThe project is broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities in the STEM programs at the institution.  As a result of its location in rural northwestern Pennsylvania, the University is limited in its ability to recruit students from two of the closest urban centers, Cleveland and Buffalo, because of the costs of out-of-state tuition.  Scholarships for out-of-state students, combined with intense faculty recruiting efforts in Cleveland and Buffalo, are resulting in a more diverse pool of student applicants to the STEM programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
