Overall, 127 years of scholarship support are being awarded.  The scholarships are increasing the number students from underrepresented groups graduating with a degree in a STEM field.   All S-STEM scholars participate in the Science Educational Enhancement Services (SEES) program.  SEES is an umbrella organization that functions as a learning community.  SEES maintains student study and meeting rooms, computer facilities, as well as, a kitchen area.   A variety of student services including faculty advisement, a Freshmen Orientation Course, a mentoring program, leadership and professional development guidance, and the Academic Excellence Workshop are available through SEES.  The Academic Excellence Workshop provides peer-led academic support in science and mathematics and tutoring services.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
