 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals can use several sensory modalities to communicate and recent research highlights the prevalence of complex signaling in animal displays (e.g. the combination of more than one signal often across multiple sensory modalities). Several hypotheses exist regarding the evolution and function of complex signaling including hypotheses relating to (a) the information content or message(s) conveyed, (b) the efficacy with which a signal(s) travels through the environment and is received and/or processed by a receiver, and (c) the potential for one signal to alter either the production, reception, or processing of a second signal. This project is aimed at understanding the evolution and function of complex signaling in the wolf spider genus Schizocosa. Within Schizocosa, multimodal courtship signaling (visual plus seismic) has evolved independently multiple times. This project examines the role of signal efficacy, signal content, and the potential interdependence of the two on complex signal function across 11 populations of Schizocosa encompassing 7 species and uses both field and laboratory based data collection and experimentation. Results from this study will not only provide foundational information regarding selection pressures influencing the evolution of complex signaling, but they will also likely provide insights into the details of modality-specific sensory perception and processing, neuronal interactions between modalities, and the influence of multimodal signals on signal detection/discrimination and learning and memory.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing innumerable research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, this research will be incorporated into a youth science camp during the University of Nebraska's Big Red Week. Scientists involved in the project will help increase the public's scientific awareness by leading nighttime spider hunts with rural youth groups in the Midwest and with church youth groups and Girl Scout Troops across the south. This project will also contribute greatly to the invertebrate collection at the University of Nebraska State Museum.\r\n",
