 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is a Ph.D. granting research department that is regionally and nationally recognized for excellence in teaching and promoting undergraduate research. The Nebraska REU draws on these qualities to cultivate an environment that emphasizes interaction among its students and among its students and the Department as the students develop their research skills. In addition to research, there is an emphasis on developing written and oral communication skills in mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe Nebraska REU is an eight-week summer program for 10 undergraduate students. The program is designed to help mathematically talented students carry out research in areas of applied mathematics that include: differential/difference equations on time series, continuous and discrete modeling in the life sciences, and stochastic modeling in the life and social sciences. The students will work in groups of 2-4 under the mentoring guidance of one or two applied mathematicians and a graduate student. With the help of their mentors, they will write up their results in a form suitable for journal publication; and, in most cases, will submit their results to a journal. All groups will present their results in a conference setting during the last week of the REU. Social activities are planned throughout the eight weeks. In addition to the $3,000 stipend, on-campus room, board, and the student recreation center are provided at no cost to the participant. The Department will also provide students up to $400 toward the cost associated to presenting their REU results at a national conference.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStudents live on the main campus, just a 5 minute walk from downtown Lincoln, in a dormitory that has a state of the art cafeteria. Lincoln, as the state capitol with a population of about 220,000, is a very pleasant town with ample free cultural activities, parks, and jogging paths for your enjoyment during the summer when you need a break from the mathematics.\r\n",
