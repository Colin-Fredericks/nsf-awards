 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR ) Phase II project will develop biocidal nanocomposites to protect plastics such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Biocides can now be added as a component during the plastic manufacturing process to make it inherently resistant to microbial attack. PVC is a widely used plastic that requires antimicrobial protection in many applications, as it is often used near water (swimming pool liners and shower curtains) or in areas where sterile or clean surfaces are critical (flooring for hospitals or kitchens and bathrooms). PVC is currently protected from microbial attack by arsenic compounds or organic biocides that migrate slowly out of the protected material. Arsenic-based biocides are under increasing regulatory pressure, and an alternative would be welcomed by the industry. Unfortunately, current non-arsenic (organic) biocides leach out of PVC, contaminating the environment and allowing fungi to attack the PVC. TDA Research, (TDA) proposes to increase the permanence of biocides designed to disperse in PVC. Nanoparticle-based biocides would not migrate out of the thermoplastics, prolonging product lifetimes. The project will start by examining several active organic biocides that have been approved and regulated as biocides for thermoplastics. Following this will be tasks related to nanoparticle synthesis; formulation and testing of the nanocomposite; nanoparticle manufacturing scale-up; and performance and economic evaluation. The plan is to develop nonarsenic, non-migratory biocides for PVC.\r\n\r\nCommercially, the proposed project will improve help eliminate the use of arsenic containing biocides; biocides which are particularly harmful because they persist in the environment. Despite their known dangers and the desire of manufacturers to discontinue their use, arsenic containing formulations continue to be used in several applications where the alternative organic biocides do not provide the needed long term protection. Further, the use of our technology will decrease the release of the organic biocides into the environment as well, keeping them in the polymer where they are needed. \r\n",
