 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of our proposal is to measure the value-added of a K-12 science\r\neducation program linked to a large-scale STEM research center. We propose a multifaceted study to document the impact of CERSP K-12 programs on pre-college teachers and students. This study will include analysis of written data from teachers, as well as data from interviews and observations. The effects of the CERSP K-12 website, learning modules, and teacher workshops will be studied. This study focuses on a center-based education program that has meticulously followed education best practices and can document many activities over a 7-year duration. The results of the study will be reported in the science education research literature as well as disseminated to the science research center community.\r\n\r\nThe results will be of use to other Center-based education programs and to science policy makers. The science research community has invested in a broad range of K-12 education outreach initiatives. The CERSP program is an example of such an initiative that impacts large populations of students and teachers in several states. Although there is significant literature about best practices in K-12 outreach, there are few guides as to the applications and impacts of these practices in the STC setting. Center leaders and those constructing center proposals will be able to use our results to design, manage and evaluate center K-12 programs.\r\nproposals will be able to use our results to design, manage and evaluate center K-12 programs.",
