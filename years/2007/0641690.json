 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIntimate associations between microbes and eukaryotic hosts are widespread in nature, occurring in every type of ecological niche.  The spectrum of such interactions ranges from highly integrated obligatory symbioses to loose associations.  Understanding how microorganisms and their hosts interact with each other and at different biological levels is of fundamental importance.  One of the most common eukaryote-prokaryote interactions is that between nematodes (roundworms) and bacteria.  The range of associations between nematodes and bacteria is incredibly broad, ranging from fortuitous to obligate and from beneficial to pathogenic. Moreover, this extensive spectrum of symbioses occurs in all possible habitats of our planet.\r\nAt present numerous researchers worldwide are studying associations between these two groups of organisms.  Yet no common coherent ground exists connecting the science being done in this discipline, despite the fact that advances in each will undoubtedly inform the others. Furthermore, a comparative approach has the power to reveal common underlying themes of nematode-bacterium associations as well as fundamental aspects of symbiosis\r\nA workshop on 'Nematode-Bacteria Symbioses' will promote intellectual discourse among scientists studying bacteria-nematode association.  The goals of this workshop are threefold: 1) Foster interdisciplinary collaborations between scientists; 2) break down barriers between researchers studying different taxonomic groups of nematode-microbe associations; 3) encourage scientists engaged in basic and applied research to explore how cross-talk and networking can enhance and advance science in this field. The workshop will be held from April 21 to 23, 2007, at the University of Arizona, Tucson Arizona.  Keynote speakers will present on a broad range of taxa and topics pertaining to microbe-nematode interactions, including ecto- and endosymbiosis, beneficial symbioses, multitrophic interactions, pathogenesis, host recognition, colonization processes, genetics and genomics.  The invited speakers are world-recognized experts in their research fields and include individuals from underrepresented groups including women (two), beginning investigators (two) and racial minorities (one).  \r\nThis workshop will help build bridges between historically separated disciplines, provide a venue for setting common and comparative research goals, and create new research collaborations and directions. Its challenge is to make educated decisions regarding the most important questions for the field of Nematode-Bacterium Symbioses to be addressed by the new methodologies of genomics, molecular and computational biology. This workshop is also meant to encourage participants to think and present their work bearing in mind that nematode-microbe associations are excellent model systems that can be applied and considered at different level of course curricula.  The proceedings of this workshop will be summarized and submitted together as a series of papers to the journal, \"Symbiosis\" as a special issue dedicated to this symposium.\r\n",
