 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this GOALI award is to develop the \"intelligent\" friction stir processes (FSP) and advance the fundamental understanding of the material deformation and alloying in FSP.  Working together with Ford Motor Company, the GOALI collaborator, this research can improve the shape, quality, and strength of the spot friction welding (SFW) joint for light-weight aluminum automotive body structure.  A novel idea to apply the FSP for addition or building of material will also be investigated.  Experimental analysis will enable better understanding of the bulk- and alloy material mixing and flow in the friction stir zone.  The intelligent spindle with temperature and force sensing capability will be adopted in this research.  Using advanced in-process monitoring and control of temperature and force can optimize the SFW process.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research can lead to three additional broad impacts of FSP.  First is the friction stir repair of cracks.  Current friction stir welding leaves a hole of the tool tip shape after retracting from the surface.  Using the material additive process, the hole can be filled and components with cracks can be repaired, possibly on-site.  Second, this process can potentially lead to FSP-based rapid prototyping to build functional part from simple geometry.  Third, small batch of new alloy materials can be generated under the large deformation and high temperature in the friction stir zone.  This research will have close collaboration with the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University of South Africa.\r\n\r\n",
