 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis and processing of materials for the 21st century requires a new paradigm where chemistry, physics, biology, engineering and computational modeling come together. Thus, multidisciplinary training is essential to prepare future science workforce. To meet this goal, the Center for Microengineered Materials (CMEM) at the University of New Mexico (UNM) will continue to offer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) through the REU Site program funded by the Division of Materials Research, National Science Foundation.  REU students will work in interdisciplinary teams on research projects that emphasize fundamental research with potential impact on industrial applications. These students will have opportunities to work with in an industry/university cooperative research center through CMEM and also with scientists at Sandia National Laboratories and UNM's newly formed Center for Biomedical Engineering. The aim is to convey the excitement of open-ended research and enhance student interest in pursuing science and engineering careers. Twelve students majoring in chemical engineering, materials science, chemistry or ceramic science and engineering will be selected each year to participate in the 10-week REU Site summer program.  They will also visit local industries and national laboratories as well as take part in social and cultural activities.",
