 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project strives to improve the state-of-the-art in architectural\r\nsimulators in two ways: (i) by enabling users to determine if an architectural\r\nsimulator correctly models the key aspects of a real hardware system; and (ii)\r\nby helping simulator implementors to identify weaknesses in their simulators.\r\nThis problem is critical because much architectural research today uses\r\nsimulations; if the simulators are not accurate then the results from the\r\nsimulator may be misleading.  Prior work validates simulators by using\r\naggregate metrics (e.g., do the simulator and the real hardware execute a\r\nprogram in a similar number of total cycles?).  This validation does not\r\nconsider whether or not the simulator and the hardware exhibit similar\r\ntime-varying behavior.\r\n\r\nA key innovation of this project is that it embraces techniques from the field\r\nof non-linear dynamics.  These techniques are well suited for computer systems\r\nfor two reasons.  First, computer systems are non-linear at all levels (e.g.,\r\nthe cost of a cache miss is not fixed and instead depends on many factors) and\r\nthus linear techniques will be of only limited use.  Second, many aspects of\r\ncomputer systems are unknown (e.g., the hardware manufacturer may not reveal\r\nthe full specifications of the hardware) or unmeasurable (e.g., it may not be\r\npossible to measure how often a particular event occurs deep down in the\r\nhardware).  Non-linear dynamics techniques are specifically designed to deal\r\nwith such missing information.",
