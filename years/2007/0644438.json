 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs are shallow benthic communities that harbor the highest \r\nbiodiversity in tropical seas.  These ecosystems are endangered due to global climate \r\nchange and anthropogenic pressure from coastal areas. Coral health has been \r\ndecaying at unprecedented rates in the past decades and is therefore in need of \r\nimmediate attention. A healthy reef requires a stable coral-algal symbiosis. Thus, \r\nunderstanding the processes required for this mutualism is fundamental for coral \r\nreef preservation.  Examining how corals respond to bacterial pathogens can also shed \r\nlight onto how host-pathogen interactions may be the same or differ from processes \r\nthat affect symbiotic interactions. The use of high throughput gene expression profiling \r\n(transcriptomics) is a relatively new genomics approach that promises to enhance the \r\nstudy of these interactions. This project will examine the transcriptome as it varies \r\nfrom natural (i.e., healthy) to disturbed states (i.e., bleached or diseased) in two \r\ncoral-algal symbioses from the Caribbean: the corals Acropora palmata and \r\nMontastraea faveolata and their dominant dinoflagellate symbionts. \r\nThe outcome of this research will contribute to the study of symbiosis as well as to \r\napplied fields such as conservation and management, including the development of \r\ncoral health diagnostics. This project will train underrepresented minorities at the \r\nUniversity of California, Merced.  This new campus offers higher education and \r\nresearch opportunities to the disadvantaged Central Valley communities. This \r\neducational effort will be enhanced by a partnership with the DOE Joint Genome \r\nInstitute to develop a course in Genome Biology.  Students will also have the \r\nopportunity to be involved in environmental podcasting through the UC Merced \r\nwebsite in three languages representative of the Central Valley populations \r\n(English, Spanish and Hmong).  The project will also continue with successful \r\noutreach activities in collaboration the California Academy of Sciences through \r\nteacher training workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
