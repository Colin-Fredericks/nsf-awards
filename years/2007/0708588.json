Mathematically, the problems\r\nrequire finding solutions to coupled, highly nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equations, further complicated by inevitable\r\ntemporal variations, multi-scale processes, and nontrivial\r\nboundaries.  Tractable problems require judicious modeling\r\nefforts in order to capture the main features of the phenomena\r\nunder consideration.  The simplified models are addressed using\r\nappropriate analytical or numerical strategies in order to\r\nprovide solutions that enable comparing the theoretical\r\npredictions with experimental observations.  The investigator\r\nexamines two sets of problems.  The first set is associated with\r\npremixed combustion in an excess-enthalpy combustor where the hot\r\ncombustion products are recirculated to heat up the fresh\r\nreactants, thus enhancing the burning rate and heat output.  The\r\nsecond set of problems is associated with nonpremixed combustion\r\nin a confined slot, where the mixing zone and the resulting\r\ndiffusion flame spread over the entire length of the reactor\r\nchannel.  The goal is to study the structure, properties and\r\ndynamics of flames in such configurations and identify conditions\r\nfor steady burning, onset of instabilities, flashback or blowoff,\r\nand flame extinguishment. \r\n\r\n     Combustion is a subject of great economical and societal\r\nconcern.  Despite the continuing search for alternative energy\r\nsources, combustion still provides the majority of the energy\r\nconsumed today.  It is therefore important to ensure that\r\ncombustion processes are utilized in the most efficient way, and\r\nin such a way as to minimize undesirable effects on the\r\nenvironment.  Recent development in the field of microscale\r\ncombustion has been motivated by the increased need for smaller\r\nscale and high density power sources and by the fact that\r\nhydrocarbon fuels have enormous advantages over batteries in\r\nterms of energy storage per unit mass.  There are, however,\r\nimportant issues that need to be addressed in order to render\r\nthis technology practical and efficient.  Beyond the difficulties\r\nassociated with fabrication, fundamental questions concerned with\r\nthe underlying combustion physics need to be overcome.  The\r\ndevelopment of combustion systems at the microscale requires\r\ndeeper understanding at the fundamental level of fluid flow in\r\nmicrochannels, heat and mass transport at the small scale,\r\ncombustion in small volumes and complex geometries, thermal and\r\nchemical properties of the wall materials, and fluid-wall\r\ninteractions.  Mathematical modeling plays an important role\r\ntowards this goal; it provides means to explain experimental\r\nobservations and identify the physical mechanisms responsible for\r\nthese observations.  The investigator, building on his earlier\r\ncontributions to fluid mechanics and chemically reacting flows,\r\nstudies the peculiarities of combustion at the microscale in\r\norder to improve physical understanding of these phenomena.  By\r\nguiding and supporting the ongoing experimental efforts the\r\nproject has an immediate effect on advancements of this new\r\ntechnology. \r\n",
