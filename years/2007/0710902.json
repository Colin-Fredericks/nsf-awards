Zoughi, University of Missouri-Rolla\r\n\r\nThe 3rd International Conference on Electromagnetic Near-Field\r\nCharacterization and Imaging (ICONIC 2007, www.umr.edu/iconic), is scheduled to be held in St. Louis, MO, USA on June 27-29, 2007. This conference is dedicated to providing a unified and unique international forum in which different communities, in particular acoustics, electromagnetics and optics, are brought together for the exchange of ideas in the realm of innovative near-field methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: ICONIC 2007 aim to provide an important and unique scientific forum in addition to assembling an international diverse group of individuals from academia, industry and government agencies. The utilization of near-field methods, implemented over a wide range of frequencies, has been continuously expanding in recent years addressing important application-based issues. These communities (acoustics, electromagnetics and optics) commonly hold their own specific scientific conferences. Scientists and academics in each of these communities are often engaged in research and development works that have direct applicability and utility in and for the other communities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: An important objective of this conference is to actively incorporate the participation of graduate students conducting research and development in these areas.\r\nPast ICONIC conferences have had a strong participation of graduate students. We intend to continue this tradition and add new elements that would strengthen student participation like a student poster competition. Additionally, NSF funding is being requested here to facilitate graduate student participation (and undergraduate students if applicable). Academic faculty attending in this conference will be encouraged to engage their students by their participation in the conference. Eligible students are expected to personally present their papers or posters at the conference. In all of the related announcements, an explicit statement will be included to encourage students from under represented groups in engineering and science to apply for these funds. In addition, the active participation of students in this conference will enhance their academic experience and facilitate exposure to several state-of-the-art topics and provide networking possibilities with individuals representing a broad range of expertise. \r\n\r\n",
