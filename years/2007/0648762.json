The Site focuses on the archaeology of eastern Africa, especially the origins of food production and ceramic and metal technology and the impacts of these processes on ancient societies. Six students will be selected from across the country, especially undergraduates from underserved communities.  The program is an intensive research experience in which students conduct archaeological research, including site survey, mapping, and the analysis of artifacts and ethnoarchaeology.   In addition, students will become familiar with archaeological resources in Western Kenya, including archaeological sites and museums, and will participate in classroom lecture and discussion with the Site's international faculty.  A central goal of the program is to provide international archaeological experiences for undergraduates.  This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
