 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will infer fine-scale electron density variations of the equatorial ionosphere by developing and applying estimation algorithms to data recorded from scintillating GPS radio signals. The resulting electron density profiles will provide images of the bubble structures that are thought to cause the phenomena of radio frequency scintillations and equatorial spread-F.  The project will include algorithm development, data collection campaigns, and data analysis.  The algorithms to be developed will perform diffraction tomography calculations; the input data are received Radio Frequency (RF) signal amplitudes and phases from an array of receivers that are experiencing scintillations. The algorithms will estimate electron density profiles by developing and applying model estimation/inversion techniques to models such as a phase screen with Fresnel forward scattering. The estimation techniques will exploit the availability of dual-frequency GPS scintillation data that can be monitored because of new civilian GPS L2 signals now becoming available. They will also exploit the ability of GPS to make group-delay measurements; use of these data will follow development of a model predicting how group delay is affected by a disturbed ionosphere. The algorithms will be applied to data from two types of equatorial scintillation collection campaigns. One type of campaign will collect data using small arrays of wide-band digital storage receivers and MATLAB post-processing to acquire and track scintillating signals. The second type will use a medium sized array of real-time GPS software radio receivers. Some of the effort will go toward completing development of the latter type of receiver. Two distinctive features of this project are its use of  very robust receiver technology, which will enable collection of very accurate RF amplitude and phase data for very strong scintillations and its development of generalized estimation/inversion algorithms.  These algorithms that go beyond the capabilities of currently existing or proposed algorithms in their use of multi-frequency data, in their problem formulations, and in their algorithmic implementation based on optimization or fixed-point methods.   The project focuses on very strong scintillations since these are the most important from an operational standpoint since they have the biggest impact on communications and navigation signals.  The project's broader impacts include the development of instruments that can be used in education as well as in research and the improved communication and navigation system reliability that will result from an improved understanding of scintillations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch has been conducted to use dual-frequency GPS amplitude and beat carrier-phase data from an array of space-weather receivers to estimate the disturbed electron density profiles that give rise to ionospheric scintillation near the magnetic equator.  This work advances the art of GPS remote sensing of the ionosphere to help image electron density variations below the Fresnel length scale, i.e., those with horizontal length scales below 100 m.  This effort included advanced dual-frequency GPS software radio receiver development, scintillation data collection campaigns in the equatorial region, diffraction physics model development, inverse diffraction algorithm development, and application of an inverse-diffraction algorithm to real data.\n\nThis project has made six principle contributions within the discipline of GPS-based remote sensing of the ionosphere.  First, it has demonstrated the efficacy of a new DSP/software-radio dual-frequency civilian GPS receiver to function as a science instrument for purposes of remote sensing of scintillation.  Second, it has gathered rich sets of dual-frequency GPS ionospheric scintillation data in the equatorial region (Natal, Brazil and Jicamarca, Peru) from small arrays of receivers. These data can be used to analyze the ionosphere and to test diffraction model inversion algorithms that are used in such analyses.  Third, this project has demonstrated the first observations of equatorial ionospheric scintillation on the new civilian GPS L2 signal, thus showing the usefulness of this new signal for remote sensing of scintillation.  These observations confirmed the expected relationships between scintillation on the GPS L1 frequency (1575.42 MHz) and scintillation on the L2 frequency (1227.6 MHz):  There was close correlation between the L1 and L2 power fades during weak scintillation, but not during strong scintillation, and the L2 fades were deeper, on average, in all scintillation regimes.  Fourth, this project has developed and applied an inverse diffraction algorithm.  This algorithm is based on a phase-screen model, and it uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) calculations and nonlinear least-squares techniques for data fitting.  It has been applied successfully to two data sets.  It has yielded improved fits to received dual-frequency L-band amplitude and beat carrier phase data from a small array of receivers.  Fifth, this project has identified weaknesses of the simple phase-screen model for the strong scintillation case if the scintillating region is thick in the vertical direction or if its vertical location drifts.  Sixth, this project has developed and tested two new techniques for improved modeling of L-band radio-wave propagation through a diffracting random ionospheric electron density profile.  One technique is based on spatial FFT calculations along two dimensions (roughly the horizontal dimensions) and on direct integration of Maxwell's equations along the vertical dimension.  The other technique is a multi phase-screen method that allows for skewed incidence of the plane waves on the phase screens.\n\nAn important impact on the public welfare has been the demonstration of an ability to apply inverse diffraction techniques to equatorial ionospheric scintillation.  This demonstration represents a small, yet significant, step towards better understanding of the ionospheric disturbances that cause radio-wave scintillation near the magnetic equator.  An improved understanding of this phenomenon should help scientists and engineers to predict or even alleviate the significant adverse impacts that scintillation can have on navigation and communication equipment.  The most problematic impact that could be better predicted or alleviated is a lack of signal availability due to the deep power fades that can be caused by scintillation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/19/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark L Psiaki"
