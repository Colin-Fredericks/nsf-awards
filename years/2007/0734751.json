 "awd_abstract_narration": "To produce meaningful, goal-directed behavior, it is necessary to be able to keep relevant information in mind and to mentally manipulate this information as needed (i.e., use working memory). It is also necessary to remember and use rules that specify how to respond under different circumstances and to switch flexibly between tasks and rules as the circumstances change. Working memory manipulation and the ability to use and switch flexibly between task rules are among the functions referred to as cognitive control functions, in that they enable us to control our thoughts and actions. Cognitive control is thought to rely on prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its interactions with other brain regions. However, brain imaging research in adults suggests that different control functions may rely on different brain regions. Moreover, behavioral research on the development of cognitive control over childhood suggests that these functions may mature at different rates. Dr. Silvia A. Bunge, with support of NSF, is examining the changes in brain activity over childhood that give rise to developmental improvements in specific cognitive control functions. To this end, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is being acquired while children and young adults (ages 8-25) perform tasks that require working memory and flexible rule use.\r\n\r\n Characterizing developmental changes in the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control will further our understanding of normal cognitive development and lead to insights regarding control mechanisms in the adult brain. These findings will lay the foundation for understanding how cognitive control development is compromised in neurodevelopmental disorders, and how teaching in schools might be modified to benefit children with disordered control. This project will provide research training and mentoring to a number of students, including a graduate student, a research assistant, and several undergraduates. The project will promote the scientific careers of at several female scientists. The findings will be disseminated via neuroscience conferences and child development conferences, and will be published in peer-reviewed journals.\r\n",
