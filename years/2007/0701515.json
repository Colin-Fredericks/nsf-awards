Kleiner\r\n\r\nThe first part of the project concerns two geometric evolution equations:\r\nmean curvature flow and Hamilton's Ricci flow.  The main objective\r\nis to understand the structure of the singular set and the geometry of\r\nthe solutions near the singular set.\r\nThe second part of the research program is motivated by geometric\r\ngroup theory and rigidity questions, specifically the asymptotic\r\nstructure of negatively curved (or Gromov hyperbolic) spaces.\r\nThis leads to an investigation\r\nof spaces which have a self-similar character using analytic\r\ntools that have been developed in the last few years.  Here\r\nthe goal is to  quasisymmetrically deform\r\n the space into an optimal form, if possible,\r\nin order to reveal hidden symmetries;  show that\r\nno hidden symmetries exist; or show that the original space\r\nwas really a deformation of something familiar.  This is directly\r\nrelated to group theoretic rigidity problems.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to study two nonlinear analogs of the heat equation: the\r\nevolution of surfaces by their mean curvature, and Hamilton's\r\nRicci flow. Mean curvature flow is a standard (idealized) model for\r\nmany physical process which involve an evolving surface, or interface,\r\nbetween two regions in space.  The Ricci flow -- an equation\r\ngoverning  a curved space geometry which evolves with time --\r\n has made headlines lately due to its\r\nprominent role in the spectacular work of Perelman on the 100 year old Poincare\r\nconjecture.  Much is known about the solutions of these two equations,\r\nbut many basic open questions remain, especially those tied with the\r\nformation of singularities, which play a central role in Perelman's work.\r\nThe project will address some of these questions.\r\nAnother component of the research program is an investigation\r\nof spaces which have a self-similar, or fractal character, using analytic\r\ntools that have been developed in the last few years.  Here\r\nthe goal is to deform the space into an optimal form, if possible,\r\nin order to reveal hidden symmetries,  show that\r\nno hidden symmetries exist, or show that the original space\r\nwas really a deformation of something familiar.  This is very useful\r\nfor understanding the asymptotic shape of infinite groups of symmetries.\r\n",
