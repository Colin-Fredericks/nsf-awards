McClure\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator plans to work in four quite different\r\nareas where homotopy-theoretic methods can be applied.  The first\r\narea is string topology.  This part of the project is joint with\r\nRalph Kaufmann; Kaufmann and McClure will combine their previous\r\nwork on string topology in order to obtain a lifting of string\r\ntopology to the chain level for arbitrary genus.  The second area\r\nis surgery spectra.  This is joint with Gerd Laures; Laures and\r\nMcClure will complete their proof that certain symmetric\r\nL-spectra have E-infinity ring structures and that the symmetric\r\nsignature is an E-infinity ring map.  They will also extend their\r\nwork in order to show that a certain map from algebraic K-theory\r\nto symmetric L-theory defined by Weiss and Williams is an\r\nE-infinity ring map.  The third area is intersection homology.\r\nThis is joint with Greg Friedman and Scott Wilson; Friedman,\r\nMcClure and Wilson will work to develop homotopy theoretic\r\nstructure on intersection chains which should (for example) lead\r\nto the development of a rational homotopy theory of stratified\r\nspaces.  The fourth area is C* algebras.  This is joint with\r\nMarius Dadarlat; Dadarlat and McClure will work to show that the\r\nclassical work of Dixmier and Douady on bundles whose fibre is\r\nthe algebra of compact operators can be extended to bundles whose\r\nfibre is a Kirchberg algebra.\r\n\r\nThe original goal of homotopy theory was to develop methods which\r\ncould be applied to geometric problems (including problems in\r\ndimensions higher than three).  Since its origin in the early\r\ntwentieth century, homotopy theory has developed into an\r\nautonomous discipline, but the connection with geometry has\r\nalways been a central concern.  Since about 1960, it has become\r\napparent that homotopy theory has applications to other things\r\nbesides geometry, for example to analysis, algebra, and more\r\nrecently to physics.  The work of the principal investigator and\r\nhis coauthors is intended to take the latest developments in\r\nhomotopy theory (for example, the theory of symmetric spectra)\r\nand apply them to other areas, including geometric problems (the\r\nclassification of higher-dimensional shapes), and problems in\r\nmathematical physics (string topology is part of the program\r\nbeing carried on by many people to develop a clearer mathematical\r\nunderstanding of ideas from string theory).\r\n",
