The Stony Brook Modeling Week comprises two\r\nprestigious symposia that are being held consecutively, namely, the annual Solid and Physical Modeling\r\nSymposium (to be held on June 2-4, 2008) and the annual International Conference on Shape Modeling and\r\nApplications (to be held on June 4-6, 2008). The first of these two conferences, the ACM Symposium on\r\nSolid and Physical Modeling (SPM) is co-sponsored by the Association For Computing Machinery Special\r\nInterest Group on Computer Graphics (ACM SIGGRAPH). It is an annual international forum for the exchange\r\nof recent research results in applications of spatial modeling and computations in design, analysis,\r\nsimulation, and manufacturing, as well as in emerging biomedical, geophysical, and other relevant areas.\r\nThe second conference, the International Conference on Shape Modeling and Applications (SMI) is cosponsored\r\nby the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Computer Society (IEEE-CS) and provides\r\nan international forum for the dissemination of new computational techniques for modeling and processing\r\ndigital representations of shapes and their properties to a diverse community of experts across a wide range\r\nof areas. These two conferences together traditionally had formed the International Convention on Shapes\r\nand Solids in 2004 and 2005, respectively.",
