 "awd_abstract_narration": "General adoption of hydrogen as a vehicular fuel depends critically not only on the\r\nability to store hydrogen on-board at high volumetric and gravimetric densities, but also\r\non the ability to extract it at sufficiently rapid rates. Recent experimental and theoretical\r\nstudies have identified several new complex hydrides with thermodynamic properties\r\nand material storage capacities approaching practical levels. However, all these\r\nmaterials suffer from extremely poor kinetics.\r\nIntellectual merit: The focus of the proposed work is to develop a systematic, rational\r\napproach to designing novel nanostructured materials with fast (de)hydrogenation\r\nkinetics and favorable thermodynamics using state-of-the-art scientific computing. The\r\naccurate predictive power of first-principles modeling will be used to forecast and\r\nunderstand the microscopic kinetic processes involved in the hydrogen release and\r\nuptake and to design new material/catalyst systems with improved properties. An\r\nin-depth atomistic picture of the chemical reactions, diffusion pathways, and phase\r\nchanges controlling the kinetics of hydrogen uptake and release will be developed.\r\nFundamental factors that control hydrogen-metal bond strength, the role of surface\r\nstructure and finite size on the thermodynamics and kinetics of hydride nanoparticles\r\nwill also be investigated. The effect of dopants and nanoscale catalysts in achieving fast\r\nkinetics and reversibility will be elucidated at the atomic level.\r\nBroader impact: The proposed work will aid in the development of computational\r\nmaterials science courses. In addition, there will be student exchange between\r\nNorthwestern and UCLA, as students from each group will have the opportunity for\r\nextensive visits to the other. The results of the research will be disseminated through\r\nthe education of graduate students, and introduction of undergraduate students to\r\ncomputational methods. It is expected that the skills acquired by the students, for\r\nexample in the use of computational modeling and simulation, will prepare them for\r\nfuture work in the industrial and educational communities. Finally, successful\r\ncompletion of this research program will greatly assist the development of new\r\nhydrogen storage systems for clean, environmentally safe passenger vehicles.\r\n",
