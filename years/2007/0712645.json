 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to create a peer-to-peer protocol that will cope with the challenges of supporting easy-to-deploy, large-scale audio communication solutions in the rapidly growing areas of social networking environments and online games. Today, the challenges prohibiting peer-to-peer audio communication on a large-scale consists of managing the dynamic nature of users joining and leaving and bandwidth management and optimization, enabling the creation of high quality audio and market-acceptable latency. The protocol and subsequent end-user applications that this project is developing aim to meet these challenges. \r\n\r\nA successful deployment with existing social networking sites will add significant value to their current offerings. The business opportunity is magnified due to the peer-to-peer nature of the protocol which requires minimal up-front infrastructure investments and manageable integration effort to roll out the technology. The proposed architecture aims to be a significant breakthrough that will elevate online communication within large group social sites from its current form of text chatting to a level that is closer to direct person-to-person contact.\r\n",
