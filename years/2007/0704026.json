 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on exploiting the unique chemical properties of \r\nmetallo-supramolecular polymers to develop novel materials.  Specifically, the potential of metallo-supramolecular polymers as templates for complex architectures, block copolymers, and catalysts will be studied.  The complex architectures targeted include poly[n]catenanes.  The synthetic protocol utilizes metal-ligand coordination as the thermodynamic driving force for the polymerization and dynamic ring closing metathesis as the covalent 'fixing' step.  For block copolymers, the ability to self-assemble block copolymer architectures using metal-ligand coordination will be studied.  For catalysts, potentially stimuli-responsive catalysis will be investigated.   \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Stuart J. Rowan, of the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University.  Professor Rowan's research efforts revolve around the discovery and the development of novel materials using metallo-supramolecular polymers.  These materials hold promise in the areas of molecular actuators, interwoven polymers, and highly thermo-stable devices.  They also hold promise for smart catalysts that respond to external stimuli.  This kind of smart catalysts could have important applications in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and electronic materials.",
