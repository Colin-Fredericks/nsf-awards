 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor David Nesbitt of the University of Colorado at Boulder and his associates will continue their investigations to facilitate benchmark tests between experiment and theory of highly reactive, transient chemical species.  Professor Nesbitt's research program in molecular spectroscopy will expand the knowledge base of jet-cooled radicals/molecular ions, metal/metal ion clusters, and single molecule microscopy and kinetics.  A major focus of the work will be to exploit the slit discharge spectrometer for high sensitivity infrared (IR) spectroscopy of jet-cooled molecular ions.  An additional focus will be the combination of pulsed lasers with slit jet expansions and high resolution direct absorption laser methods to provide high resolution IR access to novel organometallic, metal/adsorbate, and metal ion/solvent species.  Professor Nesbitt's group will also develop and exploit novel time, color and polarization fluorescence microscopy capabilities for exploring complex intramolecular dynamics of isolated biomolecules.\r\n\r\nUltimately, these experiments should provide fundamental new knowledge of utmost importance in a host of chemical transformations, ranging from atmospheric chemistry to industrial applications and biochemical catalysis.   This research will be conducted with post-doctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities.  The researchers will also be involved in outreach efforts to elementary and middle school students through the 'CU Wizards' program.",
