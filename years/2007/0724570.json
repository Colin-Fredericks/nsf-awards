 "awd_abstract_narration": "In plant and animal cells, the genetic code (DNA) resides protected in the nucleus, an internal compartment of the cell. Whenever cells divide as the organism grows and ages, the DNA is duplicated or copied in a complex and highly regulated process called replication. The accuracy of replication is extremely important because the duplicated genome needs to carry forward the correct information into the daughter cells or indeed the next generation. Maintaining the integrity and proper function of the genome after DNA is replicated has become a major theme of this field.  This conference is intended to bring together investigators from around the world including field leaders as well as graduate students to present and discuss their latest findings.  It will not only facilitate the progress in the research field, but also enrich the training opportunities for the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
