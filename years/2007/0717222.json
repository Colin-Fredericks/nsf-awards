 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major challenge in community ecology is understanding the mechanisms that maintain the diversity of species in any given locality.  The presence of predators can modify the usual predictions based on competition for resources and resource needs alone, with the conventional wisdom being that predation reduces competition and allows higher diversity.  However, mathematical models imply that predation can increase, decrease, or have no effect on species diversity depending on the circumstances.  These circumstances are poorly understood, even though the potential effects of predators are large. Thus, this proposal is to create a better theoretical understanding, with testable predictions, by developing a comprehensive mathematical theory of the role of predation in diversity maintenance. \r\n\r\nHuman impacts on the environment have had major effects on predator species, with the potential for large consequences for diversity maintenance. Moreover, predation has a much debated role in the invasion and impacts of nonnative species. Thus, this work will provide a stronger theoretical basis for conservation and invasive species management, while providing stronger predictions for empirical studies in ecology.  This work will also have an important training component in the application of mathematics in ecology, especially by women and minorities.\r\n",
