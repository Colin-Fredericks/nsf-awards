 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project describes plans for the continued development of a high quality research program in protein biophysical chemistry, and its integration into an educational plan involving high school, undergraduate, and master's students, as well as high school chemistry and biology teachers.  The intellectual merit of this research focuses on understanding the underlying molecular recognition of a class of sulfated steroids that inversely modulate ion channels belonging to the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) family.  Not only will this knowledge further the understanding of molecular recognition, but it will also aid in the ability to decipher the complex functioning of the brain.  What function do these neurosteroids play in regulating our memory, cognition, and learning?  The educational component integrates high school chemistry and biology teachers along with their students into the above research plan.  The specific aims are to:\r\n1. Map the binding site of pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS) and pregnanolone sulfate (PREGAS) to the iGluRs and understand why PREGS is a positive regulator of the NMDA receptor, but a negative regulator of the AMPA receptor.\r\n2. Involve high school chemistry and biology teachers in an inquiry based investigation, which will enable them to develop new techniques, gather ideas to incorporate into new courses or labs, and satisfy their clock hour requirements.\r\n3.  Involve high school juniors and seniors in a full time summer research program.  This will allow these students to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills, as well as to expose them to the excitement of science and the possibility of future careers in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project are primarily in addressing scientific literacy.  Not only will undergraduates and high school students be trained by this program, but also the high school teachers will participate in this program. Involvement of teachers in a research-based inquiry will aid in their ability to teach the process of science to students in a highly effective manner.  \r\n",
