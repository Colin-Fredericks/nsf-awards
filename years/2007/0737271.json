 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ITEST Comprehensive Project for Students and Teachers provides middle and high school students and teachers opportunities to use remote sensing and three-dimensional (3-D) visualization to study real-life natural resource problems in their communities with researchers from the University of Kentucky (UK) College of Agriculture and information technology (IT) staff from the Interactive Digital Center (IDC) at the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Ten multidisciplinary teams of five teachers from central and eastern Kentucky, at least one of their classes, and four student project leaders from each school are participating in the three-year project. The objectives include increasing student and teacher knowledge of remote sensing technology and 3-D computer visualization; developing and using five 3-D models, five GIS/remote sensing maps, and five units of study to be disseminated statewide; developing student Career Albums; and increasing all participants' understanding of community natural resource careers that demand IT skills. The program includes a two-week summer institute for teachers and selected student leaders, year-long teacher professional development, year-long community-based explorations for students, support by IT professionals, presentations by participants at conferences, and workshops for guidance counselors and parents. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the integration of geospatial, remote sensing and 3-D computer visualization technology; the collaboration of faculty and researchers within UK's College of Agriculture to bring timely and relevant research to the classroom; using the power of IT to do science, so as to excite central and eastern Kentucky students about STEM careers; and bringing together multidisciplinary teams of teachers to investigate community problems using technology. The broader impacts of the project include a lasting collaborative partnership among teachers, IT instructors at the IDC, and researchers within UK's College of Agriculture, and the integration of innovative technology and research into schools' curricula.",
