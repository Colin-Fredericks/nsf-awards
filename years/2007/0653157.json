 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fayetteville State University Opportunities for Talent Expansion in Interdisciplinary Education for Minorities in Undergraduate Math and Science (FSU OPTIMUM) program represents an effort that includes Fayetteville Technical Community College (FTCC) and high schools and industries in the area. The project encourages and enables minority students to complete baccalaureate degrees in Biology, Biotechnology, Chemistry, Computer Science, and Math and to enter the STEM workforce. Over the five  years of the program it is: 1) increasing the number of minority and women graduates in STEM disciplines, from 82 to 112; 2) increasing college enrollment of under-represented minority students and women in STEM disciplines from 286 to 355; 3) improving the educational opportunities for minority students and women in STEM disciplines; 4) increasing first-year and second-year retention rates of STEM majors by 10%; 5) increasing 5-year graduation rates of STEM majors by 10%; 6) improving student access to and utilization of support programs available at the University; 7) developing academic degree articulations and dual enrollment programs in STEM disciplines with FTCC and other community colleges in the service area; 8) strengthening partnerships between the University, local school districts, local STEM educational organizations and industries; and 9) through faculty focus groups, increasing the number of STEM faculty receiving professional development in teaching and in using innovative strategies for delivery of instruction and student advisement.  \r\n\r\nStudents receive financial assistance (tuition and book allowances, travel support to conferences, GRE preparations), research mentoring, enhanced advisement, internships and mentoring by STEM professionals, mathematics and science achievement projects, interdisciplinary science course offerings, and are encouraged to join learning communities. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The program includes detailed benchmarks and evaluation measures for program outcomes.  Thus the proposed activities provide an opportunity to advance understanding of effective means of support and advisement for undergraduate students in the STEM disciplines. The use of innovative teaching strategies, academic advisement and mentoring models, and subsequent evaluation fosters tight integration of education and research. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: While the project is primarily focused on direct support for undergraduate students in STEM disciplines, this project also promotes institutionalized and systematic change in the infrastructure at FSU for advisement, mentoring, networking, and partnerships; thereby strengthening the social, economic, and intellectual fabric of the community served by the university.\r\n\r\n",
