The project will build on existing interdisciplinary research on the Sugar Creek Watershed in North East Ohio. The project will recruit 8 STEM fellows each year. These fellows will work with 8 teachers each year. The intellectual merit includes the exploration of watershed science as a model system for incorporating multiple disciplines, such as environmental science and rural sociology, into a holistic, constructivist, systemic educational approach to create a cooperative learning opportunity involving university researchers and K-12 teachers and students. The broader impacts include providing the opportunity to fellows and teachers to join other project members for a research visit to Japan to analyze firefly habitat remediation as related to stream ecology.\r\n",
