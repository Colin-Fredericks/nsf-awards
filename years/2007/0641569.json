 "awd_abstract_narration": "In engineering terms, the hydraulic system of a woody plant is a \"negative pressure flow \r\nsystem\" in which conducting cells in the wood (xylem) are linked from roots to leaves.  \r\nThis type of hydraulic system is prone to failure due to the introduction of air bubbles, \r\nwhich create embolisms. Plants frequently develop embolisms in their hydraulic \r\nsystems, especially under water limited conditions. \r\nWhether man-made or natural, a pressure flow system can be protected from \r\nfailure in three ways: resistance, reparability, and redundancy.  Resistance to hydraulic \r\nfailure in plants is fairly well understood and involves the thickness of cells walls in \r\nconducting cells and in the surrounding matrix of thick-walled cells (fibers).  Reparability \r\nafter failure depends on living cells in and adjacent to xylem.  Redundancy reflects the \r\nnumber of root to leaf conducing pathways and the degree of their interconnectedness \r\n(hydraulic integration).  The unique arrangements of conducting cells, supporting fibers, \r\nand living cells in different species suggest that tradeoffs occur among these three \r\ntypes of protections.  To date, interactions among them are virtually unknown. \r\nThe proposed research questions whether the relative amounts of different types \r\nof protection change with increasing habitat aridity in dominant shrub species from \r\nmultiple lineages along transcontinental aridity gradients in North America, South \r\nAmerica, and Australia. Methods will involve standard techniques used to study the \r\nstructure of plant xylem and the use of dye tracers to characterize three-dimensional \r\npathways of water transport. Xylem function studies will quantify resistance to \r\nembolisms and reparability of experimentally induced embolisms.  This study will be the \r\nfirst to simultaneously examine the relative roles of redundancy, resistance and repair in \r\nprotecting plants from hydraulic failure. \r\nResults from this study will aid researchers and land managers in understanding \r\nhow hydraulic protection influences shrub survival during global climate change and \r\ndesertification.  Students of different ages, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds will \r\nexperience the scientific process as they participate in every aspect of the research.\r\n",
