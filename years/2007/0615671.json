 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding for a Research at Initiation Grant (RIG) to start Microbiology studies in the diversity and distribution of anaerobic bacteria that respire sulfate is being provided to Dr. Jose R. Perez-Jimenez from the Biology Department at the Universidad del Turabo in Puerto Rico. This bacterial group respires sulfate instead of oxygen and can use diverse compounds as a food source, including contaminants derived from gasoline.  They can be found in mangrove forests located in the coastal regions of the tropics.  Therefore, in an environment perennially active, they may have been adapted to degrade complex compounds coming from mangrove detritus, fuel leaks into the oceans or diverse human wastes.  In analogy to Darwin''s Finches, significant bacterial diversification is postulated to have occurred in tropical habitats because the geological origin of islands in the Caribbean is believed to include events of land separation from primitive continents, volcanic rising of the seafloor, and retraction of the sea level that sequestered bacteria in microsites.  Over time (millions of years), the bacteria geographically separated by geological events have adapted to the living conditions in various microhabitats, and may have evolved to use available chemicals as nutrients (toxic or not for humans).  The diversity (richness) and distribution (endemicity) will be examined using genetic techniques for a broad portrait of bacterial groups in coastal and terrestrial environments.  Some sites will be used for cultivation, in the presence and absence of contaminants, to know ''who is there'' and which microbes can degrade contaminants.  In a more novel approach, large genetic pieces will be examined from environmental samples and cultures to disclose selected activities, such as degradation of petroleum derivatives or detoxification of arsenate. Examination of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the tropics has been limited.  This research will provide genetic information and isolated bacteria to support future efforts with potential applications for the benefit of humanity and nature.\r\n\r\nBesides the scientific contributions, the most valuable outcome will be a generation of Puerto Rican undergraduate students trained with state-of-the-art techniques by a young scientist.  Students will benefit with direct research experiences, series of workshops and conferences, and scientific presentations at local and national levels.  The allocated resources will be employed in curricular improvement of current courses, workshops for faculty and K-12 teachers, and preparation of educational posters for the general public.",
