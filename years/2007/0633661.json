 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a series of laboratory experiments for advanced undergraduate electrical engineering students that give hands-on experience with organic electronic materials and liquid crystal display technology. Modular laboratory experiments are proposed for the fabrication and characterization of four devices: a single-pixel liquid crystal display (LCD), a polymer light-emitting-diode (pLED), a polymer field-effect-transistor (pFET), and an organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cell.  The investigator is writing a comprehensive lab manual and developing a low-cost \"kit\" of materials and equipment necessary for its implementation to increase transferability to other universities. Visits by two independent experts are being used to evaluate the effectiveness of the experiments, along with feedback from student participants. The modules are being shared with North Carolina Agricultural & Technology State University.  Materials are being disseminated through presentations at material science and engineering education conferences, through a faculty workshop, and through the posting on course website.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the material, the transfer of the modules to an HBCU, and outreach efforts through an existing program to serve minority high school students.\r\n",
