 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to implement Phase 2 of the ITEST Learning Resource Center at  Education Development Center, Inc. Phase 2 emphasizes technical assistance for ITEST projects and building a national dissemination strategy. EDC provides ITEST projects with a comprehensive collection of Technical Assistance tools, resources, and services designed to support and strengthen the ITEST community by developing an understanding of projects' strengths and needs, addressing areas of highest impact, linking projects to existing resources, and building on the contributions of formal and informal learning environments. Technical Assistance deliverables include annual PI Summits, an ITEST web forum, publications, and a variety of informative online events (panel discussions, peer exchanges, webcasts, discussion lists). Individualized technical assistance for new and returning PIs, increased communication with resource centers for related NSF programs, and a more robust dissemination plan are also new features.  Finally, ongoing project monitoring continues and contributes to the repository of data on ITEST projects including project models, evaluation plans, impacts, communities served, and participants.",
