 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) project will develop environmentally friendly composite panels from recycled aluminum cans for beams, frame, roof sections, and floor sections in low cost construction industries.  The specific objectives include: specific construction techniques for combining can end sections with various materials including (like wood and plastic) to make sandwich panels; experimental testing of the manufactured specimens for mechanical performance and failure properties; and, numerical analysis for the accurate and efficient failure analysis of the advanced structural composite panels.   \t\t\r\n\r\nThe benefits of the proposed activity include potential cost savings, structural durability, affordability and positive environmental impact due to the use of recycled beverage cans.  Since housing frames, walls, and roofing members are predominantly subjected to bending and compressive loads, advanced composite panels reinforced with can end sections may serve as a new durable composite system, and may have benefits over conventional wood, and reinforced wood composites.\r\n",
