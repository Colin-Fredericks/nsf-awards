In particular, the proposal investigates how optical beam directionality and diffraction affect secure ad hoc routing and communications in FSOSNs. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe PI plans to assess the use of unidirectional FSOSNs for secure transport of broadband data through a theoretical analysis of network connectivity as a function of system and device level optics characteristics; and the design of novel security mechanisms for routing in emerging unidirectional-link FSOSNs.  This research is high risk and high pay-off because this is the first formal study of secure routing issues in unidirectional FSOSNs. This investigation pursues the substantial but largely unexplored area of circuit-based routing for unidirectional sensor networks; novel approaches to enhance security that leverage inherent network hierarchy, line-of-sight communications, and the mobility of the base station are assessed. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe successful completion of this research will facilitate the early deployment and long-term adoption of emerging broadband surveillance networks, revolutionizing the way information is used for society's benefit. The PI is actively involved in formally mentoring a diverse base of students and has a successful track record of attracting such individuals to graduate studies. She will recruit, through undergraduate research experiences and active mentorship, students to this field of national importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
