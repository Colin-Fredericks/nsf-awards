The US PI is Dr. Nanette Chadwick, Department of Biological Sciences, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama.  The foreign collaborators are Dr. Fouad Al-Horani and Dr. Maroof Khalaf, both at the Marine Science Station (MSS) in Aqaba, Jordan.  Giant sea anemones and anemonefish form one of the most conspicuous and recognizable symbiotic interactions on coral reefs. In the Red Sea, individuals of Entacmaea quadricolor and Heteractis crispa are the most abundant giant sea anemones on shallow reefs, where they host the two-banded anemonefish Amphiprion bicinctus. More information is needed on patterns of population dynamics in both host anemones and anemonefish in the northern Red Sea. The coral reefs of Jordan at the northern tip of the Red Sea support large populations of these giant sea anemones and anemonefishes. The facilities of the MSS provide a unique opportunity to combine the expertise of U.S. and Jordanian scientists in a synergistic program to elucidate population dynamics and physiological mechanisms of interaction in these ecologically important reef organisms.  In the first year, students will develop hypotheses concerning the application of static population models to the population size structures of sea anemones and anemonefish, and concerning the ecophysiology of host sea anemones. Field work will consist of individually marking sea anemones and symbiotic fish within a defined reef area adjacent to the MSS, and collecting baseline data on abundance, patterns of symbiotic association, and population structure of members of both species. Laboratory work will involve measurements of respiration and photosynthesis of host sea anemones to determine effects of the guest fish on host metabolism. Students will select from 3 types of mathematical models to apply to the demographic data. In the second year, students will develop hypotheses on the application of dynamic information to population models, based on change in the sea anemone and anemonefish populations since the first census, and on the ecophysiology of anemonefishes. Field work will consist of recensusing the populations and applying dynamic demographic models. Students also will examine patterns of oxygen flux in anemonefishes. In the third year, students will develop hypotheses concerning application of multi-year information to population models, and on the ecophysiology of both sea anemones and anemonefish when tested together. \r\nIntellectual merit: This project will increase understanding of the population dynamics of ecologically-important giant sea anemones and anemonefish, and their potential for recovery following disturbances on coral reefs. It also will reveal the extent to which one of the host anemone species serves as a nursery habitat for fish. Elucidation of how interaction among cnidarians and fish affects their patterns of oxygen flux will enhance understanding of the ways in which reef organisms are interconnected, and reveal the complexity of ecophysiological mechanisms in a coral reef symbiosis. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This project will contribute to a scientific basis for the sustainable harvest of these organisms in other parts of the world where they are collected for the ornamental aquarium trade. It also will enhance the environmental awareness, cultural understanding, and international outlook of student participants, and will expose them to the culture of an Arabic Muslim country in the biogeographically and politically important region of the Middle East. 21 U.S. students will be exposed to field survey methods and mathematical modeling techniques for analysis of population dynamics in sea anemones. They will work with two Jordanian experts in the field who will mentor the students in ichthyological techniques and modeling of population dynamics in the anemonefish and in assessment of respiration and photosynthesis in host sea anemones as affected by resident fish.  In this program, students will develop scientific hypotheses, design individual research projects, and analyze and present their results orally and in written form. They will be exposed to laboratory and field research techniques in a unique coral reef environment.  This project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.\r\n",
