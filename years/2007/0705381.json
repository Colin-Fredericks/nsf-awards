Sharpe\r\n\r\nAndo and Sharpe will investigate several questions in elliptic\r\ncohomology suggested by the physics of open string theory.  In\r\nphysics, elliptic genera arise in closed string theory, but the\r\nrecent work of Stolz and Teichner and of Borisov and Libgover and\r\nGanter strongly suggests that open string theory plays an\r\nimportant role in elliptic cohomology. Ando and Sharpe propose to\r\nintroduce recent developments in open string theory, particularly\r\nideas about D-branes and K-theory, to the study of elliptic\r\ncohomology.  For example they hope to use open string theory to\r\ninvestigate the relationship between elliptic cohomology and the\r\nK-theory of K-theory, as studied by Baas, Dundas, Richter, and\r\nRognes.  They also hope to give a unified account of the McKay\r\ncorrespondence for elliptic genera, due to Borisov and Libgober,\r\nand for sheaves, due to Bridgeland, King, and Reid.\r\n\r\n\r\nElliptic cohomology arises from topology, and it signals a\r\nprofound relationship between physics, particularly the physics\r\nof string theory, and at least two branches of mathematics,\r\ntopology and number theory.  Precisely how these things are\r\nrelated through elliptic cohomology remains mysterious: the\r\nphysicist Edward Witten called elliptic cohomology \"a piece of\r\n21st century mathematics that happened to fall into the 20th\r\ncentury.\"  Until very recently, the study of the physics of\r\nelliptic cohomology has focused mainly on \"closed\" string theory,\r\nin which particles are replaced by loops of string.  There is now\r\na rich theory of \"open\" strings, in which particles may also be\r\nunlooped strands of string.  Ando and Sharpe suggest that the\r\nphysics of open string theory has deep implications in elliptic\r\ncohomology.  They propose to investigate several of these\r\nimplications, which they hope will shed light on some of the\r\nimportant mysteries in the subject.\r\n",
