 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates four half-year units in two subject areas, Force and Motion and Energy Transformations, for two grade bands, K-2 and 3-5. Engineering design, the construction of toys, and problem based learning are the bases of scientific concept development. The curriculum is being published online at the City Technology website and in print form by Science Source. The materials are very simple, mostly available in typical schools. Other materials are being made available as kits through Science Source. The project also does research on student learning as it develops the products. Additional products include concept inventories for the units, assessments, and materials for the professional development of teachers. Pilot and field tests are planned to occur in 17 elementary schools in Nashville, New York, Los Angeles, Washington DC, and Las Vegas. Teachers carrying out these tests receive 40 hours of professional development.",

Project personnel, including both university faculty and elementary teachers, have conducted at least four workshops at each of the past five NSTA Annual Meetings, and have two workshops scheduled at the 2015 NCTM Annual Meeting. Teachers from the core group have presented twice each at the National Association for the Education of young Children (NAEYC), the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD), and the Annual Meeting of the National Art Education Association (NAEA)...."
