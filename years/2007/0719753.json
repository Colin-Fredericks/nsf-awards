 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fresh Breeze Project concerns a multi-core chip \r\narchitecture that addresses the need for better programming \r\nsupport for parallel computation, including composability\r\nof parallel programs. This is accomplished by\r\nsupporting global virtual memory, employing a novel memory\r\nmodel based on fixed-size chunks, and virtualizing processing\r\nresources through fine-grain scheduling of threads of\r\ncomputation using an on-chip scheduler.\r\nA cycle-accurate simula\u00adtion of the architecture serves\r\nfor testing and evaluating the architecture in\r\nillustrative applications.\r\n\r\nMany functions of a conventional operating \r\nsystem relating to memory management, file system support, \r\nand process scheduling are replaced by hardware features in the \r\nFresh Breeze architecture. In consequence, Fresh Breeze \r\noperating software differs substan\u00adtially from a conventional\r\noperating system. The Fresh Breeze architecture provides\r\nspecial classes of computing objects: futures to support\r\ndata streams and guards to support transactions.\r\nThe Fresh Breeze multithread program execution model is supported \r\ndirectly by the Fresh Breeze architecture, so these features \r\nare available for writing support soft\u00adware for user authentication, \r\nresource management, input/output facilities, and directory and\r\nfile management. It is planned to make an FPGA implementation\r\nof the Fresh Breeze architecture available to interested\r\ninstitutions by means of the RAMP prototyping infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBenefits of the project include the \r\npossibility of a powerful new computing platform with effective \r\nsupport for the development of robust software for parallel \r\ncomputing, leading to higher programmer productivity and \r\nperformance. Benefits to the broader community\r\ninclude better computing facilities for goals such as\r\naccurate weather forecasting, drug design, and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n",
