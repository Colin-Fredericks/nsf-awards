This finding provides a framework to exploit the unique properties of artificial materials and their application towards creating hybrid radio-frequency (RF) and optical devices that require less power to operate than devices currently in existence.  Efforts entail the realization of bulk and planar degenerate band-edge crystal via fabrication in multilayer and multi-tone ceramics, development of non-invasive dielectric electro-optic probes to extract the extraordinary internal electric-field within the crystal, and creation of low power hybrid RF/optical devices by integrating electro-optic material into crystals which exploit the gigantic transmission band-edge resonance.  Low power RF/optical devices benefit a broad range of applications spanning modulators in optical communications networks, phase shifters in phased array radars, detection elements in hybrid RF/optical sensors, and mixers in RF-Over-Fiber systems.\r\n\r\nBROADER SOCIETAL AND EDUCATIONAL IMPACT\r\nIt is well-recognized that artificial materials will play a crucial role in developing next generation communication systems and sensors.  Technological challenges include the realization of greater bandwidth (optics) and greater mobility (RF) with the concurrent need for increased power efficiency (energy conservation).  The gigantic transmission band-edge resonance to be harnessed herewith is an essential key in creating a new class of hybrid RF/optical devices that operate at significantly reduced power to benefit telecommunications, computing, diagnostics, and sensors.  Research activities and educational goals will be integrated by developing a new RF/optics curriculum at The Ohio State University. Our goals are to (1) engender hybrid and integrative research thinking, (2) encourage interdisciplinary graduate education, (3) involve undergraduates, underrepresented groups and minorities in research, (4) engage industry and promote economic development.\r\n",
