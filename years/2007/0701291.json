 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main part of this project concerns certain invariants of the representations of semisimple \r\nHopf algebras. These invariants, the Frobenius-Schur indicators and their higher analogs, \r\nshould give information not only about the representations of a Hopf algebra, but also about its \r\npossible structure and so may help in the classification program. They should also serve as a \r\ntool in proving more general facts about Hopf algebras, by looking for representation-thoeretic \r\nproofs. The project also concerns actions of Hopf algebras on non-commutative algebras, \r\nespecially as to when the Jacobson or prime radicals are stable under such actions; these \r\nquestions are related to prime ideals and the radical of semidirect products, \r\nand would help in doing ``invariant theory'' for Hopf algebras. Finally some questions will be \r\nconsidered about twistings of Hopf algebras and of their actions on algebras, as well as more \r\ngeneral questions about which algebra properties are preserved by twisting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHopf algebras are of interest not only for their own sake, but because they appear as \r\ninvariants in other mathematical structures, such as understanding knots in geometry, and \r\nin parts of mathematical physics, such as conformal field theory. Thus a greater understanding \r\nof the Hopf algebras themselves might eventually be useful in these areas. This project will \r\nalso involve some women students involved with the Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) \r\nprogram at USC. \r\n\r\n",
