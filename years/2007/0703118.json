The goals of the project are to (1) develop a new biotechnology program at DMC that teaches current research and laboratory procedures in agricultural and medical biotechnology, (2) build a customized workforce of underrepresented technicians for local employment in the life science industry, (3) improve students' scientific literacy through inquiry-based learning, (4) incorporate instructional technology into new and existing certificate and associates degree courses, and (5) provide professional development for high school and college educators. Project deliverables include a new biotechnology program, a course website, new and revised biotechnology-related courses, teacher institutes, student research internships, project-related reports, and articulation agreements.\r\n",
