 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to organize a national forum to discuss critical issues and actions in response to the shortage of power engineering workforce in the future. This forum allows leaders from government, industry, faculty and students, and professional societies to work synergistically toward a national action agenda. The approach is address important issues such as the future demand and supply of the workforce and the nation's capacity to educate power engineers at the universities. \r\nTo attract best talents into power engineering, the curriculum innovation and diversity issues must be addressed.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual merits: \r\n\r\nThis project are achieved by studying the workforce issue in a comprehensive framework involving essential stakeholders, including government, industry, universities and professional societies. Based on properly acquired survey data, the result will be a gap analysis between supply and demand for the future workforce. Scientific analysis will be performed for the data and conclusions to ensure the validity of the results.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\n\r\nThis project are expected to be significant. \r\nThe workshop will lead to a roadmap to strengthen the U.S. capacity to educate future power engineers, to provide a well-educated workforce for power engineering that ensures reliable and economic supply of electric energy in the U.S., and to develop new ideas for innovation of research and educational infrastructure in power engineering at U.S. universities. Diversity of the future workforce can be enhanced with a coordinated action agenda. \r\n\r\n",
