 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a STEP Type 2 project that is examining the role of Hispanic serving higher education institutions in the STEM field careers of students.  The investigators are describing the characteristics of Hispanic students who transfer from community colleges to BA institutions using a national data set, the college financing strategies and borrowing practices for graduate education, and the characteristics of the institutions that serve the Hispanic population.  The study focuses especially on the role of community colleges in diversifying the STEM college graduates.  The researchers rely on a statistical analysis of large national surveys (the survey of Recent College Graduates enhanced by the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System).   The researchers use sophisticated statistical analysis methods to test hypotheses of relationships between student institution choice and later completion.  Also, the researchers are conducting a qualitative study of a selected group of Hispanic institutions that are successful in producing large numbers of STEM graduates to observe features that might have been responsible for their success with that population.  The merit of this study is that it addresses the issue of Hispanics in the science and technology workforce.  It also has an opportunity to impact the broader community by identifying forms of support that affect the graduate school attendance of Hispanic students.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Through this study, CUE examined the features of exemplary STEM policies, programs, and practices to identify ways for institutions &mdash; both Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) as designated by the U.S. Department of Education, and non-Hispanic serving &mdash; to increase the number of Latino STEM graduates.

The findings are readily available to the public at CUE&rsquo;s web site (<a href=\"http://cue.usc.edu/\">cue.usc.edu</a>), and were reported in <a href=\"http://cue.usc.edu/tools/nsf_reports.html\" target=\"_blank\">six briefs</a>, one journal article, and in two forthcoming book chapters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.
