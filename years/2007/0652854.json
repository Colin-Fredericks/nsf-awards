 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is devoted to various aspects of many-body theory in quantum\r\nmechanics, condensed matter physics and quantum electrodynamics, as well as some\r\nproblems in quantum information theory and pure mathematics. These various topics\r\nhave grown out of a body of research over several decades and the underlying unity is\r\nthat solutions in the various problem areas shed light on each other. A broader impact\r\nof this activity is that students and postdocs will be involved in these projects, which will\r\ncombine mentoring with research and help produce the next generation of\r\nmathematically knowledgeable physicists. It will also further the interdisciplinary bonds\r\nbetween the communities of mathematicians and physicists and promote the relevance\r\nof modern concepts of mathematical analysis to problems of condensed matter physics.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is contained in the following partial list of specific\r\nresearch goals.\r\n1. Low density Bose gases are now in the forefront of research {experimentally and\r\ntheoretically) and it is intended to continue the previous successful work on the ground\r\nstate energy, as well as the question of Bose-Einstein condensation and its relation to\r\nsuperfluidity. One question concerns the simultaneous occurrence of solidity and\r\nsuperfluidity. Another is to validate\r\nBogolubov's second term in the expansion of the ground state energy. A third is to see if\r\nthe excitation spectrum of the Lieb-Liniger one-dimensional model can be established\r\nfor realistic three-dimensional gases used in experiments.\r\n2. Various topics and conjectures concerning magnetization and long-range order in the\r\nHubbard model of correlated electrons will be investigated. In parallel, an attempt will be\r\nmade to prove long-range order in the ground states of two-dimensional Heisenberg\r\nmodels. Both models are presently important in condensed matter physics.\r\n3. A fundamental statistical-mechanical property of matter is the existence of the\r\n`thermodynamical limit of the free energy. A proof of this has been only partially\r\naccomplished so far when the electromagnetic radiation #eld is taken into account. It is\r\nintended to complete the demonstration.\r\n4. To study the renormalization problem in quantum electrodynamics (QED), especially\r\nwith regard to the many-body and bound state aspects. This continues a successful\r\nnon-perturbative study begun under the previous grant in which we developed a model\r\nof relativistic QED that makes sense for bound states. A complete theory has not yet\r\nbeen invented, and it is important to try to do so because QED is one of our\r\nfundamental physical theories.\r\n5. An attempt will be made to verify the long-standing conjecture that the maximum\r\nnegative ionization of a large atom is only about one electron. It is very di#cult, even\r\nwith computers, to be sure about ionization of atoms, but nature seems to be telling us a\r\nuniversal fact about fermions that it would be desirable to understand from first\r\nprinciples.\r\n6. Several topics in quantum information theory and closely related #elds. In particular,\r\na proof (or disproof) will be sought for Holevo's additivity of entropy conjecture. Success\r\nhere will imply that entangled states cannot improve the capacity of quantum channels.",
