 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop visualization tools to assist non-statistically oriented decision makers in Risk Management identify and predict risky consumer behavior in the consumer financial services industry.  The objective of the research project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using modern human-computer interaction and computer graphics technology to represent a consumer as a special object that can be manipulated in an intuitive manner by non-statistically oriented decision makers in Risk Management to manage consumer risk. \r\n\r\nThe resulting system, if successful, will increase productivity and create growth opportunities for companies in the financial services sector. In addition, the proposed project expands the realm of geometric algorithms to include novel new techniques for processing and interpreting complex financial data. The project will also produce new ways of interacting with consumer data that both leverage research in medical imaging and potentially feedback into the field to provide insights into new directions for research in both areas.\r\n",
