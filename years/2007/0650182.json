 "awd_abstract_narration": "For over 30 years, support for EERIs Learning from Earthquakes (LFE) Program has been provided by the National Science Foundation. At the heart of this program are the volunteer multidisciplinary reconnaissance teams that are sent out to damaging earthquakes around the world, bringing back observations and lessons for the professions related to earthquake risk reduction. Since 1973, EERI has conducted or published findings from 183 investigations, profoundly shaping engineering, earth sciences, public policy and the social sciences. Advances range from increased understanding in the basic science of earthquake ground motions and fault mechanics to fundamental changes in our building codes and construction practices, based on observations of building performance in earthquakes, to improved procedures in preparedness, response and recovery. While many critical advances have been made, the continuing loss of life, as well as escalating social and economic impacts, underscores the fact that much remains to be learned. As the US leader in post-earthquake investigations, EERI is improving the overall coordination of NSF-funded post-earthquake research efforts and incorporating new technologies to improve the collection and management of perishable data. EERI is also making efforts to integrate the LFE program into the new Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) and the way in which the LFE program will work with other agencies, organizations and NSF-funded centers to reach a diverse population of young people and students to stimulate their interest and involvement in science and engineering. \r\nIntellectual Merit: The program lays the basis for continuing research in many different disciplines, by providing the initial scientific and engineering observations upon which in-depth research projects are based. In some earthquakes EERI scientists and engineers may be the first to observe specific scientific or engineering evidence, such as the identification of the surface fault rupture in the 2005 Pakistani earthquake. Team members document the observations and lessons that are used to prove or disprove scientific hypotheses, and calibrate laboratory-based models of building performance, wave actions, and tectonics, among others. Data that the reconnaissance teams bring back from the field are used to pose critical research questions from the event (that merit further research), and to summarize the event for the historical record and for analysis by researchers of the future. \r\nBroader Impact: The program lays the basis for continuing research in many different disciplines, by providing the initial scientific and engineering observations upon which in-depth research projects are based.
