The work aims to empower people through an appropriately designed robust and secure digital environment that is aware of their location, context, and needs. In order to enable ubiquitous computing in practice, it is essential to build robust, scalable, and secure wireless networks that can accommodate a wide variety of mobile devices. Prototyping and experimentation serve to validate the developed protocols. A set of radio-frequency instruments enables the following research endeavors:\r\n. Better and faster testing, debugging, and troubleshooting of RF boards;\r\n. Digitizing and generating signals at arbitrary frequencies; and\r\n. Accurate signal measurement and signal generation\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The work impacts society through a digital environment that will be aware of the presence of people and their context, and will be sensitive to their needs. Application areas involve ubiquitous/pervasive computing, resiliency, and quick recovery from nature and man-made disasters, and provision of safety services for a better quality of life for the elderly and disabled. Using the capability of wireless communication to connect the physical world to the cyber-world presents other advantages, such as monitoring bridges, roads, tunnel structures, water quality, control of temperature of the home according to the presence and location of people, etc. On the educational front, the equipment helps students to better understand the intricacies of radio propagation through experimentation and measurement; moreover, a course will be upgraded and undergraduate students will be involved.\r\n",
