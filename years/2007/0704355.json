We will also have guest lectures explaining current research topics.\r\nThis multi-tiered menu, ranging form introductory material through current research, will ensure that every student gains something from their experience.\r\n\r\nBroadening the paraticipation in this Summer School will magnify its impact, and help to educate the next generation of US Scientists.\r\nIt will influence the spread of techniques from algebraic geometry into the applied sciences.\r\n",
