 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project details a joint US-Japan partnership focused on development and nanoscale understanding of amorphous-/crystalline phase transitions for semiconductor device applications through combinatorial materials exploration (CME). Two classes of materials where control of the amorphous-crystalline transition is relevant for new device structures are examined. Intrinsic vacancy chalcogenides, whose dramatic change in resistance between the amorphous and crystalline state is proposed as a basis for high-density non-volatile memory, is be the focus of the US-based team.  Metal alloy gate materials, whose variation in work function with crystal face is a limiting factor in uniform response of nanoscale electronics, is be the focus of the Japan-based part of the team.  In both cases, optimization of relevant device properties requires careful consideration of the nanoscale interplay between stoichiometry and structure in controlling the dynamics and energetics of the amorphous-crystalline transition.  \r\n\r\nIn this project, the US-Team, consisting of scientists from the University of Washington, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Micron Technology Inc., will work in close cooperation with researchers at the National Institute of Materials Science (NIMS, Japan) to develop: (1) a fundamental framework for amorphous-crystalline stabilization and transition relevant to future semiconductor device technologies; (2) new designs for combinatorial materials exploration that vary both composition and processing on single samples, and (3) a combinatorial informatics protocol to establish fruitful mechanisms for data sharing among different institutions. The collaboration will facilitate information exchange on materials relevant to semiconductor device technologies and provide a new paradigm of materials exploration as an educational program for both senior undergraduate and graduate students. Advancement of CME methodology will build upon and expand current cyber infrastructure capabilities, such as remote use of instrumentation, database creation and utility, visualization, and virtual networking and experimentation, anticipating progress across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines with dramatic impacts on the society beyond the semiconductor industries. Students participating in this research will gain exposure to these new methodologies and also will experience multiple research environments academia (University of Washington), industry (Micron Technologies) and both US and Japanese national laboratories (PNNL and NIMS).  This rich learning experience will be highly relevant to their future careers.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\n",
