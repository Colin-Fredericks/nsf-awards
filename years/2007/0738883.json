 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, Dr. Telesco will characterize the appearance and stability of mid-infrared image profiles, particularly in the wings, at the Gemini 8-meter telescopes. It is motivated by the need to push the science capabilities of the observatory as valuable information is hidden in the profile wings. Dr. Telesco and his team will work with the Gemini staff to compile and characterize various aspects of Gemini mid-infrared images (e.g., Strehl ratios, full width at half maximum, ellipticities, azimuthally averaged profiles, and azimuthal structure in the profile wings). These quantities will be compared within and among nights to determine the frequency of occurrence of specific values for each parameter. The results will be used to assess the value and role of Gemini for cutting edge mid-infrared science imaging requiring excellent profile shape and stability. Of particular importance are the answers to questions such as: How often does Gemini achieve the angular resolution and profile structure necessary for a given imaging criterion? Given these statistics, what science programs can be proposed with an expectation of achieving the image quality needed to effectively meet the science goals? What are the limitations of Gemini mid-infrared imaging data once it is in hand?\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of this project will be important for other Gemini science programs which focus on the detection of faint features near bright objects as well as its influence on future Gemini instrumentation. A graduate student and an undergraduate (or beginning graduate student) will also be involved and trained in the analysis of the image data.",
