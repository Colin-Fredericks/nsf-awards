 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project investigates models and methodologies for designing and managing multi-core processor resources under the extreme manufacturing variations and in-field hard failures projected for near future technology generations. These phenomena are governed by laws of probability and can be appropriately handled by methods that address the underlying uncertainty. Synergistic hardware and system software elements play a central role in achieving these goals through design forecasting, resource provisioning, self-discovery, and autonomic management. Hardware will be designed to support adaptation and in-field monitoring. System software will read in situ sensors, apply statistical inference, and use on-line learning strategies to build run-time knowledge about on-chip resources. This knowledge will be used to tune the processor for performance, power, and reliability.\r\n\r\nManufacturing variation and operational stress will make it increasingly difficult to benefit from raw technology scaling and will potentially limit the commercial and societal impact of computing in the billion transistor era. This research addresses these challenges by enabling the design and management of efficient, reliable, multi-core processors.  This project will have educational impact through research training of graduate students and incorporation of research findings into existing undergraduate and graduate courses. Members of underrepresented groups will benefit from mentoring efforts and will be active participants in research.\r\n",

Together these research thrusts will lead to ways to design and manage fast, reliable, energy-efficient computer systems.\n\n\n \nForecasting Failure and Variability\nLarge scale Monte Carlo simulations are widely used to investigate the probabilistic impacts of manufacturing variation. Unfortunately, these simulations are extremely complex and time consuming because they require each design point to be simulated hundreds of times. Our research investigated two complementary avenues: (1) adapting low-discrepancy sampling methods for use in Monte Carlo architectural simulations and (2) applying multi-resolution analysis to appropriately decompose geometric regions of a chip, and achieve more effective description of parameter variations without increasing computational complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the combined techniques based around low-discrepancy samples and multi-resolution analysis can reduce the number of Monte Carlo trials by a factor of 3.3x, maintaining the same accuracy while significantly reducing the overall simulation run-time.\n\n  \n\nDesign-time Resource Provisioning\nThe most surprising single finding of this research project was that there is a strong relationship between the instruction sequences in a program and the timing faults that appear when the processor operates near the critical supply voltage. This can have a profound impact if the system applies timing speculation - a technique used to boost energy-efficiency by blurring some of the traditional boundaries between the circuits and microarchitecture.  We studied the relationship between instruction sequences in an application binary and timing error rate. Specifically, we used an ad hoc procedure to find computations that risk activating critical paths. We further found that somecode transformations and ISA extensions can improve the efficacy of timing speculation while preserving program semantics. These transformations can be applied in a compiler to improve application performance under timing speculation.\n\n \nSelf-Discovery and Inference\nWe have also demonstrated that hardware can exploit  the strong correlation between instruction execution patterns and circuit-level timing within the pipeline to enhance timing speculation and allow the supply voltage to be scaled more aggressively to achieve a lower overall energy profile. We demonstrated that it is possible to apply timing error prediction to dynamically anticipate timing errors at the instruction-level and error padding technique to avoid the full recovery cost of timing errors. We studied the impact of simple prediction strategies similar to those used in branch predictors. When correctly applied, timing error prediction allows us to achieve 43.6% power savings when compared to a baseline policy and incurs only 6.9% performance penalty. We further evaluate a number of control policies that can be used to dynamically tune the supply voltage to make the most use of the error prediction.\n\n \nAutonomic Resource Management\nModern multicore architectectures feature many cores, each of which offers many ways to tradeoff power and performance by lowering the supply voltage (DVFS) or resizing private caches. However, there are an exponential number of configurations and it is infeasible to examine all possible configurations to find the ideal settings for a given workload. We found that it i..."
