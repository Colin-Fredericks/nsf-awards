 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, NUE: Michigan Technological University (Michigan Tech) Nanotechnology Enterprise, at Michigan Technological University, under the direction of Dr. John Jaszczak, will create a new Nanotechnology Enterprise-a student run and operated corporation, assisted by faculty and staff advisors that will provide undergraduates with a hands-on, entrepreneurial, educational experience as they research, develop, and market nanotechnolgy-related products and services.  Students in the Nanotechnology Enterprise will play an integral role in outreach and education by working with area and multi-ethnic high school teachers and students to present introductory lessons on the science, engineering, and societal implications of nanotechnology.  The initial products of the project will include nanotechnology outreach and curricular materials for high schools and 1st year undergraduates, development of an educational scanning tunneling microscope system, and nano-sensor devices.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering Program Solicitation (NSF 07-554), and is being funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET).",
