 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objecticve:\r\nThis NER proposal is to explore novel synthesis and properties of nanoscale organic-based spin valve structures, each consisting of conjugated organic semiconducting molecules as the nonmagnetic interlayer, and magnetic nanoparticles and a magnetic thin film as the two magnetic contacts.  A \"modular\" approach is proposed for constructing the active nanoscale devices from individual components that are pre-fabricated separately and followed by large scale assembly of nanoscale components.  Tailoring and optimization of the heterostructures is facile, because the properties of each component can be fine-tuned with control.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe proposed active organic spin valves that contain organic semiconducting molecules and magnetic nanoparticles offer promising one dimensional organic multifunctional spin-based materials and devices.  They are viable candidates for future organic spintronics applications with potential for commercialization. \r\nBroader Impacts\r\n Moreover, education, collaboration, and outreach are key features of the proposed work.  The team involves active worldwide collaborations and partnerships with industry and national labs.  It also involves participants from pre-college and college students, to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and from traditionally underrepresented groups, including women and minorities.  These partnerships will facilitate activities in and expose researchers to critical areas from new device concepts to technology transfer.  Participants will have a unique opportunity to interact with several different key aspects of magnetic nanostructures and technology, from materials development, characterization, modeling, to device fabrication and evaluation.  They will receive interdisciplinary training in important areas from organic and inorganic materials, thus preparing them for emerging markets as spintronics and the underlying conducting organic, nanoparticle, and thin film technologies develop and mature.\r\n\r\n",
