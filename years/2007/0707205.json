Solving such problems efficiently\r\ninvolves exploiting at least one of two types of naturally\r\noccurring structure, one implicit and the other explicit. These\r\nstructures are related by the result that problems with\r\nexplicitly known separable structure can be transformed via\r\ndecomposition techniques (involving independent subproblem\r\noptimization) to equivalent nonsmooth problems with implicit\r\nVU-shape structure.  For many objectives with the latter\r\nstructure the investigator and his colleague undertale\r\nsignificant further development of a bundle-based method that\r\nemploys a V-model of the objective and a U-model of an associated\r\nLagrangian.  This rapidly convergent algorithm takes advantage of\r\npast research that defined a structure that is special enough to\r\ngive \"primal-dual tracks\" to minimizers and general enough to\r\ninclude many applications.  The new work involves numerical\r\ntesting on practical problems where the cutting-plane nature of\r\nsubgradient bundling along with U-Hessian estimation allows our\r\nalgorithm to follow a primal-dual track without having to know it\r\nexplicitly.  A significant component of the work is to extend the\r\nmethod to run on nonconvex functions and have provable\r\nconvergence to stationary points.\r\n\r\n     The computational methods developed here are significant\r\nbecause they can be applied in many practical situations\r\nincluding some having broad societal impact.  A new application\r\ninvolves a complicated objective that is used in many\r\napplications such as economic and geophysical modeling,\r\ncomputer-aided design, and image analysis.  Nonsmooth\r\noptimization developments also make feasible the application of\r\ndecomposition techniques to large or complicated models such as\r\nthose occurring in operations management, telecommunication and\r\ntraffic assignment, manufacturing, civil infrastructure design,\r\nstructural engineering, finance, and strategic planning.  Such\r\nmodels illustrate the need to make trade-off decisions when\r\nconsidering conflicting criteria such as simultaneously having\r\nhigh reliability and low cost.  Such an area of application is in\r\npower system planning subject to environmental protection\r\nconstraints.  These problems naturally decompose into higher\r\nlevel problems of deciding which types of power generation plants\r\nto build and lower level ones of deciding how to best operate the\r\nvarious units to meet daily energy demand.  Additionally, this\r\nproject fits in well with ongoing efforts in high-performance\r\ncomputing, because future decomposition applications will utilize\r\nparallel processing or networks of computers to solve very large\r\nor complex decision-making problems. \r\n",
