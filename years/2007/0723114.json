The specific objective of this project is to add ultrafast spectroscopy capabilities to a newly established Photoactive Nanoscale System research and teaching cluster in the State of South Dakota. This capability is critical for investigating photoinduced ultrafast energy and charge transfer processes, which commonly occur in photoexcitation, charge separation, electron injection and related phenomena in photovoltaic materials.  The understanding of these processes will help to reach the goal of the research cluster which is cost effective solar cell technologies.  Also, the instrumentation will be used for the investigation of photosensitizers for phototherapy for cancer treatment, quantum dots for fluorescence imaging and drug delivery, as well as new fluorescent conjugated systems for optical sensors. \r\n\t\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will enhance collaboration and interdisciplinary research between the three research institutions in South Dakota: South Dakota State University, University of South Dakota, and South Dakota School of Mines & Technology.  This research cluster involves more than 10 faculty and over 30 graduate students in chemistry, electrical engineering and materials engineering.  The availability of the requested instrumentation will significantly enhance the research and teaching infrastructure, and stimulate new applications in the three institutions and support a new electrical engineering Ph.D. program at South Dakota State University.  It will also initiate undergraduate research activities in femtosecond science and technology, and provide opportunities for K-12 students and Native American students.  Research results, new curricular materials, and pedagogical approaches developed with the equipment, will have a broad impact on both teaching and research in the science community as well as to local industries.",
