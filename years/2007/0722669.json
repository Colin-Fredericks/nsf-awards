 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will support acquisition of a powder x-ray diffractometer (XRD) for geoscience and materials research at the University of Minnesota - Morris.  The Morris campus is an undergraduate institution.  Acquisition of the XRD will support faculty and student research in glacial and Quaternary geology and the materials sciences that requires phase identification of fine grained materials.  Examples include: 1) identification of clay minerals in soils developed on moraine deposits to assist in paleorecontructions of glacial extent and timing in the Colorado Rocky Mountains and the dynamics of distal lobes of the Laurentide ice sheet in the U.S. Midwest; 2) characterization of the crystallinity and structure of synthetic clays used to create clay/polymer composite materials that a re possible candidates as electrolytes in lithium ion bateries; 3) studies of platinum (II) complexes to investigate their behavior when exposed to volatile organic compounds in an effort to develop materials for \"electronic noses\"; and 4) investigations of solid-state properties of organic materials as possible alternatives to amorphous silicon for thin film electronics.  The XRD will markedly enhance the infrastructure for the research and teaching at UMM (no other XRD exists on campus), promote undergraduate participation in research activities, and foster partnerships between the University and outside scientists.   Faculty and students from the Departments of Geology, Chemistry, and Physics will benefit from local access to the XRD and the PIs plan to introduce XRD techniques to undergraduates in conjunction with class-related laboratory activities in a number of regularly offered courses.\r\n",
