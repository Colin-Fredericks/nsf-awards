There are four research objectives: (1) focus on a SMP that consists of copolymerized and crosslinked n-tertbutylacrylate and diethyleneglycol acrylate, to determine the dependence of polymer chemistry on the mechanical properties of polymers, (2) design a SMP composition whose mechanical properties match those of the native arterial tissue, (3) develop computational models of SMP behavior for use in medical device design, and (4) optimize rapid prototyping methods to fabricate patient specific vascular grafts from medical imaging data. In the long term, the research will potentially impact the treatment of vascular diseases.\r\n\r\nThe educational program  centers on the development of a Medical Device Training Certificate (MDTC) at the investigator's institution. Three activities are proposed: (1) a summer internship for students at the FDA as part of their Medical Device Fellowship program, (2) research experience in the investigator's laboratory, and (3) enrollment in the investigator's course of Biomechanical Engineering.\r\n",
