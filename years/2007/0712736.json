The symposia started in 1973 and it has been sponsored by the two most\r\nimportant academic organizations in computer architecture, the Special Interest Group on Computer Architecture\r\n(SIGARCH) of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Technical Committee on Computer\r\nArchitecture (TCCA) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The majority of historically\r\nhigh-impact publications on computer architecture have been published in this conference.\r\nIt is a significant event that the 35th Annual Symposium of ISCA will be held in Beijing, China, in June 2008.\r\nThis will be the first ISCA meeting held in China since the symposia started in 1973. \r\nThis award will assist deserving students to attend and present their work at the meeting. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
