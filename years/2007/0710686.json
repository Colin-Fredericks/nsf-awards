 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tIn collaboration with Chinese, U.S., and other international colleagues, measurements of nitric oxide (NO), reactive nitrogen (NOy), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and its analogues, and dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) will be conducted by the PIs during the CAREBEIJING experiment in Beijing in August 2007.  The in situ measurements from this and other field programs will be analyzed using 3-D chemical transport models.  Satellite measurements including tropospheric ozone, nitrogen (IV) oxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and carbon monoxide (CO) will be integrated in these analyses.  The objectives of the research are to: (1) characterize photochemistry in polluted regions; (2) improve emission inventories of ozone precursors; (3) understand regional transport of pollution and seasonal variations; and (4) assess regional pollutant outflow and impacts of potential pollution control strategies.\r\n\tThe broader scientific impacts of this research stem from the rapid economic growth in China, which has led to large increases in pollutant emissions.  Previous analyses have clearly shown that transport of pollution adversely impacts air quality in the United States and elsewhere.  Through measurements of critical reactive nitrogen species and collaborations with scientists in China, an improved understanding of air pollution and the impacts of various air pollution control measures will result.  In addition, graduate students will receive education and training in data analysis and modeling through this project.  An extensive web site with general and research information is planned.  One high-school teacher from the U.S. will also travel to the CAREBEIJING site to learn about the scientific issues and environmental policies, and bring this knowledge back to classrooms in the United States.\r\n",
