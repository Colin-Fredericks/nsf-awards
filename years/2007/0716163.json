 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 5th USENIX Symposium on File and Storage Technology (FAST) is scheduled for February 2007. FAST is a leading forum for innovative research in storage systems, bringing in researchers and practitioners from both industry and academia. Topics include reliability, performance, mobility, power management, measurement, and other topics germane to file and storage systems. This NSF proposal requested funding to support the attendance of US-based graduate students. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work.\r\nThe support requested in this proposal makes possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend. Particular attention will be paid to directing support towards underrepresented minorities including women, African-Americans, and Native Americans.",
