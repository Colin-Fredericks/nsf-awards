 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)  This project is a collaboration among Brigham Young University, The University of Tennessee, Ball State University, and The United States Air Force Academy. The project team is producing a collection of undergraduate complex analysis research projects with accompanying computer applets. This collection will allow undergraduate students to explore applications and current research topics in complex analysis. The collection has several purposes: (1) to serve as a resource for senior capstone courses; (2) to serve as a supplement for a standard undergraduate complex analysis course with the objective of helping students explore research topics either in a group or individually; and (3) to serve as a resource for small or independent student research projects for advanced undergraduate students who would like to begin exploring some research areas in complex analysis. For example, undergraduate students will be able to begin researching topics in complex analysis such as minimal surfaces, circle packing, complex dynamics, fluid flows, and harmonic mappings. The accompanying computer applets are helping the students explore the basic results and the open questions related to these topics. \r\n\r\nThere is great potential for a broad impact of this project, well beyond the schools involved in the project. The materials and applets will be especially helpful for students who want to do undergraduate research, but who are at institutions without sufficient resources or with limited research opportunities. It will provide these students with the background, experience, and excitement that is associated with research in mathematics.\r\n",
