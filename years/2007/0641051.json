The teams will conduct a biotic survey of North America by collecting tardigrades at the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. Student researchers will be trained to collect, identify, sequence, and report on tardigrades. Their results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and available over the internet on the Tardigrade Reference Center (TRC) at the Academy of Natural Sciences with keys, descriptions, images, DNA sequences, and distribution maps.\r\n\r\nThe project will discover new species, expand the continental diversity, and link DNA sequences to voucher specimens in order to ascertain species associations, distributional patterns, and genetic variation of the tardigrades.  The TRC will target scientists, educators and hobbyists who use the Internet to find data, facts, and teaching activities. The project models the collaboration between the undergraduate, research, and museum communities. It also fosters communication among specialists, and demonstrates the blending of morphological and molecular approaches to species identification.  The project will expose many students to scientific inquiry such that they will be prepared for careers in science, education, and government.\r\n",
