The proposed work will integrate advances in polymer physics, viscoelastic fluid mechanics and computational science to develop a mechanistic understanding of interfacial dynamics in displacement flows of linear and branched polymeric melts. The intellectual merits of the proposed activities include: \r\n\r\nComprehensive experimental investigation of the influence of polymer concentration and architecture on the interfacial dynamics of prototypical air-fluid displacement flows. \r\nDirect simulation of the interfacial instability of prototypical air-fluid displacement flows of linear and branched entangled polymeric solutions. Determination of the influence of thermal effects (i.e., coupling of viscous heating and the thermal sensitivity of the fluid) on interfacial dynamics of prototypical air-fluid displacement flows of linear and branched entangled polymeric solutions. \r\nThe proposed research will result in development of experimentally validated hi-fidelity process simulation tools for industrially relevant processes - a field where computational tools are desperately needed to rationalize the design and operation of net shape liquid state processes for commodity and value added products. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe success of present and future technologies and their potential to improve our quality of life depend largely on the creation of a workforce that is well equipped to tackle modern science and engineering challenges. One of our main objectives is to develop a system of instruction, through both classroom and laboratory experiences, for training graduate and undergraduate students in computational material science and engineering. In the past decade, U.S. graduates at all levels of education have significantly fallen behind their European counterparts in this area. Hence, the proposed research/educational program is essential and timely. \r\n\r\nDiversity and Outreach: Various programs at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), e.g., NSF-supported TLSAMP, Pipeline Engineering Diversity Program and GEM will be used to ensure participation of African-American, Hispanic-American, Native-American and female students in this research. We will also utilize the extensive outreach infrastructure at UTK to involve K-12 teachers and high school students in the research program. \r\n\r\nInternet Based Dissemination: The simulation module, experimental database, technical publications and presentations stemming from this research will be placed on an actively maintained web page. Middleware will be used for web-based execution of the simulation module and data visualization. \r\n\r\nIndustrial Interactions: The coating Industry fully recognizes the value of the proposed research. A close collaboration with 3M Corporation in implementation of the results of this research in an industrial setting is envisioned. \r\n\r\nBuilding Research Infrastructure in an EPSCoR State: This proposal will contribute to the further development of a sustainable research infrastructure in Tennessee, in terms of (i) training students, (ii) developing expertise at UT and (iii) strengthening the research network between UTK, Stanford and Danish Technical University. \r\n",
