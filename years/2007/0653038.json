 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nFor over three decades, the Chautauqua Short Courses for College Teachers Program has provided a wide array of carefully designed short courses, workshops, and field experiences to undergraduate faculty from two and four-year institutions. The Program provides an opportunity for faculty members to stay abreast of emerging trends in their field(s) through intensive interaction with scholars at the frontiers of science, mathematics, and engineering disciplines.  The Program serves as a conduit between cutting-edge research findings and teaching approaches in post secondary education. Participants translate what they learn in Program courses into more informed, more effective, undergraduate teaching.  In this project, 67 short courses will offered at five regional centers in Seattle Washington, California State University at Dominguez Hills, Austin Texas, Dayton Ohio, and SUNY Stony Brook (Long Island, NY).  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this program is that it facilitates the teaching of up-to-date content using up-to-date pedagogical content knowledge by undergraduate faculty in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the Chautauqua Short Courses Program derives from its national scope and wide coverage of disciplines. Over the course of the last Chautauqua grant from NSF, spanning seven years of workshops, more than 12,700 distinct college teachers have participated in 740 individual courses. As a result, more than 2,200,000 undergraduate students have benefited from improved instruction annually.  Nearly a third of faculty participants have come from two year colleges.  \r\n\r\n",
