 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dark Septate Fungal Endophytes (DSEs) have recently emerged as important ecosystem components in several different plant communities, particularly in stressful environments. Blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), one of the most important forage grasses in North America, harbors large quantities of DSEs. Using standard molecular techniques, the investigator and his students will compare the assemblage of fungal species colonizing B. gracilis with those inhabiting another important perennial forage grass in the same study area, Sporobolus cryptandrus (sand drop seed). The comparison will help determine which species of DSEs are most likely contributing to the attenuation of environmental stresses experienced by grasses in arid habitats. A greater understanding of the ecological role of these fungi will reveal essential information about their lifecycles and, more importantly, disclose vital details about the ecological role that fungal-plant symbioses play in stressful environments.  \r\n\t\r\n\tThis project will provide educational and research training for at least four undergraduates per year, such that these students will obtain an in-depth knowledge of ecological genomics that is typically reserved for students pursuing a graduate degree. Training of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in all facets of the proposed molecular genomics, an emerging high-tech industry, is a goal of this project. In addition, the investigator will practice and learn new molecular techniques that will be integrated into the curriculum of his courses. The dissemination of these new techniques into the classroom will benefit a diverse group of undergraduates at a small liberal arts institution.",
