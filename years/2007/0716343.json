 "awd_abstract_narration": "CT-ISG: Collaborative Research: Trustworthy Enforcement\r\nof Domain-independent Run-time Policies\r\nAbstract\r\nRun-time monitors are a common and pervasive mechanism for ensuring that software and\r\nsystems adhere to security policies. Anti-virus and anti-spyware programs, personal firewalls,\r\nintrusion-detection tools, Java's stack inspection, and even mechanisms that trap operatingsystem\r\nexceptions in order to show a ?blue screen of death? can all be thought of as run-time\r\nmonitors. Although they differ greatly in their complexity and scope of policies that they can\r\nenforce, these mechanisms all observe the behavior of a running system and detect and react\r\nto potentially dangerous events. Despite the pervasiveness and real-world importance of runtime\r\nmonitors, their use has far outpaced theoretical work that makes it possible to rigorously\r\nreason about monitors and the policies that they enforce, particularly in distributed settings.\r\nThis project develops models, tools, and mechanisms for reasoning about and implementing\r\ndistributed, concurrently executing run-time monitors. The research adopts a holistic,\r\nfour-prong approach that spans the breadth of the space between theoretical models and\r\npractical systems for enforcing run-time policies. Specifically, this project (1) creates a\r\nframework for reasoning about enforcement that permits the possibilities of concurrent, distributed\r\ncomputations; (2) develops a type-safe policy-specification language that ensures\r\nthat specified policies compile into well-behaved monitoring mechanisms; (3) designs trustworthy\r\nalgorithms for automatically translating a desired overall policy into node-specific\r\npolicies that can be distributed and enforced throughout a network; and (4) designs, implements,\r\nand tests a prototype system for specifying and enforcing run-time policies with\r\nsupport for concurrently executing computations. Taken together, these research tasks enable\r\nformal modeling and automatic enforcement of run-time security policies in concurrent\r\nand distributed settings.",
