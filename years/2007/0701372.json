 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present proposal focuses on the study and control of strong field processes via the\r\napplication of attosecond pulses in combination with a variety of other intense, ultrafast\r\nsources. The short duration of the pulses and the strength of the applied fields mean\r\nthat accurate calculations require a nonperturbative solution of the laser-matter\r\ninteraction, which is achieved by direct integration of the time-dependent Schroedinger\r\nequation.\r\nAll of the calculations envisioned are directly relevant to ongoing collaborations between\r\nthe principle investigator and experimental groups at the forefront of strong field physics\r\nand attosecond science. Investigations to control strong field processes by quantum\r\npath selection using attosecond pulse trains synchronized to strong infrared fields, as\r\nwell as a novel attosecond electron wave packet interferometer which uses the same\r\nconfiguration, are undertaken. In addition studies of the interaction of atoms with\r\nattosecond pulse trains having just one pulse per infraredcycle, an arrangement that\r\ncan be used to freeze the motion of electrons periodically released into an infrared field,\r\nwill be examined.\r\nExplorations of multiphoton physics in a new regime, the deep tunneling limit, reached\r\nwhen a high intensity, few cycle mid-infrared laser is used to ionize rare gas atoms, is\r\nalso on the agenda. Of special interest is the possibility that these pulses can be used\r\nto generate attosecond pulses with a low average frequency, which would make them\r\nvery useful for controlling ionization processes in atoms and molecules.",
