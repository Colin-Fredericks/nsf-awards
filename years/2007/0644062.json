 "awd_abstract_narration": "The past few years have witnessed a growing number of large-scale\r\nnetworked systems. Most of these systems are built following an\r\noverlay approach, with each of them regularly and independently\r\nprobing its environment to guide path selection algorithms, route\r\naround faulty links and replicate content for availability. As these\r\nsystems grow in popularity, such an approach will result in an\r\nunsustainable degree of monitoring and restrict the variety, number\r\nand span of distributed services.\r\n\r\nThe thesis of this project is that a large fraction of\r\nglobally-distributed systems can be built to ensure sustainable\r\nscalability by strategically reusing the view of the network gathered\r\nby long-running, ubiquitous services such as CDNs and P2P\r\nsystems. This work defines and explores \"3R\" - a new approach to the\r\ndesign and implementation of distributed systems that focuses on\r\nminimizing aggregated control and administrative overhead by\r\nstrategically reusing environment's views and recycling previously\r\ngathered measurements. In particular, we are designing efficient\r\ntechniques for maintaining, accessing and reusing this information for\r\nbuilding next-generation streaming multicast, content distribution and\r\ndata sharing applications.\r\n\r\nThe work explores the tradeoffs in the recycling/reuse of\r\nenvironmental measurements, and their implication in\r\ndistributed-system design. Ultimately, it will facilitate deployments\r\nof wide-area applications, benefiting society at large. The research\r\nagenda is complemented by a thorough education and outreach plan for\r\nstrengthening experimental systems education and contributing to\r\nminority recruitment and retention.\r\n",
