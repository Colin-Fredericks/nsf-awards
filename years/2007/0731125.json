 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe rapid increase in the level of sophistication and types of explosives necessitate the development of sensing systems that strategically combine multiple, ultra-sensitive detection technologies to significantly improve sensitivity and probability of detection. Through a multidisciplinary collaborative effort the researchers propose to develop and integrate novel sensor arrays based on different sensing principles with multi sensor data fusion (MSDF) techniques for detecting and predicting explosives threat with high precision. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe proposed methodology addresses some of the fundamental challenges in sensing of explosives using several strategies. First, the probability of detection is significantly enhanced by integration of multiple types of detectors [fluorescent polymer nanofibrous sensors, nanowire sensors, surface acoustic wave sensors (SAW)] that operate simultaneously. Secondly, each of these sensors will be specifically designed to maximize analyte-receptor interaction, thus improving the sensitivity. Ultra-high surface area polymeric nanofibers and metal oxide nanowires will achieve extremely high sensitivity due to enhanced analyte-receptor interaction. SAW sensors with chemoselective polymer coatings will provide complementary detection capabilities. Finally, for analyzing data acquired by multiple sensing systems we plan to develop cognitive-based MSDF models and perform inferences that may not be possible from a single sensing system alone. This approach will reduce the uncertainties associated with the interpretation of data gathered by the individual sensing systems by identifying coincidences, thus making the overall detection system extremely precise, and significantly lower the incidence of false alarms. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nSeveral graduate and undergraduate students will be actively involved in the multidisciplinary tasks of the proposed research. Educational activities also include the addition of new modules into existing courses, participation in conferences, interaction with researchers and industry professionals, and K-12 outreach involving high school students and teachers (through the UMass K-12 outreach program, Summer Opportunities in Sciences, and the Lowell Regional Physics Alliance).  The novel sensing technologies that will be developed in this project will significantly add to the existing infrastructure for research and education. Partnerships with industry (Foster-Miller Inc., and Linden Photonics Inc.) will facilitate technology transfer and commercialization. The results from this project will be broadly disseminated to benefit a large audience, enhancing their scientific and technological understanding, and increasing their awareness on safety and security issues. \r\n\r\n",
