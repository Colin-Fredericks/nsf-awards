The approach is to employ a set of finite-element and plane-wave-expansion techniques to provide accurate multi-scale simulation and analytical description of the electromagnetism in anisotropic metamaterials, starting from nanometer scales of metamaterial units, to micrometer scales of optical devices, to millimeter scales of integrated photonic circuits. \r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThe emerging area of negative refractive index media has already resulted in revision of such fundamental laws of nature as refraction and diffraction. Anisotropy-based waveguides, which form the backbone of the proposed research, provide solutions to two fundamental problems associated with conventional negative-index systems: resonant absorption and sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. The proposed research will address the fundamental properties of anisotropic negative-index systems, including coupling between micro- and nanoscale structures, sub-diffraction manipulation of optical signals, and evolution of optical nonlinearities. \r\nBroader impacts \r\nFrom the fundamental standpoint, proposed research will have its implications in physics (light-matter interaction), biology and chemistry (imaging, sensing, spectroscopy), and engineering (optical computing). From the educational standpoint, proposed activities will lead to an updated curriculum and interactive Java-based tutorial, reflecting recent developments in metamaterials and negative refraction. From the societal standpoint, the proposed research has a potential to revolutionize the areas of sensing, imaging, and communications.\r\n",
