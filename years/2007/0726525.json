Furthermore the project seeks to discover paradigms \r\nthat lead to robust communication, without misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe principal insight at the core of this project is that\r\neach communicating player has selfish goals that describe what\r\nit would expect from the communication with the other players. \r\nSuch goals are non-trivial (can not be achieved by one player\r\nalone), and verifiable by the player. The project explores the \r\npossibility of using these verifiable goals to enable mutual \r\nunderstanding. Specifically, it uses research from the last \r\nseveral decades in complexity theory on interactive proofs and\r\nprogram checking to suggest scenarios in which communicating \r\nplayers could start without any prior common background and\r\nstart to converge towards a common understanding, thereby \r\nestablishing a theory of understanding. The broader impact of \r\nthis project would be to enable a mathematical approach to \r\nunderstanding human communication and development of language, \r\nas also to guide the design of robust protocols for inter-computer\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n",
