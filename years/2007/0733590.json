 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through five assessment scholars for mathematics and science education Gullickson and his CoPIs seek to advance knowledge in K-12 STEM education and assessment practices by building capacity for Assessment for Learning (AfL), improving assessments in K-12 STEM and teacher preparation courses, and providing models for pre-service STEM teacher preparation through enhanced teaching modules. Three goals outlined in the proposal are: (1) faculty from three centers form a learning community, (2) recruit 5 STEM research scholars to conduct research on measurement and evaluation, and  (3) expose pre-service teachers to assessment models in their STEM course work. \r\n\r\nTheir work expands on the existing research in the Assessment for Learning (AfL) program. To accomplish this, the project will advance overlapping learning communities first among faculty, then among STEM Education Research Scholars, ultimately exposing pre-service teachers to assessment models in their STEM coursework and having the scholars study the process. The project is based on a collaboration between three programs at Western Michigan University: The Evaluation Center, Mathematics Education, and the Mallinson Institution for Science Education. \r\n\r\n",
