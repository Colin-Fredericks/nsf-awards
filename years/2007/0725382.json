Its subtleties mirror core issues in learning.\r\n Creative and original concepts are proposed, as outlined in the approach section above.\r\n The PI and Co-PI have been collaborators since 1998, and both have significant research track records in many synergistic projects.\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research are:\r\n Improved heuristics for cutting through combinatorial complexity.\r\n Creating stronger links between learning architectures and improving their training.\r\n Contributions to related applications:\r\nEconomics, \r\nSecurity Applications, \r\nSensor networks,\r\nEmbedded systems,\r\nBiologically-inspired applications, \r\n K-12, international, and underrepresented groups outreach.\r\n The dissemination of results will be superior, due to the availability of Go rules and data.\r\n The project will benefit society, through an improved ability to automate strategic analysis, through better tools, and through an improved workforce.\r\n\r\n",
