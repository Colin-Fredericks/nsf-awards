A unified national roadmap will be made from this conference as to how academia, industry and the national labs can make lignocellulosic biofuels a practical reality. Recommendations will be made and given to government, academic and industry leaders. The format of the workshop will be to have featured speakers, discussion sessions, and informal interactions. \r\n\r\nLignocellulosic biomass has a tremendous potential to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and allow us to obtain transportation fuels from domestic biomass sources. This would thus improve the nation's environment, economy, and national security. However, there are currently no industrially processes that use lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock. Heterogeneous catalysis plays a central role in developing efficient for biofuel production. This workshop will bring together the experts in this field to discuss the science and technology and future opportunities for biofuel production. \r\n\r\n",
