 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I Project is aimed at developing a new low-cost process to manufacture nanostructured net-shape Mg parts. These lightweight and high strength parts are expected to be cost-effective applications of nanotechnology in automotive, aerospace and many other industries. The process (herein termed TS) combines injection molding (Thixomolding) and Sinewave deformation.  The resulting material is readily formed into complex shapes by warm drawing, or superplastic forming (SPF). TS generates novel microstructures and micromechanisms to be explored by our University partner.  The process introduces two synergistic mechanisms for strengthening, generated in-situ in bulk parts - grain size refinement and intermetallic particle refinement. The nano-sized dispersoids that fortify the nano-sized grains provide opportunity for learning new science.  The ability to eliminate mechanisms that hinder the ductility and formability of current commercial Mg sheet constitutes a novel contribution to processing science. \r\n\r\nThe TS process opens the way to minimize energy/fuel consumption in autos and aerospace vehicles; to lessen the burden of military personnel.  This process will be designed around an automated manufacturing cell that will feature agility for same day delivery of custom selected alloy and part geometry.  The TS process is environmentally friendly, free of slag, dross, global warming gases and fire and safety hazards.\r\n\r\n",
