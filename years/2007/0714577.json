 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximately four decades ago scientists were first able to enter the undersea polar\r\nenvironment to make observations for a period of time longer than they could hold their breath. Since those first under-ice dives, technology has advanced tremendously so that scientific divers have the potential to extend their observational and experimental depths and times to limits never before available. Novel scientific ice diving techniques have expanded to include use of dive computers, oxygen-enriched air, re-breather units, blue-water diving, and dry suits with dry glove systems. Within the next decade these limits are expected to be extended to even greater depths, based on the scientific need. At the same time, it is critical to maintain the scientific diving community's exemplary diving safety record. This international workshop will review the recommendations provided at the 1991 Polar Diving Workshop, in the context of scientific need and technological advances in diving during the past fifteen years. The workshop will bring together an international group of experts, including scientists, physiologists, technologists, logistics managers, diving safety officers and ice diving experts. The broader impacts will include dissemination of the results to a broad international audience and the increase in knowledge to support the expected increase in scientific diving to during the International Polar Year.\r\n\r\n",
