 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes transfer genes and proteins into plant cells.  Transferred DNA is stably inherited and expressed in plant cells, causing crown gall or hairy root disease.  These are the only known examples of natural genetic exchange between bacteria and higher organisms.  Plant molecular biologists created \"disarmed\" strains of A. tumefaciens that lack the disease-causing genes but retain other genes needed to transfer DNA into plants.  Agrobacterium is the preferred method to deliver genes to plants.  This technology is widely used to create transgenic crop plants, which were planted on 106 million acres in 2003 and saved US farmers $1.8 billion while reducing pesticide use by 45.8 million pounds.  \r\n     The ability of A. tumefaciens to transfer DNA into the plant cell nucleus depends on a DNA-binding protein that is transported (along with DNA) from bacterial cells into plant cells.  Some strains of A. rhizogenes lack this crucial protein, but they are still able to transfer DNA into the plant cell nucleus.  An unusual A. rhizogenes protein (GALLS) provides an alternative route for uptake of DNA into the plant cell nucleus.  The GALLS protein is located inside the nucleus where it interacts with another protein, which is attached to the transferred DNA.  The GALLS protein appears to pull the incoming bacterial DNA into the nucleus of the plant cell.  \r\n     To test this hypothesis, GALLS protein will be tested for the predicted biochemical activity needed to mobilize DNA into the nucleus.  Several genetic and biochemical approaches will be used to identify plant proteins that interact with GALLS protein in the nucleus.  Cell biology and fluorescence microscopy will be used to monitor transport of GALLS protein from bacterial cells into plant cells.  This work may improve plant transformation technology by making it possible to target incoming bacterial DNA into specific locations in the host plant's DNA.  Thus, new genes can be introduced into locations that do not disrupt important plant genes, thereby avoiding developmental abnormalities, which are common using current plant transformation methods.  \r\n\tBroader Impacts.  Undergraduates, high school students, and graduate students will receive intensive research training.  As outreach, the PI will train high school teachers in a summer workshop on plant biotechnology.\r\n\r\n",
