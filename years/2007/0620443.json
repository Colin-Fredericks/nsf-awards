 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Harvard Forest LTER (HFR) investigates forest response to natural and human disturbance and environmental change over broad spatial and temporal scales. Involving many researchers and students from a dozen institutions, HFR embraces the biological, physical, and social sciences to address fundamental and applied questions for dynamic ecosystems. Its work on the ecological effects of the primary drivers of forest change in New England (human impacts, natural disturbances, and climate change) has resulted in synthetic publications, cross-site collaborations, and effective outreach in conservation and environmental policy. \r\n\r\nThe forests of eastern North America are being (sub)urbanized and fragmented more rapidly than elsewhere in the U.S., and regional impacts of pollution and climate change may be especially dramatic due to New England's location at the end of the nation's 'tail-pipe'. The proposed work for HFR's next phase focuses on the impacts of the changes in rates and magnitudes of these key drivers of landscape change and explores their consequences for regional populations, communities and ecosystems. The proposed research represents a shift in focus from the impacts of the primary, physical drivers of forest change examined largely at a single site or landscape to a comprehensive analysis of both primary and secondary forces and responses operating across the entire region. This mandates a greater emphasis on the biological components of landscape change, such as invasive species and pests, and the contributions of individual taxa to ecosystem processes. In addition to considering drivers explored earlier, this phase will incorporate new measurement and experimental studies of land-cover change (resulting from forest harvesting, conversion, and land protection) and the spread of invasive species (plants, pests, and pathogens) and native ungulates (especially moose) that are re-colonizing the region. \r\n\r\nThis broadened research agenda is a consequence of an increasing regional perspective, greater interdisciplinary participation, a strong commitment to inform conservation, management, and policy efforts through collaboration with mission-oriented agencies and non-profit organizations, and a commitment to position HFR for emerging research opportunities outlined by the LTER Strategic Task Force and NEON planning processes. \r\n",
