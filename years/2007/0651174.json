The goal of this research is to understand turbulent scalar subgrid scale mixing and develop advanced Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) mixing models.  \r\n\r\nThis research presents a collaboration between an experimentalist (Tong of Clemson) and a modeler (Frankel of Purdue) to investigate modeling of the subgrid-scale scalar joint filtered density function (FDF) and its statistics, as well as of other related aspects of probability-density-function modeling. The investigators propose an experimental / computational investigation of a novel three-stream jet mixing problem, an idealized nonpremixed jet flame, and various turbulent partially-premixed jet flames (Sandia TNF D, E, and F flames) as reference flames. The project is focused on the improvement of scalar FDF methods used in conjunction with LES. LES/FDF calculations will be performed by adopting three scalar mixing models and the variable mixing time scale model of Cha for reacting scalars. Simultaneously, measurements will be used to assess the validity of these mixing models and to evaluate results of LES/FDF calculations. Data from experiments conducted at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and Sandia National Laboratories will also be used to develop improved mixing models.\r\n\r\nTechnologically and scientifically, the success of this project can have a significant impact on combustion-turbulence modeling. In addition, the two graduate students supported under this proposal will benefit from the cross-university interaction and from interactions with scientists and engineers at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB, Sandia National Labs in Livermore CA, and the Turbulent Non-premixed Flame (TNF) Workshop.\r\n",
