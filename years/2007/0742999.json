 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nDatasets originating from many different real-world domains can be \r\nrepresented in the form of interaction networks in a concise and meaningful fashion. \r\nExamples abound, ranging from gene expression networks to social networks, \r\nand from the World Wide Web to protein-protein interaction networks. \r\nThe study of these complex interaction networks, which are often evolving, \r\ncan provide insight into their structure, properties and behavior. \r\n\r\nIdentifying the portions of the network that are changing, \r\ncharacterizing the type of change and extracting relevant patterns \r\nthat can help predict future events and behavior are all critical \r\nchallenges that need to be met in this context. \r\nTo this end the PI plans to explore and design an event-driven \r\nmethodology to study the evolutionary behavior of such interaction \r\nnetworks from the perspective of node-level and community-level \r\nviewpoints. Incorporating semantic information and leveraging \r\ngraph grammars in a structured manner will also be explored in this context.\r\n\r\nThe main scientific outcome of this research will include the \r\nability to extract, analyze and understand key patterns and features \r\nof such dynamic interaction networks in the context of end \r\napplications drawn from clinical and social settings. \r\nThe broader outcomes of this work will be to train capable \r\ngraduate and undergraduate students in the fields of network \r\nanalysis and data mining. Women and minorities will be especially \r\nencouraged to participate and existing interactions with \r\na local HBCU will be strengthened.\r\n\r\nProject Page:  http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~srini/SGER/information\r\n\r\n",
