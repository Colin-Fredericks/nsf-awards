The PI and others believe that this is\r\ninadequate to assure reliable semantic interoperability among \r\nthe various accounting standards and systems.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is the first to bring together researchers from\r\nthe formal semantics / KR / ontology communities and the accounting\r\ncommunity.  It is to explore the prospects for interaction of these\r\ntwo communities and write a report with a research agenda for \r\nwork in this interdisciplinary area of formal semantic specification\r\nof financial information systems and the implications for \r\ninteroperatibility of these financial reporting systems.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\n\r\nFinancial information systems are an essential component in\r\nthe management of large organizations - business, government,\r\nand nonprofits.  They are an essential component of the \r\nsecurities and banking industries,  securities and banking regulatory \r\nagencies and operation of taxation systems.\r\nFinancial reporting systems are also the basis from which \r\neconomic statistics, such as national income statistics and\r\ntrade statistics are generated.   Improvements in the semantic\r\nspecification of these financial information systems will \r\nfacilitate the automation of the financial reporting chain,\r\nand improve the reliability of interoperability and integration\r\nof such financial reporting systems within businesses, and between\r\nbusinesses and regulatory and taxation agencies.\r\n\r\nFinally, the adoption of formal semantic specifications for \r\nfinancial reporting systems will entail substantial changes in the\r\ntraining of accounting information system professionals.\r\n\r\nProject web page:  http://www.msu.edu/user/mccarth4/NSFontology/\r\n\r\n",
