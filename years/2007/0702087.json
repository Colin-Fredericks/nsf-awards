Dagli, University of California-Santa Barbara\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This integrative systems proposal introduces a new and novel approach for a photonic analog to digital converter that can deliver eight bits of resolution at sampling rates of 40 GS/s and higher.  The proposed analog to digital converter resembles very much to a wavelength division multiplexed fiber optic digital link without the fiber.  It consists of a multi wavelength source, a quantizer, a sampler and receivers.  The source is several different semiconductor lasers operating at different wavelengths.  The quantizer is a high-speed unbalanced Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator.  The sampling is performed using low-voltage and high-speed Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulators.  The sampled outputs at different wavelengths are detected using the same detection threshold and the digital outputs of the receivers generate a code corresponding to the digitized version of the analog signal applied to the quantizer.  Most parts of this system are well known and commercially available.  The most critical part is the low-voltage and high-speed Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator for the quantizer and sampler.  The focus of this proposal is to develop this critical component and make a proof of concept demonstration of a scaled down version of the analog to digital converter operating at 20 GS/s with 3 bit resolution.\r\n\r\nBroad Impact: The immediate impact of this project will be to fill in the need for much sought-after high resolution and high bandwidth analog to digital converter for applications such as radar and high speed instrumentation.  Yet there is a broader impact which is the development of highly integrated, highly functional and low cost photonic systems.  Such developments could enable technologies for many other applications such as low-cost high-performance signal processing and data transmission.  Furthermore, microchip design, fabrication, testing and optical system modeling required in this project form an excellent educational vehicle to prepare highly skilled work force in critical areas of science and engineering.\r\n\r\n",
