 "awd_abstract_narration": "What do our theories in physics tell us about the world, and why are we justified in believing what they say? Most answers include an appeal to objects and their properties. Developments in physics over the last century have prompted a different kind of answer: structuralism. Structuralists claim that theories in physics tell us only about structure. What this means is controversial, and there are many varieties of structuralism. The aim of this project is to examine the reasons why the structuralist response occurs, and to assess the viability of such responses.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. Historically, the structuralist response occurred in two phases. The first, in the early 20th century, included such major figures as Poincare, Russell, and Carnap. The second began with Worrall's 1989 paper, and is ongoing. Part I of this project aims to provide a systematic treatment of the historical sources, informed by the needs of the current debate. This is achieved by (i) analyzing the structuralist views of each historical figure against five specified criteria, and (ii) locating the current debate against the background of this 'philosophical map'. Brading contends that this will have an immediate impact, providing dramatic clarity to the range of structuralist options available, and their strengths and weaknesses. In Part II, Brading develops her version of structuralism, via a range of case studies drawn from interpretationally challenging areas of physics. With her prior research in technical philosophy of physics, especially symmetries, and her continuing involvement in an international structuralism workshop, Brading is ideally qualified to take on this bold project.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts. The project is intended to be of interest to scientists, philosophers of science and physics, and historians of science and physics, and to contribute to the dialogue between these disciplines. The broader significance lies in the opening question, above, which extends beyond the scope of the project to such issues as methodology and funding. Dissemination of the results will be through publications in leading journals in the field, and presentations at conferences and universities both in the U.S.A. and abroad. Part I involves the creation of a structuralism database that will be made publicly available. The 'philosophical map' has strong pedagogical value. Brading is training two graduate RAs on this project in independent research. Philosophy of physics is a male-dominated field, and Brading is pleased to include on her team one female RA, who hopes to pursue a career in philosophy of physics.\r\n",
