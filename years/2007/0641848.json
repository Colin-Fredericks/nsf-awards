 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nodulation is a symbiotic interaction between legumes and nitrogen fixing bacteria and is important in agriculture, as 33% of the world's protein comes from nodulating legume crops.  This symbiosis also allows legumes to obtain nitrogen from the air, which permits legumes to grow in nitrogen-limiting soils.  Nodulation occurs in the roots of legumes once the plant and bacterial partners signal and respond to each other through a complex series of interactions. The number of nodules formed on the root depends upon local and long distance signaling from the shoot to the root; the PI has shown that the plant hormone auxin is the likely long-distance signal.  With this award, the PI will investigate how nodule number is controlled by auxin in the legume Medicago trunculata, which has been developed as a model system for studying nitrogen fixation in plants.  The PI previously identified four supernodulation mutants in Medicago that affect nodule number.  The four aims of this award are 1) to clone these genes; 2) determine how these genes interact; 3) examine the auxin hormone balance of each mutant more thoroughly; and 4) examine the transport of auxin and other signals by grafting experiments. Because the nodule number regulatory pathway is involved in root growth and root/shoot communication, this work will also lead to a better understanding of how plants coordinate shoot and root growth.  The experiments will be performed by high school students, undergraduate and graduate students from the PI's home institution.  The PI has a record of mentoring students and is committed to including underrepresented high school students through participation in a summer internship program.",
