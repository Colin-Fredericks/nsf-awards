 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for EPS-0701812 \r\n\r\nKentucky proposes hosting the 19th Annual NSF EPSCoR National Conference, which\r\nwill take place in Lexington, Kentucky on November 7-10, 2006. The agenda will\r\naddress the theme, \"Rising above the Gathering Storm: Innovating to Compete in a\r\nGlobal Economy.\" This conference topic is intended to expand upon the recent\r\n\"Gathering Storm\" report produced by the National Academy of Sciences. This is a\r\ntimely topic demonstrated by the shift of industry in recent years to locating or relocating\r\ntheir manufacturing plants in geographical areas where there exists a well-educated\r\nworkforce, and low-cost labor is readily available. In today's world, where advanced\r\nknowledge is widespread and low-cost labor is plentiful, U.S. advantages in the\r\nmarketplace and in science and technology have begun to erode. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this topic is related to the exploration of how the EPSCoR community can contribute to advancing science and technology in a rapidly changing world so Americans can continue to benefit from a high standard of living and national security.\r\nThe conference theme \"Rising above the Gathering Storm\" aligns with Federal priorities\r\nand the President's American Competitiveness Initiative. \r\n\r\nWith regard to broader impacts, the conference agenda will include a diverse range of topic areas that will be of interest to both EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR participants alike. The presentations and speakers have been strategically selected to represent a diverse group of view points and areas of expertise including: public sector; private sector; national laboratories;\r\nuniversity administration; and many others.  Student participation will allow these important insights to be further extended to the educational system.\r\n\r\n",
