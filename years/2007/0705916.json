 "awd_abstract_narration": "III-COR: Collaborative Research: Graceful Evolution and Historical\r\nQueries in Information Systems-- a Unified Approach\r\n\r\nDatabase schema evolution is a constant in the life-cycle of\r\nInformation Systems (IS), and a source of major costs for maintenance,\r\nupgrading, and service down time. The traditional process of\r\ninstalling a new schema, converting the database, and rewriting\r\napplications is slow and laborious. Instead, this project develops\r\nthe novel technology whereby the schema evolution problem is\r\nreduced to coordinating mappings between multiple concurrent\r\nversions of schema, applications, and database. The project's\r\napproach consists of developing: (i) XML-based architectures for\r\nunifying the management of evolving data and metadata, (ii)\r\nmethods for capturing evolution via schema mappings, (iii)\r\nefficient mapping techniques for queries and applications. These\r\nadvances will enable the development of the MetaManager, a system\r\nthat supports: (a) preserving and querying database histories, and\r\n(b) better planning on how-to evolve current schema versions, via\r\nevaluation and testing  of ``what-if'' scenarios. Its\r\nfunctionality and performance are validated using various testbeds,\r\nincluding the SDSC Storage Request Broker, which hosts scientific\r\ndata for research groups ranging from astrophysicists to\r\nbiologists.\r\n\r\nThis novel and timely approach provides a solution to both the\r\nevolution and preservation of IS.  Because of the\r\nkey role played by IS, a broad range of scientific, educational,\r\nand economic activities will benefit. Project funds support\r\ntraining of PhD students while undergraduate research interns are\r\ntrained on schema-evolution scenarios using the MetaManager. The\r\ntechnology is a part of database design courses. Results are\r\ndisseminated via publications, reports and demos which are available from:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cs.ucr.edu/~tsotras/meta-manager\r\nhttp://wis.cs.ucla.edu/projects/meta-manager\r\nhttp://db.ucsd.edu/people/alin/meta-manager\r\n\r\n",
