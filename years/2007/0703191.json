 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is testing the impact of its technical support learn-by-doing methodology and internship program on persistence in IT coursework and degree programs. Although the current Computer Technical Support (CompTechS) program focuses on job placement, the outcomes since the Fall semester of 2004 have indicated that students continue coursework and degree programs at a rate of 70%. Through this project, faculty are documenting the relationship between hands on experiential learning and persistence in and interest in IT coursework and careers. This project is coordinating instruction and internships for two community colleges and is recruiting students from nearby agencies serving minorities and economically disadvantaged.  \r\n\r\nProgram Goals include:\r\n\r\nTesting the learn-by-doing methodology of the paid campus internship as a vehicle to attract and retain low income students and underrepresented minorities in computer related coursework and degree programs. \r\n\r\nDemonstrating the paid industry internship as a means of increasing students' feelings of skill and competence and contributing to career goals requiring further education. \r\n\r\nDocumenting best practices in the project contributing to persistence in IT degrees and providing comprehensive documentation for replication of the program. \r\n\r\n",
