 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed exploratory project addresses Grand Challenge 3: Cutting-Edge STEM Content in K-12 Classrooms. It falls under Component B: The Development of Resources and Tools, Category 2: Instruction of K-12 Students and Teachers. The grant develops, implements, and evaluates new multimedia laboratory activities designed to engage students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This project involves initiating a collaboration with teachers, administrators, and students at the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA) and specifically targets artistically gifted students who are often steered towards more traditionally creative areas (e.g., arts and humanities), which they may have come to view as more exciting, and away from STEM. The goals to help students understand that scientific principles permeate the creative and performing arts and that creativity and expression are also embraced by STEM. The laboratory activities are designed to provide hands-on instruction and interaction with concepts through creative exercises, such as the manipulation of music and images. The activities appeal to musical, spatial, and kinesthetic intelligences, since students directly manipulate tactile interfaces and immediately hear and see the resultant changes.\r\n\r\n",
