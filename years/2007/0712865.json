 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project co-sponsors a conference titled ``An international conference on Geometry and Analysis on Manifolds\", which will take place from April 8, 2007 to April 14, 2007 at the Chern Institute of Mathematics in Tianjin, China.  Its scientific focus will be the current and future development of geometry and analysis on manifolds, especially those related to the Atiyah-Singer index theory. Key topics include Aityah-Singer index theorems, Witten deformation, hypoelliptic Laplacian,  geometric invariants, twisted K-theory, geometry and topology of gerbes, symplectic geometry, spin geometry and application of Dirac operators. The conference will also honor Jean-Michel Bismut, one of the leading researchers in the field. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the conference will be threefold. First, to highlight the recent major developments in geometry and analysis on manifolds, such as Bismut's hypoelliptic Laplacian and Donaldson's work; secondly, to bring together leading experts in the field and survey the recent remarkable progress and point to new directions; third, to nurture and encourage young researchers and advanced graduate students by providing them with an opportunity to have direct contact with the leading researchers and with each other, and foster good opportunities for future collaboration.\r\n\r\n",
