 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spectral Graph Theory or Algebraic Graph Theory, as it is also known,\r\nis the study of the relationship between the eigenvalues and\r\neigenvectors of graphs and their combinatorial properties. Random\r\nwalks on graphs, expander graphs, clustering, and several other\r\ncombinatorial aspects of graphs are intimately connected to their\r\nspectral properties.  Recent approaches to the analysis of\r\nhigh-dimensional data have exploited the fundamental eigenvectors of\r\nthe data. These data sets are large and ever increasing requiring\r\n``real-time\" accurate responses to the given queries. This creates the\r\nneed for very fast algorithms, that also provide strict theoretical\r\nguarantees on their output. Spectral techniques have been applied to image\r\nprocessing, both by computers and in the primary visual cortex of\r\nmonkeys.  Critical component to all these application is algorithms\r\nwith efficiency and accuracy guarantees for solving these linear system\r\nand finding their fundamental  eigenvectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nA multidisciplinary team consisting of Theoretical Computer\r\nScientists, Machine Learning Scientist, and Neuroscientist will\r\ndevelop and apply spectral graph theory to applications from data\r\nmining to clustering, and image processing.  Enabling technology\r\ndevelop will include: 1) linear-work or O(m log m)-work algorithms\r\nthat run in poly-logarithmic parallel time for computing extreme\r\neigenvalues and generalized eigenvalues of diagonally-dominant\r\nmatrices, including Laplacian matrices, as well as algorithms of\r\nsimilar complexity for solving the related linear systems. 2) Better\r\nestimates for Fiedler values and generalized Fiedler values.\r\nApplication development: 1) Improvements in spectral image\r\nsegmentation. 2) The use of generalized eigenvalues in data mining and\r\nimage segmentation to combine multiple sources of information. 3) The\r\nuse of preconditioners for approximate inference in graphical models.\r\nand 4) Combine insights into the problem of image segmentation gained\r\nfrom spectral algorithms with knowledge gained from recent experiments in visual system\r\nof monkeys to better understand how the primary visual cortex functions.\r\n",
