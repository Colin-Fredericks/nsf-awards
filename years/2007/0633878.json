 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided for the design, development, and implemention of a component of an Arctic Ocean Observing System in the Switchyard region of the Arctic Ocean (north of Greenland and Nares Strait) that will serve the scientific studies developed for the IPY (International Polar Year), SEARCH (Study of Environmental ARctic Change), and related programs. The defining elements of the System are: (1) a multi-platform design, (2) combination of proven technology with adaptation of innovative, highly promising, new tools for operation under sea ice cover that are considered to be future backbones of a quasi-permanent, pan-Arctic Ocean System, (3) a modular approach that allows expansion of the system to a pan-Arctic scale, and (4) ongoing refinement of the design through evaluation of combined data and modeling results. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project will continue and expand two aircraft-based sections between Alert and the North Pole for long-term observation of hydrographic properties and a set of tracers aimed at resolving relative age structure (CFC's, tritium/3He) and freshwater components (18O and Ba) in the upper water column, utilizing the Arctic CTD/rosette system. This modular system is deployed through a 12\" hole drilled through the sea ice and traces temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, while at the same time allowing the collection of up to 12 water samples. The study also will continue one helicopter section across the shelf slope just west of Nares Strait to capture the structure and transport of the water masses coming around the Canadian Basin on their way to Nares and Fram Straits. To complete the quantitative assessment of the transport of the water masses from the Canadian Basin towards Nares Strait and Fram Strait, a set of 7 new, low-cost, lightweight moorings will be deployed across the shelf just west of Nares Strait to separate the individual transports through these straits. Finally, the planned in situ observations will be augmented by satellite-derived observations of the sea ice motion and mass budget. \r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe heaviest ice cover in the Arctic Ocean lies between the northern coasts of Ellesmere Island and Greenland and the North Pole because sea ice is transported to this region by the surface currents and winds.  Sea ice and water from throughout the Arctic Ocean pass through this region before exiting through Nares Strait or Fram Strait.  The sources of this water vary depending on the large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation.  We refer to this region as Switchyard because water parcels from different locations are transported here by different pathways and then follow different pathways out of the region, as in a train switchyard.  The surface waters are relatively fresh because of river water inflow, low salinity water that enters the Arctic Ocean from the Pacific Ocean through Bering Sea, and melting of sea ice.  The outflow from the Arctic Ocean influences the density of surface water in the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian seas and the North Atlantic Ocean, and this can affect the formation of deep water in these regions during winter when the surface water loses heat to the atmosphere, thus becoming denser, and sinks. This is a link in a large scale overturning circulation loop of warm water transported north by the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current cooling, sinking and flowing southward in a subsurface current system.  If the density of the surface water in the North Atlantic is made sufficiently light by lowering its salinity, winter cooling cannot make it dense enough to sink, and this affects the exchange of heat between high and low latitudes.\n\n \n\nThe Switchyard program is part of the Arctic Observing Network, and it is designed to investigate variability in water properties and circulation and to detect longer term trends that may be occurring in the Arctic Ocean as the result of climate change.  We conduct annual surveys of water properties during early spring in the region (Fig. 1), and from these properties we can identify the presence and amounts of different water types originating in different regions of the Arctic Ocean.  The heavy sea ice cover of the Switchyard area prevents icebreakers from operating in this region.  We obtain our measurements and water samples using aircraft that land on the sea ice and sample through holes drilled through the sea ice using a CTD/rosette (Fig. 2) that we developed for deployment through ice.  The surveys are carried out from a Canadian military base, Alert, located at the northeast corner of Ellesmere Island.\n\n \n\nThere are two major features in the surface circulation of the Arctic Ocean, the Beaufort Gyre, which is located in the southern half of the Canada Basin, and the Transpolar Drift, which transports water and sea ice across the Arctic Ocean from the Siberian continental shelf to Fram Strait between Greenland and Svalbard.  There are two modes of surface water circulation:  1) a strong, large Beaufort Gyre which accumulates freshwater with the Transpolar Drift transporting water from western Siberia towards Fram Strait, and 2) a weak, small Beaufort Gyre, which releases stored freshwater that is then incorporated into the Transpolar Drift (Fig. 3).  A transition between a strong and weak Beaufort Gyre occurred between 2006 and 2010 and was documented in our measurements and in the sea ice circulation derived from satellite observations (Fig. 4).  In 2008 there was an increase in freshwater compared to the amount of freshwater present during the earlier years in the decade (Fig. 5).  This was caused by an increase in river water transported to the region in the Transpolar Drift.  Freshwater continued to increase between 2008 and 2009, resulting from increases in sea ice melt water and freshwater from the Pacific Ocean. The fraction of sea ice melt water is negative because the formation of sea ice removes freshwater from the ocean.  It became less negative from 2008 to 2009 and 2010 because the increase in sea ice melting resulted in a smaller net removal..."
