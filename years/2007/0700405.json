 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for research and development of a scientific and engineering knowledge base for studying the effect of bio-deposition process on living cells. The project activities involve: 1) studying the feasibility of depositing living cells and constructing cell-embedded structures; 2) developing an engineering model as well as a multi-scale modeling approach to predict the deposition process-induced mechanical forces and the effect of the process and the mechanical forces on the biological behavior of cells; and 3) quantifying the biological responses of cells, its viability, recovery, proliferation, and damage under varying processing conditions. This project can lead to developing new techniques and tools to help the advancement of emerging cell-based bio-fabrication for broad applications in therapeutic products, biochips and biosensors, diagnostic arrays, microfluidic systems, and pharmaceutical methods. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will foster the convergence of engineering and life sciences, and provide viable manufacturing tools to biology and life sciences community.  This project will actively engage industry, government and medical institution. The outcome of research can be applied to help the mission of safe exploration of space, the development of biofabrication product standardizations, and the prioritization of the future cell-based products for tissue engineering manufacturer, thus have broad impacts on the technological development, economic growth, and improvement of the quality of life. This project will also develop a new interdisciplinary course spanning Design/Manufacturing, Biomaterials, and Bio/Cell Mechanics to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers.\r\n",
