Through this REU experience that focuses on sustainability the undergraduate students will engage in challenging cutting-edge research projects and will be exposed to global challenges. \r\n\r\nSpecific objectives of the program include: 1) exposing students to fundamental scientific and engineering research that enhances sustainable product and process design; \r\n2) introducing systems-level frameworks that lead to sustainable engineered infrastructures; 3) providing hands-on laboratory experience and training in state-of-the-art facilities through projects supervised by a team of faculty mentors, graduate students and industrial and/or government mentors; 4) demonstrating how international industrial/university/government collaborative research projects are conducted to achieve innovative solutions and technological advances; 5) increasing awareness of industrial careers and graduate school opportunities; 6) providing a global and multi-disciplinary perspective on sustainability; 7) enhancing the written and oral communication skills of the students; and 8) increasing the diversity of students interested in engineering disciplines.\r\n\r\nSustainability is a global issue, as several universities throughout the world are now recognizing. Two leading international university partners will join with the University of Arizona researchers to provide exceptional REU opportunities in focused areas of strength.  The National University of Singapore is conducting leading-edge research in semiconductor technology and is strategically located since many semiconductor companies have manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia, and throughout the region.  The University of Queensland (UQ) in Brisbane has recently established several key interdisciplinary research centers including the Centre for Water in the Minerals Industry, the Sustainable Minerals Institute, Centre for Functional Nanomaterials, and the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis REU program will encourage undergraduates to attend graduate school and to consider future careers in research or technology.  Recruitment efforts will be targeted to underrepresented minorities and women.\r\n",
