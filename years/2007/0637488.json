 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project focuses on the research, development and testing of a new type of smart instructional tool. This tool addresses the needs of today's online technical training and academic distance-learning engineering and technology programs as a substitute for conventional workplace related hands-on practice and engineering laboratory exercises.  The research project develops a methodology and tools for creating highly interactive simulation-based virtual activities that will enable learners to perform genuine workplace tasks and lab assignments online. The program precisely imitates the actual process of completing a task including the use of instruments, devices, specific methods/techniques, and directs and controls learner's actions and provides appropriate remediation tips and feedback. The programs runs in demo, practice and assessment modes - in the assessment mode, the program will be used for skill and knowledge evaluation and performance prediction. \r\n\r\nThe project addresses the diverse virtual practice needs of corporate and military training, as well as academic engineering and technical education. The primary target audience is corporate, military and medical technical personnel, as well as students enrolled in technical, engineering and healthcare programs in colleges and technical/vocational schools. Manufacturers and retailers of hardware and high-tech consumer goods will be able to use the project products for consumer education. The performance-based assessment tool provides a reliable way for the evaluation of personnel preparedness and performance prediction. \r\n\r\n",
