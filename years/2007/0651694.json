 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF-CNPq Collaborative Research Proposal on solitons, integrable theories\r\nand inifite-dimensional symmetries:\r\nThis is a proposal for a travel grant within the NSF-CNPq Collaborative Research\r\nprogram. The project will enable continuation of a long-term collaboration of the PI,\r\nProfessor Aratyn, with Profs. L.A. Ferreira (University of Sao Paulo), and J.F. Gomes\r\nand A.H. Zimerman (State University of Sao Paulo) on fundamental features of\r\nintegrability and further development of its applications in a variety of modern physical\r\ncontexts.\r\nThe collaborators plan to combine efforts to improve knowledge of various integrable\r\nmodels in two and higher dimensions, their algebraic and analytic aspects and ties\r\nbetween them. They expect to make advances on the following topics: understanding\r\nof new integrable models (with and without supersymmetry) emerging from\r\ndeformations of bihamiltonian structures; construction of non-abelian Toda models with\r\ninternal degrees of freedom and its soliton solutions; the Riemann-Hilbert factorization\r\nproblem applied to gradations other than the homogeneous ones and the tau functions\r\nof topological field theories described by the Witten-Dijkgraff-Verlinde-Verlinde equation;\r\nand soliton solutions of higher-dimensional integrable models\r\nand their structure.\r\nThe broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity are in the educational\r\ncomponent. Its objectives are to train young researchers in new methods and\r\ntechniques of the theory of integrable systems and their applications. There are a large\r\nnumber of graduate students in the Brazilian hosts institutions of Drs. Ferreira, Gomes\r\nand Zimerman The travel grant will involve all senior collaborators in training and\r\nmentoring arrangements. Several former Brazilian students and one US student now\r\nhold academic positions and continue to contribute to the field.",
