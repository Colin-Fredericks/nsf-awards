 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the geometry of spaces of rational curves\r\non smooth projective varieties, with a view toward understanding the\r\nstructure of rational points for varieties defined over function\r\nfields.  Consider a rationally-connected variety:  Which homology\r\nclasses contain free rational curves?  Very free rational curves? Is\r\nthe space of such curves connected?  Irreducible?  Rationally\r\nconnected?  Of general type?  Is there a workable notion of `rational\r\nsimple connectedness' and is this a birational property?   How can we\r\ndistinguish unirational varieties as a subclass of rationally-connected\r\nvarieties?  These questions are related to fundamental problems in Diophantine\r\ngeometry over function fields:  Does a rationally-connected variety\r\nover C(t) satisfy weak approximation?  Can the hypothesis of the Tsen/Lang\r\nTheorem over C(s,t) be formulated geometrically?  For rationally-connected\r\nvarieties over C(s,t), to what extent do cohomological obstructions\r\ngovern the existence of rational points?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award will support research on systems of polynomial\r\nequations with coefficents varying in parameters.  Our goal is to\r\nsolve these equations with rational functions that depend on these\r\nparameters.  The case of a single equation (or of several independent\r\nequations) was addressed in the mid 20th century;  the feasibility\r\nof finding a solution depends on the degree of the equation, the number\r\nof free variables, and the number of varying parameters.  Recently,\r\na comprehensive geometric approach was developed when there is just\r\none varying parameter.  However, for multiple (not necessarily\r\nindependent) equations in two varying parameters much remains to be\r\nunderstood.  This work will also have broader impacts on the education of\r\ngraduate students and postdoctoral fellows, the development of web-based\r\ncollaboration tools, and the promotion of robust academic networks\r\nlinking universities across the country.\r\n",
