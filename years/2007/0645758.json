 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Division of Chemistry: Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, and the Division of Materials Research: Solid State Chemistry Program, to Professor Alicia M. Beatty at Mississippi State University supports studies on the synthesis and characterization of hydrogen-bonded inorganic/organic hybrid materials.  The supermolecular synthetic approach will establish new methods for the preparation of inorganic/organic hybrid layers with organic pillars (homo-metallic clay mimics) and hybrid layers with hybrid pillars (hetero-metallic clay mimics).  These novel materials are expected to have broad use in catalysis, chemical separations, and molecular recognition, as well as potential applications in the development of magnetic solids and semiconductors.  The educational plan provides students and teachers in fifteen high schools in the Mississippi State region with an opportunity to participate in chemical research.  Professor Beatty particularly focuses on encouraging women as well as underrepresented minority and economically disadvantaged undergraduate and high school students to take part in her research and educational activities.  Annual continuing education classes focusing on crystal growth, clay chemistries, and zeolites and minerals will also be offered to Mississippi science teachers.",
