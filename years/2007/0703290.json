 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas A&M University System (TAMUS) LSAMP Phase IV will extend an\r\nalliance of three institutions: 1) Texas A&M University (TAMU), a Tier I research\r\ninstitution, 2) Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU), a Historically Black College\r\nand University, and 3) Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMUCC), an\r\nHispanic Serving Institution. To sustain gains made during Phase I, II, and III of the\r\nTAMUS LSAMP, alliance institutions will develop strong ties with 5 community\r\ncolleges, which each have large underrepresented minority (URM) student enrollment.\r\nThe community colleges are Palo Alto College (San Antonio); North Harris Montgomery\r\nCollege, both the North Harris and Cy-Fair campuses; Houston Community College-\r\nNortheast campus; and Del Mar College (Corpus Christi).\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT - TAMUS LSAMP IV has a GOAL of broadening the\r\nparticipation of underrepresented minorities (URM) in science, technology,\r\nengineering or mathematics (STEM) disciplines to the successful completion of a\r\nbachelor's degree and who are well prepared and ready to matriculate into a\r\ndoctoral program.\r\nObjectives include:\r\n1. Enhance community college partnerships for recruitment of URM students into\r\nSTEM majors through integrated interactions with alliance institutions.\r\n2. Expand retention efforts for STEM URM undergraduates with a focus on firstyear\r\nand transfer URM students at alliance institutions.\r\n3. Promote and encourage URM student pursuit of doctoral degrees and building of\r\na community of scholars from the undergraduate to graduate school levels and\r\nacross alliance institutions.\r\n4. Provide international experience for a select group of TAMUS LSAMP IV\r\nstudents for increasing and diversifying the pool of globally trained STEM\r\ngraduates\r\nPI Dr. Karan Watson, Dean of Faculties and Associate Provost, and Regents\r\nProfessor of Electrical Engineering, TAMU, will be joined by co-PIs: Dr. David Prior,\r\nExecutive Vice-President and Provost, TAMU; Dr. Karen Butler-Purry, Professor of\r\nElectrical Engineering, TAMU, and current TAMUS LSAMP Phase III Project Director;\r\nDr. Milton Bryant, Dean of Engineering, PVAMU; and Dr. Frank Pezold, Dean of\r\nScience and Technology, TAMUCC. These research faculty will seek to advance\r\ndiscovery of successful mechanisms to increase URM student retention, graduation and\r\npursuit of doctoral degrees, and URM student involvement in international study abroad.\r\nBROADER IMPACTS - The involvement of PVAMU, a Historically Black College and\r\nUniversity, and TAMUCC, an Hispanic Serving Institution, will broaden the participation\r\nin STEM of URM groups, as will participation by TAMU, as research intensive\r\ninstitution, and 5 community college partners since all enroll large numbers of URM\r\nstudents. LSAMP IV will benefit society by increasing participation of URM groups in\r\nSTEM, and by providing opportunities and activities at the undergraduate and graduate\r\nlevels that lead to educational and career enhancements of URM students.\r\nLSAMP IV will also enhance the infrastructure of research and education by\r\nadvancing undergraduate research and pursuit of graduate and doctoral STEM degrees at\r\nalliance institutions and through the replication and dissemination of successful models\r\nfor URM community college transfer students.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTexas A&amp;M University System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TAMUS LSAMP) worked under the model of improving Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) underrepresented minority (URM) student retention, the level of URM involvement in STEM academic and professional communities, and the progression of URM students to STEM\ngraduate studies.  TAMUS LSAMP Phase IV provided funding for alliance-wide academic enhancement activities and research opportunities.\n\nThe TAMUS LSAMP Undergraduate Research Program was established to promote the academic and professional skills of LSAMP students. The immediate intent was to link undergraduate students with active and supportive faculty-researchers who would mentor the students and provide them with opportunities to engage in research-related activities, as early as possible in the students\u00c6 academic careers. The long-term intent was to encourage and prepare students to continue their academic and research\ncareers in STEM graduate programs.\n\nDuring Phase IV, the three partner institutions of TAMUS LSAMP encouraged and supported undergraduate research (UGR) during the academic year by providing research seminars, summer research, summer study abroad opportunities, and summer international experiences.    Opportunities for participants to attend research conferences of their respective professional organizations provided a platform for presenting their research to their peers and to the organizations\u00c6 professionals.  The project also held its own annual symposium for students to present their research to their peers across the Alliance, providing the opportunity to increase their skills at presenting as well as to gather feedback on their research and presentation. \n\nCollaborations with other programs and grants on each campus allowed more student exposure to opportunities available through the LSAMP project.  Lessons learned on each of the three Alliance campuses were able to be disseminated through contact with the other programs and grants across each campus and with local community colleges.  Opportunities for recruitment of future LSAMP participants were made when the Alliance connected with a K-12 program that brought in STEM teachers for workshops. \n\nAn increase in URM STEM enrollment was indicated by data in all years of Phase IV for the Alliance from the baseline year (Fall 2007) to Year  6 (Fall 2013).  The net Alliance enrollment increase for the six years of Phase IV was 72.2% (3,076 students) over the baseline enrollment (4,261 students) at the end of Phase III.  The Alliance had a minimum yearly enrollment gain (from one year to the next) of 1.7% (which occurred between Years 3 and 4) and a maximum yearly enrollment gain of 20.4% (which occurred between Years 5 and 6). \n\nURM STEM Bachelor Degree data indicated changes in the bachelor degree production of the three TAMUS LSAMP Alliance institutions from the baseline year (2007-2008) to Year 6 (2013-2014).  A total of 4,689 STEM\nbachelor degrees were awarded to URM students over the six years of Phase\nIV.  The net degree increase for Year 6 (918 degrees) of Phase IV is 62.5% (353 degrees) over the baseline degree total (565 degrees) at the end of Phase III.  Degree completion rates, regardless of level, have experienced historical cycles.  The number of degrees reported for the last year of Phase IV appears to indicate the degree cycle to be dropping for two of the three institutions.  Year 5 completion rates were at the top of the cycle.  The Alliance had a minimum yearly degree gain (from one year to the next) of 6.5% (which occurred between Years 3 and 4) and a maximum yearly\ndegree gain of 15.0% (which occurred between Years 4 and 5) for Phase IV.  Individual institutional data indicate fluctuations in the number of degrees completed.  These fluctuations may have been attributed to the economy and other factors causing students to have to return to work or to drop out of the degree programs. ..."
