 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Cyber-mapping teaching modules are being developed and implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of three-dimensional photo-realistic virtual outcrops in teaching undergraduate introductory-level as well as upper-level geosciences courses for non-STEM and STEM students.  Three-dimensional visualization presents challenges for relating field examples back to classroom teaching. Rugged field conditions can hinder a variety of people, especially those with mobility disability and travel limitations, from benefiting from field experience. Real-world elements of three-dimensionality are being incorporated through curriculum modules built upon the latest cyber-mapping technology which integrates three major components: (1) high spatial resolution topography generated by ground-based Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data, (2) spectral information derived from high resolution digital photography, and (3) Global Positioning System (GPS) information relating the LIDAR-derived topography to global coordinates. Curriculum for lower level introductory geosciences courses to more advanced geoscience majors courses are being used in a vertically aligned manner to synergistically integrate educational and research opportunities in the context of Universal Design for undergraduate college students, thus affording better accessibility to geosciences topics to persons with mobility disabilities or travel limitations. A feedback-loop of formative as well as summative evaluations is being implemented.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: The incorporation of cyber-mapping is providing the geosciences community with a powerful means for teaching geosciences courses that will improve the quality of geosciences education and literacy.  Incorporating cyber-mapping technology is providing virtual accessibility of field localities to a group of people who cannot otherwise access those localities because of mobility or travel limitations. \r\n",
