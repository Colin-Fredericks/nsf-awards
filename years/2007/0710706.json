 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a 12 month standard award.  This is funding to support participation by approximately 10 researchers from the United States in a joint U.S.-France workshop to be held May 2-3, 2007 in Bordeaux, France.  Recent advances in computer science and engineering have realized new and unprecedented opportunities to benefit individuals through computer-based treatments that use life-like computer characters that behave like sensitive and effective tutors or therapists.  This workshop will bring together researchers in computer science and speech and language pathology from the United States and France who desire to collaborate to advance the technology needed to realize virtual therapy systems that can provide accessible and effective treatments to individuals with neurological disorders.  Research and development of virtual tutoring and therapy systems requires a deep understanding of the communication processes that occur during effective behavioral therapies, and knowledge about how to design human computer interfaces that model these communication processes to optimize user engagement and treatment effectiveness.  The workshop will allow researchers to share insights gained from their research and to propose future work to advance knowledge about human communication, clinical treatments and the design of effective treatments based on this knowledge. The first day of the workshop will involve presentations by U.S. and French researchers related to ongoing efforts to develop the tools, technologies and treatments that can benefit individuals with neurological disorders.  The second day of the workshop will bring together a smaller group of researchers who will work together to explore ways to initiate and sustain collaborative research projects.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Virtual human systems with optional online clinician oversight can offer an accessible and inexpensive means to provide effective behavioral treatments to millions of individuals.  The proposed workshop has the potential to accelerate research and development of virtual therapy systems through international collaboration.  This workshop is expected to lead to collaborations among U.S. and French researchers that will result in new knowledge and in virtual therapy systems in French and English that will be evaluated in each country with individuals with Parkinson disease and aphasia.",
