 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is to develop a new method for determining material properties under large strain, strain rate and temperature conditions that exist in metal cutting.  These property data can then be used in finite element analysis of machining operations.  The approach will include three tasks: 1) development of advanced steady state finite element model for two-dimensional (orthogonal) cutting, 2) development of an inverse analysis algorithm, and 3) experimental validation of the developed inverse analysis methodology to determine flow stress data using orthogonal cutting tests.\r\n\r\nThe results of this project will be a reliable test method for obtaining material data for \"virtual machining\", i.e. computer simulation of machining processes. Thus, researchers as well the machining companies, that represent a large portion of North American manufacturing industry will have a tool for conducting reliable machining simulations. As with other applications, simulation of machining operations saves time and costs. Consequently, the results of this project will contribute to productivity increases across the manufacturing industry, especially with companies that manufacture cutting tools and mechanical components produced by machining.",
