 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Utah. Richard Steiner is the site's Program Director. Ten faculty will serve as REU student mentors. During the award period (2007-2010), at least 10 students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program. Recruitment efforts will target students who do not have substantial research opportunities at there own institutions. In addition, the program will seek to attract a mix of students with rural and urban backgrounds and will focus on women and ethnic minorities. The research projects offered are in the areas of analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry. All participants  will receive training on the application of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography to chemical research. This will include both classroom lectures and direct instruction on using the instruments. Weekly meetings will expose the participants to different fields of research, career opportunities for chemists, and ethical issues facing researchers. Students will give oral reports, participate in a poster session, and submit a final written report. Program evaluation will include a  questionnaire for the student participants.",
