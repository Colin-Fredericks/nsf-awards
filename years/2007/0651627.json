 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) grant has been awarded to the\r\nHope College Nuclear Group (under the direction of Dr. Paul DeYoung and Dr.\r\nGraham Peaslee) by the National Science Foundation to support a variety of\r\nundergraduate research projects for the next three years.  The research\r\nactivities will center on understanding the properties of unstable nuclei far\r\nfrom stability, which are essential for understanding the fundamental nuclear\r\nforce, modeling the formation of heavy elements in supernovae, and testing a\r\nwide variety of nuclear theories and models.  In addition, we will be\r\ndeveloping novel applications of nuclear physics techniques to questions in\r\nother scientific fields, which can lead to valuable new scientific information\r\nin these areas.  Involving undergraduate students in all of these efforts\r\neducates them, excites them, and gives them tremendous preparation for\r\ngraduate work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically the Hope College Nuclear Group currently is planning to\r\ncharacterize the structure of several radioactive nuclei, including 16Be,\r\n13Li, 5H, and 9C.  These studies will be done at the National Superconducting\r\nCyclotron with the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA)  and the University of Notre\r\nDame with the ND neutron wall.  At the Hope College Ion Beam Analysis\r\nLaboratory, the nuclear group will use nuclear scattering and x-ray\r\nspectrometry along with accelerator and detector technology to determine\r\nmetalloprotein stoichiometry, to characterize the trace-element constituents\r\nof glass, and to determine the geological provenance of sand grains.\r\nRutherford backscattering will also be used to characterize electropolymers\r\nand conduct in-situ measurements of protein fragments in gels.\r\n\r\n\r\nUndergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the experiments:\r\nplanning, detector development, experiment setup, data taking, analysis, and\r\ndissemination. This grant will also provide support for a postdoctoral\r\nassociate as part of a trial effort to train future researchers that can\r\neffectively involve undergraduate students in the setting of a primarily\r\nundergraduate institution.\r\n**\r\n\r\n",
