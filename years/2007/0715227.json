 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical analysis combined with computer simulation is proposed for continued investigation of the properties of strongly coupled complex (dusty) plasmas.  Complex (dusty) plasmas consist of mesoscopic grains immersed in the background of gaseous plasma of electrons, ions and neutral atoms.  Such systems occur in a variety of situations.  The Proposal addresses problems associated with collective behavior in such systems: i.e. phenomena resulting from the cooperative participation of many particles.  Such a collective behavior is the hallmark of strongly coupled systems.  Six major areas are proposed for study: (i) magnetic interaction between grains carrying a magnetic dipole moment; (ii) propagation of waves in complex plasmas in two dimensional and three-dimensional configurations; (iii) micro-instabilities generated by beams of ions or grains penetrating into the complex plasma; (iv) stochastic and disordered behavior in complex plasmas; (v) phase transitions in complex plasmas; (vi) feasibility study for the cryogenic generation of complex plasmas on the surface of liquid helium.  One of the principal approaches to be used in the proposed investigations relies on an analytic method referred to as the Quasi Localized Charge Approximation that has been successfully used previously.  Collaboration with a research group at the Research Institute for Solid State Physics and Optics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest, Hungary on computer simulation will enhance the research program.\r\nBroader impacts of the research will contribute to improved understanding of problems of fundamental importance in plasma and condensed matter physics.  Establishing techniques suitable for the manipulation of mesoscopic structures will also have impact on engineering applications. Scientific exchanges with several major theoretical and experimental research groups both in the U. S. and overseas will be facilitated.  These principles and techniques of strongly coupled plasma physics will be part of a graduate program in the physical and engineering sciences.",
