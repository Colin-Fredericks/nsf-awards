As an interdisciplinary field, HPC engages talents in the broad areas of hardware architecture and design, system software, programming languages and tools, and parallel algorithms and computational techniques. \r\n\r\nWhile many universities offer graduate courses in one or more of these areas, there is a dearth of collegiate level courses presenting an essential balanced treatment across all constituent areas and their critical interrelationships as they contribute in synergy to delivered performance. Only through such an interdisciplinary presentation can students experience the interplay and mutual sensitivities of each conceptual component with the others determining the factors that influence the overall resulting computational capability. Louisiana State University (LSU) is undertaking to develop such a course at the first year graduate level and as a senior level elective. The goal of this new course, using multimedia: \"High Performance Computing Concepts, Methods, and Means\" is to engender a new generation of computer and computational scientists expert in the development, operation, and application of high performance computing systems prepared to address this nation's future challenges demanding capability and expertise in HPC. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
