Even though more capable enzymes are becoming available through the latest advances in genetic engineering and protein science, the water-insolubility of organic compounds remains greatly restraining to the efficiency of many promising biotransformations.  This research seeks to develop and investigate a breakthrough strategy to conduct interfacial biocatalysis in a way mimicking biological membrane-binding mechanisms of proteins.  Specifically, native water-soluble protein enzymes and cofactors will be conjugated with hydrophobic polymers to form surfactant-like structures, thus enabling self-assembling of the catalysts at O/A interfaces.  Research objectives are to: (1) Enable the self-assembling of multienzyme systems at O/A interfaces, (2) Investigate fundamental aspects of the interfacial catalysis of multienzyme systems, and (3) Evaluate the potentials of the interfacial biocatalysis for commodity chemical production, especially the multiple enzyme pathway for the production of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (pHBA), which is used for the production of liquid crystal polymers, dyes, pesticides and pharmaceuticals.  The education plan seeks to (1) Facilitate the integration and eventually form a core foundation of biotechnology into the chemical engineering curriculum, and (2) Promote public awareness and interests in engineering.\r\n",
