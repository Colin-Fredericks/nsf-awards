 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposing team plans to analyze the power spectrum of line-of-sight photospheric magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs) and coronal holes, in order to investigate whether the spectrum of an emerging active region portends its future flare productivity. Their approach is motivated by the need to identify new active regions that have the potential to produce powerful flares, as well as to understand the nature of photospheric turbulence in ARs. \r\n\r\nThe PI will also derive observational parameters of the photospheric turbulence inside coronal holes, such as magnetic power spectra, mean flux density, and filling factor. She expects the results of this study to advance our understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of magnetic flux tubes in the photosphere above active regions. This research will also enhance our understanding of coronal hole formation and solar wind acceleration mechanisms.\r\n\r\nOne of the proposing team's goals is to provide a new technique for long-term forecasting of strong solar flares and associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The results will be applicable to important space weather problems, such as determining the probability of a strong flare or a CME eruption from the Sun. This project will also support a graduate student and provide a catalogue of results for wider use by the scientific community.\r\n",
