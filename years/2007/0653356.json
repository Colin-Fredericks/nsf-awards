 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses certain basic aspects of the electroweak and\r\r\nstrong interactions reflected in the properties of mesons and nucleons\r\r\n(particles found inside atomic nuclei) and their interactions at low\r\r\nenergies.  The strong and weak interactions are responsible for the\r\r\nstructure of matter at the smallest known scale, a femtometer (size of\r\r\nthe hydrogen nucleus) or less.  The research is motivated by the fact\r\r\nthat the present comprehensive theory -- the Standard Model (SM) -- is\r\r\nknown to be incomplete.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe rare decay of the pi-meson (pion) into an electron and a neutrino,\r\r\noccurring once in about ten thousand ordinary pion decays, provides a\r\r\ntheoretically extraordinarily clean window to certain possible\r\r\nextensions of the SM, at a very large mass scale not directly\r\r\naccessible at any existing or planned accelerators.  The PEN\r\r\nexperiment, mounted at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland, by an\r\r\ninternational collaboration of seven institutions led by the\r\r\nUniversity of Virginia (UVa) group, builds on the success of the\r\r\nPIBETA experiment which improved by about an order of magnitude the\r\r\naccuracy of several rare decay modes of the pion and muon (a massive\r\r\nrelative of the electron) in a series of measurements from 1999\r\r\nthrough 2004.  A new project, encompassing experiments \"Nab\" and\r\r\n\"abBA,\" has been initiated at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak\r\r\nRidge National Lab in Tennessee, with the aim to measure precisely and\r\r\nsimultaneously several of the decay parameter of the neutron beta\r\r\ndecay.  Through their precision, these experiments will explore\r\r\nsimilarly interesting possible extensions to the SM.\r\r\n\r\r\nDuring the past five years this program has resulted in four doctoral\r\r\ndegrees at UVa.  Two UVa Ph.D. students are currently working towards\r\r\ntheir theses, plans call for a third to join the group soon.  Each\r\r\nyear typically one to two undergraduate students are engaged in\r\r\nresearch on this project, thus gaining practical laboratory\r\r\nexperience.",
