 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student travel support is provided to the Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI) conference due to the benefits to the communities and to the areas of Computer Systems Research (CSR) and Global Environment for Networking Innovations (GENI).\r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit: After the significant success of its first three meetings, Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI) has become a very strong conference that fuses the research areas of networking and systems.  It has developed a strong focus on implementation and experience. Most importantly, the cross-disciplinary emphasis of NSDI makes it well-suited for student participation. NSF student travel support not only is beneficial to the symposium, but also to students from diverse backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe relation of the central themes of NSDI to the Computer Systems Research areas of systems is straightforward. The relation of the central themes of NSDI to GENI within CNS derives from NSDI's emphasis on testbed implementation and experimentation, as well as its cross-disciplinary emphasis.  NSDI in effect incubates young researchers\r\n",
