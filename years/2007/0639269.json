 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing 500 fifth graders in Southern New Mexico with a diverse menu of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learning opportunities that will continue into seventh grade for these participants.  Each student will receive a minimum of 150 hours of out-of-school experiences in Special STEM Saturdays, Family Festivals, and Summer STEM programs.  The overarching theme of \"Adaptation to the Environment\" will serve to integrate a wide range of topics and activities in the STEM disciplines.  The project will utilize the rich sources in traditional cultural and the environment provided by the region (Stone Age) and strong local capabilities in the aerospace industry (Space Age).  The school population is predominantly Hispanic students, with at least 35% having English as a second language.  The families of these students will be recruited to participate in the project, as well as a minimum of 30 educators.  Research will be conducted on the effect of the project on students' interest and achievement in STEM disciplines, the role of parents' participation on student success and the effect of high quality professional development for teachers on their interest in STEM.",
