 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Michigan State Group plans to continue its research on top quark physics using the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) and use this expertise from CDF to contribute to the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. The group is currently working on measuring the charge of the top quark, which the SM predicts to be +2/3 but there are non-SM theories that allow for an exotic top quark with charge  -4/3.  Additionally the group is working with matrix element techniques that can be applied to the search for a non-Standard Model W boson which might decay into a single top quark plus a bottom quark.  Ultimately it is planned to use this technique to search for Higgs Bosons in the WH Channel at the LHC.  Over the next three years the group will gradually transition to the ATLAS experiment.   As a fundamental feature of the research effort, the group is dedicated to encouraging minorities, especially women, to become interested in science and pursue careers in physics.  \r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main goal of the field of high-energy physics (HEP) is to answer the question \"What are the fundamental constituents of matter and how do they interact?\".  To answer this question a theory called the Standard Model (SM) has been developed over the last several decades.  The theory has been tested to the level of a few tenths of a percent over a large range of energies and has been found to provide a remarkably precise description of the sub-nuclear world.  Despite its successes the SM does have a number of shortcomings.  For example, it does not explain why there are 6 quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom) in nature or why their masses have a hierarchical pattern.  In fact the theory contains a number of free parameters, such as the quarks\u00c6 masses, which must be obtained from experimental measurements.  One experimental result that was surprising was the mass of the top quark.  Weighing in at ~175 GeV, the top quark is the heaviest elementary particle known.  The top quark\u00c6s large mass gives it a unique role in the SM and may be the best place to understand the mechanism that generates mass.  In addition, the top quark decays so quickly that it allows particle physicists to directly measure its properties such as its spin and charge, which is not possible for the other quarks.  These special qualities of the top quark make it the ideal specimen for answering some of the nagging questions that have yet to be filled in by the SM.  In order to address some of the SM\u00c6s shortcomings new theories have been proposed which often include \u00e6exotic\u00c6 particles.  Searching for these new particles, such as heavy gauge bosons called W\u00c6 and Z\u00c6 bosons, place limits on the new theories beyond the SM and help to refine our understanding of the universe.  This project has measured the electric charge of the top quark and observed the production of singly produced top quarks on the CDF experiment and set limits on the masses of W\u00c6 and Z\u00c6 bosons on the ATLAS experiment.\n\n \n\nThis project has measured the electric charge of the top quark and observed the production of singly produced top quarks on the CDF experiment and set limits on the masses of W\u00c6 and Z\u00c6 bosons on the ATLAS experiment.  This research led to 4 publications on CDF and 3 publications on ATLAS.\nThis project has supported 3 postdocs, 2 graduate students and 2 undergraduates on the CDF and ATLAS experiments.\nThis project is dedicated to encouraging women to be involved in science, specifically physics.  This grant supported 5 women (including the PI) to do research in a cutting-edge field of physics.  In addition the PI volunteers each year at the 5th Grade Girls\u00c6 Match and Science Conference which is designed to encourage young girls to stay interested in math and science.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/04/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kirsten A Tollefson"
