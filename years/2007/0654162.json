 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective and approach of this Collaborative Research project is to use a novel non-contact pattern imprinting methodology to address the cost and environmental elements of manufacturing micron and possibly sub-micron scale surface features. The process is based on focused electric field induced ion transport,  which is capable of imprinting miniaturized and micron size features at an attractive cost of ownership. The process employs an electrochemical cell, wherein the cathode has a cavity enclosing the electrolyte with a cation-selective ion-conducting flexible membrane. Preliminary results indicate several advantages of the proposed technique over the current technology. This project focuses on developing a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental process mechanisms. The gained insights will then be utilized to extend the process to the submicron regime.\r\n \r\nThis process, if successful, would provide unique, environmentally benign process for micron- and sub-micron sized features and components. This process would respond to a rapidly increasing demand with significant manufacturing cost saving among very diverse industries, including electronic systems, actively controlled optics, automotive, communications and micro-satellites, medicine and biotechnology, micro-probes for air and land-based home security and counter terrorism systems. The project will provide exposures for graduate and undergraduate students to novel methods of designing and manipulating micron- & sub-micron scale material removal processes. The fundamentals of the processes  will be incorporated into a new course curriculum in non-traditional approaches to micro and nano-patterning technology. Wide dissemination of the insights gained will be achieved by developing a software test bed for simulation and control of the process, and making it available through the World Wide Web.",
