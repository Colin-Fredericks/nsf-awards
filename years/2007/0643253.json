 "awd_abstract_narration": "Precise and controlled repair of DNA double-strand breaks is crucial for cell survival and genomic integrity.  Double-strand breaks can be repaired by a number of both accurate and inaccurate mechanisms.  Although accurate repair pathways have been extensively studied, error-prone double-strand break repair is not well characterized at the mechanistic level.  This CAREER project will elucidate the genetic requirements for error-prone break repair and characterize the dynamic interactions between various double-strand break repair pathways in the multicellular eukaryote Drosophila melanogaster.  To accomplish these objectives, teams of graduate and undergraduate students will utilize reporter systems that measure the relative use of repair pathways to study how developmental and tissue-specific cues affect repair pathway choice.  They will employ web-based wikis to promote effective communication within the teams and to share ideas and protocols with the larger scientific community.  In addition, the research will serve as the basis for a new seminar course that engages students in critical analysis of primary literature articles within the field.\r\n\r\nThis project will further our understanding of a crucial question in molecular biology-how various DNA repair pathways are coordinated to ensure genomic stability in a constantly changing multicellular environment.  In addition, it will provide insight into the mechanisms by which error-prone DNA repair pathways can promote genetic diversity.  While conducting research, students will participate in mentoring workshops and outreach activities designed to develop skills required for successful research careers.  These experiences will encourage them to take ownership of their research and career paths at an early stage in their training.  The project should therefore have a broad impact on the retention of students in research-oriented scientific fields, particularly those students from traditionally underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDNA double-strand breaks occur when both strands of a DNA helix are severed.  These breaks, if repaired inaccurately, can lead to chromosome deletions and rearrangements that are frequently associated with the development of cancer cells.  The goals of this project were to (1) develop assays in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) to measure the frequency and consequences of error-prone double-strand break repair, (2) identify genes that play important roles in the process or regulation of error-prone repair, and (3) determine how different types of double-strand break repair are controlled in the context of an organism that has multiple cell types and developmental stages. \n\nDuring the course of the project, we developed several novel assays which we now regularly employ in the lab.  These assays allow us to induce double-strand breaks at specific sites within the fly genome and follow their repair using easy-to-score visible traits, such as eye color and wing shape.  Importantly, we can create breaks in defined genetic and genomic contexts so that they are preferentially repaired using specific repair templates.  Furthermore, we can determine whether break repair proceeds through end joining, which involves the processing of broken DNA ends and direct rejoining, or homologous recombination, which involves the use of an undamaged template for repair synthesis. \n\nUsing our assays, we found evidence for a new type of end-joining, which we have named \"synthesis-dependent microhomologous mediated end joining,\" or SD-MMEJ.  This is an error-prone form of end joining that utilizes short, repeated sequences in DNA flanking a double-strand break as templates for the synthesis of microhomologies.  These microhomologies are then used to hold broken ends together during repair.  We have written software that can identify repair junctions consistent with SD-MMEJ and will make it publicly available.  Importantly, this type of repair does not seem to be specific to flies; we have found evidence for SD-MMEJ in worms, mice, and human cancer cells.  We have also identified a protein, DNA polymerase theta, which is important for both SD-MMEJ and for the repair of other types of DNA damage.  This protein is highly expressed in many human tumors, suggesting that it may be important for the generation or evolution of cancer cells.  Recently, we have identified tissues in the fly where polymerase theta plays a particularly important role in preventing genomic instability.  Ongoing characterization of flies possessing various mutant versions of polymerase theta will allow us to characterize novel functions for this protein during development.\n\nIn addition, we have discovered that non-processive, mistake-prone translesion polymerases are involved in the initiation of homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks.  They appear to be in competition with highly processive polymerases that carry out normal DNA replication.  This finding is important, because it provides a potential explanation for several recent reports that homologous recombination repair can be mutagenic.  Specifically, competition between translesion and replicative polymerases could provide opportunities for switching between repair templates, resulting in imperfect copying of DNA sequences at repair junctions.\n\nThe research for this project was conducted by teams of graduate students and undergraduates, all of whom received formal training in mentoring techniques.  During the course of the project, 10 graduate students, 32 undergraduates, 1 postbaccalaureate student, and 1 high school student conducted research for at least three months in the lab.  Most of these students have presented their research results at local symposia and many have given talks and posters at national and international conferences.  They have participated in outreach activities including visits to local high schools and community colleges and have gone on to postgraduate work in..."
