 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\n\r\nThis project is building a set of interactive teaching modules for biomedical engineering courses dealing with commonly used medical imaging modalities (X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound and PET), biomedical signals (ECG, EMG, and EEG) and bio-optics (laser and OCT).  Each module consists of six sub-modules that present a historical and background review, a description with graphical illustrations, interactive animations, up-loadable simulations, a medical applications library, and assessment tools.  The evaluation effort, under the direction of a faculty member from the College of Education, is looking at student use of the material and their perceptions about it during engagement with the modules; at student learning using a quasi-experimental design with pre and post test, and at student transfer of learning beyond the classroom.  The project includes collaboration with a community college allowing the material to be developed and evaluated with diverse student populations, class sizes, teaching environments, course settings, student training concentrations, and faculty expertise.  Internal and external advisory committees are helping to guide the project.  The material is being shared with others through presentations at engineering education and biomedical engineering conferences, though a website, and through a special forum on medical imaging, signal, and optics teaching and research.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the material, the community college collaboration, and an emphasis on Hispanic students.\r\n\r\n",
