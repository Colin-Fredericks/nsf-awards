 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will develop dose sensors for use in ion beam and proton beam cancer therapy. The proposed technical approach will result in compact, low-cost dose sensors with high sensitivity, high accuracy and good long term stability. The sensors can be used for both ex-vivo applications (such as beam monitoring, calibration and control), as well as for in-vivo applications (implanted within the patient's body), to allow very precise treatment of small tumors and advanced tumors.\r\n\r\nProton beam cancer therapy is fast becoming a mainstream technology in the US, offering the potential for successful cancer treatment, with minimal side effects and minimum damage to adjacent healthy tissue. For successful treatment, it is critical to achieve the proper dose, and to target the dose to a specific volume within the patient. The development of accurate, reliable dose sensors is critical to achieving the proper dose to cancerous tissue and minimizing the dose to healthy tissue. The use of in-vivo dose sensors will enable beam position accuracy to within small fractions of a millimeter, even with the inevitable organ movement due to patient respiration and cardiovascular action. This increased level of beam position accuracy will enable successful treatment of advanced tumors, small tumors and tumors intimately adjacent to healthy organs.\r\n",
