 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complex dynamic and electrodynamic interactions of the ionosphere, neutral atmosphere, and solar wind are untangled in the context of five specific initiatives.  First, the hypothesis that discrepancies between the subauroral electrics fields measured at the Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) site and at San Santin, France is caused by a flywheel mechanism is investigated using measurements from two Fabry-Perot interferometers and two all-sky cameras at Millstone Hill.  Second, a new technique to derive electron density and temperature using ISR plasma line and gyro line measurements is implemented and tested using data from the Sondrestromfjord, Greenland ISR.  Third, molecular ion models are used to estimate the molecular population to be included in ISR spectral fitting, resulting in improved ion and electron temperature determination.  Fourth, a technique to assemble a real-time measure of the equatorial electrical field around the globe is applied with the intention of predicting F-region ionospheric irregularities collectively known as equatorial spread-F.  Fifth, two all-sky cameras are positioned at Cerro Tololo, Chile and at Huancayo, Peru for the purpose of capturing plasma bubble structure and morphology using  a stereo view.",
