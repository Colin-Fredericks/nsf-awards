 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to develop novel biomolecular signal amplification protocols for nanomechanical cantilever based biosensors. The approach is to select aptazymes (RNA-based enzymatic molecules) that perform target-activated ligation based their ability to function on sensor surfaces and to enhance cantilever bending signals significantly by employing rolling circle amplification (RCA) protocols. The specific aims of the project are: 1) Adaptation of solution-based aptazymes and RCA to the cantilever, 2) Development of new aptazymes for surface function and 3) Adaptation of surface-based aptazymes to the nanomechanical cantilever for detection of proteins. In this study, Dr. Savran will be the PI and will be responsible for all experiments. Dr. Ellington will be co-PI and will undertake molecular selection and synthesis.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: In this study, the synthesis of aptazymes for optimal performance on sensor surfaces will be demonstrated for the first time. The selected molecules will be adapted to the nanomechanical cantilever sensor along with rolling circle amplification to achieve enhanced signals and detection limits that are only observed by fluorescence-based detection systems. \r\n\r\nBroad Impact: This project will result in ultrasensitive detectors that are mass produced via microfabrication techniques with reduced costs per unit device. This is expected to have significant economical and social impacts by enabling affordable systems to a wide variety of users ranging from biologists to clinicians. This project will also aim to i) contribute to the nanotechnology awareness of high-school students and ii) foster involvement of undergraduate students of minority backgrounds in nanotechnology research.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
