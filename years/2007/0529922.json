 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic science goal of Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) is to understand the physics of the Southern California fault system and encode this understanding in a system-level model that can predict salient aspects of earthquake behavior. Southern California's network of several hundred active faults forms a superb natural laboratory for the study of earthquake physics. Its seismic, geodetic, and geologic data are among the best in the world. Moreover, Southern California contains 23 million people, so that high seismic hazard translates to nearly one-half of the national earthquake risk. The Center's tripartite mission statement emphasizes the connections between information gathering, knowledge formulation through physics-based modeling, and public communication of hazard and risk. An important part of SCEC's mission is to increase the diversity of its scientific workforce; SCEC values diversity in all aspects of its activities. Created in 1991, SCEC has since expanded to 54 institutions involving over 560 scientists. The core institutions, currently 15, are committed to SCEC's mission and offer sustained support for its programs; the participating institutions, currently 39, are self-nominated through their members' participation. The Center is open to any credible scientist from any research institution interested in collaborating on the problems of earthquake science. However, SCEC is structured to achieve prioritized science objectives within the Southern California Natural Laboratory, and resources are allocated accordingly.",
