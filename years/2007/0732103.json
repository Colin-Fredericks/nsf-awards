Its aim is to develop primarily new faculty through the dissemination of innovative and effective teaching methods.  In addition, the participants will discuss a number of promising research areas in which concepts, principles, problems, and laboratory experiments can be incorporated into course work.\r\n\r\nThe School also brings new faculty together with mid-career and senior colleagues to discuss educational methods and delivery mechanisms and to provide tested educational materials to new faculty for use in a variety of courses.  Twenty-one different workshops are planned in many areas that receive NSF support, such as Systems Biology, Molecular Simulation, Process and Product Design, Computational Fluid Dynamics and Quantum Chemistry, Sustainability Engineering, Pre-College Education, etc.\r\n\r\nThe School aims to support the attendance at least of one new faculty member from each school in the U.S. that awards chemical engineering B.S. degree, with the number totaling approximately 100.  The resulting research and educational materials will be widely distributed via CD-ROM and the Internet to the chemical engineering community and beyond.\r\n",
