However, the autonomous, heterogeneous and decentralized nature of participating peers across multiple administrative domains introduces two challenges.\r\nOne challenge is effective decentralized resource management, which includes introducing incentives for peers to provide good services, self-adaptive resource sharing in different situations and optimal resource allocation. The other challenge is efficient system management, which includes self-defensive system management and user friendly management interfaces. Efficient system management makes the system easy to maintain and use and reduces the system management cost, which is extremely important for large scale systems.\r\n\r\nThis investigator conjectures that the fundamental problem of resource sharing is a dependable mechanism for resource trading. Given this trading mechanism, it is easy to build several high level resource management services, such as service level agreements, optimal resource co-allocation, advance reservation, and dynamic adaptation and reconfiguration. This research consists of four components: (1) An adaptive, personalized trust model named aPET to be employed by individual peers for trustworthiness derivation; (2) A trust-based economic model M-CUBE to efficiently express resources thus to provide a powerful foundation for resource allocation and management; (3) Efficient resource allocation scheme across multiple sites and investigating the impact of trustworthiness provided by aPET on resource allocation schemes; and (4) Applying the proposed trust and economic models to provide efficient system management. The research is expected to serve as a fundamental component and has the extraordinary potential to be deployed and adopted by several high-end computing communities, which require collaboration of geographically distributed resources.\r\n",
