 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ciliated protists in the genus Vorticella are widespread, well-known, aquatic micro-organisms, but identification of individual kinds is difficult and little is known about their evolution.  American and Chinese collaborators will use a wide variety of new information (especially gene sequences) to sort out classification and evolutionary relationships of five groups of Vorticella species to begin solving this problem.  Activities will include: (1) collecting many new samples from North America, China, and Europe; (2) using photomicrography and modern imaging techniques to document and describe informative cellular structures and life cycle stages; (3) sequencing a variety of genes; and (4) using a full range of information (structural, developmental, and genetic) to decipher evolutionary relationships. \r\n\r\nThe result will be more reliable identification of Vorticella species that will make them easier to use as bioindicators of water quality and waterborne toxins, their greatest value to society.  A web-based identification key and information bank will aid this kind of use.  Information gathered will lay a foundation for reclassifying the entire genus of nearly 200 species and yield greater knowledge of evolution in the larger group of organisms to which Vorticella belongs.  Finally, this will be a major investigation of geographic distribution and species diversity of micro-organisms, an area of inquiry still in its infancy.  Research will be done at N.C. Central University, which is predominantly African-American, diversifying its research effort and training undergraduates from an under-represented minority for careers in biological research.\r\n",
