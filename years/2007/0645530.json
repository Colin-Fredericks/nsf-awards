 "awd_abstract_narration": "Child-mother relationships provide an important context for children to learn about their environment and about how to interact with peers and other adults. Thus, the study of child-parent relationships is a key to understanding all socialization processes of children. The basis for the formation and maintenance of child-mother relationships are everyday interactions. This program of research will explore the relation between those interactions and children's competence in other contexts such as preschool settings. \r\n\r\nResearch on these issues is scant, despite the fact that the preschool years are likely to be a time when child-mother relationships are consolidated, with implications for children's adaptation to social exchanges with others, and for children's socialization outcomes in general. Findings may have important implications for prevention and intervention issues in families from the populations studied. \r\n\r\nThis project has two objectives. The first is to investigate child-mother relationships processes in the domains of behavior and mental representation during early childhood (3.5 to 5 years of age). Further, we will study the relations between child-mother relationships and children's social competence (i.e., social exchanges with peers and other adults). To accomplish this, observations of maternal and child behavior at home and in playgrounds will be conducted. Narratives regarding child-mother relationships will also be obtained from mothers and children, as well as an assessment of mother-child joint interaction regarding attachment related issues. Finally, data on children's behavior during social interactions with peers and adults will be obtained from preschool teachers. \r\n\r\nThe second objective of the research is to investigate and compare the relationship processes mentioned above and their ability to predict social competence in samples of dyads from two different cultural contexts. Information will be collected from both U.S. and Colombian children. Although the tendency to form relationships with primary caregivers is characteristic of all humans, child-mother relationships are context sensitive. We will compare the data from both samples to determine common as well as sample specific patterns of association among the variables.\r\n",

The quality of those relationships has been found to play an important role in child development.  There were two general goals for the study.  The first main goal was to investigate the relations between the quality of maternal care (sensitivity) during mother-child interactions and children?s quality of attachment to mother (security).  Attachment security was assessed at the levels of both behavior and narratives (representations).  In addition, we were interested in studying the associations between security and the quality of children?s social exchanges with peers and other adults in preschool settings (social competence, aggression, and withdrawal).  The second main goal was to investigate and compare the issues mentioned above in samples from two different cultural contexts.

All those results were found for both the U.S. and the Colombian samples.\n\nAs narratives (representations) about attachment are concerned, results showed initial evidence of a significant association between attachment behavior and attachment narratives, when children were 3.5 years old.  This was so in samples from both countries.  However, analyses indicated that the association between attachment behavior and narratives  was not significant at 5 years of age in either sample.  Thus, more research is needed on the topic to account for the differences at both points in time. \n\nFindings about the relations between attachment security and social competence, aggression, and withdrawal showed that attachment security was not significantly related to social competence and aggression at 3.5 years of age in either samples; child withdrawal was significantly related to attachment behavior in the Colombian, but was not in the U.S. sample.

As attachment narratives are concerned, results indicated that they were related to social competence and withdrawal in both samples, but not to child aggression, when children were 3.5 years old.
