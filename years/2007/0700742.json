 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to explore the geometry of parameter spaces of sheaves on\r\nalgebraic curves and surfaces. She wants to calculate some of the\r\nintersection theory, in particular Verlinde numbers, on Gieseker moduli\r\nspaces of semistable sheaves on a smooth surface. These\r\nintersection-theoretic calculations will help the PI probe whether the\r\nlevel-rank duality which is a feature of moduli spaces of bundles on a\r\ncurve, can be associated with moduli spaces of sheaves on a surface as\r\nwell. The author also wishes to explore some of the representation theory\r\nof classical and affine Lie algebras on the cohomology of Grothendieck\r\nquot schemes on curves, as well as on the cohomology of Gieseker moduli\r\nspaces of sheaves on a surface, which would result in a better\r\nunderstanding of the geometric structure of these moduli spaces.\r\n\r\nThe study of vector bundles in algebraic geometry parallels that of gauge \r\nfield theories in physics. The most familiar example of a gauge field is \r\nthe electromagnetic field. Higher-rank vector bundles correspond to \r\nnonabelian gauge fields, which appear in high-energy physics, and \r\nmathematically are organized as the entries of a matrix.  Studying the \r\ngeometry and intersection theory on the moduli space of bundles, which is \r\nthe goal of this project, leads in particular to understanding the \r\nstructure of various integrals on the space of all possible gauge fields. \r\nThese integrals are mathematical expressions for scattering amplitudes of \r\nvarious physical processes in high-energy physics.\r\n",
