Lehmann of the University of Virginia and his postdoctoral and graduate student colleagues will use liquid helium nanodroplets as unique laboratories for studying the ways in which molecules behave in confined quantum fluids.  Lehmann and his group plan on studying the behavior of ions in size-selected helium droplets to search for the presence of novel fluid effects (vortex rings or rotons).  In addition, Lehmann and his group will use the nanodroplet as a calorimeter -- measuring the energetics of exothermic processes by detecting the evaporation of helium atoms.  Other experiments plan on studying the poorly-understood relaxation dynamics of molecules with excited rotational, vibrational and spin degrees of freedom in these quantum fluids.\r\n\r\nHelium nanodroplets are an unusual quantum environment whose behavior is still poorly understood.  The results of these investigations will provide crucial benchmarks for theorists interested in modeling these systems.  The work in calorimetry is of fundamental importance since it allows thermochemical information to be determined directly -- a molecule at a time.  The students and postdoctoral fellows working on this project will be provided with broad interdisciplinary training at the interface of chemistry and condensed matter physics.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThis research project was focused on the spectroscopy and dynamics of molecules and ions solvated in helium nanodroplets.   Helium is a unique substance that remains liquid down to zero degrees Kelvin (K) and, at 2.12K, undergoes a phase transition to a superfluid phase.   This phase is has many unique and interesting properties, including the ability of flow to continue indefinitely and the ability creep up surfaces and flow out of a container.   These properties arise from the fact that a superfluid is a macroscopic quantum state with long-range phase coherence.  There is a long history of the study of bulk liquid helium.  In the past decade, the study of superfluidity on the nanometer scale has become possible through the study of helium nanodroplets.   These are clusters of hundreds to millions of helium atoms that are formed in a high vacuum chamber and rapidly cool to 0.38 K by evaporation.  One of the most powerful ways to study the properties of these droplets is to introduce atoms or molecules into the droplets and then take the spectrum of these dopants.   The spectra can be compared to the spectra of the same atoms or molecules taken in the gas phase, in solids of other inert gases (Ne, Ar, Xe), and conventional liquids, such as water or carbon tetrachloride.   In most cases, the spectra are very different from any of these other environments, reflecting the unique interactions of a superfluid with other atoms and molecules.   The goal of this research program is to increase our understanding of how a microscopic superfluid interacts and how this reflects the properties of a microscopic superfluid.\n\n \n\nWe aim to understand how the rotational and vibrational motion of the molecules are changed by the helium environment.   We know that molecules come into equilibrium with the helium droplets but that the rate of energy exchange is often orders of magnitude slower than for conventional liquids or solids.   We aim to measure the rates of relaxation of these degrees of freedom and also to develop theoretical models to predict the same.   We want to learn about the translational motion of ions in the droplets and compare that to previous studies of the motion of ions in bulk superfluid helium.   We want to understand if we can form vortex states in the superfluid helium droplets.  Vortices are quantum states that are trapped topological defects where helium atoms circulate around a vortex line with quantized circulation.   These are well studied in bulk helium but have not yet been observed in helium nanodroplets.   \n\n \n\nWe also seek to understand if we can observe and control novel chemical reactions in the superfluid environment.   All atoms and molecules we put into the helium are free to move about, since it is a liquid environment.   When a single droplet picks up more than one dopant, these will eventually form a molecular complex.  It has been demonstrated that often complexes can be formed that cannot be formed by any other known way.   Because of the low temperature, even very small barriers to chemical reaction cannot be overcome.    One example of how we are trying to control reactions is to use magnetic fields to align electron spins.   To form covalent bonds, one must generally pair up electrons &ndash; if the electrons have their spins aligned they cannot form an electron pair.   In accessible magnetic fields, the difference in energy between an electron spin pointing up and spin pointing down is much less than thermal energy if most environments.  This is not the case for helium droplets, where with a field of 1 Telsa, electrons will strongly align with the field and not have sufficient energy to flip.\n\n \n\nThis project advances the fields of molecular spectroscopy, chemical reaction dynamics, and condensed matter physics.   It has provided two graduate students, two undergraduates, and two post doctoral fellows a broad training in a highly interdisciplinary field of research.   One of the products of th..."
