 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dissolved organic matter, DOM, is a major reservoir of organic carbon in estuaries and the ocean. It plays a key role in coastal ecosystem ecology as a food source for microbes, sunscreen against ultraviolet radiation for plankton, and a chemical reactant affecting water quality. This project seeks to understand the role of tidal marshes as sources of DOM. The abundance of marshes in the Chesapeake Bay (70,000 ha) make this an ideal place for addressing several key questions. Do the properties of DOM differ between freshwater and saltwater estuaries? Are differences due to the types of plants the adjacent marshes support or amount of salt in the water? Do microbes grow differently on DOM from certain marsh types? A comprehensive array of methods will be used to answer these questions including field studies, optical properties, chemical analyses and novel laboratory studies. The ultimate goal is to better understand what regulates sources and fates of DOM as it is transported by estuaries to the coastal ocean. \r\n\r\nThe research will improve our ability to use ocean color remote sensing to understand aspects of  the ecology of the Chesapeake Bay and other coastal zones.  Because DOM production is an important process in global carbon cycling, the research also will contribute to our understanding of the controls on atmospheric carbon dioxide and, hence, climate change. The work promotes teaching, training, and learning by incorporating research into the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center's (SERC) public education programs, which brings hands-on science experiences to nearly 10,000 children every year. The public will learn about the research through mass media, websites, and public events hosted at SERC and the University of Maryland.\r\n",
