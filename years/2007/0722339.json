 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lab-centric instruction is a substantial extension to the widely advocated use of supervised closed labs as a required part of the course. In lab-centric courses, lecture and recitation time is traded wholly or in large part for supervised, structured labs that become the primary resource for student learning. Berkeley has offered lab-centric instruction in CS1 and CS2, and instructors have observed numerous benefits over and above those claimed for lab-augmented instruction. The vision is to significantly expand the use of lab-centric instruction into all CS courses (especially upper division) and academic settings. We propose a three-year project with the following goals. 1.  Assemble a diverse team of leaders in communities related to lab-centric instruction: CS curriculum, pedagogy, teacher education, digital repositories, and educational technology.  2. Evaluate the state of lab usage and barriers to adoption of lab-centric formats in courses across the range of higher-educational instructional contexts.  3. Create an online space to support the growth and functioning of the lab-centric community. 4. Recruit instructors to develop and refine a small number of lab-centric segments for inclusion in upper-division CS courses, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the supporting tools and materials for this development and wider community interaction. 5. Provide outreach for the lab-centric community and the online center and dissemination of the project results through a variety of educational forums. The Berkeley lab-centric courses appeared particularly to benefit students traditionally underrepresented in CS courses. Extension of these results to other institutions through the efforts of the proposed community would have a significant impact on CS education. Lab-centric materials should be readily sharable, and therefore contribute greatly to educational infrastructure. We will provide broad outreach and dissemination to instructors, and encourage leaders to pursue new, related avenues of research. The benefits of lab-centric instruction should be extensible to lab instruction in other science and engineering disciplines, encouraging collaboration and cross-fertilization between community members and educators in these outside disciplines.\r\n\r\n",
