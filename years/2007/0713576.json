 "awd_abstract_narration": "Query Evaluation and View Materialization in Probabilistic Data\r\nPI:  Dan Suciu (U. Washington)\r\nAward:  IIS-0713576\r\n\r\n\r\nDatabases and data management tools have a deterministic semantics: a data item \r\neither is in the data set or is not.  But when data comes from multiple sources,\r\nor is extracted automatically, it often contains a variety of imprecisions that\r\nare difficult to model using the standard deterministic semantics: the same \r\ndata item may have different representations in different sources \r\nand matching algorithms are imprecise; schemas differ across sources and \r\nschema matching tools are imprecise or incomplete or both; data at different \r\nsources may hold contradictory information; finally, some data, such as sensor \r\ndata, is inherently probabilistic and hence imprecise.  This project represents \r\nall sources of imprecision in a single uniform way, as data with a probabilistic\r\nsemantics, and extends today''s data management tools to manage efficiently \r\ndata with probabilistic semantics.\r\n\r\nRe-designing databases to handle probabilistic data is a daunting task.\r\nThis project studies two problems that lie at the core of probabilistic \r\ndata management: the complexity of the query evaluation problem on \r\nprobabilistic databases, and the view materialization problem \r\n(deciding whether a view can be materialized and whether it can be \r\nused in other query plans). The results of this research will consists \r\nof a range of fundamental techniques to be used in a general purpose \r\nprobabilistic query processor.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits. The project makes new contributions that lie \r\nat the intersection of several disparate fields: logic, probability theory, \r\nknowledge representation, and traditional query processing and optimization.  \r\nThe project enhances the understanding of the query evaluation problem on \r\nprobabilistic data, develops new algorithms for efficiently evaluating \r\nsuch queries and for materializing views, while leveraging existing database \r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact. Searching large information spaces (the Web; large collections\r\nof scientific databases; Homeland Security data) is one the new and most \r\nchallenging frontiers in Computer Science.  The innovation that is needed \r\nto support complex searches that scale to large and heterogeneous \r\ninformation spaces, has to come from the data management research community.  \r\nThis project makes contributions to broaden our ability to search large \r\ninformation spaces.  If successful, the project will be one of the pieces\r\nthat will help data management technology undergo a new paradigm shift, \r\nfrom supporting complex queries with deterministic semantics,\r\nto supporting complex explorations with probabilistic semantics.\r\n\r\nProject URL:\r\nhttp://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/suciu/project-probD",
