 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Division of Chemistry award supports the renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Wellesley College for the summers of 2007-2009. Program director Christopher Arumainayagam will be assisted by co-PI David Haines in the ten-week program.  Ten students will do research with a diverse group of faculty in the chemistry, physics, and geosciences departments on an array of chemistry-focused projects in a collaborative and multidisciplinary environment.  Students impacted include rising sophomores and juniors, students from underrepresented groups, and students from institutions with limited research opportunities.  In addition, two local high school seniors will be invited to do part-time research during the summer.  All REU students will participate in a weekly seminar program, panels on career opportunities and graduate schools, and workshops in public speaking, scientific writing, and ethics.  Speakers and panelists will draw heavily from Wellesley alumnae to provide accessible and easily identifiable role models of successful scientists and citizens.  Each student will give two public presentations of her research during the summer, the first as an oral presentation of work in progress, and the second as a poster in an all-college poster session. Students also will be encouraged to present their research at national and regional conferences.",
