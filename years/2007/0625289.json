 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fort Valley State University (FVSU) will strengthen the undergraduate recruitment and retention activities in the STEM disciplines with a second five-year HBCU-UP Implementation Project.  This project will advance the mission of the University by providing high quality STEM degree programs that increase the participation of individuals from minority groups in STEM. The expected project outcomes include: 1) increased STEM graduation; 2) increased faculty participation in research, publications, and grants writing; 3) enhanced quality of undergraduate research experiences; 4) strengthened partnerships with academic institutions and private companies; 5) increased use of technology in teaching and research in all STEM disciplines; and 6) increased numbers of STEM students completing the path from high school through college to graduate school.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project consists of a comprehensive set of activities which will strengthen the overall STEM curricula at FVSU. The development of research infrastructure and partnerships with other institutions and private companies will have an impact on the academic and research programs at FVSU beyond the project period. This project will develop a model for interdisciplinary collaborations in research and curriculum particularly suitable for small teaching institutions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The project will produce better prepared, competitive, students for the STEM workforce and establish a pipeline of students into graduate and professional programs. This program will serve as a recruitment and retention tool for the institution and enable FVSU to gain visibility as a student-centered institution that provides opportunities for undergraduate student research. The NSF REU-Site in biotechnology and Collaborative Summer Internship with major institute programs in STEM at FVSU can serve as a model for other minority serving institutions seeking to promote undergraduate mentoring and research programs in STEM.  Through cross-disciplinary links and links to larger universities and laboratories, FVSU will create an exemplary program that will provide sustainable research experiences for students and a fulfilling research environment for faculty.",
