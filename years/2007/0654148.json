 "awd_abstract_narration": "The experimental research program continues experiments examining the collective behavior of a novel atomic gas: a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of Rb-87.  This work is at the crossover between condensed-matter physics and ultracold atomic physics.  This \"crossover\" region is  a rewarding area to study strongly correlated systems that are far from equilibrium.  The environment of ultracold atoms provides an exceptional tool to study dynamics with minimal coupling to a dissipative thermal environment that plagues conventional solid or liquid systems. The general theme of the project is to study the role of thermal or quantum fluctuations in determining the nature of the dynamics at the transitions.  Of particular interest are the dynamics at quantum phase transitions, at which correlations proliferate, dominate the behavior of the system, and rapidly change its character. The research will shed light on the thermal properties of spinor gases. In particular, the project will characterize quantum dynamics and topological defect formation at a quantum phase transition which connects quantitatively to scaling behavior and critical exponents, directly observe spin vortices in a two-dimensional Bose gas in which the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism of vortex/antivortex generation and pairing should occur, and achieve spatially-resolved spin squeezing in a spinor BEC. \r\n\r\nOne of the broader impacts of this work is to use the magnetization-sensitive imaging technique developed to make precision measurements of magnetic fields over small areas, which could have both scientific and technological applications.  Further, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows will be trained in ultracold atom research.   The program also includes a component extending developments from modern ultracold atomic physics to undergraduate education by developing experiments for undergraduate teaching laboratories.\r\n",

In fact, these gaseous materials are, as far as we know, the coldest matter in the Universe.  The motivation to produce such low temperatures is to test the principles of physics at the physical frontiers, with the potential for discovering new concepts regarding how materials can behave.\n\nWith support from the NSF, we explored the properties of a new type of material, a magnetic superfluid comprised of cold rubidium atoms trapped within a laser trap.  We asked how an isolated system becomes spontaneously ordered, what role quantum mechanics plays in such dynamics, what types of order are selected by the system under different external influences, and how long it takes for such order to develop.\n\nWe found that an isolated quantum system makes random choices in selecting, for example, the direction of its magnetization.  The dynamics of such ordering involve the amplification of noise that is initially present in the system.  We learned how to harness such amplification, a capability that may be useful in future detectors.  We observed that this particular system takes a very long time to become ordered -- several seconds -- and that ordering occurs only if the system's properties are fine tuned.\n\nOur work has generated new insights on the dynamics of systems that are driven far from equilibrium.
