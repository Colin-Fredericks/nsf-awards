 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PAlmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) is designed to exploit the large and \r\nincreasing concentration of people working in number theory and number theoretic \r\napplications located in the Southeast. The primary goals include the  fostering \r\nof collaboration and education rather than dissemination of new results. The \r\nmeetings will provide graduate students exposure to recent research with a \r\nminimum of costs.  The location of the meeting will rotate among Clemson \r\nUniversity, University of South Carolina and the College of Charleston.  \r\nThe regular meetings will foster a strong regional culture of research in pure \r\nnumber theory as well as its applications. The creation of PANTS is especially \r\ntimely as there is more and more interplay between pure number theory and \r\napplications.  For instance, low-discrepancy sequences created from function \r\nfields are used by financial institutions; higher dimensional abelian varieties \r\nare being considered in cryptography to guarantee privacy of digital \r\ncommunications; and understanding modular towers is now very important \r\nin the construction of the best sequences of error-correcting codes.  \r\nThis mixture of very theoretical mathematics with applications is uniquely \r\nwell-represented at the PANTS core institutions, and we intend to capitalize \r\non this. The conferences will host many of the major names in the field. \r\nBecause of its relatively central location in the Southeast, the series will \r\nattract students and faculty from several states, who would not otherwise be \r\nable to attend larger more costly conferences. In addition, the organizers will \r\nstrive for a demographically diverse group of speakers  and participants, \r\nincluding women and those from other underrepresented groups.",
