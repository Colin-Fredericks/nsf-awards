Galloway\r\n\r\nThis proposal is concerned with research projects at the\r\ninterface of spacetime geometry and general relativity.  In\r\nparticular, properties of marginally trapped surfaces, which have\r\nplayed an important role in theory of black holes, will be\r\ninvestigated.  Although physically well motivated, very few\r\nrigorous results about marginally trapped surfaces, and\r\nassociated objects, such as dynamical horizons, had been known\r\ntil recently.  This situation has changed, and there are now\r\nrigorous results concerning existence, uniqueness, and other\r\nissues. Motivating this study in part is the realization of a\r\ndeeper connection between marginally trapped surfaces in\r\nspacetime and minimal surfaces in Riemannian manifolds.  The PI\r\nwill conduct research on a number of topics pertaining to\r\nmarginally trapped surfaces, such as the topology of black holes,\r\nrigidity and regularity of outermost marginally trapped surfaces,\r\nand aspects of dynamical horizons. String theory has increased\r\ninterest in gravity in higher dimensions, and, in particular,\r\nthere has been a great deal of recent research concerning black\r\nholes in higher dimensional spacetimes. Schoen and the PI\r\nrecently obtained a generalization to higher dimensions of a\r\nclassical result of Hawking concerning the topology of black\r\nholes. One part of the present proposal, involving joint work\r\nwith Schoen, concerns an effort to obtain an important\r\nstrengthening of this result, which would close a gap in the\r\nconclusion concerning allowed topologies. This circle of ideas\r\nshould also be useful in obtaining lower entropy bounds for\r\nhigher dimensional stationary black holes in the asymptotically\r\nAdS setting that extend known results in four dimensions. The PI\r\nwill also conduct research on a continuing project with Andersson\r\nand Cai concerning the positivity of mass for asymptotically\r\nhyperbolic manifolds, and research pertaining to a problem of\r\nPenrose concerning the classical stability of string theory.\r\n\r\nModern theories of gravity are geometrical in nature. The\r\ngravitational field and other fields, black holes and related\r\nobjects, may be described and analyzed using geometric\r\nmethods. In more general terms, this project is concerned with\r\nthe study of certain features of gravity of current scientific\r\ninterest from this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools\r\nof Riemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and\r\nLorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime. These\r\ntheories provide a method for studying the relationship among\r\nthree fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature\r\n(i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the\r\nglobal shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal\r\nstructure structure (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays\r\nand light cones).\r\n",
