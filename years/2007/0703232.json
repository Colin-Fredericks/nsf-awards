The conference will run for five days. The subject will be Several Complex Variables and Complex Geometry.  The funds will be used primarily in supporting women, young mathematicians, and members of underrepresented groups.  In addition, a good deal of the conference activities will focus on vertical integration.  The subject of several complex variables and complex geometry is now at a new plateau of maturity and continued development. It is important to take this opportunity to assess recent developments and to chart the course for future work.\r\nThis conference is designed to be in the workshop style. Its objective is to chart new directions in the field and to foster new collaborations. The intellectual impact will thereby be considerable, and will last far beyond the one-week duration of the conference. As a result of these considerations, the impact of this event will also be broad and lasting. One of goals is to integrate young mathematicians and mathematicians from underrepresented groups into the working infrastructure of the profession. By putting them into contact with mature and experienced scholars, and exposing them to current research problems, one can help to jumpstart their careers and give them something of lasting value to take with them. \r\n\r\n",
