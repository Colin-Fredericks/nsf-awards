Sabry Abdel-Mottaleb of the Photoenergy Center and the Department of Chemistry at Ain Shams University (ASU) in Cairo, Egypt.  They plan to study the Alignment of TiO2 nanoparticles in polymer films, the nanowiring effect, and the potential for producing efficient hybrid solar cells. The research purpose is to understand the effectiveness of various methods for aligning TiO2 nanoparticles in blended polymer/TiO2 composite films. Alignment of TiO2 particles in polymer films will be carried out using electric fields, magnetic fields, and ionic self-assembly. To determine the effectiveness of the various alignment techniques, the film properties will be tested in a variety of ways including light and dark conductance, photoluminescence quenching, UV/Vis/NIR Spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, Lifetime-time resolved spectroscopy, and electrochemical testing as well as surface characterization by microscopic methods. Solar cells made from the films will be tested for internal quantum efficiency and overall power conversion efficiency.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Polymer-based solar cells must achieve power conversion efficiencies of 10% to 20% in order to compete with more traditional forms of power generation. To date, the efficiency of these devices has been limited due to low photocurrents that result in part from poor charge transport. This research aims at better understanding of charge transport in organic opto-electronic devices. It is expected that alignment of the TiO2 needles will enhance electron transport in the films (by creating nanowiring or channels) leading to increased efficiencies for hybrid solar cells and other opto-electronic devices. This project will determine the best methods of achieving the alignment.\r\nBroader impact: Improved understanding of charge transport in polymer photovoltaics should lead to the fabrication of low-cost, more efficient solar cells needed for sustainable developments.  Successful development of high efficiency solar cells would also reduce the environmental impact of energy production. In addition to device-integrated solar cells, the technology developed through this program is expected to have a wide range of applications including organic display and LED technology. Through the exchange of scientists and the sharing of facilities, the project will result in the transfer of scientific, technical, and research experience between the U.S. and Egypt in the strategically important field of clean energy generation. The knowledge gained will be disseminated in international journals. The PI will engage two post-doctorates in this project.  A number of graduate and undergraduate students working in his lab will benefit from investigating these systems, and this will enhance the training of the next generation of engineers. \r\n\r\nThis project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
