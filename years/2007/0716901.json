The consequences of increased production of conventional feedstock and next-generation feedstock will be examined for the nation's water supply and quality.  The issues affecting water and land resources, which are intimately connected to water, will be considered from several angles, including the scientific, technological, and policy opportunities and challenges.  The approach to consider the system as comprehensively as possible will help prevent unintended consequences of the ramp-up of biofuels production in the US in terms of water and land resources.  The colloquium will be organized by a steering committee of experts in hydrology, water quality, agricultural and environmental engineering, water economics and policy, and biofuels.  The results from the colloquium will be distributed to a wide audience through a report, brochure, and web site.  The results will inform the policy related to water and land resources in biofuels production. \r\n\r\n",
