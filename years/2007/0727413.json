 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores a new approach for creating high-strength porous coatings by exploiting atomic shadowing effects during physical vapor deposition. The key idea is to employ simultaneous directional deposition from multiple sources to build nanorod arrays, and to sequentially vary the deposition angles to cause interlinking by controlled rod-branching and rod merging, producing three-dimensional interconnected nanorod networks. The proposed approach builds on a recently developed simultaneous opposite glancing angle deposition (SO-GLAD) technique which utilizes local atomic shadowing effects during line-of-sight deposition to create unique self-organized multi-component nanostructure arrays. Nanorod networks will be deposited in a dedicated ultra-high vacuum sputter deposition system. In parallel, the growth will be simulated using a combination of ab initio, molecular dynamics, and lattice Monte Carlo approaches.\r\nThis research will lead to the basic scientific understanding, both in experiment and theory, of a new approach to create nanostructured coatings. The new approach will be applicable to a wide range of materials systems, ranging from ductile metals to corrosion-resistant ceramics, with potential applications as radiation-resistant coatings in future nuclear fusion and fission reactors, as porous conductive catalyst support structures for fuel-cells, and as active nanostructures for pressure sensors in nanorobots and artificial skins. An integral educational component of the project focuses on graduate student training in nanoscience and technology, and explores the introduction of nanomanufacturing concepts in an undergraduate course. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
