 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pacific Science Center (WA), in collaboration with Explora (NM), the North Museum of Natural History and Science (PA) and the Institute for Learning Innovation (MD), will develop, implement, research and evaluate a delivery model for effectively communicating current science to the public at informal science education organizations.  Project deliverables will include cost-effective delivery mechanisms, development and testing of professional development workshops for scientists, in-depth research into the factors affecting implementation of the model and a guide to implementation of the model workshops.\r\n\r\nThe project will reach museum professionals at 28 institutions, 275 scientists and 25,000 visitors over three years.  It has significant potential for long-term impact on science museums across the nation based on the development, testing and dessemination of a flexible educational program approach that involves partnering with practicing scientists and engineers in their communities.  In so doing, it will enhance their capacities to communicate current science and technology to their audiences.",
