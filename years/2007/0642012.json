 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of the digestive system involves transformation of an initially straight tube into an elaborately looped and rotated structure. Mechanisms underlying these topological transformations are unknown, yet they are vital for the three-dimensional (3D) form of individual digestive organs and the proper physiology of the digestive system. Dr. Nascone-Yoder has utilized embryos of the frog, Xenopus laevis, and the fish, Danio rerio, to investigate the mechanisms underlying these critical morphogenetic events. In a screen to identify small molecules that alter gut morphogenesis Dr. Nascone-Yoder's laboratory discovered that retinoic acid (RA) induced defects in normal gut looping, elongation and rotation. She will test the hypothesis that RA signaling shapes digestive anatomy by modulating cell adhesion, polarity and rearrangements in the gut tube. The multi-species focus of this research will enable identification of evolutionarily conserved signaling molecules involved in digestive organ morphogenesis and will provide insight into the potential effects of toxins and/or chemical cues on the phenotypic plasticity of digestive organs. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in gut morphogenesis will provide parameters that can be used to guide the engineering and repair of organs from individual cells.  Dr. Nascone-Yoder has a strong record of including undergraduates in her research and will continue to recruit students from diverse backgrounds into her laboratory.",
