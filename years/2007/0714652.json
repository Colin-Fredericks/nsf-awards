 "awd_abstract_narration": "This International Symposium on the Reactivity of Solids will be held at the University of Minnesota in June 2007. The last meeting in the U.S. was in 1988 at Princeton, NJ. It was also supported by the National Science Foundation. The International Symposium on the Reactivity of Solids (ISRS) is an interdisciplinary professional group dedicated to the promotion of interdisciplinary research on materials properties and performance with a particular emphasis on how the reactivity effects the synthesis, properties and performance of the material. The symposium encourages interactions among researchers in universities, government laboratories, and industrial laboratories. It will bring together chemists, geologists, physicists and materials scientists to discuss the leading scientific issues relating to inorganic materials.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nA particular purpose of this proposal is to encourage the participation of underrepresented groups and junior scientists just beginning their careers, so that they can interact with the leaders in their field. The results of the meeting will be disseminated by publication in the Journal of Materials Science, thus reaching the largest possible audience.\r\n",
