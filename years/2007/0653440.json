 "awd_abstract_narration": "The James Madison University Particle and Nuclear Physics Group (JMU-PNP) consisting of three faculty and a group of undergraduate students, conducts research in Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics at Jefferson Lab (JLab), at Fermi National Lab (Fermilab), and at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). Members of the JMU-PNP group conduct research designed to explore the rich structure of the nucleons, protons and neutrons, which are the basic building blocks of the atomic nucleus. While it is widely held that nucleons are built out of three quarks (viewed as fundamental particles) in constant interaction via gluon exchange, a complete picture of the mechanisms that give rise and govern the evolution of multi-quark systems (protons, neutrons, nuclei) is not yet available. Our group participates in studies that hope to clarify this picture by charting the structure of nucleons and nuclei using leptons (electrons, muons, neutrinos) as probes.  Our group is also involved in measuring the muon lifetime which can be used to extract the Fermi coupling constant which determines the strength of one of the four fundamental forces, the weak force.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the JMU-PNP group is to integrate important contributions to top notch research with an outstanding educational experience for promising undergraduate students.  The group members are actively involved in ongoing research in both Hall B and Hall C at JLab (detector design and testing, data taking, data analysis). In addition, the group is planning experiments and pursuing detector improvements as part of the planned 12 GeV upgrade in accelerator energy for JLab. The group is also a key collaborator in the MULAN experiment (Muon Lifetime Experiment), underway at PSI, and in the Minerva experiment (Neutrino-Nucleus Interactions) at Fermilab. \r\n",
