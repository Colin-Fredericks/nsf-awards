 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant genus Dombeya, of the Chocolate Family, is a striking example of the megadiversity of Madagascar, with 180 of its 210 species found only on this unique island.  Although the genus is ubiquitous throughout Madagascar, most species of Dombeya are poorly understood and have been taxonomically neglected.  This project aims to ameliorate this neglect by accomplishing two objectives: 1) complete a molecular phylogeny, a hypothesis of evolutionary relationships based on the study of DNA, for the entire genus, and 2) produce a taxonomic revision of section Astrapaea, a well-defined group within Dombeya.\r\n\r\nIn developing countries, like Madagascar, widespread poverty compels unsustainable land use making immediate conservation action imperative. Yet, successful conservation and biodiversity management efforts require a sound taxonomic foundation, which is often lacking for tropical taxa.  This study of section Astrapaea begins taxonomic work on Dombeya and the genus-wide phylogeny creates a framework for future taxonomic revision of the remainder of this dauntingly large genus, a significant goal considering Dombeya makes up 2% of the Malagasy flora.  The project's concurrent creation of an online database of the Dombeya of Madagascar ensures dissemination of results to those most in need of them: researchers working on the ground in Madagascar.\r\n",
