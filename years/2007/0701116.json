 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the modular representation theory and\r\ncohomology of finite groups of Lie type. A major thrust involves the\r\ndefining characteristic theory, in which the underlying module is\r\ntaken over a field having the \"same\" characteristic as the group.\r\nThe cross-characteristic theory is another theme; here, the\r\ncharacteristic of the module differs from that of the group. In both\r\ncases, the (already known) representations of continuous Lie groups provide a starting point for representations. This is most apparent in the defining\r\ncharacterstic case, where an ambient algebraic group is available.\r\nIn cross characteristic, quantum groups plays a similar role, but,\r\nso far, only for the finite general linear groups. The major\r\nunsolved problems involve classifying the irreducible modules,\r\ndetermining their dimensions and characters, and understanding their\r\nhomological properties. Issues involving Weyl groups (and Hecke\r\nalgebras), finite dimensional algebras (e.g., endomorphism and\r\nquasi-hereditary algebras), the geometric theory of perverse\r\nsheaves, etc. arise naturally in many attacks on these problems.\r\nParshall and Scott have developed and contributed to many of the\r\nvarious approaches, and the current project will continue in that\r\ndirection, but also apply new (and deep results), such as the recent\r\nsolution of the Broue conjecture for symmetric groups (by Chuang and\r\nRouquier). For example, the authors will combine this work with\r\ntheir own recent work relating Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial character\r\nformulas for representations of the special linear groups in the defining characteristic to the representations of symmetric groups.\r\n\r\nThe groups and representations studied here comprise the most\r\nimportant basic ingredients for creating a general theory of all\r\nfinite group representations, Over the past century, similar\r\ntheories for continuous groups played a large role in quantum theory\r\nand the theory of elementary particles. Their finite analogs have\r\nalready proved valuable in the design of communications and data\r\nstorage devices, though this finite theory remains very incomplete. In the future, one expects that the finite discrete worlds of computers and\r\ncommunications will become even more important. The task of creating\r\na viable general theory of finite group representations--the\r\ninvestigators' long-term goal--is, thus, a central problem\r\nfor the future. Finally, graduate and undergraduate students will\r\nbe fully involved in the project.",
