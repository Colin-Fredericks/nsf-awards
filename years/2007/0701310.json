 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT for award DMS-0701310 of Mantovan\r\n \r\nBeginning in 1967 Langlands suggested an intricate web of\r\nfar-reaching conjectures connecting the theories of automorphic\r\nforms and Galois representations. He also predicted some of these\r\ncorrespondences to be encoded in the cohomology groups of Shimura\r\nvarieties and their local models. The proposed research pursues the\r\nstudy of the geometric implications of these conjectures, focusing\r\non two key features: the compatibility between global and local\r\nconjectures and the functoriality principle. The PI aims to enlarge\r\nthe class of Shimura varieties whose local behavior at unramified\r\nprimes is well understood by eliminating two common restrictive\r\nhypotheses: the assumption of properness and the restriction to the\r\nsubclass of Shimura varieties of P.E.L. type. In the first case, the\r\nPI proposes to develop the integral theory of arithmetical\r\ncompactifications for Shimura varieties, following the works of\r\nFaltings-Chai and Pink. In the second case, she plans to study the\r\nbad reduction of Shimura varieties of Hodge type, following the\r\nstrategy of Rapoport-Zink.\r\n \r\nThe Langlands program proposes the existence of a relation between\r\nseemingly unrelated objects in number theory and harmonic analysis.\r\nA Galois group is the collection of all symmetries existing among\r\nthe roots of a given polynomial in one variable and a Galois\r\nrepresentation is the realization of such symmetries as matrices. On\r\nthe other hand, automorphic forms are complex functions possessing\r\nmany self-similarities. A connection between the two theories as it\r\nis proposed by the Langlands program would provide an incredibly\r\npowerful mathematical tool translating theorems of harmonic analysis\r\ninto theorems about algebra, and vice versa. In some cases, it is\r\nexpected such a correspondence to be encoded in the geometry of\r\ncertain algebraic objects: the Shimura varieties and their local\r\nmodels. This project aims to shed some light on how the geometry of\r\nthese spaces could reflect some of the deepest aspects of the\r\nLanglands' conjectures.\r\n\r\n",
