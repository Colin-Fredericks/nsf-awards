 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61). This project is developing instructional modules at the undergraduate level that focus on mathematical modeling in the behavioral sciences. These modules cover such topics as mating strategies, contests, habitat selection, foraging, cooperation and conflict, and communication. The focus is on well-understood models of animal behavior, with students encouraged to extend the models to human behavior, politics, and economics. Modules can be used together in behavior courses or singly in introductory biology, ecology, evolution, sociology, or psychology courses. A secondary aspect of the project is enhancement of mathematics classes by introducing behavioral applications. Each module actively engages the student in developing a model. After watching video of a behavior that illustrates a question, a student identifies the relevant variables, formulates a model, translates it to mathematical form, makes predictions based on the model, tests those predictions with a graphical simulation, and designs real-world experiments that would test the model. These exercises give students experience with probability, game theory, and optimization methods. A manual for instructors suggests ways to incorporate the material into a variety of courses and indicates areas that students may explore further on their own. This material is being tested at a diverse group of colleges and universities. Evaluation includes comparative tests (lecture-only vs. module) and longer-term tests of retention and transfer of knowledge. Dissemination of the material through national meetings, educational publications, and distribution by a textbook publisher is broadening the impact of the project and increasing the exposure of undergraduates nationwide to mathematical modeling of behavior.",
