The site has three main components:  (1) A 10-week summer research opportunity for 12 students per year to work at a KNAC institution, (2) A fall Student Symposium attended by KNAC faculty and about 80 students, where each KNAC supported student gives a 10-minute research talk, as well as other students from their institutions, and guests. There is also a poster paper session for students who cannot give talks due to time constraints, (3) Publication of the Proceedings of the Undergraduate Research Symposium, for which each presenting student will contribute a four-page research paper. \r\n\r\nTo date, approximately half of KNAC students go on to graduate school and most are pursuing science-oriented careers.  KNAC serves as a model for other small college astronomy departments of how a regional consortium can successfully address issues of size.\r\n\r\nThe site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
