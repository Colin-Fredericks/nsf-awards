 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation is supporting four US-based researchers to participate in a workshop on language production that is being coordinated by the European Science Foundation.  The objective of the workshop is to facilitate the interdisciplinary investigation of bilingualism and multilingualism, including spoken languages as well as signed languages. The workshop brings together behavioral, neuroscientific and computational approaches to provide the context for breakthroughs in our understanding of language and cognition and their relation to brain activity in multilinguals that are beyond the reach of the individual disciplines. The workshop aims to advance our understanding of: 1) How individuals can learn, produce and understand two, three or even more languages; 2) whether bilinguals, and in particular multilinguals learn and use their languages in ways that are similar or different to the ways in which monolinguals learn and use their native language; and 3) whether the brain networks engaged in processing one language are sufficient to support the processing of two and more languages. \r\n",
