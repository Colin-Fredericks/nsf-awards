 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dramatic increase in the availability of data from various sources is creating many fundamental challenges in computing, storage, communication, and human computer interaction issues for data mining. Scientists, engineers, and businesses are faced with problems that involve understanding complex networked observations, massive simulation data sets, and ubiquitous sensory data streams. These heterogeneous data sources should be linked and analyzed for discovering the next frontiers of science, arts, and technology. We also need to look beyond the current cyber-infrastructure and explore how the next generation of networked data mining applications will support such large-scale, ubiquitous, multi-source, and data intensive domains. \r\n\r\nThis workshop on Next Generation Data Mining and Cyber Enabled Discovery for Innovation (NGDM-07) brings together data mining researchers, scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds along with domain experts for various emerging problems that are relevant to Cyber Enabled Discovery for Innovation (CDI). NGDM-07 focuses on the areas of: data mining in sciences, engineering and digital humanities; data mining for security and surveillance with information privacy and security considerations; multimedia data mining; pervasive computing and ubiquitous data mining; and the web, semantics, and data mining. \r\n\r\nThe interdisciplinary nature of the workshop provides a forum for the participants to cooperatively analyze the state of the art in data mining and its role in CDI and formulate new data mining research directions, and outline development or infrastructure issues and activities that are fundamental in supporting CDI challenges. The workshop participants will also discuss fruitful collaborative and synergistic activities that will foster creation of CDI environments.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will generate a report detailing future directions of data mining research and will suggest promising modalities of research with an aim to foster innovation and technology transfer. The workshop website (http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~hillol/NGDM07/) also includes links to other relevant material.",
