 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an international collaborative program supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering.  The collaborating principal investigators, V. Sharma of the Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, Florida (FIT) and K. Bouzek, of the Institute of Chemical Technology, Prague seek to understand the mechanism of the electrochemical synthetic route of sodium and potassium ferrate(VI) (Na2FeO4 and K2FeO4).  The current efficiency of the electrolytic ferrate(VI) synthesis in highly alkaline solutions using an anode material with  high silicon content is comparable with an anode made of carbidic cast iron near room temperature.  However, significant differences in reaction efficiency are observed at slightly higher temperatures.  This research program seeks to reveal the mechanism of the processes occurring at the surfaces of these two anode materials.  Classical electrochemical and electroanalytical techniques will be utilized to perform experiments at different temperatures, and the solubility of ferrate(VI) in alkaline mixtures will be measured. One practical goal is to enhance the formation of solid ferrate(VI) in electrochemical solution mixtures.  \r\n\r\nThe ferrate(VI) can be used as an environmentally friendly oxidant, disinfectant, and coagulant for treatment of emerging pollutants and toxins in aquatic systems.  Other potential applications include industrial \"green\" processes for synthesizing environmentally more benign products.  This international collaboration will facilitate scientific and educational interaction between US and Czech Republic research groups. A graduate student from the Bouzek group in Prague will visit the Sharma group at FIT to gain experience with the chemical synthesis of ferrate compounds. Also, a US graduate student from the Sharma group will visit the collaborating laboratory in Prague to learn key electrochemical techniques, gain invaluable international experience. The FIT program will also involve at least one undergraduate researcher.\r\n",
