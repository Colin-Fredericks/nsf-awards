Luecke\r\n\r\nThis RTG proposal is focused on training in low-dimensional\r\ntopology and its applications.  The study of low-dimensional\r\nmanifolds has become one of the central areas of research\r\nactivity in mathematics.  The PI's have an established\r\ntrack-record of research accomplishments in several different\r\nareas of low-dimensional topology; for example knot theory, 3 and\r\n4-manifold topology, hyperbolic manifolds and symplectic\r\ntopology.  The project will also allow the PI's to continue their\r\ntraining of postdocs and students. The subject of this RTG\r\nProposal interacts with several other branches of mathematics as\r\nwell as the applied sciences.  It therefore provides fertile\r\nground for research, education and training experiences at all\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\nOne of the main features of the proposal is to build, and\r\nelevate, the successful structure for training and education\r\ncurrently in place in the Department of Mathematics. However, an\r\nimportant new component of our proposal is training for\r\ninterdisciplinary research.  This will afford postdocs, graduate\r\nand undergraduate students educational and training experiences\r\ndifferent from the traditional ones available at present.  We\r\ntherefore aim to provide a framework that supports education and\r\ntraining by instruction in the traditional sense, and also\r\nprovide opportunity for training experiences in applications of\r\ntopology in the physical and biological sciences. As part of this\r\nlatter effort the project will promote interactions with\r\nscientists studying knotting phenomena in DNA and biomedical\r\nmathematics.  As part of our outreach efforts, we will instigate\r\na public lecture series that will raise the profile and level of\r\nawareness of the role of topology in other sciences in the\r\nUniversity and local community.\r\n",
