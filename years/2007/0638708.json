The main goals of this project are: 1) to enhance Fellows' communication skills, 2) to strengthen teachers' content knowledge, and 3) to improve science and math achievement in middle grades. These goals drive all training, implementation, and assessment efforts. Fellows and teachers participate in training activities that promote inquiry- and standards-based teaching, especially as they relate to raising the achievement of students with Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD). Fellows bring their content knowledge and research experiences to the classroom, enhancing instruction and piquing students' interest in science and math. The intellectual merits of this project are related to its inquiry-based and interdisciplinary structure. Fellows and teachers participate in workshops that promote child-centered instruction using NSF-funded materials such as Developing Mathematical Ideas; the Connected Mathematics Project; and Full Option Science System. Fellows and teachers, guided by Research Advisors and project personnel, design and deliver interdisciplinary units based on annual themes such as Earth History, Planetary Science, Populations and Ecosystems, or Chemical Interactions. These units engage students in field experiences, promote scientific processes, and make connections to cutting-edge research. Fellows and teachers have opportunities to engage in research and educational endeavors at international institutions, further enhancing middle grades students' understanding of research. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe GK12 Fellows in the Middle project at Montclair State University in New Jersey involved 32 teachers, 24 graduate students, and over 1200 middle school students over its five-year partnership with five local school districts. The GK12 Fellowship allowed science and mathematics masters students to pursue their research under the guidance of research advisors at the university while interacting with middle school students as a part of their fellowship responsibilities.   Math-science pairs of research graduate students collaborated with math-science pairs of middle school teachers to co-develop and co-teach interdisciplinary lessons.  Through this structure, graduate students were able to refine their communication and teamwork skills while infusing the middle school curriculum with inquiry- and research-based lessons, and teachers were exposed to current research in science and mathematics.  In addition to the Fellows, teachers, and middle school students, the program involved educators, researchers, and administrators in roles such as research advisors to the Fellows, school district liaisons, project researchers, and external evaluators.\n\n \n\nFellows worked as resident scientists in the schools for two days each week.  They led discussions and explorations, engaged students in laboratory activities, and prepared students for field trip experiences.  Other project activities included a pedagogy-focused Summer Institute and monthly workshops for Fellows and teachers, fieldtrips based on annual interdisciplinary themes for middle school students, and an annual culminating math/science day for all participants.  Through supplemental funding, some Fellows, teachers, and faculty members participated in an international component.  This experience, in different years, entailed visits and exchanges with university and K12 colleagues and scientists in China, Panama, and Ecuador.  The aim of the international component was for Fellows and teachers to engage in activities that highlight the importance of international collaborations and cross-cultural communication in science and mathematics. \n\n \n\nThe intellectual merits of this project were related to its resident scientist model as well as its inquiry-based and interdisciplinary structure.  The resident scientist model put the Fellows in the position of scientists engaging the public (the students) in discussions and explorations of scientific issues.  This experience provided them with a safe environment in which to refine their communication skills and think deeply about what it means to communicate science.  For the middle school students, their interactions with a resident scientist enhanced their understanding of science; they also came to see the resident scientists as role models and mentors. \n\n \n\nThis university-school district partnership is a new model for K12 science and mathematics education, professional development of teachers, and preparation of graduate students to be leaders in STEM.  The interdisciplinary teamwork between mathematics and science teachers, and between Fellows and teachers enabled deep exploration of math-science connections in the curriculum.  Also, because the Fellows were able to offer their specialized knowledge of their fields, the teams were able to design lessons with current themes, adapting graduate school content to middle school students.  In addition to presentations of these original lessons by Fellows, teachers, and project staff at conferences and workshops, the lessons will be shared through a resource book for middle school teachers. \n\n \n\nProgram evaluations showcased the broader impacts of this project.  Data were collected through various means including interviews of teachers and Fellows, focus group interviews of middle school students, surveys, observations, and content knowledge assessments.  All participant groups benefited from the unique structure of the program.  Fellows, through their teamwork with each other and with mid..."
