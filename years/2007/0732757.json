The materials are designed to develop teachers' understanding of mathematics knowledge for teaching similarity. Module I, the foundation module, focuses on a thorough grounding of similarity and contains 6-8 video case sessions. The four extension modules offer options for further exploration:  (1) Definitions and Theorems; (2) The Role of Language in Geometry; (3) Choosing and Using Technological Tools; and (4) Bridging to High School Geometry. In total, 18-24 video cases are produced, which, taken together, form the curriculum of a 45 to 60-hour professional development course.",
