 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2007 UW Seattle Innovation Symposium is the third in a series launched in\r\n2005. The series seeks (1) to build and maintain a network of researchers who advance the body of knowledge on ?sustainable innovation,? and (2) to create artifacts such as case studies, published papers, and Educational TV programs to share research on sustainable innovation as widely as possible with other researchers, company innovators, and, through Public Television, the general public. The UW Seattle Innovation Symposium continues to build a critical\r\nmass of leading researchers (academics, artists, PhD students studying innovation, and company\r\ninnovators/entrepreneurs) to: (1) share intellectual assets and experiences that identify the innovations and innovation practices with potential to create new products and services, and (2) explore organizational structures and practices that will quickly create effective levels of ?sustainable innovation? in economics.  The ongoing symposium series will create a multi-disciplined network of academic and company innovators that can continue to work collaboratively on the myriad individual research projects required to extend our knowledge base on innovation, and shorten the time that it takes for innovations in particular companies to make their positive impact on the economy at large. SIS07 will also begin to move its attention outward from individual businesses to larger, global concerns. Situations like global warming and the coming end of extraction industries will require, not just ingenious stop-gaps\r\nbut complete reconceivings of fundamental aspects of society.  The multidisciplinary meeting engages senior researchers, corporate leaders and students to produce new insights.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
