 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global mainstream media characterizes offshore call centers as catalysts for social change in India. Yet, limited evidence exists of the call center industry contributing to a dramatic transformation of Indian society in terms of gender relations. Working the night shift (in order to service the 9 - 5 timescape of the American customer) is a key requirement of this industry. However, the nightscape is primarily an exclusive male domain that often represents danger for women.  In some cases, women who go out at night are associated with prostitution or questionable moral values. This doctoral dissertation study examines how the global demand for 24-hour workers is re-configuring the physical, temporal, social, and economic mobility of women because of the night shift requirement of call center employment. Initial findings have shown that call center employment expands some women's economic opportunities. At the same time, women continue to face higher levels of scrutiny when going out at night and this in turn impacts their mobility and access to public space. Another key concern is how households respond to changes in women's mobility. By investigating the variety of spaces occupied by women as a result of call center employment, this study will articulate how notions of gender are inscribed in the urban nightscape. Drawing from globalization discourse and feminist geography, the research questions are: 1) How does the global demand for night shift workers re-codify women's physical and temporal mobility? Temporal mobility refers to going out during the nighttime versus daytime; 2) What spatial and temporal barriers, as well as opportunities, do women face both in the household and urban public space?; 3) How does call center employment translate into social and economic mobility or immobility? This study will take place in two major cities, Mumbai and Bangalore, as well as smaller cities, such as Ahmadabad. Qualitative research methods, such as participant observation and structured/semi-structured interviews, are used and media accounts of the industry are also collected. The media accounts of the industry, in combination with participant observation and structured/semi-structured interviews, serve as the basis for uncovering how call center employment reshapes women's livelihoods. \r\n\r\nThe overwhelming growth of international linkages in the sphere of customer service marks a significant shift in global telecommunications and development. It is transforming the economy of cities in India. Fortune 500 companies, from IBM to Delta Airlines, are reliant on call centers and various data processing functions such as inputting medical transcripts and credit card applications/billing have been transferred to India. The offshore maintenance of confidential health and economic data along with the transportation information of a major U.S. airline brings forth new global security concerns such as cyber-terrorism. The opportunity to conduct fieldwork in India's call centers allows for an increased understanding of the growth and future direction of this relatively new industry. And by focusing on the global demand for night shift workers, this study will uncover how employment opportunities beyond the traditional 9 - 5 timescape reshape women's livelihoods both in the household and larger community. At the same time, this study will demonstrate how gendered norms of mobility and access to public space impact women's participation in the formal economy of a developing nation. This serves as a foundation for understanding the ways in which women are being integrated into the dominant, and arguably masculine, forces that are shaping the global economy. \r\n",
