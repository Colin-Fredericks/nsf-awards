 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13). This project uses the results of educational research to redesign experiments in the introductory electricity and magnetism (E & M) laboratory. Electromagnetic interactions and light play a central role in determining the structure of the physical world and are important in existing and emerging technologies. A basic understanding of E & M is necessary for science and engineering students and traditionally such students study this in the second half of the introductory physics course, the intellectual merit of this proposal includes new experiments that are based on a predict, observe, explain approach that asks students to first test hypotheses and predict the outcome of a particular experiment before making measurements. Computers with laboratory interfaces allow real-time recording and graphing of physical quantities. These two factors allow students to actively confront difficult concepts and resolve prior misconceptions about electricity, magnetism and optics resulting in significant improvement in the effectiveness of laboratory instruction. Effectiveness of the project is evaluated by student performance using standard instruments with additional input from student evaluations each semester. This allows comparison of student overall satisfaction and performance with a ten year data base of information from the existing laboratory. Broader impacts are shared with colleagues and the community.\r\n",
