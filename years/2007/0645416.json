This work will further \r\nour understanding of the distribution of types of planets and their host \r\nstars, the diversity of planet properties,constrain the formation mechanism \r\nof other planetary systems, and possibly shed light on the formation of our \r\nown solar system.\r\n\r\nDr. Agol will incorporate students from the University of Washington \r\nAstronomy Department's Pre-major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP) into this \r\nresearch program.  Pre-MAP is a program to attract and retain traditionally \r\nunderrepresented students to astronomy and science, technology, engineering, \r\nand math majors (STEM).  Dr. Agol will oversee the program, recruit students, \r\nand supervise student research as part of his role as the faculty director \r\nof the program.  Dr. Agol will also help in replicating this program in \r\nother STEM departments (at the University of Washington) and will expand the \r\nprogram to include community-college transfer students.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded by the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences",
