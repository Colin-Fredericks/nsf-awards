 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study new computational techniques with\r\napplications to inverse problems and image analysis. They will seek new\r\nmethods that combine variational arguments with ideas from computational\r\nharmonic analysis and partial differential equations in order to overcome\r\nlimitations of existing methods. The research will have three objectives:\r\npropose new models for cartoon and texture separation in images by working\r\nwith spaces of distributions; propose completely new techniques for\r\nmultiscale hierarchical decomposition of images; propose efficient\r\nalgorithms for solving inverse problems.\r\n\r\nFrom the proposed research and educational program, computational \r\nmathematics, image processing, as well as more general areas of science and\r\nengineering will benefit. Applications include image analysis, medical\r\nimaging, satellite imaging, material science, and terrain data analysis,\r\nsurveillance and inverse problems.\r\n",
