 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Keck Geology Consortium, comprising 18 primarily undergraduate institutions, will offer summer research experiences for approximately 48 undergraduates each of three years, building on 20 years of successful programming by the original 12 institutions.  Students will be recruited from the 18 schools, and 25 to 30% will come from non-Consortium institutions.  Summer research projects will be continued in the following academic year as independent study projects, with presentations at the culminating Keck Annual Research Symposium in the spring.  Students will publish short contributions in the annual proceedings volume and will be encouraged to present their work at regional and national disciplinary meetings.  The intellectual merit of the Keck Geology Consortium program includes the combined field and laboratory research experiences that will make meaningful scientific contributions in the areas of structural geology, paleontology and paleoecology, and paleoclimatology as well as igneous and metamorphic petrology, sedimentology and stratigraphy, and hydrogeology.  The yearlong Keck Consortium program impacts students' scientific and geoscience research skills; provides a robust scientific experience culminating in presentation of results at the annual research symposium and publication in the proceedings volume; and broadens participation of females and minority groups in summer research experiences.",
