 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teachers' Domain online professional development courses contain multimedia collections of science materials and resources developed by WGBH with support from National Science Foundation (NSF) during the last six years. Using an experimental design, this project will examine the effects of online professional development courses on high school biology teachers' content and pedagogical knowledge, and on their students' knowledge. The impact of using 'rich media' will also be tested. Hierarchal linear modeling techniques will be used to analyze the data.  This project will contribute to the knowledge base of what makes a difference in student achievement by testing the efficacy of online professional development for science teachers.  The issue of science teachers' content and pedagogical knowledge poses particular problems at the middle and high school level, where a large percentage of teachers are teaching outside their area of expertise. This project will contribute substantially by examining both the effect of professional development on high school biology teachers and the connection between professional development and student achievement. In examining the effectiveness of the Teachers' Domain professional development courses and materials on teachers and students for a diverse group of New York State school districts, it will be possible to understand how teachers can go beyond surface familiarity with basic concepts and textbook presentations and increase their pedagogical content knowledge.",

The findings from these studies hold implications for the design and dissemination of professional learning opportunities for K&ndash;12 teachers, in particular for science teachers using digital media tools in their instruction.\n\n \n\nThe online course, Teaching High School Biology, sought to improve teachers\u00c6 content knowledge, their pedagogical knowledge, and their knowledge of how to integrate digital media resources into their teaching. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the impact on teachers\u00c6 own knowledge of, and on their students\u00c6 understanding of, genetics and evolution, through participation in the course. The course was developed by WGBH\u00c6s Teachers\u00c6 Domain and delivered by PBS TeacherLine.\n\n \n\nIn addition to the main quantitative study, the project included a qualitative study that investigated teachers\u00c6 instructional practices and a supplemental study with school districts using a blended learning approach in their professional development offerings that provided information about potential models for integrating online learning resources.\n\n \n\nThe participants in the experimental study were 81 New York state high-school biology teachers and their students (a total of 2,532 9th and 10th graders).
