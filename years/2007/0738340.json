 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are proposing to organize an NSF sponsored Workshop at Rutgers University, New Jersey, July 31-Aug 1st, 2007. The theme will be wireless mobility. The past two decades have brought about a major shift from fixed to mobile phones all over the world. Mobile phones today outnumber fixed ones in most countries. The same shift from fixed to mobile has happened more recently in the access to the Internet from personal computing platforms,  laptops and PDAs. This trend is now bringing MANETs, once confined to battlefield, to urban and even domestic scenarios.\r\n\t\r\nThis proposal seeks NSF travel funding support in order to organize a Workshop where the critical research issues involving wireless mobility will be discussed. In particular, what is the impact of mobility on wireless applications; how can the Infrastructure help manage mobility; how can mobility be used to advantage (in routing, content discovery, connectivity management). How can we best test the new mobility trade offs with mobility testbeds? \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The workshop will bring together systems researchers active in various different domains and applications. Intellectual Merit: research on MANET mobility will lead to sophisticated analytic modeling and simulation techniques. \r\n",
