With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Bowyer and his undergraduate colleagues are investigating the reaction kinetics of the indium mediated allylation reaction carried out in aqueous solution.  Using photomicrography to follow the heterogeneous reaction, direct information about the mechanism and rate constants for the C-C coupling reaction under \"green\" chemistry conditions is obtained.  Undergraduate students are involved in all aspects of the research ranging from data collection and analysis to the presentation and publication of the results of the research. \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Bowyer and his undergraduate colleagues at Hobart and William Smith Colleges are examining the kinetics of the indium catalyzed carbon coupling reaction in aqueous media.  This green chemistry process is likely to have significant impact in the fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industry.  Using photomicrography, the heterogeneous reaction process is directly followed, and fundamental mechanistic and kinetic information obtained.  \r\n",
