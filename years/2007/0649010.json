 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates site in Physiology and Neurobiology at the University of Connecticut (Storrs, CT) offers paid summer research opportunities in the areas of renal, cardiac, and muscle physiology as well as developmental neurobiology, synaptic plasticity and neural circuits.  Interested students, especially underrepresented minorities and students with disabilities and from institutions with limited research opportunities are invited to apply.  Ten undergraduates will be recruited each year to participate in graduate level research projects on physiological systems in animals ranging from invertebrates and marine fish to birds and mammals.  All students receive a stipend, room and board, research supply money, and assistance with funds to travel to and from the University.  REU students will be part of a campus multidisciplinary REU community consisting of several programs in the physical sciences and engineering as well as physiology and neurobiology.  The 10-week program begins in early June with orientation and training programs in laboratory safety and animal care protocols as well as ethics programs and Diversity in Science workshops.  Students receive hands-on practical research experience guided by an individual faculty mentor.  Objectives for student participants include being able to:  (a)  apply the scientific method in hypothesis-driven research; (b) engage in self-directed research; (c) communicate research results in verbal and written form; and (d) make informed decisions about a career in science.  The REU program also includes seminars, an end-of-summer research symposium, and a variety of recreational activities.  Each student prepares a scientific paper as well as a poster of their research for presentation at an on campus REU symposium.  Students can expect to acquire skills and knowledge to help them enter graduate research programs.  UConn is located midway between New York City (2.5 hours) and Boston (2 hours) in scenic eastern Connecticut.  More information is available at http://www.pnb.uconn.edu/reu or by contacting Dr. J. Larry Renfro at 860-486-4119 or larry.renfro@uconn.edu.  \r\n",
