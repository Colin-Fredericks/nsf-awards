 "awd_abstract_narration": "The APEX Scholars Program is providing scholarships to students pursuing degrees in mathematics, physical sciences, biological sciences, engineering and related technologies, and computer science and technology. APEX Scholars receive scholarship funds, as well as academic support and cohort opportunities, to participate in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) enrichment activities. Other students who do not quite meet academic qualifications receive a one-time APEX Incentive Award that allows them to demonstrate academic potential at the college level. Successful Incentive students become APEX Scholars. Successful APEX Scholars who transfer to a baccalaureate STEM program receive APEX Plus scholarship to continue their educations. Virtual cohort activities link these students throughout the country. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The APEX Scholars Program is adapting successful support mechanisms developed through the college's NSF-funded Center for Promoting STEM (CP-STEM). Using the mechanism of CP-STEM to coordinate APEX Scholars, this brings together large groups of students whose shared interest in STEM allows them to learn from each other. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The program enables a cohort of students across the spectrum of STEM subjects to better understand the nature of different STEM fields. Interacting and working together within the cohort helps develop teamwork skills essential to success in the workplace. In addition, the continuum of financial support through community college programs and into baccalaureate programs offers opportunities to STEM students not normally available.\r\n\r\n",
