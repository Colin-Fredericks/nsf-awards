 "awd_abstract_narration": "As producers of knowledge in a globalized society, scientists and scholars must reckon with an increasingly connected world that impacts the activities of knowledge producing enterprises.  This fact has prompted research-oriented organizations such as universities, R&D business, and federal agencies to promote international research collaboration as a means to build intellectual capacity and increase competitiveness, among other goals.  This project continues the long-standing support by both the Association of American Geographers (AAG) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) for US geographers to engage in international collaboration through formal activities of the International Geographical Union (IGU).  This project will support the participation of seventy-two (72) United States geographic scholars in two major international geographic conferences to be held in the Middle East from April 2008 through November 2010.  It will partially underwrite the participation of forty-five (45) US scholars in the 31st International Geographical Congress in Tunis, Tunisia to be held in coordination with the Association of Tunisian Geographers from August 12-15, 2008; and twenty-seven (27) US scholars in the IGU Regional Conference in Tel-Aviv, Israel in coordination with the Israeli National Commission for Geography during the Summer of 2010.  Approximately 60 percent of participants will be junior scholars.  This project will provide benefits to individual researchers and the broader geographic community through contributions to resources for research and education, including stimulating scholarly publications, fostering collaborative, multi-national research, and improving geographic education; contributions to human resource development, including international scientific leadership; contributions to broad enrichment of US science and of other disciplines; and other contributions beyond science and engineering as described in the proposal narrative.\r\n\r\nWidespread participation of US geographers in these upcoming International Geographical Union sponsored conferences in the Middle East will strengthen US ties with international scholars.   Past NSF-funded travel grant programs have made a difference, stimulating one-fifth to one-quarter greater US participation rates than in years when such support was not available.   Junior scholars in particular are provided early professional development opportunities through participation in international events.  The focus on the Middle East region in particular holds potential for improved scientific collaborations between US scholars and geographers in the region, whose joint research ultimately will help Muslim countries further develop collaborate technical knowledge base that can translate research and development into useful applications for solving socio-economic problems.  American scholars are also provided with unique opportunities for outreach, positive engagement, and improved research programs through these partnerships in the region.  \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis funding from the National Science Foundation enabled the Association of American Geographers (AAG) to manage a travel grant program to support the participation of 100 U.S. geographers in three major events of the International Geographical Union (IGU).  The IGU is the global organization that promotes worldwide scientific exchange and collaboration on topics of interest to the field of geography and is a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU).  The events were held in Tunisia, Israel, and Chile.  The scientists funded under this program come from 34 states plus the District of Columbia and are affiliated with 52 distinct U.S. institutions of higher education.\n\nThe participation of these scholars, which include senior and junior faculty and graduate students, in these high-level IGU events is significant for several reasons, including:\n\nToday\u00c6s globalized society and increasingly-connected world is having a significant impact on research-oriented organizations such as universities, R&amp;D enterprises, and government agencies.  Accordingly, these institutions are promoting international research collaboration as a means of building intellectual capacity and increasing U.S. competitiveness.  The travel of 100 American scholars from a wide range of U.S. institutions of higher education to a series of key international conferences helps strengthen research collaboration and scientific exchange.    \nThe Middle East is a region of significant global interest in recent decades and will likely remain so in the coming years.  Two of the IGU conferences that were included in this grant program took place in this key region. Supporting U.S. researchers to attend these organized events helped to develop the potential for improved scientific research collaborations between U.S. and Middle Eastern geographers.  As an outcome of the conference, a number of participating scholars identified plans to pursue or continue joint research that will foster knowledge exchanges and promote mutual understanding and encourage scientific research and its applications to sustainable international development, including in agriculture, urban planning, and new geographic technologies, and other geographic fields.  In addition to this positive engagement, many participants also noted the value that visiting the region had for enriching their teaching of Middle Eastern issues from a more knowledgeable perspective.\nAttendance at major international geography conferences enables U.S. geographers &ndash; including junior faculty &ndash; to seek opportunities to serve as international leaders in the discipline.  A number of participants reported taking on roles as scientific research commission chairs or even officers.  This is a key aspect of professional development and allows American geographers to play a lead part in IGU activities as well as other important leadership positions and influence global scientific research.\n\n\nThe AAG is a nonprofit scientific and educational society founded in 1904 to promote the advancement of geography.  Our members, representing all fifty states, are geographers and related professionals who work in the public, private, and academic sectors.  Their career fields include college and university faculty members; scientific researchers; federal, state, and local government employees; planners; cartographers; businesspeople; and elementary and secondary educators.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/21/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patricia A Solis"
