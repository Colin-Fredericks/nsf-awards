 "awd_abstract_narration": "P.I.: Anthony Powell, Photographer\r\nProposal Number: 0637614\r\n\r\nAnthony Powell will create a high-definition video library of Antarctic time-lapse photography. Powell has  wintered-over 6 times in Antarctica and in his spare time managed to amass an impressive library of winter footage. Now with a grant from the Antarctic Artists and Writers program, his overall goal is to create a cohesive 4-season vista of stunning visuals that bring the continent to life in a way never before seen. The footage will include both the natural environment and the everyday life of researchers and support personnel. His existing work is quite extraordinary and has proved hugely popular, winning a  prize in the short film category of the Palouse International Film Festival. Research personnel have also benefited from the work, by gaining new insights into the nature of the environment, such as the motion and formation of Nacreous clouds.
