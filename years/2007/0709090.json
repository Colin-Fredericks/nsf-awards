Our project will explore the following two broad topics:\r\n.\tFundamentals of molecular interactions with CNTs and the effects of spatial confinement on the molecular structure, dynamics and transport.\r\n.\tActive regulation and control of molecular selectivity and transport through carbon nanotubes using highly specific DNA-based molecular gating.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed research will broaden and enhance the fundamental science of nanofluidics. We will not only investigate the effect of confinement that has implications for understanding ionic and water transport in living cells, but also lay the foundation for the development of membrane-based transformational technologies. The newly discovered phenomenon of fast transport through carbon nanotubes will be exploited to enable improvements in the performance of membranes for desalination, gas separation as well as other applications such as protective gear and drug delivery.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\tBeyond the training of graduate and undergraduate students on nano-bio-fluidics and the strengthening the course curricula at the partner institutions, we will design and implement co-taught graduate level courses. We will also place special emphasis on the recruitment of minority and underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nThe main research and educational theme of this work is: Active Nanostructures.\r\n",
