 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-0654321 O'Connell  This project is a group International Travel Grant to the University of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe International Conferences on Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design (ICPPEPPD) are held every three years. For the first 21 years the locations alternated between North America and Europe, while in 2001, the conference was held in Asia for the first time. Following the 10th Conference in Utah, the 11th will be held in Crete before returning to Asia in 2010. The first ten conferences produced highly desirable interactions between academic\r\nand industrial and government workers in this vital area for chemical process design and simulation. The meetings are the most important gatherings for workers from all over the world; the Ninth Conference held in 2001 in Japan attracted 250 participants from 29 countries, while the Tenth held in 2004 in Utah was attended by 170 technical participants from 18 countries. Each conference has produced important collections of papers in reviewed archival Proceedings volumes.\r\n\r\nThe Eleventh ICPPEPPD Conference is scheduled for May 20 - 25 2007, in Hersonissos, Crete, Greece, with a similar format to the successful previous Conferences, but with innovative contemporary session topics and workshops on new and unique subjects. (The 11th is being planned for 250 technical participants because the location, costs and timing are more favorable than in 2004.)\r\n\r\nThe present grant provides funds for travel, and meals and lodging in some cases, for as many needy US academic researchers as possible for the 2007 meeting. Those supported would include only presenters of invited and contributed papers as well as young research workers who would not be able to attend without such support. (No request is made for Meeting organization expenses or for non-US participants.)\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This Conference will gather the most important international researchers on the vital area of properties and phase equilibria for product and process design to review progress and to uncover the next generation of problems and their potential solutions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Global state-of-the-art will be articulated and advanced. American participation is essential for making contributions to the general knowledge base, for building awareness of global activities, and for fostering international collaborations.\r\n",
