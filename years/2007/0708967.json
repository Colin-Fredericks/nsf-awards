 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0708967\r\nGallagher\r\n\r\nDr. John Gallagher of the University of Wisconsin at Madison will carry out a study of starburst activities in nearby galaxies, making spectroscopic and imaging observations with telescopes of the WIYN (Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-National Optical Astronomy Observatory) Observatory and with SALT (the Southern African Large Telescope).  First, he will investigate the relationship between young stellar systems within starbursts, compact massive star clusters and starburst clumps, and the state of the interstellar medium.  Second, he will study how young stellar populations in starbursts connect to galactic winds and widespread gas ionization.  The data will be compared with models of stellar populations, enabling studies of astrophysical processes inside these extreme objects, which are likely to apply in rapidly star-forming young galaxies at redshifts of two and above, where the majority of the present day stellar mass was probably produced.\r\n\r\nThe research activities involve student training and international collaboration.  Undergraduates will gain access to this project through the NSF-REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program.  The team will continue its participation in the very popular \"Universe in the Park\" program, where students bring small telescopes to state parks in Wisconsin and open the skies to the public.  Exchange programs will be carried out with South Africa and other countries.",
