 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project we will focus on four important aspects (requirements)\r\nof an end-to-end software environment for performing multiple parallel\r\nnon-rigid registrations over the Grid. Our application is Image Guided\r\nNeurosurgery  (IGNS).  IGNS  is  an important  tool for  neurosurgical\r\nresection which is a  common therapeutic intervention in the treatment\r\nof malignant brain tumors.\r\n\r\nThe  four requirements  we will  study in  this project  are:  (1) the\r\nhigh-performance   of   the   parallel   and   distributed   non-rigid\r\nregistration code  by dynamically balancing  the processors work-load,\r\n(2) the   ease-of-use  from   medical  doctors   (radiologist)   of  a\r\nweb-service by developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for clients\r\nof  our web-service  (3) the  portability of  the code  to run  from a\r\nsingle high-end workstation to  more than one clusters of workstations\r\nwithin  the  local  and  wide  area  networks  available  to  research\r\nhospitals  and medical  centers, (4)  the reliability  by guaranteeing\r\nthat part of  the system will complete the  computations for the image\r\nregistration  and  by making  sure  we  meet  the time  constrains  by\r\nacquiring and  re-configuring the system at runtime  to compensate for\r\nlost (faulty) computing resources.\r\n\r\nThe end-product will  be a prototype of an  IGNS web-service. However,\r\nthis project will have broader  impact to image guided therapy because\r\nthe  same  framework  (but  different modalities  and  finite  element\r\napproximation models)  can be used  in prostate biopsy  and treatment,\r\nand liver cryotherapy.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
