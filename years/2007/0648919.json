 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of West Georgia campus, in Carrollton, Georgia, will be the site of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program for eight weeks during the summers of 2007, 2008, and 2009. The program will be led by Professors Bruce Landman and Abdollah Khodkar, and involve research in the areas of combinatorics, number theory, and graph theory. Eight students will be invited each year, with one student coming from within the University of West Georgia by means of a competitive selection process. After the eight-week program, the students will attend a conference at which they will be able to present their research work. The participants will work in teams of two or three students, with each student being a member of two different teams. Students will be housed on the campus of the University. The research problems will stem for the main areas of interest of the two faculty mentors, combinatorial number theory and graph theory. The program is designed to develop the participants into research mathematicians, with the ability to pose and prove original conjectures, to learn independently, to collaborate with others on research projects, and to effectively communicate their findings, both orally and in writing.\r\n",
