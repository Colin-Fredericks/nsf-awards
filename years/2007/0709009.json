 "awd_abstract_narration": "NER: Novel Chiral Architectures of Magnetic Nanowires\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe objective of this research is to create composite materials with magnetic nanometer-scale chiral (helical) internal structure. The composites will be fabricated using nanowires embedded in a host material. A new technology based on a rotating applied magnetic-field along with localized heating/cooling will rearrange the nanowires into chiral domains. The magnetic and optical properties of the composite will depend not only on the properties of individual nanowires (composition, size and shape) but also on their arrangement.  These properties will be investigated to establish a relationship between the electromagnetic response and the micrometer and nanometer scale structure.  This project will advance the science of complex magnetic and optically coupled nanostructures and may provide a route for creating materials with properties not found in natural materials, like negative refraction.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe fabrication and understanding of magnetic nanostructures is essential for the future development of electronic devices. The proposed chiral architecture will provide additional flexibility when engineering materials for optical, magneto-optical and microwave frequency applications. Potential applications are high-density information storage, microwave devices and nanophotonics. \r\nIn the wake of hurricane Katrina, research and education in emerging high-tech fields like nanotechnology is important to rebuilding southeast Louisiana's economy. The project is an extension of the existing nanoscience research and educational activities of the Advanced Materials Research Institute (AMRI) at the University of New Orleans. The combined outreach efforts allow undergraduate students from the local HBCU's to conduct research and increase the awareness of science and technology at the high school level. \r\n\r\n",
