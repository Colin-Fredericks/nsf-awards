Students at SCC will build its capacity to offer\r\nSTEM disciplines through reformed STEM coursework, research, and internship activities. The\r\nproposed activity will yield data which will assist SCC in STEM enhancement. This approach\r\nwill also provide facilitate matriculation of our two-year graduates into a four year institution of\r\nhigher education or the job market. Faculty will develop a research base and research agenda,\r\nwhich will involve all SCC students, faculty members, and other tribal programs.",

Throughout the project year\u00c6s our STEM fields have shown a significant increase in graduation rates currently 47% of our graduates are from the STEM fields, we also have successful transfer students.  SCC has also established a Moodle website that is used by STEM staff and also has redeveloped their cultural Ethnobotany class.  Many of the STEM classes have been updated and improved to go along with the transferabilty inititiave with the Montana Univeristy System.  For this reporting period the NSF TCUP program had 24 students total throughout Summer, Fall and Spring semesters, ouf of the 24 students 10 graduated within the academic year.
