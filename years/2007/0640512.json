 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of modern research in evolutionary biology is to identify the genetic basis of traits that limit reproduction between species. This project will dissect the genetic basis of traits that limit mating between closely related species in the butterfly genus Heliconius, a group of neotropical butterflies famous for striking, warning colored wing patterns and extensive mimicry.  Using a combination of high-resolution genetic mapping, analyses of gene expression, and studies of visual anatomy, this project will identify the specific genes responsible for adaptive divergence in wing color and color preference, characterize their developmental actions, and elucidate the interactions between trait and preference evolution.\r\n\r\nSexual or behavioral isolation plays a critical role in driving the early stages of the speciation process yet little is known about the genetic basis of divergent mate preferences and preference cues in young species. This project will provide a detailed examination of the genetic and mechanistic basis of adaptive divergence that has the side-effect of driving speciation in a recent adaptive radiation.  The results of these analyses will have profound impacts on our understanding of the speciation process, particularly in terms of how disruptive natural selection can drive divergence of species.  In addition, this research will have a variety of broader impacts related to education, the participation of underrepresented groups, and the dissemination of results.\r\n",
