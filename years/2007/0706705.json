Goerss\r\n\r\nThe chromatic picture of stable homotopy uses the algebraic\r\ngeometry of formal groups to organize and direct investigations\r\ninto the deeper structure of computations and theory. This\r\nproject seeks to develop this point of view in two directions,\r\none local and one global.  The first, or local, direction is an\r\ninvestigation into K(n)-local homotopy theory in general and into\r\nthe K(2)-local sphere in particular. The second, or more global,\r\ndirection, would be to make systematic our knowledge of\r\nstructured ring spectra using stacks and the moduli stack of\r\nformal groups as the basic parameterizing device.  In particular,\r\na main part of the project is to continue work on the problem of\r\nrealizing families of commutative ring spectra over the moduli\r\nstack of formal groups. The spectrum of topological modular forms\r\narises from taking the homotopy inverse limit of just such a\r\nfamily and recent work of Lurie, Behrens, and Lawson had given\r\nnew examples. We can ask for systematic results along these\r\nlines, and we can ask for a thorough investigation into the\r\nexamples we have. An intriguing and novel feature of these\r\nfamilies is that they use the theory of Barsotti-Tate groups to\r\ncombine information from formal groups of various heights.\r\n\r\nThis project is in homotopy theory, which is a branch of\r\ntopology, a rather modern field that grew naturally out of\r\ngeometry by studying phenomena that remain invariant under\r\ncontinuous transformations, rather than rigid (e.g.,\r\nangle-preserving) transformations. Of particular importance in\r\ntopology are the continuous maps between large dimensional\r\nspheres; under a suitable equivalence relation, this is the ring\r\nof stable homotopy groups of spheres. This notorious difficult to\r\ncalculate, or even to make conjectures about; therefore, in the\r\npast few decades we have focused on trying to understand\r\nlarge-scale qualitative phenomena. In summary, this is the main\r\nthrust of this project as well. It has been very fruitful to\r\ndetect these phenomena using tools from other fields, especially\r\nalgebraic geometry. The transition from topology to geometry is\r\ndone using homology theories, which is a way of linearizing\r\nbehavior in topology. Simply sticking to one such theory is a\r\nradical process, however, and it loses too much data; therefore,\r\nwe study families of such theories.  Of particular importance is\r\nthe family parametrized by the stack of one-parameter formal Lie\r\ngroups. The theory of stacks is vital here, as this allows us to\r\nstudy symmetries across continuous families of geometric objects\r\n-- especially when the self-symmetries can vary non-continuously\r\nthroughout the family, as is most certainly the case here.\r\n",
