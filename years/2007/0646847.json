 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU is an eight-week summer research experience in mathematics to be held at SUNY Potsdam for about 12 undergraduates mathematics students (9 supported by the NSF site grant) working in groups of 3 or 4. The areas of the research for 2007 include Algebra, Ergodic Theory, Applied Graph Theory, and Topological Graph Theory.\r\n\r\nThe proposed summer program is built on the premise that the students will be colleagues with the faculty advisors and will be treated as such as they jointly pursue unanswered mathematical questions. \r\n\r\nWe have ambitious goals for our students.  We would like to help them build their confidence in their ability to do research independently, and to help them build their appreciation and understanding of the vast field of mathematics.  We also want to help them to improve their oral and written communication skills.  Each group will present their results to the other students, at least twice during the eight weeks.  Students will be encouraged to present their results at a national meeting.  Each group will also use LaTex to prepare a paper on their work.  We also hope to expand our students' mathematical horizons through hosting a weekly guest speaker.\r\n\r\nSUNY Potsdam is widely known for its undergraduate mathematics program, and Clarkson University has an international reputation in scientific research. Together, these institutions create for students a unique atmosphere of learning and research. \r\n\r\nWe strongly encourage applications from women, minorities, students with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups.\r\n",
