 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe practice of medicine involves the science of prediction. \r\nPrediction depends on clinical or laboratory variables or factors \r\nthat are linked to outcome. The most common predictors in cancer \r\nmedicine are the three variables: tumor size, regional lymph node \r\nstatus, and distant metastasis. The three variables are combined \r\nin a bin model to form the TNM Staging system, which is a major \r\ntool used to predict the outcome of cancer patients and guide therapy. \r\nHowever, the TNM system has only three variables. Therefore, \r\nits predictive accuracy is limited. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research addresses issues of numerical computing and optimization \r\nin developing expanded cancer prognostic systems that can integrate \r\nmultiple variables. Two sets of closely related tasks will be investigated, \r\nand they represent two major aspects of the intellectual merit of the study.  \r\nOne task is focused on how censored survival times and different \r\ntypes of variables are integrated into a clustering framework that \r\nworks for a large volume of cancer patient data. Another task is to \r\nuse the developed cluster analysis to establish prognostic systems, \r\nwhich will provide a more accurate prediction of outcome by taking \r\nmultiple prognostic factors into account. The broader impact of this \r\nresearch includes many aspects. It will have a direct impact on future \r\nstaging and classification of cancer patients. The work has general \r\napplications and can be adapted to studies of any non-cancer health \r\nproblems. The investigator's study is expected to make significant \r\ncontributions to advances in medicine. The research will also have an \r\neducational impact.  \r\n",
