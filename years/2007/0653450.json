 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the study of electron collisions with inert closed shell rare gases and molecular hydrogen (a closed-shell molecule). The first experiments address physics questions about the dynamics of electron-rare gas ionization particularly with regard to the collisional distribution of energy between the out-going ionized electrons.  The project will focus on the difficult near-threshold ionization region where the energy of the two outgoing electrons is very low. Additional experiments will provide detailed electron collision data regarding the imparting of angular momentum by the scattering electron to the target, resulting in polarized radiation, in coincidence with the scattered electron.  Extensive collaborations with theorists will assist comparisons between the experimental results and theoretical models.  Important and broader impacts involve education of a large number of undergraduate and high school students as well as under-represented minority students. The present experimental group has, in the past 18 years, been active working with undergraduates and high school students and publishing papers with these students. Students are empowered to seek higher education in the form of PhD programs or seek employment in better positions in industry than they would have initially envisioned.",
