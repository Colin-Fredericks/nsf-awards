 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a Microbial Biodiversity Survey and Inventory across all 13 of the major aquatic (marine and freshwater) Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites established by the NSF US LTER Program. The long-term objective of the study is to document and describe baseline diversity and relative abundance data for both common and rare members of microbial communities located in aquatic LTER sites and to relate this diversity to the underlying physical and chemical environment. The project employs a new, high-volume DNA sequencing technology based on the sequencing of small ribosomal RNA regions that are especially variable, which will allow for discovery of novel microbial diversity in the bacterial, archaeal and eukaryal domains of life. \r\n\r\nBiodiversity in general, and microbial biodiversity in particular is important because microorganisms help shape Earth's habitability by orchestrating the major carbon transformations, biogeochemical cycles, and input into atmospheric composition. Radical fluctuations in microbial populations caused by changes in the environment pose irreversible threats to our quality of life and the entire biosphere. The resulting data will directly benefit participating LTERs that actively communicate results to policy makers, natural resource managers, the broader scientific community and the general public. Podcasts are planned to be coordinated with the Schoolyard LTER program.  \r\n",
