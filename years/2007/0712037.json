 "awd_abstract_narration": "This small business innovation research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the development\r\nof a novel abrasive-free recyclable copper CMP (AFCMP) recyclable process based on\r\nan unique patented iodine chemistry which leads to the formation of a soft, insoluble\r\ncopper iodide layer on the surface of the copper. This layer can be gently removed by the\r\npolishing pad without the need for particles in the slurry (abrasive-free slurry). This\r\nprocess is in contrast to conventional CMP processes that forms a hard copper oxide layer\r\n(by addition of hydrogen peroxide), which require both etching chemicals and hard\r\nabrasives (alumina/silica) for removal. In contrast, the copper iodide layer possess nearly\r\nan order of magnitude less hardness, thus can be easily removed by the polymer polishing\r\npad. The insoluble copper-iodide in the effluents can be removed by filtration and the\r\nchemicals can be recycled back for CMP polishing.  \r\nThis project will attempt successful demonstration of (i) copper polishing using abrasive-free\r\nCMP slurries to meet present technical requirements, (ii) compatibility of AFCMP\r\nslurries to next generation ultra-low k dielectrics materials, (iii) the ability to filter and\r\nobtain consistent performances with the filtrate slurries.\r\n\r\nThe rapid integration of low k interconnects and AFCMP is expected to lead to\r\nsubstantial profits and energy savings. Environmental friendly manufacturing, and\r\nincrease in hi-tech jobs. US will be a leader in copper low k CMP technology; and US\r\nbased semiconductor companies will have a local slurry supplier. Ensure US leadership\r\nin nanotechnology.",
