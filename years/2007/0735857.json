This meeting was held at the Bishop's Lodge in Santa Fe, New Mexico on March 5-6, 2007. The three PIs are FIND-funded PIs who made the arrangements for the PI meeting.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. PIs funded under the FIND program are required to attend three PI meetings per year during the period they are funded. The purpose of the PI meetings is to review the progress of ongoing projects, and provide the opportunity for PIs to understand how their projects may intersect and work toward building new Future Internet architectures.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. The goal of the FIND PI meetings is to afford PIs opportunities to meet and discuss the technical aspects of their projects, and to work towards forging a consensus around what design principles should be guiding their work. The hope is that these interactions will foster multi-disciplinary collaborations in the future are result in new Future Internet architectures. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
