Experiments will be performed on three materials - carbon nanotubes, Indium-Arsenic nanowires, and graphene. These have all demonstrated novel physics and are considered leading candidates for nanoscale electronics applications. The research will use innovative fabrication and measurement techniques, such as local electric fields and substrates that can be controllably strained, to understand what factors most influence electron transport in nanoscale materials. The proposed research will also lay the groundwork for novel electronic devices. Education and research are integrated through a focus on recruiting and involving women and minorities in research activities. Specific educational tasks include mentoring under-represented undergraduates in research projects, and organizing special nanoscience sessions at conferences targeting women and minorities. The project will train talented scientists and help improve the science knowledge base of our society.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe goals of this CAREER project are to 1) significantly improve the understanding and manipulation of transport properties in nanostructures, and 2) recruit under-represented groups to physics by exposing them to cutting-edge nanoscience. Experiments will be performed on three scientifically and technologically relevant materials; carbon nanotubes, InAs nanowires, and graphene. The research will utilize local probes and novel tuning parameters to answer basic questions about transport in nanostructures, particularly regarding the interplay between electron-electron interactions, band structure, spin and charge distributions, and disorder. Innovative measurement and fabrication tools - such as quantum point contacts to detect spins, tunneling probes to measure energy distributions, and electric fields and flexible substrates to tune conductance and band gaps - will be developed to allow for precise studies of fundamental properties and also to lay the groundwork for novel tunable devices. Education and research are integrated through a focus on recruiting and involving women and minorities in research. Specific educational tasks include mentoring under-represented undergraduates, and organizing nanoscience sessions at major conferences and meetings targeting women and minorities. The plan will thus help increase the future pool of talented scientists and help improve the scientific knowledge base of our society.\r\n",
