 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThe Anasazi EFT-60 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometer is being used to implement NMR spectroscopic experiments and provide hands-on experience for students in freshman through senior chemistry laboratories. About 1200 students per year from several disciplines are  impacted by this project.  Students in the organic chemistry sequence at the Mississippi University for Women (MUW) are also gaining experience in NMR spectroscopy with this instrument. The broad impact of the NMR instrument as a tool to interest and retain underrepresented students in STEM disciplines is enhanced through outreach activities to area high school students and undergraduates from community colleges and universities not having access to NMR instrumentation at their home institutions. The positive effect on increasing participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering is based on local demographics including a 20% African-American enrollment at Mississippi State University, a student body that is 85% women and 32% African-American at MUW, a 93% African-American and 71% female enrollment at Mississippi Valley State University, and a 56% African-American population at area high schools. The hands-on experience with an FT-NMR spectrometer enhances the chemistry majors' undergraduate education and helps prepare students for employment or graduate study. The intellectual merit of the project is demonstrated by the enhancement in students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and greater involvement in chemical research. Increased enthusiasm towards chemistry as a career is realized because of the vertical incorporation of FT-NMR spectroscopy and the integration of this technology throughout the chemistry curriculum.\r\n",
