 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moist tropical forests have huge amounts of carbon in their biomass and soils, and high rates of productivity: tropical forest growth, disturbance, and land use therefore have potentially large impacts on atmospheric CO2 levels. Accurate modeling of carbon uptake and release by forests is essential for global-change analyses, yet we do not even know how much CO2 tropical forests capture or produce. This project will make use of 19-yr-old replicated plantations in lowland Costa Rica to evaluate species-level controls over whole-forest carbon cycling. In comparisons among four species, three key plant traits that influence ecosystem-level carbon balance will be evaluated: 1) carbon use efficiency (CUE); 2) partitioning among plant parts that have differences in CUE (e.g., leaves, wood); and 3) tissue biochemistry, which influences carbon cycling rates. \r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of this project include training and international experience for both undergraduate and graduate students. Further development of the widely used Century model will offer a major advance in the ability to predict the effects of shifts in species composition on ecosystem-level carbon balances. Maintenance of this research site will provide infrastructure for other researchers, and a demonstration of restoration of ecosystem services. Results will be disseminated to the scientific community, and also to NGO's and land-holders in the area. Development of a user-friendly rainforest simulation model will enhance education opportunities for 29,500 K-12 students in the Miami, FL area, though a partnership with the Fairchild Tropical Botanical Garden.\r\n",
