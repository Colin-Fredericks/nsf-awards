 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a workshop, PI Jack Kruse, to support the travel of Alaska Native leaders and other policy makers to participate in the release of the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) data and to contextualize that data in their regions and communities.  The workshop will be held during the IPY launch at the University of Alaska Anchorage, March 22nd, 2007. \r\n\r\nThe SLiCA project, funded by NSF, is an international survey of living conditions among indigenous peoples across the Arctic involving a partnership of researchers and indigenous organizations in Greenland, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Russia, and the United States.  The US  portion of the project focuses on indigenous households in Alaska's North Slope, Northwest Arctic, Bering Straits, and Chukotka regions. The goal of the international study is to develop an integrated set of individual, household, community, and regional databases for use in comparative analyses of living conditions among Arctic populations.  This Alaska workshop will be a follow-up on the international workshop which took place in 2006 among the Arctic Council's Sustainable Development Working Group.\r\n",
