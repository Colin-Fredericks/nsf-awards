 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless sensor networks have the potential to revolutionize research areas and\r\nindustries that require the distributed collection and aggregation of data,\r\ne.g., civil engineering, biology, and geology.  However, to date their impact\r\nhas fallen short of this potential.  This is not surprising; wireless sensor\r\nnetworks are difficult to design and program.  Experts in application domains\r\nsuch as biology and civil engineering have neither the training in embedded\r\nsystem programming and design required to develop adequate wireless sensor\r\nnetworks, nor the time or inclination to become embedded systems designers.\r\nFor wireless sensor networks to live up to their potential, they must be easy\r\nfor application experts to design and program instead of requiring embedded\r\nsystems design expertise.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to put wireless sensor network design and deployment within\r\nthe reach of applications experts.  This project will identify a small set of\r\napplication archetypes, described in terms meaningful to application\r\ndevelopers, that capture the most common application structures.  Each\r\narchetype will be backed by a compilable specification written in a simple\r\nhigh-level archetype-specific language. After customization, a specification\r\nwill be passed to a synthesis algorithm to produce a working hardware-software\r\nsystem.  Synthesis of efficient wireless sensor networks would be intractable\r\nwithout an appropriate hardware-software platform.  Therefore, this project\r\nwill also determine the particular types of hardware and software components\r\nnecessary to enable support for wide range of archetypes.  A configurable\r\nhardware-software platform will be developed based on these findings.\r\n",
