 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI is requesting funding for the development of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) based on an existing design and upgraded with a high-resolution and dynamic range digital camera, fluorescence imaging system, hyperspectral camera, multi-beam sonar, chlorophyll and CDOM fluorometers, and an AC-9 absorption and attenuation meter.  The AUV will be used for coral reef benthic surveys on the insular shelf and slope, as well as other benthic habitats.  The AUV development will provide new research capabilities to map and characterize deep coral reef habitats that lie outside of safe SCUBA range and provide training and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe broader impacts from this proposal include undergraduate and graduate hands-on educational opportunities by allowing students to participate in the both the development and the use of the proposed instrumentation.  The AUV will also be used as part of undergraduate classroom projects, seminars, special topics courses, and demonstrations.  Approximately 95% of the student population at the University of Puerto Rico comes from underrepresented groups in ocean science and technology.  Additionally, the AUV and its capabilities has the potential to support wider collaborations among researchers for coral reef research outside of Puerto Rico as well as with other disciplines.",
