 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the use of high-dimensional geometry in attacking problems at the forefront of computer science.  This includes closing fundamental gaps in our understanding of theoretical issues, as well as solving practical problems that arise from the need to analyze and manipulate massive data sets.  Such data sets arise naturally in disparate fields like machine learning, computer vision, and bioinformatics.\r\nOn the foundational side, high-dimensional geometric techniques play a pivotal role in obtaining fast, approximate solutions to classical hard problems which are difficult to solve exactly.\r\nThe investigator will study these connections and the development of new algorithmic techniques to exploit them.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the PI will seek new algorithms which provide better approximate solutions to a variety of classical problems in areas such as graph partitioning, data clustering, and graph coloring.  Many of these approaches are based on semi-definite programming and an important goal of the project is to understand exactly the power that this class of algorithms provides, via both new algorithmic techniques and complexity-theoretic lower bounds.  These endeavors will incorporate techniques from high-dimensional geometry and probability, functional analysis, and extremal combinatorics.  Another goal concerns coping with the dimensionality of data sets.  For this purpose, the goal is to develop both new dimension reduction techniques, as well as algorithms and data structure that are able to operate directly on intrinsic low-dimensional structures inside data whose representation is, a priori, high-dimensional.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGeometric phenomena in algorithms and complexity\n\nPI:  James  R. Lee (Associate Professor, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, University of Washington)\n\nAs the prevalence of technology grows, we are simultaneously confronted with massive amounts of data, increasingly difficult computational problems, and the ever-growing value of efficient solutions to those problems.  Almost every major human endeavor, from medicine, to energy consumption, to commerce is undergoing a computational revolution.  And it is well-known that simply \"working harder\" is not enough&mdash;raw computing power cannot keep up with our thirst for more answers.  We have to work smarter as well; that is the primary subject of study in the field of \"algorithms.\"  We examine how computers can solve problems more efficiently.  In fact, we look for clever ways to solve problems that, on the face of it, look entirely intractable.\n\nWhen one starts dealing with huge, unwieldy data sets, the information starts to look very high-dimensional.  This can be problematic; the famous \"curse of dimensionality\" states that many algorithmic approaches get tripped up when dealing with high-dimensional objects.  In this project, we took a close look at this phenomenon.  We looked at how it can be helpful, by interpreting certain problems (like image compression and signal recovery) in a non-obvious geometric way, and how we can confront the situations where it seems to be a detriment.  We also studied whether these geometric issues are intrinsic or whether they are simply an artifact of our approach.\n\nAlong the way, we invented many new algorithms, in areas like compressed sensing, where one tries to understand data collected using very noisy measurements, and in graph partitioning, where the goal is to break a problem into smaller pieces on which a solution is easier to find, in a way such that the pieces can be gracefully recombined into a solution for the whole instance.  We also developed sophisticated mathematical techniques for understanding the limitations of certain approaches, mainly in the area of semi-definite programming.  One of the most exciting advances is our new method for analyzing \"spectral algorithms\" which are capable of remarkable feats, like discovering friendships in social networks, or recognizing people from their photographs.\n\nThe many publications from our work are freely available at the web site:  http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/jrl/.
