These researchers will draft a White Paper for review by the broader earthquake engineering and hazards communities via the World Wide Web. Following further input gathered through an invitational Workshop, a final White Paper will be produced that includes recommendations designed to ensure that complex, multidisciplinary hazard issues receive attention from researchers with the skills and expertise to enable society to prepare for and recovery from future extreme events in a manner that minimizes disruption and loss.",
