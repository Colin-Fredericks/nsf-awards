 "awd_abstract_narration": "The integrative systems proposal focuses on developing techniques to minimize the effects of the phase noise, which is one of the primary factors that limit the performance in many communication systems. In contrast to many of the existing approaches for combating phase noise, we propose to use signal processing techniques together with circuit techniques to overcome the phase noise problems. Based on this integrated approach, a novel phase noise compensation scheme with potentially significant performance improvement is proposed. This research will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed phase noise compensation scheme in communication transceivers. In addition to providing a complete design framework based on a clear understanding of various design options and the corresponding tradeoffs in performance and implementation complexity, the feasibility and the advantages of the proposed approach will be demonstrated by realizing it on silicon. The concepts and techniques developed in the proposed research should be broadly applicable to all communication systems (transmitters and receivers) that suffer from the effects of phase noise. \r\n\r\nThe above research plan is coupled with an education plan that describes how the proposed research will help train both the graduate and undergraduate students. The multi-disciplinary nature of the proposed research will broaden the students' technical understanding, which the PI believes is mandatory for next generation of engineers. The proposal also includes plans to improve the participation of underrepresented groups. Finally, the results of the proposed research are expected to benefit the numerous sectors of technology that require inexpensive and low-power communication devices.\r\n\r\n",
