 "awd_abstract_narration": "Foreman's proposal involves applying  tools from mathematical logic to questions in dynamical systems. Many dynamical systems, while completely determinate, appear to have elements of random behavior. This phenomenon can be described explicitly when there is a time-invariant probability measure on the system.  Such a description could state that the system is measure theoretically isomorphic to a particular known process, such as a Bernoulli process. From this point of view it is natural to try to attempt to classify dynamical systems measure-theoretically. The hope would be to have a \"library\" of possible measure preserving systems and be able to describe an arbitrary system measure theoretically as one in the library.\r\nThis project, while very successful in its early stages, runs into insuperable obstacles for deep logical reasons. Foreman's previous work with his co-authors showed that the isomorphism problem for ergodic measure preserving systems is inherently too complex from a logical point of view to admit a classification. Foreman's proposed work involves extending these anti-classification results to differentiable systems on compact manifolds and to identify those  systems for which the isomorphism problem is tractable.\r\n\r\nMany natural systems evolve over time according to definite rules. Much of science involves discovering these rules and describing them, perhaps by a system of equations. These rules discuss how individual points in a system behave, and are often completely deterministic. However, what can be actually observed (for example due to round-off error) in these systems are sets  of points. At this level the qualitative behavior of a dynamical system can be apparently random. This led to the project of classifying\r\nthe possible behavior statistically so that the   qualitative behavior of\r\nnatural systems could be catalogued. There were many successes in the program in its early stages. Recently however, it turns out that there are reasons related to mathematical logic that the program cannot, in principle, work. Foreman's proposed research explores extending the impossibility results to concrete settings and finding large collections of systems for which there are good classifications of their statistical behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
