 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chen\r\n0724936\r\n\r\n     The investigator and co-investigator organize a conference\r\non the topic \"The Interface between Atomistic and Continuum\r\nTheories\" under the auspices of the Society for Natural\r\nPhilosophy.  The conference themes address mathematical issues\r\nthat arise in the development of continuum-level governing\r\nequations (balance laws and constitutive equations) for materials\r\nbased on atomistic considerations.  The focuses are on the\r\nrelationships between the relevant physical principles used at\r\natomic and continuum levels, as well as consistency of the\r\nresulting theories.  Basic understanding of the characteristics\r\nof the theories across different length scales is essential for\r\ndeveloping analytical and computational models that are capable\r\nof describing a broad range of material behaviors.  The speakers\r\ninvited to participate in the conference are leading researchers\r\nin mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering.  These\r\nspeakers present their current research on analysis, modeling,\r\nand simulations for various material systems.  The conferences of\r\nSociety for Natural Philosophy have a history of being\r\ncross-disciplinary endeavors.  The works presented at these\r\nconferences have embraced a broad spectrum of research topics,\r\nwith common emphasis on the application of rigorous mathematical\r\nanalysis to the study of physical systems. \r\n\r\n     The conference contributes directly to building a solid\r\ntheoretical foundation for rapidly developing technological areas\r\nsuch as nanotechnology, novel materials, and large-scale material\r\nsimulations.  As many nations are heavily investing in these\r\ntechnological areas, the most significant and lasting\r\ndevelopments can only result from progress at fundamental levels. \r\nThe theme of the conference reflects the current trend of using\r\nadvanced mathematical tools to address critical problems arising\r\nin the modeling of material behavior across widely varying length\r\nand time scales.  The conference promotes the participation of\r\njunior researchers and students, and exposes them to a novel,\r\nimportant, and rapidly expanding area of science and technology.",
