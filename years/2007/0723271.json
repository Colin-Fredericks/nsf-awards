 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad goal of this instrumentation proposal is to develop microchip flow injection capillary electrophoresis (MFI-CE) using fiber optic detection. Its research focus is on the development and deployment of new analytical methods for the analysis of metals and small molecules. This instrumentation development is a collaboration between PIs in Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Civil Engineering. \r\n\r\nThe integration of FI-CE on a microfluidic format coupled to fiber optic detection is unique. The PIs' previous work designing CE on a microfluidic format, FI-CE, and FI using fiber optics will be integrated into one versatile instrument with small sample volume requirements and the robustness of a fiber optics detection system. The instrument will ultimately be used for: 1) Metal ion analysis and speciation, 2) Phosphorus-containing species analysis, and 3) Continuous flow enzyme microreactors. \r\n\r\nThis research effort will provide undergraduate and masters students a solid background examining problems at the interface of chemistry and engineering. The proposed instrumentation project will involve students in the design and development of the instrument and will be part of a broad educational experience for students that will include scientific seminars, mentoring, and course advisement. The research projects planned for the participants are aimed at demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of the techniques and its importance as a new and exciting instrument in solving broad scientific problems. Overall, this project will provide undergraduate and masters students a solid analytical chemistry and engineering design background with broad applications.\r\n",
