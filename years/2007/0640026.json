 "awd_abstract_narration": "When organisms experience different environments, they often display different phenotypes; i.e., different morphologies or behaviors.  Indeed, this tendency for organisms to vary in response to changing environments (termed phenotypic plasticity) is so ubiquitous that it can be regarded as a universal property of living things.  Despite longstanding theory suggesting that phenotypic plasticity may generate novel traits in organisms, we know relatively little about phenotypic plasticity's role in promoting diversity within and between species.  The proposed research will seek to fill this critical gap by examining whether and how maternally inherited plasticity promotes diversity within and between species of amphibians.  These goals will be achieved using a combination of laboratory experiments and observations of natural populations. \r\n\r\nThe results of this research could prove vital for understanding how living things develop, function, and evolve.  Indeed, this work will help us to understand how the environment, not just genes, affects development.  Such work is critical for evaluating the origin and treatment of developmental diseases.  This proposal will also contribute to educational outreach by training young scientists in interdisciplinary research, and will broaden access to science by actively recruiting students from underrepresented groups.  Finally, the research will be used to educate the public through a planned science outreach program for K-12 students and teachers.\r\n",
