 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to develop a unique combination of multimodal detection scheme anchored by an innovative electronic signal transduction approach based on MOSFET-embedded microcantilevers coupled with in-situ MEMS heaters.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nWe propose to develop a receptor-free detection approach for chemical sensing and identifying explosives by exploiting their discriminating thermal response, in combination with an all-electronic MOSFET signal detection  all of which are amenable to massively parallel and multiplexed mode for detection and with requisite orthogonality of sensor response to explosive vapors. \r\nSpecifically, we plan to address the following intellectual challenges:\r\n1) Design and fabrication of MOSFET-embedded microcantilever sensors that can provide unprecedented sensitivity of nanomechanical detection of gases/vapors.\r\n2) Design and fabrication of MOSFET cantilevers that can be heated uniformly in a programmed manner within 50-100 milliseconds.\r\n3) Demonstration of thermal speciation of explosive components with high selectivity, to enable discrimination of relevant vapor species in explosives.\r\n4) Design of sample collection and fast preconcentrator units that can collect explosives within 10 seconds and regenerate the system within 10 seconds.\r\n5) Demonstration of detection of explosives and mixtures in the presence of interferents. Coupled with MOSFET-embedded microcantilevers for all-electronic signal transduction and detection approach, we believe that our combined approach provides for a unique and out-of-the-box initiative for highly selective detection of explosives.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThe proposed sensor system theme will be incorporated in a sensor module as a part of Materials World Network (MWN) program at NU, which reaches thousands of high school students and hundreds of teachers, including DOD establishments. We will leverage other NU outreach programs under NCLT (teachers), NSEC (REUs) and MRC (MIN) to attract underrepresented students for research internship and graduate support. The proposed team will engage in local underrepresented student engineering societies. We will incorporate research themes in the ASME tutorial modules. Northwestern is involved in an ongoing collaboration with Dr. Barry Aprison team at the Chicago Museum of Science & Industry (CMSI) for a nanotechnology exhibit. Our team will help provide advice and input in the development of Nanotechnology exhibit at CMSI, including a theme on biochemical sensors. Collectively, we will help achieve effective integration of research with UG and graduate education, hands-on training, professional development and broader societal impact.\r\n",
