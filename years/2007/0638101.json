 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a microchannel reactor system for the field production of hydrogen peroxide based the electrolysis of water. The proposed approach is based on the electrolysis of water, and environmentally benign approach which is suitable for field production. The use of microchannel technology enables the miniaturization of the system and efficient operation at small scales, key for field operation and other distributed production needs. This program will demonstrate the feasibility of such approach. In addition, the program will demonstrate solar operation of the microreactor system, further enhancing system portability and reducing operational costs. \r\n\r\nHydrogen peroxide is an extremely versatile chemical with a wide range of commercial applications. However, storage and transport of concentrated hydrogen peroxide is costly, and the methods currently utilized for synthesis rely on the use of organic solvents and alkylated anthraquinones. On-site hydrogen peroxide production will eliminate the requirement to transport and store large volumes of hydrogen peroxide solution in remote locations. Microreactors offer a novel production platform that can be readily integrated with sensors, control systems and other unit operations to provide high throughput production of hydrogen peroxide suitable for bio-decontamination and wastewater treatment operations. \r\n",
