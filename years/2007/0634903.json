 "awd_abstract_narration": "Along the eastern boundary of Northeast China the subducting Pacific plate approaches depths of 600 km. The surface of Northeast China is a region of active intraplate continental magmatism and extension. The basement rock of Northeast China is composed of an Archean craton juxtaposed with a Paleozoic foldbelt. The NorthEast China Extended SeiSmic Array (NECESSArray) project is a multi-national collaborative seismic experiment to deploy 280 broadband seismometers across Northeast China to study slab behavior in the mantle transition zone, the cause of intraplate continental magmatism and tectonics, and the evolution of ancient Archean lithosphere that has undergone substantial modification. The experiment will be done in collaboration with scientists from the China Earthquake Administration (CEA), the Earthquake Research Institute (ERI) of Tokyo University and the Research Center for Prediction of Earthquakes and Volcanic Eruptions of Tohoku Univeristy, in Japan and the PI's of this proposal from the United States. In total, the Chinese will provide data from 140 broadband seismometers, the Japanese 40, and we are requesting funding to deploy 100 instruments. The maximum spacing of instruments in the array will be about 80 km with an aperture of roughly 1000 km by 1200 km and a duration of deployment of two years. \r\n\r\nThrough our collaborations we will apply all available seismic imaging techniques to the data we collect to develop a seismic image of the mantle beneath Northeast China from the crust to depths on the order of 1000 km. The seismic image of the crust and mantle will include a three-dimensional P and S velocity model with scale lengths of roughly 50 km, a reflectivity profile, and a map of anisotropy. The seismic results will be used to answer a number of questions including:\r\n1)\tDoes the subducted Pacific plate lie flat on the 660 km boundary?\r\n2)\tIf the plate is flat, how far does it extend to the west beneath Northeast China within the transition zone?\r\n3)\tDoes the plate at some point sink into the lower mantle and if so how does it do this?\r\n4)\tAre there reflectors in the top of the lower mantle beneath Northeast China as observed in other subduction zones, and if so how are they related to subducted slab in terms of mineralogy and chemistry?\r\n5)\tIs there any indication of a barrier to slab flow within the top of the lower mantle?\r\n6)\tWhat is the relationship of mantle flow above the subducted slab to the active tectonics of Northeast China ( magmatism along the North Korea-China border, magmatism and uplift along the Mongolian-China border, and extension within the Songliao basin)? 7)\tHow has the Archean mantle lithosphere been modified and deformed due to the subduction and collision history it has experienced?\r\n8)\tHas Archean mantle lithosphere truly been delaminated or has it only been modified and displaced horizontally?\r\n\r\nThe NECESS project is seismological but our results should provide constraints on the processes involved in subduction in the mantle transition zone. This in turn will provide fundamental constraints for mineral physicists and geodynamicists studying convection in the mantle as well as its mineralogy and chemical composition. The seismic images of the shallow mantle will be at an unprecedented resolution for such a large area and will include regions undergoing active tectonic processes as well as Archean lithosphere that has undergone modification. Thus our results will be important for geochemists understanding of old lithosphere modification and lead to a better understanding of the relationship between rock measurements made through studies of xenoliths and seismic observables as well as the cause of intraplate tectonics.",
