 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brown University, a founding member of the 72-member New England Science Center Collaborative (NESCC), is leading Seasons of Change, a traveling exhibit development project involving members of NESCC as well as the 31-member North Carolina Grassroots Science Museums Collaborative.  The key concept of the exhibit is how regional iconic \"harbingers\" are related to climate change - for example, the impacts of a changing climate on the maple syrup industry in New England and shifts in bird migration patterns in North Carolina. \r\n\r\nTwo customizable and modularized versions of an approximately 900 square foot exhibit on local impacts of climate change are being produced for small and medium-sized venues.  The project expects to serve approximately 1.5 million visitors in the two regions and is positioned as an innovative model for other regions of the country.  A citizen science program will be developed by staff at TERC for those participating centers with outdoor venues.  The exhibit is being designed by Jeff Kennedy Associates and MegaFun simulation software designers.  NESCC is also developing a project Web site. Goodman Research Associates is conducting both formative and summative evaluation processes on visitor learning and on the project's collaborative process.  The Association of Science-Technology Centers will manage the two tours.  \r\n\r\n",
