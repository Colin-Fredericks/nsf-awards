 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flagellar (swimming) motility allows bacteria to acquire nutrients, escape hazardous conditions, and form biofilms to allow adherence to abiotic surfaces and protection from antimicrobial substances. The production of a flagellum is one of the most highly regulated developmental processes observed in bacteria. Therefore, studies of the bacterial flagellum provide insights into mechanisms of gene regulation, signal transduction, and complex organelle assembly. Recent studies have identified a novel regulatory cascade in Listeria monocytogenes that controls production of flagella in response to temperature or infection of eukaryotic host cells. Expression of flagellar motility genes is mediated by the opposing activities of MogR, a DNA binding transcriptional repressor, and GmaR, an anti-repressor for MogR that also functions as a glycosyltransferase exhibiting beta-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) activity for flagellin (FlaA). GmaR represents the first known example of a bifunctional protein that transcriptionally regulates expression of its enzymatic substrate. The glycosyltransferase activity of GmaR is functionally separable from its anti-repression function. This project will determine the structure-function relationship governing the compartmentalization of activities within GmaR.  Whether GmaR anti-repression is mediated through a direct protein-protein interaction with the MogR DNA binding domain region or through disruption of multimerization of MogR required for binding DNA will be determined. The domain(s) of GmaR that mediate anti-repression and facilitate FlaA binding and glycosylation will also be identified. These studies will provide an understanding of how the individual activities of a bifunctional protein are compartmentalized within its primary sequence. This project will also serve as a model system for the study of protein structure for compartmentalization of multiple activities, the mechanisms for anti-repression via protein-protein interaction, and the specificity determinants for enzymatic activity of an OGT. The research project serves as a vehicle for recruiting, mentoring and multidisciplinary training of students from underrepresented groups.",
