 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complexity of modern large-scale systems has caused a transition\r\nfrom a purely perimeter-based defensive model to one where security\r\nmechanisms pervade the infrastructure. However, there has not been a\r\ncorresponding evolution in the model under which security policy\r\noperates in such environments: policies must still make independent\r\ndecisions using only partial information: just what is known by that\r\ncomponent at the time the decision is made. Thus, security policy must\r\noperate under certain assumptions that often cannot be validated. Such\r\nunchecked assumptions offer a way for attackers to bypass security by\r\nexploiting unforeseen loopholes. Consequently, administrators often\r\nuse additional security mechanisms, such as intrusion-detection\r\nsystems, that are poorly integrated with each other and with the\r\nexplicit system access-control policy.\r\n\r\nThis project is exploring the use of coordinated security policy\r\nmechanisms in heterogeneous, large-scale distributed environments. The\r\nassumptions on which security policy decisions are based are always\r\nchecked against current facts. Changes of these facts are signaled by\r\nevents propagated to other security-critical elements. Security\r\nmechanisms become dynamic, allowing for coordinated and continuous\r\npolicy re-evaluation throughout the duration of an entity's\r\ninteractions with the various components of the system. This model\r\nnaturally integrates access control, intrusion detection and other\r\ndefensive mechanisms, allowing for the unification of protection and\r\nreaction under the auspices of a common security policy. The result is\r\na more reliable and robust computing infrastructure that is resilient\r\nto new threats and attacks, and bridge the gap between the\r\ncapabilities offered by advanced defense mechanisms and the inability\r\nof security policy to take advantage of them in a coherent,\r\ncoordinated manner.",
