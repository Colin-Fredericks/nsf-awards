 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Workshop, supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of \r\nMultidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, is\r\nfocused on providing broad guidance on future directions in polymer science, \r\nengineering, and education.\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Given the major developments in scientific research in\r\npolymers and the simultaneous evolution of the polymer industry in the 10 years\r\nfollowing the last NSF Workshop on Interdisciplinary Macromolecular Science and\r\nEngineering, it is essential and timely that a new workshop be held now to identify and \r\nupdate specific science and engineering research opportunities and strategies.  At the same \r\ntime, reflecting the increasing globalization of science and technology, it is essential to\r\nexamine the polymer field under this light and to identify opportunities and challenges in \r\nterms of education and international competitiveness.  For this purpose, a two-day\r\nworkshop will be held at NSF headquarters with the participation of leading scientists,\r\nengineers, and educators from academia, industry, and national laboratories.  This\r\nworkshop is to tbe organized by a committee of six individuals representing very broad\r\nacademic and industiral perspectives and having expertise across the polymer field and its\r\ninterfaces with areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, and\r\nexngineering.  The following six topics have been identified for study and discussion\r\namong the workshop participants:  (1) Polymer synthesis and new polymeric materials,\r\n(2) Design and manipulation of complex polymer systems, (3) Computational modeling\r\nand theory, (4) Processing and assembly, (5) Characterizatin and properties, and (6)\r\nPolymer technology in the service of society.  Education and competitiveness will be\r\nwoven into each of these themes and throughout the workshop.  In addition to the six\r\nsubgroups fo 6 to 10 particpants to discuss each of the above topics, the workshop will\r\nbegin with seven plenary speakers on issues of major importance and timeliness.  These\r\nwill include hiearchical functional materials, polumers in biology and medicine, energy\r\nproduction and storage, environmental and sustainability, cyberscience and polymers, and \r\nglobal security.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  Emphasis on educaton and international competitiveness will\r\nbe given throughout the workshop and will also be the subject of a panel discussion on \r\nthe first day.  The workshop will create a web site that will be used as a tool to solicit\r\ninput and suggestions on these topics from the polymer community and to provide\r\ninformation about workshop organization, schedule, and (evenutally) conclusions.\r\nParticipants in the workshop will reflect a wide diversity and include leading senior and \r\njunior academic researchers, polyer educators, members of industry and government\r\nlaboraties to ensure that the conclustions of this workshop are broadly applicable across\r\npolymer research and education.  A few selected graduate students (to be included as\r\nassistants) will also benefit from this unique experience.  Following the workshop, the \r\norganizing committee will report to NSF on the recommendations fo the entire group, and\r\nwill subsequently publish a final report.  The report will address key new research and\r\neducation directions, as well as the changing industrial needs and global context of\r\npolymer research.  The resulting report will be broadly disseminated through publication\r\nin print and on the Internet and is expected to influence the global polymer science and \r\nengineering community.  Major interest for this workshop has been expressed by many\r\nother Federal Agencies, which are expected to participate and co-sponsor it.\r\n",
