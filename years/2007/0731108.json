There are four specific aims: (1) measures of heat delivery, cell death and heat shock protein (HSP)  expression for laser irradiated cells in solution with (CNT) carbon nanotubes (evaluations will consider the influence of tube structure, branching, dendritic formations and concentration), (2) determine temperature distributions in phantoms with CNT, (3) measure optical properties and thermal parameters associated with the tubes and their interaction with tissue, and (4) develop a computational model for predicting temperature distribution in tissue with CNT over the parametric range studied.\r\n\r\nThe successful development of CNT assisted laser therapy could have substantial influence on the success of future treatments adopted for removing tumors and fighting cancer. As such, the investigation could have broad impact with tremendous value. The study will also evaluate the efficacy of these treatments in terms of both cell viability and HSP expression, which will address the potential for tissue recurrence. Also, the project also includes the development of a new course, establishing an outreach program for high school students, a mentoring seminar series for women in both undergraduate and graduate engineering programs.\r\n",
