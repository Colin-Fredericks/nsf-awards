 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the development of new ruthenium-based chiral catalysts for enantioselective olefin metathesis. A new approach for stereoselective olefin metathesis, involving two-point association of substrates with the catalyst, will be developed, significantly expanding the scope of olefin metathesis. Issues of practicality and selectivity are particularly emphasized, and all the reactions under study can be run in air with undistilled solvents. The mechanisms of activity that are unique to the catalysts and transformations developed in this program will be elucidated. Such mechanistic information will then constitute the basis for design of new metathesis catalysts that are highly reliable and practical and exhibit unprecedented activity. The new catalysts will be used to develop new asymmetric ring-closing, ring-opening and cross-metathesis reactions. The utility of new catalysts will be demonstrated by the preparation of complex natural products. The project also aims to establish the parameters that govern directed catalytic olefin metathesis reactions as well as determine the full range of directing units that can be effectively utilized. These investigations will lead to the development of the first readily available, easily removable and effective class of chiral auxiliaries for highly stereoselective olefin metathesis.\r\n\r\nThe \"olefin metathesis\" reaction, which can efficiently afford a wide range of organic molecules that are difficult to access by other methods, has proven to be a singularly powerful and unique catalytic transformation that has already had a tremendous impact not only in organic chemistry but also in medicinal, biological and material chemistry. At the heart of the success of olefin metathesis is the efficiency of catalysts that promote these important processes. With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Amir Hoveyda, of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College, is exploring the design and function of new catalysts for the olefin metathesis reaction. Study and development of new chemical reactions is a fundamental and significant objective of modern chemistry. New reactions allow access to many important molecules that were previously out of reach. Of particular importance are the design and development of reactions that are initiated by a catalyst and deliver products that predominantly consist of a single stereoisomer (stereoselective). Within this context, the introduction of catalytic stereoselective olefin metathesis reactions will have a tremendous impact on many branches of organic chemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCatalysts are extremeely important to the abilitty of people to use chemistry to produce substantial amounts of useful and important molecules, whether they are polymers, therapeutics, electronics or used for may other reasons to enhance the quality of our lives.  Effective catalysts that are easily available, can be easily handles, are reliable to use and are cheap to prepare are incredibly important to our ability to access any molecules that we need in a realistic time frame, at a realistic cost and without damaging our environment for the future generations.\n\nIn this project, we have been able to develop probably the world's best catalysts (best meaning that our catalytsts satisfy many if not all the above requirements) for what is widely considered the most important and powerful transformation in all of chemistry: olefin metathesis.  This is a reaction that allows one to take two C&ndash;C double bonds, a double bond between two atoms that are the basis of all life on earth (organic chemistry) and tie them together so that we have a new double bond!  The byproduct is a small gas molecule: ethylene that just evaporates away.  Why do we need to make new olefins?  They are use in virually every important process from reactions that lead to formation of anti-cancer, anti-AIDS, anti-diabetes drugs to polymers that we can make kitchenware with.\n\nIn brief, through this NSF funded project, we are able to make many otherwise difficult-to-access molecules available at low cost and in a reliable and environmentally friendly fashion.\n\nBut the proof of the pudding is in the eating!  And we have the proof.  Many of the catalysts designed and developed through funding made available by the NSF are now sold to chemists across the world.  Our most recent catalysts were licensed soon after discovery; three companies contacted us for the rights to the catalysts.  Every student of chemistry, every researcher in the chemical or pharmaceutical industry knows about and uses our catalysts.\n\nTo be able to work on projects that have such strong and immediate impact on human life is a fantastic way of exciting young students, from high school to college to gradaute students that they can have a highly satisfying and most exciting life as research scientists.  Indeed a significant number of graduates of our research group, many of whom were part of this NSF-funded project now hold leadership positions in academia and industry.  Examples are Beth Sattely who is a junior faculty as Stanford, Kevin Brown who teaches at University of Indiana, Pam Lombardi who is on the facultry of Stonehill College and Dennis Gillingham who is a faculty member at the University of Basel in Switzerland.  Josh Van Veldhuizen is a senior research scientist at Gilliad in Seattle, and Steve Garber teaches at a community college in Colorado.\n\nIt is critical to us that the projects that we work on not only have a strong impact on the field of science and modern technology but also that they train the future leaders of our field.  Based on such standards, we have been blessed with a great deal of success in this NSF-funded project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amir Hoveyda"
