 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\n\tThe properties of macromolecular materials constructed by directed- and self-assembly techniques will be studied. The ability to precisely craft non-dendritic, metal-based (charged) fractal polymers (via terpyridine-metal-terpyridine connectivity) will lay the foundation to create many new materials based on ionic interactions (with species such as dendrimers, classical polymers, and other fractal-based constructs). It has been demonstrated that these fractals self-assemble to give ordered fibers and rods; the introduction of appropriately charged species as counter ions, (such as dendrimers, porphyrins, and oxidized carbon nanotubes) is expected to (1) lead to novel materials possessing new and interesting electronic phenomena and (2) provide energy storage and release devices. Incorporation of rigid shape-persistence within the building blocks of the polymeric fractals will stabilize a 3-dimensional framework for forming \"macromolecular-sized\" void regions capable of acting as sites for (1) catalysis, (2) molecular inclusion or (3) connectors for single-walled carbon nanotubes. Work in the area of terpyridineCuII coordination with carboxylate ions has already led to the crafting of reversible carbon nanotube networks. Combining this coordination phenomenon with carboxylate-terminated dendrimers will allow the creation of \"spheres-within-spheres\" with unrestricted rotation predicated on the ability to form a polymerized network around the copper-bound dendrimer (followed by quantitative removal of the Cu-coordinating species). Employing terpyridine moieties possessing masked, carboxylate termini will facilitate the creation of multiple spheres-within-spheres that can be likened to \"bucky onions.\" Multiple layers with differing metals will be crafted and their tunable electronic characteristics will be investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nNew materials will be constructed based on the physical interactions of charged species and their potential to fit, or pack, in a precisely ordered manner. This will lead to new types of electronic devices, such as molecular batteries. New spherical materials possessing freely rotating internal spherical elements will be studied for use as shields for toxic materials and a molecular-scale compass. These areas of research are important with respect to the \"miniaturization\" of components for micro-electro-mechanical systems, sensors, and new photovoltaic devices. Educational opportunities arise from the training and development of scientists at all levels. Educational outreach is promulgated through the principal investigator's website (www.dendrimers.com), which currently averages 6,000-7,000 visits per month, as well as presentations at area schools, universities and conferences. Industrial and international collaborations will continue supporting the necessity of interdisciplinary integration.\r\n\r\n",

We have focused on design and development of parameters for the construction of nanoscale and macromolecular materials that have included: (1) metal-connected components; (2) geometry-based interconnectivity and interactions for directed bottom-up (step-wise assembly starting from an initial foundation) and self-assembly approaches whereby complex materials can be generated in a single step; (3) the potential to craft polymetallic arrays and networks possessing differing, heterogeneous metal centers that are precisely positioned to take advantage of any intercomponent interactions; and (4) the ability to exploit the unique physical properties associated with these new materials. &nbsp;In many cases, these unique megastructures were also explored for their ability to self-organize into networks and new materials based on lipophilic-hydrophilic and ionic interactions, as well as for their potential to participate in host-guest relationships. For example, new materials have been constructed that exhibit unique absorption and emission properties based on metal-component &nbsp;connectivity and interactions (Image 1).&nbsp; An overall perspective was maintained that incorporated functionalized nano- and macroscale development with that of the spatial arts, mathematics, and material science by incorporating similar shapes at differing size scales (<em>i.e</em>., known as 'self-similarity') in our molecular construction.&nbsp;This can be seen in many of the cyclic, metal-based networks we have prepared and studied, such as in Image 2 that depicts an idealized filled-in representation of a nanoscale (8 nm) metal-based, spoked wheel structure and its electron micrograph picture. Uniquely, this molecule spontaneously assembles due to complementary building block design. Advancement towards these goals has also included the examination of the coordinated and directed assembly of rod-based structures into ribbon-like materials (Image 3). Engineering of these types of materials facilitates the enhancement of electronic properties.

Providing appropriately staged conceptual and technical scientific challenges student laboratory competence and skills were addressed while instilling and nurturing critical thinking, requisite for all disciplines, as well as everyday life experiences (Images 5 and 6). Participation of underrepresented groups and minorities were encouraged through direct support and community outreach projects, as well as inner-city school presentations and K-12 teacher involvement that broadly promoted scientific and technical understanding.
