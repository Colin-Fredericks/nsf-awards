 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symplectic Field Theory (SFT) project, initiated a few years ago by A. Givental, \r\nH. Hofer and the PI of this proposal,   had two main  initial goals. First,  to develop a formalism for the theory of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds  (Gromov-Witten theory) in a spirit of a Topological Field Theory, and second, to find  new invariants of contact manifolds and their Legendrian submanifolds. However, later on there were discovered many new connections of SFT with other areas of Mathematics, and in particular with the theory of integrable systems and String Topology. The main directions of research of   the proposed  phase   of the project are:   completion of analytic foundations  SFT;  further development and expansion  of the algebraic formalism of the SFT to include  TCFT and Givental's loop groop formalism in   Gromov-Witten theory;   development of the full relative version of SFT, which  would adequatelly describe the structure of the compactified moduli spaces of holomorphic curves with mixed  asymptotic and Lagrangian boundary conditions; study of the relation between quantum integrable systems of SFT and classical integrable  systems of Gromov-Witten theory; development of computational techniques for invariants arising in SFT; applications of SFT to low-dimensional topology.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n Symplectic Field Theory is at the crossroads of several mathematical disciplines and  its development  already had, and as a result of the current research should  have even  a bigger impact on a number of different areas  of Mathematics, such as Symplectic  Geometry,  Hamiltonian Dynamics, String Topology, Low-dimensional Topology,  Topology of Moduli Spaces and Theory of Integrable Systems.  It is also of interest  for Mathematical Physics.  The current project should further clarify the relations  between  SFT and these disciplines. One of the goals of the project is to write a book   intended   as a basic  reference, as well as  a ``user guide\" for mathematicians \r\ninterested  in applications of SFT. \r\n\r\n",
