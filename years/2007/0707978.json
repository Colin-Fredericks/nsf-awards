This project improves our understanding of\r\nsuperlenses and invisibility, particularly for spherical\r\nsuperlenses, which not only superresolve but also magnify.  It\r\nalso seeks to characterize exotic electromagnetic behaviors that\r\ncomposite materials formed from constituent materials with\r\nextreme properties can exhibit in the quasistatic limit, where\r\nthe wavelength of the time-harmonic radiation is much larger than\r\nthe microstructure.  The investigator also studies a new class of\r\nmaterial named \"massnetic materials.\"  These have in their\r\nmicrostructure collections of spinning tops, each situated in a\r\ncavity in the body, and each weighted on one side by a mass that\r\nallows one to increase or decrease the spin of each top by\r\nappropriately oscillating the body.  These materials should be\r\nable to store and release energy on the microscale.  The\r\ninvestigator also explores new equations of elastodynamics, and\r\nstudies novel microstructures with the unusual property that\r\ntheir average momentum depends not just on their overall\r\nvelocity, but also on how they are deformed, i.e. on their\r\nstrain. \r\n\r\n     Metamaterials, i.e. composite materials with properties\r\nunachievable in ordinary materials, have attracted a great deal\r\nof interest and are beginning to revolutionize our understanding\r\nof materials and the properties they can exhibit.  More\r\ntechnogical applications of these materials are now possible due\r\nto advances in our ability to tailor the microstructure of\r\nsubstances, for instance through nanotechnology.  This project\r\nstudies how composites can be constructed from high contrast\r\nmaterials to exhibit elastic and electromagnetic properties far\r\nricher than existing materials.  In the defence, automotive,\r\naerospace, electronics, and other manufacturing and\r\ntelecommunication industries there is a constant need for new\r\nmaterials.  The impact of such new materials is likely to be\r\ngreatest when their properties are radically different from any\r\nmaterial we know.  The project could lead to the development of\r\nwhole classes of radically different new materials with novel\r\nproperties.  Also it should give a much needed firm theoretical\r\nfoundation to Pendry's work on spherical superlenses, and enhance\r\nour understanding of invisibility.",
