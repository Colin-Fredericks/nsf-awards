Ostermann\r\n\r\nThis award for an REU Site at the University of Kansas Center for Research, Inc. supports 10 undergraduate students each year for three years. The primary objectives of the program are to: 1) engage undergraduate students in stimulating, cutting-edge research projects focused on interfaces and interfacial phenomena in chemical engineering; 2) provide students with exposure to the breadth of industries influenced by chemical engineering such as advanced materials, energy, biomedical, environmental remediation, catalysis, etc.; and 3) provide a unique opportunity for a diverse population of undergraduates from across the U.S. to interact academically and socially, aimed at building a more integrated network of graduating chemical engineers.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the research experience, the students will participate in academic seminars, social gatherings, trips to local industries, and professional development workshops.  Finally, the students will participate in an ethics seminar series to develop ethical thinking skills to complement their research skills.\r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will focus on minority and female participants as well as students from institutions without significant research programs.  Participants will be recruited nationally from chemical engineering, environmental engineering, and the natural sciences.\r\n",
