 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2007.  The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in US science. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Vibration communication in the Gryllotalpidae (Insecta: Orthoptera): sensitivity to and production of substrate-borne signals in intra-specific communication.\"  This research seeks to identify and characterize the sensitivity to vibration in both the winged, sound producing prairie mole cricket ( Gryllotalpa major) and the apterous and tympanum-lacking New Zealand mole cricket (Triamescaptor aotea).   The following questions are being investigated in both species: 1. What are the neurophysical response ranges in frequency and intensity to seismic stimuli? 2. Does either species produce seismic communication signals in the presence of conspecifics of either sex? If so, what are the characters of these signals? Field-collected individuals of both sexes of each species are being tested for sensitivity to and production of seismic signals.  The sponsoring scientist is Andrew C. Mason at the University of Toronto at Scarborough. \r\n \r\nThe training objectives focus on the enhancement of skills required for independent projects designed to describe the mechanisms and functions of communication in insects. The training program provides instruction in neurophysiological instrumentation designed to measure neural responses to sound and vibration in insects and other arthropods. Moreover, technical laboratory experiences are combined with data analysis training in advanced statistical measures to refine the skills needed to effectively analyze data procured in neuroethological studies. \r\n",
