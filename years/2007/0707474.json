Star formation, chemical history, ionization processes, transport of heavy elements, cooling and heating of the gas, formation and destruction of molecules, and the production and transport of ionizing radiation from the first stars and quasars, will all benefit from the developed modeling algorithms, which will be incorporated into publicly accessible numerical simulations.  This research will help to understand the evolution of galaxies, stars, and gas in the high-redshift Universe, including current and future observations at optical, ultra-violet, infrared, and sub-millimeter wavelengths.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator (PI) and his team members will continue their long record of giving numerous educational and public presentations of research and general-interest astronomy.  The PI has sponsored high school students in summer projects, and expects to continue doing so.  He is also active in graduate and postdoctoral training, and national and professional service organizations.  Previous research by this group has promoted several general tools, including new simulation codes and the application of atomic and molecular physics to interstellar and intergalactic studies, as well as to spectrum formation codes.",
