 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a product for a reversible contrast enhancement layer (R-CEL) using semiconductor nanocrystalline materials.  The R-CEL technology, if successfully developed, will enable finer resolution optical lithography postponing the need for more expensive techniques such as electron beam or x-ray lithography. R-CEL technology will help to extend the diffraction limit facing optical lithography by enabling double exposure techniques to be used for pattern definition. \r\n\r\nThe use of R-CEL with double exposure will increase the capability of optical lithography thus enabling the extension of Moore's Law without the need to switch to more expensive alternatives.  It will also help restore the technological competitiveness of domestic vendors in the lithography industry.   The SBIR project will also advance the understanding of semiconductor nanocrystal characteristics including detailed absorption and recombination processes and the effect of nanocrystal surface conditions on dispersion with polymers. This information will be valuable in other semiconductor nanocrystal UV applications including optical storage, UV light sources and detectors.\r\n",
