 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing with pictures is an intuitive way to introduce secondary school students to information technology (IT), so this ITEST Comprehensive Project for Students and Teachers is centered on introducing Computer Vision and Imaging experiences into the core curriculum of mathematics and IT. Each year, twenty teachers and sixty incoming tenth grade students in the Greater Orlando area are involved in learning about and interacting with modules that explore the relationship between mathematics and pictorial computing. The areas of computer vision and imaging science are exciting because of their applications to such diverse areas as art, medicine, security, and entertainment. The modules focus on creating an understanding of the mathematical science that underlies pictorial algorithms. Inquiry-based learning, friendly team competition to develop a game, and a supportive, nurturing environment provide the educational framework so the experiences can be enjoyed by all. \r\n\r\nThe teachers receive 120 hours of summer professional experience at the beginning of the PROFIT year, are supported by 40 hours of follow-up year-round contact in monthly weekend activities that include interactions with local IT companies, and attend a 40-hour reflective workshop at the end of the PROFIT year. The teachers also teach the students in the 80-hour Summer Institute. The students attend the Summer Institute, visit the university after school throughout the year, and attend quarterly weekend social events where they and their parents interact with local industry. Additionally, about 1500 students a year have immediate contact with PROFIT through modules introduced into the core classes regularly taught by the teachers.\r\n\r\nIndustry is a significant partner in PROFIT via an Industrial Affiliation mechanism that exposes the teachers and students to industry speakers, industrial tours, high-school level internship opportunities, and job shadowing. \r\n",
