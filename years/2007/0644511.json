 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIn this five-year proposed CAREER project, newly developed ultra low-power chemical and\r\nturbidity sensors will work alongside low-power commercially-available temperature, pressure\r\nand flow sensors to provide high-density remote sampling of the watershed environment in\r\neastern Kentucky.\r\nScientific Merit:\r\nThe scientific goal of this project is to build and use a low-cost sensor platform for real-time\r\nwater quality monitoring. Original research will be conducted into ultra low-power chemical and\r\nturbidity sensors. These micro- and nanofabricated components will be integrated into a\r\nmacroscale sensor network using off-the-shelf wireless networking hardware and open-source\r\nsoftware that has recently become available. Wireless communication nodes will each connect to\r\ndozens of low-power submersible sensors at different depths; since depths and sensor types\r\ndepend on the application, a standard electrical and mechanical sensor interface will allow users\r\nto easily customize the network. The end result will be a new set of low-cost research tools\r\navailable to help environmental and geological researchers ask new scientific questions, backed\r\nby the ability to carry out watershed monitoring projects with greater data resolution than ever\r\nbefore.\r\nBroader Impact/Educational Activities:\r\nEducational activities focus on using the sensor network to monitor water quality in eastern\r\nKentucky. Due to the rugged Appalachian terrain, previous studies of the region's water quality\r\nhave not been carried out at high resolution. Mining, agriculture, and natural events contribute to\r\nboth degradation of water quality and changes in the hydrological dynamics of ground and\r\nsurface water flow, yet the impracticality of accessing a remote streambed during a storm, and the\r\nlow spatial density of conventional sampling, have made it difficult to pinpoint the source of a\r\nchange in water quality without after-the-fact laboratory techniques. The broader impact of these\r\nremote access real-time water quality maps will be an improved ability to monitor, understand,\r\nand mitigate sources of pollution affecting human and ecological communities.\r\nTwo groups of Kentucky students, one in urban Louisville and another in rural eastern\r\nKentucky, will participate in the project's educational activities. Sensor fabrication and testing\r\nwill be conducted at the University of Louisville by first-year students in our Introduction to\r\nEngineering curriculum. Because this project fits into the larger context of improving the natural\r\nenvironment, it may attract students who have not previously considered majoring in electrical\r\nand computer engineering due to unfamiliarity with the purpose and variety of career options in\r\nthe field. These underrepresented students come disproportionately from the female and minority\r\npopulation.\r\nThis project will also establish a collaborative link between the engineering school at the\r\nUniversity of Louisville and Eastern Kentucky University, which does not have an engineering\r\ndepartment. Field testing, data collection, and analysis will be conducted by students at Eastern\r\nKentucky University via the Eastern Kentucky Environmental Research Institute, which was\r\ncreated in 2005 with funds from the National Science Foundation's Experimental Program to\r\nStimulate Competitive Research (NSF-EPSCoR). Its purpose is to foster interdisciplinary\r\nresearch into understanding the effect of environmental function on eastern and central\r\nKentucky's land, air and water, and to encourage both undergraduate and graduate student\r\nparticipation in the design and execution of research projects, particularly field-based research\r\nactivities. Early in the project, professors, students and community members will specify sensors\r\nto best complement the monitoring methods they are currently using. In return, they will obtain\r\nnew research instruments, and hands-on experience with cutting-edge wireless sensor network technology.",
