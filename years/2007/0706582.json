 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nAn experimental study into the origins of anisotropic thermal conductivity of solid\r\npolymers is proposed. In particular, a relationship between the molecular structure of\r\nthe polymer and the resulting macroscopic properties is sought. It has already been\r\nestablished that (1) deformed, cross-linked elastomers exhibit an anisotropic thermal\r\nconductivity tensor, k (2) the tensor k is linearly related to the extra stress tensor,\r\nfor the polymer in the same state, and (3) the constant of relation for these two\r\nquantities exhibits a universal value of 0.03, independent of chemistry for the few\r\nsystems studied, when properly made dimensionless. In this work a set of experiments\r\nhas been designed that will distinguish between competing theories to describe these\r\nobservations. A non-invasive optical technique called Forced Rayleigh Light Scattering\r\nto examine novel material states is used. Results will necessarily distinguish between\r\ncompeting theories on the origins of the effect.\r\nThe results of the study will have broad impact on the transport modeling of advanced\r\nmaterials containing plastic. While previous work showed how non-isothermal\r\nmodeling of liquids requires an additional complexity because of anisotropy, it also\r\nsuggested that this complexity could be easily modeled through use of a phenomenological\r\nrelation to stress. The current work, if successful, should determine if similar\r\nprinciples apply to the solid polymer during cooling.\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nAn experimental study into the origins of how heat flows differently in different\r\ndirections for solid polymers, such as plastic, is proposed. In particular, a relationship\r\nbetween how the molecules are behaving and the resulting heat-flow properties\r\nis sought. In this work a set of experiments has been designed that will distinguish\r\nbetween competing theories to describe these observations using a non-invasive optical\r\ntechnique called Forced Rayleigh Light Scattering. Results will necessarily distinguish\r\nbetween competing theories on the origins of the effect.\r\nThe results of the study will have broad impact on the modeling of advanced materials\r\ncontaining plastic. While previous work showed how temperature modeling of these\r\nliquids requires an additional complexity, it also suggested that this complexity could\r\nbe easily modeled through use of a simple relation to stress which is typically calculated\r\nalready. The current work, if successful, should determine if similar principles\r\napply to the solid polymer during cooling.\r\nSecondly, as part of the project, a display explaining the key optical technique employed\r\nwill be provided to the Holography Museum in Chicago. Visitors will learn that\r\nholography is used to study material properties, and how the technique is employed.",
