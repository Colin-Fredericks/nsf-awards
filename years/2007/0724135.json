 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe plant cell wall has the greatest impact on the use of cereal grains for human benefit because the major nutrients, starch, and proteins in these grains are enclosed within endosperm cell walls within the seed. Endosperm cell walls are composed mainly of arabino(glucuron)xylan (AGX, 70%) and mix-linked glucan (MLG, 20%). The deposition of these polymers during endosperm development is highly ordered, which makes wheat endosperm an excellent system to use for the identification of genes involved in AGX biosynthesis. No AGX-biosynthetic genes have been identified. Therefore, success in identifying the polypeptides involved in this process will open new avenues to crop improvement and contribute to plant-breeding programs. The objective of this project is to identify and analyze the function of candidate genes, namely xylan synthase (TaXylS) genes involved in AGX biosynthesis in wheat. This work will lead to a basic understanding of AGX biosynthesis as it relates to cell wall biosynthesis and growth of seeds. Results may provide an initial step for engineering plants with improved cell wall properties to meet the needs of the wood, paper, textile, fuel, and food industries. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide valuable research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. All students will be trained in cell, developmental, molecular and computation biology.  Ohio University is located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in southeast Ohio, a predominantly rural setting, and draws 25% of its undergraduate population from the surrounding Appalachian region of Ohio and West Virginia. \r\n\r\n",
