 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12).  This project is forging connections between community college faculty and the national chemical education community in order to improve teaching and learning in foundational chemistry courses.  This is being done by supporting 20 two-year college faculty members per year to attend and possibly present at three national American Chemical Society (ACS) Meetings using NSF Catalyzed Innovations in Two Year Colleges Symposia as well as at two summer Biennial Conference on Chemistry Education (BCCE) Meeting Workshops.  The planned mixing of 2 and 4-year faculty is promoting the creation of a community with an increased knowledge of NSF funded innovations and providing role models and mentoring for faculty who are interested in obtaining external grants.  The broader impact of this project is found in improving both the quality of chemistry courses in community colleges and the participation of chemistry faculty in the larger chemical education community. The substantial numbers of both STEM majors who attend community colleges and K-12 teachers who received their science education at community colleges add to the project's broader impact.",
