 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nProgramming a sensor network is quite hard, since it forces the programmer\r\nto program in low-level languages that exposes details of the hardware, \r\nmake low-level optimization decisions, and build a great deal of network\r\nmachinery. A programming methodology is sorely needed that will allow\r\na user to specify the overall functionality of the application at a\r\n high-level using a suitable programming framework.\r\nIdeally, the specified user program would be automatically translated \r\nto optimized distributed code that runs on individual nodes.\r\n\r\nThis project attempts to realize the above vision by viewing the sensor\r\nnetwork as a distributed database of facts gathered from the environment. \r\nThe belief is that the collaborative behavior of a sensor network\r\napplication can be easily abstracted in terms of deductive rules\r\nthat manipulate the facts, while the non-collaborative behavior can be\r\n embedded in built-in functions.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the project is to develop a query engine for efficient\r\n in-network evaluation of deductive queries in sensor networks.  \r\nThe query processing plan includes translation of the user program \r\ninto optimized virtual memory code, which is downloaded into the sensor \r\nnodes for distributed execution. The research results would be prototyped\r\nin networking simulators (TOSSIM and ns2) and in real sensor network \r\nplatforms based on Berkeley motes and Gumstix-like boards.\r\n\r\nThe above research plan has the potential of greatly simplifying the \r\ndesign and use of sensor networks, by bundling all the low-level \r\ncomplexities of design choices and optimizations in the query engine.\r\nExamples of domains that will benefit from our contributions include \r\nground traffic, emergency response and disaster relief operations,\r\nphysical phenomenon such as weather and storm tracking, \r\nforest fire tracking, migration patterns of animals/birds, etc.\r\n\r\nThe project web site (http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~hgupta/logicSense)\r\nwill be used for dissemination of all course materials, publications, \r\nand software that result from our project.\r\n",
