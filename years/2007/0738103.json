Carbon fiber based copper matrix materials have been widely used in those industries.  However, the use of carbon nanotubes instead of carbon fibers offers opportunities to improve properties of these materials.  The proposal addresses the issue of how to manufacture copper composites embedded with carbon nanotubes.  The investigators propose to use numerical and experimental methods to achieve this objective. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThis international partnership takes advantage of combined expertise to resolve the problem of creating and modeling \"extreme\" composites with carbon nanotubes.  Theory, modeling and simulations will be carried out at Florida State University, while the French group will conduct the experimental work.  The proposed research will advance understanding of the thermo-mechanical properties needed to create to novel materials for use by the electronic and power industries.  Education aspects involve training of US students in the experimental techniques developed by the French researchers.\r\n",
