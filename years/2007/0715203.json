 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on novel self-phasing antenna array technology that allows secure communication within a distributed network of mobile agents that have no prior knowledge of their respective locations. The specific application of this proposal is for covert terrestrial sensor and nanosatellite networks. Despite the need for distributed intelligence systems to maintain reliable, up-to-date, uncompromised intelligence data dissemination capabilities throughout the entire network, they are often targeted by terrorist attacks. In many cases, these systems are easily detected by conspicuous antenna structures or the high concentration of radio-frequency emission in their vicinity. this research is to develop retrodirective antenna arrays to facilitate covert communications between a distributed terrestrial sensor network and an information gathering nanosatellite network. In contrast to conventional phased-array antennas, retrodirective arrays are self-phasing and are capable of providing self-steering, point-to-point radio crosslink. Retrodirective arrays located at the terrestrial sensors are used to autonomously uplink intelligence data to the satellite. Retrodirective arrays aboard the satellite are used to establish secure satellite-to-satellite crosslinks. The broader impacts of the proposed research will result in more secure, efficient data transmission in wireless networks that are of interest to the scientific, defense, and intelligence communities. The research will also support multidisciplinary training of students in areas that are of critical national importance.\r\n\r\n",
