 "awd_abstract_narration": "The centerpiece of this project is the continuation of year-round operations and calibration of a high resolution Fabry-Perot spectrometer at the University of Canterbury's Mount John Astronomical Observatory, NZ (44 deg S) that the PI has been conducting for the last 14 years.  These observations will lay the foundation for the derivation of a statistically meaningful long-term mesospheric and lower thermospheric climatology including both winds and temperatures for the  Mid-latitude Southern hemisphere atmosphere.  Comparison between Mount John (southern hemisphere) and Fritz Peak (northern hemisphere) wind and temperature climatologies will be used to investigate inter-hemispherical differences in atmospheric dynamical behavior.  Additional objectives that will be explored as part of this project include:  comparison between simultaneous common volume observations of winds with the optical technique and both meteor and MF radar techniques at and near Mount John; combining radar and optical techniques to determine and characterize airglow altitude dependencies; and comparison with planned optical imager investigations at Mount John to investigate short-periodicity wind and temperature oscillations that have recently been discovered in the observations.  \r\n\r\nThe planned activities will be conducted as part of an established U.S.-New Zealand international cooperative project.  In addition, through international cooperation and collaboration under the aegis of the Antarctic Aeronomy Consortium the observations in New Zealand (Mount John, Birdlings Flat) will be combined with observations in Australia (Adelaide, Beveridge), Argentina (El Leoncito, Buenos Aires) and Antarctica (Scott Base, Arrival Heights, Mawson, Davis, South Pole) to extend the climatological studies of planetary-scale and tidal wave activity to cover large fractions of both the midlatitude and high-latitude Southern Hemisphere. Collaboration with a theoretical modeling scientist to further interpret and investigate the implications of the observational findings has also been established.  Graduate and undergraduate students will participate both in the observational and data analysis parts of the planned research program.  Knowledge of atmospheric behavior at Southern Hemisphere latitudes is an important ingredient in fully understanding Global Climate Change and its human implications.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nInvestigation of the Southern Hemisphere's mid-latitude upper\natmosphere is part and parcel for our understanding the Earth's\natmosphere.  Although it has been tempting to perceive the Southern\nHemisphere as a mirror image of the Northern Hemisphere, it is becoming\nclear this is not the case.  The existence of the Southern polar vortex\nhas been shown to affect the behavior of this hemisphere's atmospheric\nregion. The sparseness of land at the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude\nhas limited long-term investigations there; New Zealand's strategic\nlocation provides a unique opportunity such long-term midlatitude\natmospheric investigations and, with the collaboration of our New\nZealand colleagues, we have been carrying an in-depth long-term study\nof upper atmosphere.\n\nOur specific studies in New Zealand have consisted of the determination\nof the optical Doppler shifts (winds) and Doppler widths (kinetic\ntemperature) of the naturally occurring neutral particle emissions of\nthe night sky, from which we can study the dynamical and\nthermodynamical behavior of the atmosphere.  Our rugged and\nnearly-autonomous instrumentation (located at the University of\nCanterbury's Mount John Observatory) has been shown to be stable to\nbetter than one part per billion per year (ppb/yr) for decades, thus\nproviding known quality measurements over the long term.  Our\ninvestigations over the years have attracted (graduate) students\ninterested in hands-on unique experimental work, with results whose\ninterpretation have advanced knowledge in the field.  These 11 students\nhave received Ph.D and MS degrees.\n\nThe already existing complementary, University of Canterbury operated,\nmedium-frequency (MF) and astronomical meteor radars (the latter being\nadaptable to atmospheric motion studies) have provided a unique\nopportunity for an international collaboration, now extending for over\ntwo decades, to study both the motions and thermal behavior of the\nSouthern midlatitude atmosphere at 44$degree$S.  Among our earlier\ncombined studies, the three ground-based instruments showed the motions\nmeasured by them to be the same (within the uncertainties of\nmeasurement) as well as to provide a determination of the height of\nemission for the optically derived motion measurements.  The optical\nheight of emission was also determined independently by comparison with\nthe WINDII instrument on the UARS satellite.\n\nOne of the notable findings of our NZ studies has been the observed\ncooling of the mesosphere and lower-thermosphere (MALT) both earlier\nthan and during solar activity maximum. This result applies regardless\nwhether sunspot number or the F10.7 index is used to denote solar\nactivity.  This effect is shown in Figure 1 for the yearly averages at\nMount John for both the lower thermosphere (nominally at 95 km altitude\nand denoted by the measured emission of atomic oxygen OI) and the\nmesosphere (nominally at 87 km altitude and denoted by the measured\nemission of molecular hydroxil OH).  Figure 2 illustrates the Mount\nJohn mesospheric OH daily temperature (935 points) data for the same\nperiod as Figure 1 and solar activity as a scatter plot showing a\n(statistically) significant negative dependence of the mesospheric\ntemperature with solar activity.  This negative dependence was reported\nearlier in the 1970s by us and by a Sodium lidar study at the Northern\nHemisphere. Other studies, albeit not as long as the ones mentioned\nhere, have reported a positive temperature dependence with solar\nactivity.  A detailed report on our findings including the data shown\nhere) and their interpretation is in preparation.\n\nThe recent installation of a Boston University all-sky imager, at the\nsame location as our instrumentation, has enlarged the scope of our\nstudies to include the investigation of the relation between the\napparent motion of brightness features observed by the imager and the\nmass motions (wind) determined from Doppler shifts by our equipment.\nThis new direction has been the driving ..."
