 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) is an interdisciplinary research and education program established in April, 2000 to investigate the relative importance of land and ocean processes in structuring ecosystems at the land-sea margin. The principal study area is the Santa Barbara Channel and the coastal watersheds that drain into it, and the focal ecosystem is giant kelp forests, which occur on shallow rocky reefs at the interface of the land-sea margin throughout the study area and other temperate coasts throughout the world. The major focus of the work proposed here is developing a predictive understanding of the structural and functional responses of giant kelp forest ecosystems to environmental forcing from the land and the sea. The amount of nutrients and organic matter delivered to the kelp forest from land and the surrounding ocean varies in response to short- and long-term changes in climate, ocean conditions and land use. Variation in the supply of these commodities interacts with physical disturbance to influence the abundance and species composition of the forest inhabitants and the ecological services that they provide. The overarching question of the proposed research is: How do abiotic drivers acting over different spatial and temporal scales interact to influence kelp forest structure and function?\r\n\r\nTo address this question the investigators will focus research around three general themes: (1) The influence of abiotic press and pulse drivers on rates of delivery of N and C to giant kelp forests, (2) The direct and interactive effects of key press and pulse drivers on kelp forest community structure and function through the modification of nutrient supply and wave disturbance, and (3) The indirect effects of pulse and press drivers on kelp forest community structure and function and the feedbacks between structure and function. The research will take advantage of a variety of approaches that include: (1) Coordinated long-term measurements of key abiotic drivers and ecological response variables, (2) Manipulative field experiments designed to isolate the causal mechanisms underlying the patterns observed in long-term measurements, (3) Measurement-intensive process studies aimed at obtaining a mechanistic understanding of processes that cannot be isolated using manipulative experiments, and (4) Integrated synthesis using modeling and analyses that allow for predictions beyond the spatial and temporal scope of SBC data, and that help guide the direction of future research. These efforts will be facilitated by SBC LTER's information management system which focuses on data organization integrity and preservation as well as provision of web-based access to a variety of different users. \r\n\r\nEducation and training are tightly integrated into all aspects of the research. The scientists/educators have successfully developed a multifaceted, interdisciplinary approach to education and outreach that highlights and integrates the research interests of SBC LTER investigators, students, and the general public. The programs include active links with K-12 students and teachers, graduate and undergraduate student training, direct public outreach, and productive interactions with the media, local NGOs and agencies. The outreach and education programs will continue to expand during the next six years as collaborations mature and attract additional support from participants and agencies. This interdisciplinary group of scientists are committed to sharing research findings with resource managers, decision makers, stakeholders, and the general public who are interested in applying the findings to policy issues concerning natural resources, coastal management, and land use.  \r\n",
