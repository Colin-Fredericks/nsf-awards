 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the approximate solution of certain\r\nsystems of evolution partial differential equations (PDE) arising at\r\nthe intersection of mathematical physics and geometric analysis.\r\nSuch systems of equations, known as Geometric PDE, with both constraints\r\nand gauge degrees of freedom, appear in a wide range of physical and\r\nmathematical problems; examples include Maxwell's equations (or more\r\ngenerally the Yang-Mills equations on a curved background), and\r\nEinstein's field equations and other Hamiltonian systems with an\r\ninfinite-dimensional symmetry group. The Cauchy formulation for such \r\nsystems yields a constrained evolution system which has to be augmented \r\nwith gauge-fixing conditions in order to get a unique evolution vector field.\r\nThe project will involve constructing finite element discretizations\r\nfor solving such geometric PDE systems; various techniques for dealing\r\nwith evolution systems with constraints will be analyzed, including\r\nconstraint-projection using variational techniques (where the numerical\r\nsolution is projected back to the constraint manifold after\r\nsome number of time steps), the use of special finite elements which\r\nautomatically solve the linearized constraints and thereby remain on a\r\npiecewise-linear approximation to the constraint manifold, and finally\r\nleast-squares approaches which only control the constraints rather than\r\nenforce them. In particular, stability results guaranteeing convergence\r\nof the numerical solution to the continuum solution will be derived,\r\nat least for the linearized equations.  A posteriori error estimates will \r\nbe derived for studying properties of the discretizations, and for \r\nbuilding adaptive methods.\r\n\r\nThis project involves the design, development, and implementation of\r\nnew mathematical and computational techniques for solving a large class \r\nof important, challenging, and pressing mathematical problems in\r\nmultiscale and multiphysics modeling and simulation.  The techniques \r\ndeveloped will lead to the aquisition of new knowledge in areas of \r\nscience such as relatistic astrophysics, by making possible more reliable \r\nand accurate simulations of phenomena such as gravitational collapse, \r\nnonlinear stability of deformed rotating black holes, binary black hole \r\ncollision, and the production and emission of gravitational radiation.\r\nMost of these problems are currently of great interest due to the \r\nrecent construction of gravitational wave detectors such as the NSF-funded\r\nLIGO devices in Lousiana and Washington.  The results from this project \r\nwill have a broad impact on areas of mathematics such as geometric analysis,\r\nas well as in astrophysics and general relativity.  The methods developed \r\nhere will contribute to the advancement of numerical methods for complex \r\nthree-dimensional constrained nonlinear dynamical simulations, and the \r\ntechnology produced will provide powerful tools for the exploration of \r\nmodels in astrophysics and relativity as well as in some areas of pure \r\nmathematics such as geometric analysis.\r\n",
