 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate improved corrosion resistance of iron and aluminum alloys by coating the alloys with a durable superhydrophobic coating. The corrosion of metal has a major effect on the economy of industrial nations. The costs associated with corrosion are in the billions of dollars annually.  The superhydrophobic coating is a highly water repellent coating that is composed of hydrophobic chemicals and nano-sized particles. The coating is applied onto the metal surface to create a hydrophobic surface that is nanotextured. The presence of water plays an integral role in most metal corrosion processes and the nanotextured hydrophobic thin film prevents liquid water from wetting/adhering to the metal surface. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the use of the superhydrophobic coating for metal corrosion protection, the use of a primer layer that is applied underneath the superhydrophobic coating is examined. The primer layers to be investigated are known to have metal adhesion and anti-corrosion properties. The anti-corrosion properties of the superhydrophobic coatings will be evaluated using electrochemical techniques.",
