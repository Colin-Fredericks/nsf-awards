 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project engaging Ursinus College undergraduates in\r\nexperimental nuclear structure research. The project is part of an\r\nongoing collaboration with colleagues at the National Superconducting\r\nCyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and Florida State University (FSU)\r\ninvolving experimental work at the NSCL. We will investigate shell\r\nstructure in exotic, neutron-rich nuclei via one-proton knockout and\r\ninverse-kinematics proton scattering measurements at the NSCL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe protons and neutrons that compose an atomic nucleus fill a series of\r\nshells similar to the shells filled by atomic electrons. Many nuclear\r\nproperties are determined by shell structure including the shape of the\r\nnucleus, the energies and lifetimes of excited states, and the degree to\r\nwhich protons and neutrons act in concert in excitations. Recent\r\ninvestigations of exotic nuclei with many more neutrons than protons\r\nhave revealed that nuclear shell structure can shift with increasing\r\nneutron number.  The proposed work will help to expand the understanding\r\nof the evolution of shell structure away from stability.\r\n\r\n\r\nA central goal of the project is to maintain an active research\r\nprogram in nuclear structure on the Ursinus College campus. Ursinus\r\nCollege is a national liberal arts college of about 1600 students with\r\na long history of strength in the sciences. This project will provide\r\nstudents opportunities to apply their knowledge of physics outside the\r\nclassroom, gain practical skills in data acquisition and analysis,\r\nobserve and participate in the operation of a nuclear accelerator\r\nfacility, and present their work to colleagues. Participants will\r\ntravel to the NSCL to perform experiments and analyze the data at\r\nUrsinus. They will present their results to the Ursinus community as\r\npart of the Ursinus College Summer Fellows Program and to the nuclear\r\nphysics community at American Physical Society/Division of Nuclear\r\nPhysics meetings.\r\n\r\n",
