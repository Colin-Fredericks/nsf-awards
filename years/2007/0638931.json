 "awd_abstract_narration": "WGBH Educational Foundation is requesting funds to produce the third and fourth seasons of \"NOVA scienceNOW,\" a multimedia project addressing a wide array of science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects via multiple platforms including national PBS broadcast, the PBS Web site and innovative outreach initiatives.  Project goals are to help the general public understand the value and importance of scientific ressearch and to encourage an interest in STEM careers among younger viewers.\r\n\r\nINNOVATION/STRAGEGIC  IMPACT:   The series provides a significant opportunity to develop a new format for science journalism building on brand recognition but potentially reaching a broader and more diverse national audience.  The new host will be Dr. Neil deCgrasse Tyson, an accomplished astrophysicist and charismatic science communicator whose partipation will help the series reach out to a broader demographic.  NOVA is planning a new scheduling configuration for these future seasons to maximize audience for the six new programs per year, i.e. the programs iwll run consecutively in the NOVA slot during June and July.\r\n\r\nCOLLABORATION:   NOVA has developed a new consortium of PBS stations to advise on the series and to contribute editorially to the programs.  This will give the program greater geographic coverage and will provide local contacts with researchers at major universities and institutions connected to these stations.  The project will also partner with the American Library Association and Sigma Xi and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in the outreach effort.  Multimedia Research, Inc. and Goodman Research Group will conduct formative and summative evaluations, respectively.",
