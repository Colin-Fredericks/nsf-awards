 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless sensor networks are ideal candidates for a wide range of\r\napplications, such as monitoring of critical infrastructures, data\r\nacquisition in hazardous environments, and military operations.  It is\r\nusually necessary to reprogram sensor nodes after they are deployed\r\nthrough wireless links. This project is aimed at investigating secure,\r\nrobust, and DoS-resilient remote programming of sensor nodes through\r\nwireless links.  First, this project develops a novel reliability\r\nmechanism that integrates proactive transmission and NACK mechanisms\r\nto tolerate packet losses during code dissemination efficiently.\r\nSecond, this research integrates efficient authentication mechanisms\r\ninto this approach to guarantee the integrity of disseminated code\r\nimages.  Third, this project develops weak authentication mechanisms\r\nto mitigate the potential DoS attacks aimed at consuming the resources\r\n(particularly the battery power) of sensor nodes. Fourth, this project\r\nextends the above techniques to provide secure, proactively robust,\r\nand DoS-resilient code dissemination in hybrid sensor networks, where\r\nthere are both high-end nodes (e.g., PDAs, Intel mote 2) connected\r\nthrough high-capacity wireless links (e.g., 802.11) and low-end nodes\r\n(e.g., MicaZ motes) connected via low-power wireless links (e.g.,\r\n802.15.4).  To achieve a thorough understanding of these techniques,\r\nthis project implements all the proposed techniques and evaluates them\r\nin a hybrid wireless sensor network test-bed named WiSeNeT at North\r\nCarolina State University.",
