 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging wireless networks are envisioned to simultaneously support both delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive applications. Unfortunately, providing delay guarantees in wireless networks has been a challenging problem due to (i) the unreliable and resource-constrained wireless channel, and (ii) the inherent complex interactions across multiple protocol layers. The goal of this CAREER project is to provide an advanced suite of theoretical tools, algorithms, and protocols for supporting delay-sensitive applications on wireless networks. By combining large-deviation with Lyapunov stability, this project first develops a new unified theory for characterizing the delay performance of advanced MAC/PHY mechanisms. This is then integrated into a unified cross-layer control and optimization framework for delay-sensitive applications, which leads to high-performance algorithms and protocols for MAC scheduling, advanced rate adaptation, admission control, multi-path routing, and pricing-based control. Finally, in one of the focused application areas, vehicular networks, the project develops tailored analytical tools and control algorithms to address the unique real-time requirements of highway safety applications.\r\n\r\nResearch results will have a broad impact on the wireless industry by providing novel analytical techniques and practical control protocols for wireless networks supporting delay-sensitive applications. Through the Center for Wireless Systems and Applications, the PI will actively share the results with industrial collaborators. The research is tightly integrated into the undergraduate and graduate curricula at Purdue. In particular, a vertically integrated Project team is formed to involve undergraduate students in research. The project will also benefit our society by improving highway safety and saving human lives.\r\n",
