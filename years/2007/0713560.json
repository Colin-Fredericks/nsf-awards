 "awd_abstract_narration": "Severe physical and cognitive disabilities make it difficult or impossible to perform activities of daily living (ADL). The primary objective of the proposed interdisciplinary research and development effort is to assist persons with physical disabilities to perform ADLs using a smart 9-degree-of-freedom modular wheelchair-mounted robotic arm system. The user interface will employ a haptic device with force reflection. Advanced control algorithms for combining the mobility of the wheelchair with the manipulation of the robotic arm will be developed; and sensor-based velocity scaling and assist functions will be used to enhance manipulation range and accuracy for the severely disabled.  This will be done by addressing a set of fundamental human-robot coordination and control issues: (1) design of system architecture for sensor assisted scaled teleoperation and (2) combined mobility and manipulation in a task-optimized control scheme. This work will provide a broader impact to both the engineering community and the health sciences community by innovative research in rehabilitation robotics and its integration with education at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Besides assisting people with disabilities to do activities of daily living, the proposed project would strengthen their job prospects by providing better solutions to improve work place performance.",
