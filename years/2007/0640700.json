 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell communication is a key process during normal development of all multicellular organisms.  An important focus of developmental biology research is to understand how cells integrate different types of signals to make appropriate cell fate decisions in the context of developing organisms. Current research indicates proteins that serve as molecular scaffolds\" and adaptors play a vital role in integrating signaling events within cells. These scaffolds act by assembling multi-protein complexes that ensure proper routing of signaling components inside cells. The long-term goal of Dr. Veraksa's research is to elucidate how such protein adaptors control cell communication.  It has been shown that Arrestin proteins act as molecular scaffolds in mammalian systems.  Dr. Veraksa's laboratory will investigate how Arrestin controls cell signaling in embryos of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  They will use a combination of traditional genetic approaches and more advanced methods to study protein-protein interactions in these embryos. Dr. Veraksa's laboratory provides an excellent environment for training graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in genetics and molecular development. Completion of the proposed research will advance our understanding of cell communication at the molecular level. \r\n\r\n",
