 "awd_abstract_narration": "The answers to numerous fundamental problems in physics and compact object astrophysics depends on accurately determining the masses and radii of neutron stars. This project will lay the theoretical foundations for accurately measuring neutron star masses, as well as their equations of state and for probing neutron star spacetimes. Dr. Ozel and students will address through major computational calculations (i) the dependence of the Eddington limit on the neutron star spin and the geometry of the emitted radiation, (ii) the emission spectra of bursting, weakly magnetic neutron stars at high temperatures where non-coherent scattering is dominant, and (iii) the corrections to the emitting area and to redshifted line profiles arising from the complex metric of rotating neutron stars. By directly comparing the theoretical work to X-ray observations of rapidly-rotating, highly relativistic and accreting neutron stars, this research will answer several outstanding questions in compact object astrophysics, gravitational physics, and quantum chromodynamics. Major questions to be addressed include the state of matter in regions of the quantum chromodynamic phase diagram that complement the early universe studies and an assessment of accreting neutron stars as gravity wave sources by establishing mass-spin correlations. \r\n\r\nThrough this work, graduate students at the University of Arizona will be trained in theoretical and computational work in astrophysics and gravitational physics. Dr. Ozel will include the results of  this work in her expanding public outreach efforts which popularize neutron stars and black holes through public television programs, press interviews, and public talks.\r\n",
