 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is grounded in an approach designed from over 20 years of\r\nresearch on Cognitively Guided Instruction (Carpenter, Fennema, Franke, Levi, &\r\nEmpson, 1999). In addition, we will leverage recent work on formative assessment based\r\non the same cognitive model that drives (Black & Wiliam, 1998a). The formative\r\nassessment based on the work of Black and Wiliam along with CGI are two of the only\r\nprograms of research to link professional development to teacher learning to student\r\nlearning (Black & William, 2004; Wilson & Berne, 1999). We also leverage multilevel\r\ntheory to understand how these programs can effect change on teacher knowledge,\r\nclassroom practice, and student learning. Rather than understanding one level, this project\r\nlooks to understand how professional development influences the complex interactions\r\nwithin classrooms and schools that produce important learning gains in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe research will be conducted in a high need inner city school district that will\r\nserve as a national model for the evaluation of professional development in mathematics\r\neducation. The project will also inform efforts to understand the instructional practices\r\nthat promote substantive learning in mathematics for Latino students and English\r\nlanguage learners.",
