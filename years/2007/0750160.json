At the graduate level, under-representation among minority groups is even more striking than at the undergraduate level; for example, African Americans comprised fewer than nine percent of graduate school enrollments and Hispanics comprised just five percent of graduate school enrollments in the early 21st Century in U.S. universities. Under-representation may even be more important in California and Texas, which are the two largest states in the country in  terms of population and also two of the most racially and ethnically diverse states. Indeed, both California and Texas are now considered to be \"majority-minority\" population states. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative renewal project -- which includes proposals  from the University of Texas at Austin, Stanford University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Southern California -- will continue to address the under representation of Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans in graduate programs in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic (SBE) sciences at these four institutions. The project will continue to increase the enrollment, retention, and successful completion of under-represented minority (URM) graduate students in the SBE Sciences at alliance institutions, with the long-term intent to increase representation among URM groups on university faculties in the SBE sciences. Two principles continue to guide efforts. Alliance partners will: 1) share ideas, best practices, and resources, and create a network to recruit and retain students for alliance universities; and 2) build on successful initiatives that have already been developed on each of the campuses so that efforts can be as cost-effective and successful as possible.   Highly collaborative and innovative methods will be used to improve efforts in recruiting and retaining minority graduate students at the institutions.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this program is to influence the future of higher education in both\r\nCalifornia and Texas. The future of higher education in these two critical majority-minority states in part depends on the ability of universities in these states to diversify the racial/ethnic mix of faculty. The collaborative effort presents one model of how to do so within the SBE sciences.\r\n",

In addition to using NSF grant funding, major financial and programmatic support for the project was also secured from the university through: matching funds, identifying students, facilitating mentorship experiences,  and faculty and staff direct input and substantive involvement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the project has  the support of twelve USC SBE Sciences departments, including&nbsp;Anthropology,  Marshall School of Business, Annenberg School for Communication,  Economics, Geography, Davis School of Gerontology,&nbsp;Linguistics, School  of Policy/Planning/ Development, Political Science, Psychology,  Sociology, and American Studies and Ethnicity. Other departments such as History,  English, and&nbsp;the School of Education have some students and faculty that  have also become involved in the program. Some selected students and  faculty&nbsp;from these departments have become involved because they are  engaged in social sciences research and employing social  sciences&nbsp;methodologies. Importantly, the School of Education has been  supportive of project efforts, namely by assisting with career  development &nbsp;workshops, such CV/Resume Writing and teaching tips and  strategies for interviews for fellowship and faculty positions. Furthermore, four administrative units have provided support for  the program. First, the USC Graduate School, where the program is  housed, provides full-time and part-time staffing, office space and  equipment,&nbsp;and leverage to interface with students, faculty, and staff  across the university. Second, the USC College of Letters, Arts, &amp;  Sciences Deans&nbsp;Office, the academic area where the majority of students  come from, provides matching funds for stipends and encourages faculty  and deans to&nbsp;participate in program operations. Third, the Office for  the Protection of Human Research Subjects/Institutional Review Board  provides&nbsp;essential overviews and training related to research protocols  and research ethics.

The project has helped foster a community of SBE Sciences scholars that  includes faculty members and Ph.D. students from  underrepresented&nbsp;backgrounds. We feel that project services are important factors  contributing to student retention, achievements, and commitment to  advancing&nbsp;scholarship in the SBE Sciences.&nbsp;Specific objectives of the project include:  recruitment of underrepresented students for Ph.D. Programs,  Professional Development for currently enrolled Ph.D. Students, making  available supplemental funding for research and conference travel for  Ph.D. Students, Summer and Year-round Academic Skills Enhancement  Programs, Preparation for the Professoriate, Mentorships with Faculty,  etc. Significant results of the project are as follows: Findings suggest that the program is serving as an important bridge program to better  prepare and welcome newly admitted&nbsp;Ph.D. students and current Ph.D.  students at the pre-qualification stage from underrepresented  backgrounds. The program addresses students'&nbsp;academic, personal, and  social needs by developing skill sets essential to success as a Ph.D.  student, providing important summer funding, and&nbsp;fostering activities  and environments that cultivate a sense of belonging and community.&nbsp;  Student participants periodically testify and show us how professional experiences empowered, with new  insights for their area of research, and develop new relationships with  professional acquaintances that could possibly serve in the future as  resource and network sources. We have found that the Fall Visitation  Program serves as an effective outreach and recruitment strategy that  targets talented, underrepresented undergraduates from throughout  California and the nation.&nbsp; The goal of this program is to expose  high-achieving undergraduates to graduate education at USC and other  universities across the state and country, including increasing knowledge about the general graduate  admissions process graduate school expectations and opportunities.
