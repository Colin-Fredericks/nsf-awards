 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Microbial Population Biology Gordon Research Conference is a biennial conference that draws scientists from a diversity of fields and for the past 25 years this meeting has proven central to the development of Microbial Population Biology as a field. The meeting brings together integrative and broad-thinking scientists in biology by promoting interactions between biochemists, microbial and molecular geneticists, bioinformaticists, virologists, computational biologists, mathematical modelers, population biologists, evolutionists, and molecular, medical and environmental microbiologists. Past conferences have led to crossdisciplinary collaborations, often employing cutting-edge technologies, and frequently of major impact and publications in leading scientific journals. This conference is a major forum for discussion of major concepts in Darwinian Medicine, the evolution virulence, the origin of pathogens, the role of recombination in structuring pathogen populations and the evolution of antibiotic resistance. As such, future medical practice will be based in part on an understanding of the role of microbial evolution in disease. This award will support registration and travel costs for eight post-doctoral scholars and other participants. The 2007 conference boasts half of the invited speakers at the associate professor level or below and approximately one third of the speakers and discussion leaders are female or minority.\r\n",
