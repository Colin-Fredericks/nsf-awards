 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Victor Gevorgyan of the University of Illinois at Chicago. Professor Gevorgyan will continue to investigate new synthetic methodologies to prepare aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds  using transition metal catalysis.  He hopes to use these new compounds as building blocks in the preparation of pharmaceuticals or new materials. The proposed research, which is at the interface of organometallic and organic chemistry, will also provide multidisciplinary training at undergraduate (independent research and SROP regularly engaged in the PI's labs), graduate, and postdoctoral levels.  The research would have broad impact on continuing education as well, as the PI's labs have between 2 and 5 undergraduates working with graduate students and postdocs at any given time.  It will also provide additional research opportunity for teachers through the Research Experience for Teachers program (RET), which is active at UIC. By expanding teachers' background, science's appeal can be relayed to their students, increasing the number who will pursue science as a major.  \r\n  \r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed work is expected to have broader impacts in the health related areas by providing new, effective routes to biologically important intermediates, and in material sciences by allowing easy access to valuable building blocks, which could be utilized in the rapid assembly of complex frameworks and conjugated materials.
