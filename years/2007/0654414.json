 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award supports the development of interdisciplinary training in Biocentric Robotics at the University of Utah, including students and faculty in mechanical engineering, bioengineering, and the computer sciences.  Biocentric robotics concerns the development of robots to physically interact with and assist people, and to attain advanced performance by applying biological principles.  Students will be given interdisciplinary training in designing biocentric robots and in the salient aspects of biological systems.  The emphasis is on developing the new components, design approaches, and control techniques necessary to build the robots of the future.   Trainees from the different departments will undertake a common curriculum in robotics that is augmented with several new courses and new laboratories equipped for training and research.  Students are immediately assigned a supervisory committee and commence with a sequence of lab rotations.  Trainees will present their work at an annual meeting and will take part in a variety of activities to prepare them for their future careers.\r\n\r\nThe interdisciplinary curriculum and other activities will prepare trainees to develop robotics to assist humans in all aspects of life.  Biocentric robots will be able to aid the physically impaired and elderly, assist in rehabilitation, and assist in surgical procedures.  Biologically inspired robot designs will achieve some of the dexterity and capabilities enjoyed by mammals and invertebrates in order to perform tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for humans to do. Outreach activities will utilize robot projects and competitions to interest secondary school students in science and engineering.  This project will work with Montana State University and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University to recruit graduate students.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis IGERT's theme of Biocentric Robotics emphasized the key role of\nbiology in the future developments of robotics.  The subthemes are\nbioinspiration, biomanipulation, and bioinstrumentation.\n\nBioinspiration: Robots are increasingly playing a role in our everyday\nlives, and must deal with complex enviroments just like humans do.\nThere are challenges to building robots that can sense, move, and\nmanipulate skillfully in the real world.  Biology offers many examples\nof animals that do just that, whether over land, in the air, or under\nthe water.  By studying the design and control principles of such\nanimals, we can be inspired to come up with new robot designs which\ntake advantage of such principles.\n\nBiomanipulation: Robots are increasingly coming into physical contact\nwith humans, with a goal of helping them to do some task better or a\ngoal of performing some medical intervention.  Surgical robots are now\nin routine use in many hospitals, but new approaches are being\ndeveloped such as microrobots in the body.  Rehabilitation robots are\nbeing developed to assist therapists for patients with motor deficits\nsuch as spinal-cord injuries, Parkinson's disease, and stroke.  These\nrobots can assume some of the repetitive and strenuous training for\nsuch patients, as well as providing totally new therapies that improve\noutcomes.  Microrobots are being developed that can be placed in the\nbody and controlled by external magnetic fields; possible applications\ninclude eye surgery, gastroinstestinal camera pills, and cochear\nimpants.\n\nBioinstrumentation: Robotic technology can be applied to develop new\ninstrumentation to monitor a person's mechanical interactions, or to\nassist in a medical procedure.  Instrumented shoes have been developed\nthat measure gait and footfall force.  By imaging the change in\nfingernail coloration during fingerpad contact, either using external\ncameras or a nail-born miniature optical sensor, the forces of contact\ncan be measured.  Spinal-cord injured patients have a hope of being\nable to walk in the future by direct stimulation of nerves with\nmicroelectrode array implants.  A robotic platform in an MRI scanner\nmoves a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) array to heat\ndifferent parts of a tumor, as an alternative to radiation.\n\nThere were 16 faculty from the Department of Mechanical Engineering,\nSchool of Computing, and Department of Bioengineering who participated\nin supervising 30 IGERT students and furthering this IGERT's goals.  A\nnew faculty position in robotics in the School of Computing was\ncreated because of obtaining the IGERT.  Students were enrolled in the\nRobotics Track, a joint program of study for MS and PhD students\nenrolled in Mechanical Engineering or School of Computing.  The\nRobotics Track requires students to take core courses in the geometry,\nmechanics and control aspects of robotics, and a course each in\ncomputer vision, machine learning or artificial intelligence, and an\naction category class.  A two-semester seminar was required, where the\nfirst semester focused on research presentations and the second\nsemester involved professional development lectures by the robotics\nfaculty.  Three half-semester research rotations in different\nlaboratories were required to acquaint IGERT trainees with first-hand\nexperience of projects in different laboratories.\n\nCourses were tailored or revamped for this IGERT's theme and for the\nadditional instrumentation and robot systems that were obtained with\nIGERT funding.  Two KUKA Agiles robots and two Baxter robots were\npurchased and used to revamp the laboratory projects of the core\nIntroduction to Robotics course.  A Vicon motion tracking system was\npurchased and used in several courses.  Smaller robot systems and\ninstrumentation were obtained and used in several courses as well. The\ncourse Artificial Intelligence (AI) was totally revamped and split\ninto two courses (AI and Machine Learning), emphasizing modern\nprobabilistic methods used in advanced robot..."
