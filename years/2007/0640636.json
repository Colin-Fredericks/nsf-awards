 "awd_abstract_narration": "Promotion of energy efficiency and environmental protection are major challenges in future energy applications due to the rising prices in petroleum oil and environmental impacts. Rapidly growing technologies such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and electric power generation are the best examples of the emerging need to incorporate efficiency, reliability, security, safety, and environmentally friendliness into the energy systems. Due to lack of proper matching between the source and load dynamic characteristics, maintaining the operating conditions at optimal point is not possible in\r\nconventional energy application. It has been proven that employing energy storage systems improves the efficiency and reliability of the electric power generation as well as power train of the vehicles. This CAREER proposal will investigate the feasibility and implementation trends of integration of the two systems while they both use the same energy storage system. The required building blocks, tools, and technologies for future cyberinfrastructure development will also be identified. In the future envisioned\r\nby this creative proposal, by the year 2020, at least ten percent of the vehicles will be in the form of a hybrid car with an onboard energy storage unit. The vehicles are plugged in to the power grid while they are not in use; hence, while being charged, the onboard energy storage unit will be used for the grid regulation and peak load shaving purposes. The electric energy stored in the vehicle will be used to provide parts of or the entire traction force while the vehicle is in use. Intelligent power management\r\nstrategy and proper communications between the vehicle and power grid as well as the required power electronic components are the main focus of this proposal.\r\nThe proposed plan is to devise a new comprehensive approach to the applications of energy storage units in power systems. The main intellectual merit of the proposed project is to integrate the transportation and electric power generation sectors in order to improve the efficiency, fuel economy, and reliability of both systems. This task is performed via integration of the onboard energy storage units of vehicles with the power grid by power electronic converters and communication systems. The Principal\r\nInvestigator (PI) has strong knowledge and significant accomplishments to be able to carry out the proposed work. He has been in the process of developing new undergraduate and graduate courses as well as laboratories at the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR).\r\nThe proposed research and education activities will improve the study of the applications of power electronics and energy storage systems in power and energy systems by integrating the process of learning and discovery. Students at all levels will be exposed to discovery-based exercises and creative research-based educational tools. Furthermore, the cutting edge research and scientific advances will be delivered in the classroom, laboratory, and field. Different workshops in the related fields of hybrid\r\nvehicles, renewable energy sources, fuel cells, and power electronics will be designed to promote the recruitment, training, and professional development of high school students, teachers, fire marshals, paramedics, and general public. Minority and female students will be included to participate in the proposed research and education activities. Collaborations with institutions, faculty members, and students who are members of underrepresented groups will be established. This project also fosters\r\npotential research collaborations and communications between UMR, HEV manufacturers, power utility companies, and other involved universities and research institutes. \r\nAnother impact of the proposed project is the identification and establishment of highest quality multi-disciplinary interaction with other fields of engineering including computational intelligence, controls, and communications. The results of the\r\nproposed activities will be disseminated through presentations, tutorials and papers at local, national and international seminars, conferences, and workshops. The broader community of general public, code officials, and policy-makers will also be provided with the analysis, interpretation, and synthesis of the proposed research and education results through presentations and public media in order to communicate\r\nin a broader context.\r\n",
