 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWith the increasing amount of confidential information being handled\r\nby computer software, ensuring privacy of  personal information is\r\nbecoming a great concern.  To address this concern, this project\r\ninvestigates mechanisms that track\r\nthe use of sensitive data handled by software programs with the goal of\r\npreventing unauthorized disclosure.\r\nThe technical focus is on the use of runtime mechanisms that track the\r\nuse of  sensitive data. There are three thrust areas investigated in\r\nthis proposal (a) mechanisms  for process based separation and\r\nruntime checking for enforcing confidentiality policies\r\n(b) techniques for erasing sensitive data from programs\r\nafter their intended use and (c) techniques for tracking implicit\r\ninformation flows. The project uses novel ideas that build on the PI's\r\nprior work in language based techniques for addressing\r\nfundamental research questions in these thrust areas.\r\nTo maximize impact, this project will also implement  tools\r\nthat will apply these techniques to large scale software\r\napplications. These tools will enable programmers and end users\r\nto retrofit programs in order to safeguard their\r\nconfidential data.  These tools will be distributed using the\r\nWeb for the widest possible dissemination and further enhancement.\r\nWith regards to education, this project aims to train both graduate and\r\nundergraduate students to perform research in the the application of\r\nlanguage based methods for computer security and privacy.\r\n",
