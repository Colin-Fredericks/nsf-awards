 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professors Craig A. Ogle and Michael D. Murphy of the University of North Carolina- Charlotte who will apply NMR spectroscopy and the rapid injection NMR (RINMR) technique to study the reactions of organocopper compounds, which are some of the most valuable reagents for the formation of C-C bonds. Previously, several long sought after copper (III) intermediates in organocuprate chemistry have been identified. These have been characterized and shown to be intermediates in organocuprate reaction chemistry. Having found ways of preparing the intermediate, the reaction chemistry of copper (III) compounds will be explored. Traditionally, copper (I) cuprates have a rich synthetic chemistry and it is expected that there may be a very rich synthetic chemistry associated with these copper(III) cuprates. New ways of\r\npreparing these copper (III) compounds, their subsequent reactions using rapid injection NMR, and their bench-top chemistry will be explored. Continuing to understand these reactions at a deep mechanistic level will improve them by making the alkylation of organocuprates more efficient with less side reactions and may lead to new ways of making rational changes to the reagents and reaction conditions to allow them to be controlled enantioselectively. \r\n.\r\nThis award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professors Craig A. Ogle and Michael D. Murphy of the University of North Carolina- Charlotte whose research will explore the chemistry of copper(III) cuprates, a class of compounds that up until now were largely unknown but should be readily available to the synthetic chemist from common precursors. Professors Craig ands Murphy will continue their collaboration using the RINMR technique with industrial scientists. This project will offer the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the preparation and handling of air sensitive reagents, operation of analytical instrumentation, and experimental design. Students will also have opportunities to analyze NMR spectra and kinetic data, interact with an industrial chemist, and present their data at regional and national meetings. The economic impact of this research could be significant, potentially leading to new products and methodologies in the pharmaceutical industry.\r\n",
