 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Tysoe and his coworkers in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee are investigating the molecular mechanism of extreme pressure lubrication, using a combination of ultra high vacuum spectroscopic probes and pin on disc tribology measurements.  The role of phosphorous and boron containing lubricant additives is examined on well characterized iron and aluminum surfaces.  A molecular level understanding of the surface chemistry under these extreme pressure conditions will enable the design of improved additives, with significant impact on the metal machining and automotive industries.  Strong connections with industrial lubricant manufacturers extend the educational and broader impacts of this work. \r\n\r\nUsing traditional pin on disc measurements of friction, on surfaces characterized using electron spectroscopic probes, Professor Tysoe and his group at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, are exploring the mechanisms of extreme pressure lubrication in the presence of boron and phosphorous containing lubricant additives.   Understanding the molecular mechanism of this process enables the design of improved lubricant additives with significant impact in the metal working industry.  \r\n",
