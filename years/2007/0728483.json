 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is awarding scholarships to qualified students and enhancing student support services at Russell Sage College for Women (RSC) and Sage College of Albany (SCA). The objectives of the program are to:  increase the number of students (especially women and minorities) enrolled in degree programs in science and mathematics fields; enhance support activities; and establish and strengthen ties with universities, government and industry. \r\nThese objectives are designed to address the following problems: women, minorities, and students of low income have historically been, and continue to be, underrepresented in these fields; students often graduate from degree programs under-prepared for careers in these areas. \r\nIn order to achieve the objectives, students in the biology (RSC/SCA), chemistry/biochemistry (RSC), computer science (SCA), mathematics (RSC), or mathematics/engineering (RSC) programs are receiving scholarships on a competitive basis. A total of 90 scholarships are being awarded over a four-year period. In addition, scholarship students are participating in a comprehensive support program, the key components of which are: regular meetings with faculty mentors; site visits; tutoring; funding for conferences or memberships. \r\nIntellectual Merit:  The project builds on a previous NSF scholarship program which demonstrated good outcomes. Academic programs are strong, and the design of the S-STEM project helps ensure capable graduates.  \r\nBroader Impacts: This program is designed to extend educational opportunities to those underrepresented in science and mathematics fields, emphasizing women and minorities. By creating cohorts of S-STEM students, a culture of interdisciplinary cooperation is created.  Outcomes of the project are being presented to the Sage community and the larger communities within each discipline. \r\n\r\n",
