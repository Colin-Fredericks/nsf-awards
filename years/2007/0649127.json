 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experience for Undergraduates in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics at WPI provides a unique educational experience for students of mathematics by introducing them to research in an industrial environment.  The students work in teams on problems provided by local business and industry.  They work closely with a company representative to define the problem and develop solutions of immediate value to the company. They work closely with a faculty advisor to maintain a clear focus on the mathematics and statistics at the core of the project.  \r\n\r\nTwelve undergraduates will participate each summer.  A team of three-four students will work on each of the industrial projects.  Students are assigned to a project according to their interest and course background, but in most cases the work requires knowledge and tools from several areas of mathematics and statistics.   Each team makes weekly progress reports to the full group and all students participate in these presentations.  At the end of the program, each team provides a final written report as well as a final public oral presentation summarizing the results of their research.  \r\n\r\nThe site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
