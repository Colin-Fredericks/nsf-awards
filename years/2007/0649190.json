 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nScience is an increasingly collaborative enterprise, and the Tufts University REU program in the Department of Biology trains students in collaborative, interdisciplinary research. The 10-week summer program entitled \"Integrative approaches to studying recognition systems in cells, organisms, and populations\" will provide 10 students the opportunity to work with two mentors, with one serving as the primary mentor, to conduct research using techniques from different disciplines (development, endocrinology, genetics, neurobiology, animal behavior, plant ecology, conservation biology, and engineering).  In addition to designing and conducting an independent research project, students will participate in weekly discussions and seminars, periodic field trips, and a symposium. Overall, the goals of this summer program are to increase students' proficiency in biological research and collaborative skills, to educate and inspire students toward future research careers, and to develop students' ability to effectively communicate scientific results. The Tufts REU program provides students with a stipend, free housing, and assistance with travel expenses to and from Tufts.  Tufts REU Site is committed to providing research opportunities for undergraduates, including students traditionally underrepresented in science and those who might not have such opportunities at their home institutions. For more information see http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/undergrad/research/reu.asp or contact Phil Starks at philip.starks@tufts.edu.\r\n\r\n",
