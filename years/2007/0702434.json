Unfortunately, the capacity for CMOS to continue this trend is finite and will be reached in the near future. This is beyond idle speculation and the semiconductor industry has at present identified the replacement of CMOS as an important, but difficult technological challenge. This research project seeks to develop alternatives to conventional computer system design and fabrication that will be fundamentally important as technology moves past the convenient abstractions built during the first 50+ years of computing.\r\n\r\nSelf-assembled nanoscale systems are a potential candidate for replacing silicon CMOS technologies because of the ability to fabricate nanoscale structures in vast numbers without the need for multi-billion dollar facilities. Coupled with the potential to position molecular-scale components in complex networks, self-assembly is becoming a potent disruptive technology with potentially significant influence on the production of future integrated circuits and microprocessors. Specifically, by leveraging the larger-than-silicon industrial base of chemical manufacturing this research has the potential to create a sea change in the cost model for the fabrication of computer systems.\r\n\r\nNew technologies, such as self-assembly, bring new challenges for the creation of computing systems. The research components of this proposal seek to address the following challenges: 1.) designing high-performance, low-power computer architectures that match the fabrication characteristics of future nanotechnologies, 2.) design and test nanoscale circuits with a focus on device parameter variation, defect modeling and test generation, and automated tools for circuit layout, and 3.) fabrication and characterization of \"proof-of-principle\" novel self-assembled nanoscale devices (RGFET) and circuits.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project outcomes are divided into several broad categories related to DNA-guided self-assembled computing systems.  These include: defect models, sequential assembly, self-organized network optimizations, photonic devices and circuits, sensing and processing, and new memristor-based computing methods.  Self-assembled nanoscale systems have the potential to reduce fabrication cost and expand the domain of computing.\n\nSelf-assembly presents several challenges to computer designers due to the inherent random processes involved in chemical reactions.  For circuit and system designers it is important to know the types of problems (defects) that can occur during fabrication.  One outcome of this project is a classification of defects in self-assembled nanostructures that can be used by designers to develop methods that can tolerate the known types of defects.\n\nA second outcome of this project is a limit study to determine how large of a structure could be created by assembling components one-by-one in a sequential manner.  Our results demonstrate the finite limit achievable by this method and point toward a hybrid approach for future fabrication the combines bottom-up self-assembly with conventional top-down techniques.\n\nThe first two outcomes confirm a previous hypothesis that assumes a computational substrate comprised of a set of limited size defective components. An additional outcome in this project extends earlier results that utilize this defective substrate for computing by providing a method to optimize communication between components in self-assembled networks.  Another outcome is a small-scale demonstration prototype (emulated on today\u00c6s hardware) of the previously proposed architecture that could be implemented on a self-assembled computing fabric with high defect rates.\n\nAdditional outcomes explore novel devices for nanoscale computing.  Specifically, explorations of new nanoscale photonic devices suitable for DNA-guided self-assembly, demonstration of molecular scale multiplexed sensing with self-assembled nanophotonic gates, and a proposed computing platform that could be used to sense and process information to provide health monitoring or support life science experiments.  Further efforts on self-assembled nanophotonics produced models for use in circuit design and analysis using nanophotonic devices and a proposed new nanophotonic on-chip network design that dramatically lowers power and energy consumption of computer chips.\n\nOther work explores the use of emerging memristor devices as a combined/compute platform for performing \u00e6big data\u00c6 processing.\n\nThe broader impact outcomes include support for increasing diversity through support of two female graduate students, undergraduate outreach by involving several undergraduates in various subprojects, interdisciplinary training of students by having students\u00c6 research experiences span from laboratory experiments for self-assembly up through circuit and architecture design and analysis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/18/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alvin R Lebeck"
