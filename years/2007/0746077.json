 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this symposium is to explore the synergies between creative cognition and intelligent systems in a cross-disciplinary setting that fosters cooperation both in designing creative systems and in creatively designing systems. This focus on creativity in the context of intelligent systems has the potential for increasing innovation in existing fields of research as well as for defining new fields of study.\r\n\r\nMajor goals for the research presented and discussed in this symposium include:\r\nArtificially Creative Systems: the goal is the development of new types of intelligent systems that produce or simulate creativity using novel approaches to reasoning, searching, and representing knowledge. These systems may be inspired by human creativity or by the possibilities of artificial systems that are beyond human capabilities.\r\nComputational Models of Human Creativity: the goal is to construct cognitive models of human creativity that can be the basis for computational creativity.\r\nIntelligent Systems for Supporting Creativity: the goal is to produce user interfaces, interaction design, decision support, and data modeling techniques that lead to the development of intelligent assistants that support the user in being more creative.\r\n",
