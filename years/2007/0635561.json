The mathematical biosciences include the biological, medical, and environmental sciences where the application of mathematical, statistical, and computational science may lead to significant progress in understanding key processes in the application area.  The mission of the MBI is (i) to develop mathematical theories, statistical methods, and computational algorithms for the solution of fundamental problems in the biosciences; (ii) to involve mathematical scientists and bioscientists in the solution of these problems; and (iii) to nurture a community of scholars through education and support of students and researchers in the mathematical biosciences.  The Institute organizes a yearly program consisting of 6-8 workshops and several tutorials around selected themes.  Workshops emphasize discussions over formal talks and offer an environment that encourages developing collaborations. The themes selected for the next three years are Bioengineering (2007-'08), Developmental Biology (2008-'09), and From Genes to Cells: Networks, Scales, and Complexity (2009-'10). A unique postdoc program is designed to develop young researchers into truly interdisciplinary scientists. They are immersed in a broad range of topics and interact with workshop participants, visiting scientists, and local researchers, while being co-mentored by a mathematical scientist and a life scientist. \r\n\r\nThe Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) at Ohio State University (OSU) is one of seven Mathematical Sciences Institutes (http://mathinstitutes.org/) supported by the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences. The MBI supports programs that promote multidisciplinary research at the interface of the mathematical and life sciences. It hosts scientific programs on long (academic year) and short (one week or less) time scales.  The programs are organized around selected themes, which range from Mathematical Neurosciences (2002-'03) to Systems Physiology (2006-'07) and From Genes to Cells: Networks, Scales, and Complexity (2009-'10).  The MBI provides opportunities for researchers in the mathematical and life sciences to interact and form new collaborations.  Most of the Institute's programs are conducted on the OSU campus, but the MBI also sponsors conferences and workshops at its academic Institute Partners.  These Institute Partners and MBI's Corporate Partners contribute to the Institute's programming and planning through dedicated governance committees.  The MBI website (http://www.mbi.ohio-state.edu/) describes upcoming and past programs, solicits ideas for future programs, and offers application forms for Institute activities.\r\n",
