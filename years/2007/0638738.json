The objectives of this project are: 1) train STEM graduate students to improve their communication, teaching skills, interest in K-12 education, and knowledge of how they can help K-12 educators as STEM professionals and track their career paths; 2) enrich K-12 experiential learning in STEM and improve teachers knowledge, understanding, and confidence in STEM teaching through implementation of the PEER (Partnership for Environmental Education and Rural Health) integrated STEM curriculum; and 3) develop a transportable model for institutionalization of a sustainable GK-12 partnership in higher education. Fellows will serve as STEM role models while enhancing their own appreciation for enriching STEM instruction in public education. Middle-school students will learn STEM in more depth from experiential learning approaches and direct interactions with Fellows. Participating schools will benefit from enhanced capabilities to use inquiry-based learning. The University will benefit from better students entering college and enriched graduate training. This GK-12 model has broader impacts by strengthening the partnerships between institutions of higher learning and rural schools and by fostering integration of research and discovery within education for all students. Broad dissemination into many rural schools will enhance STEM understanding of the untapped, underrepresented and improve of the nation's education enterprise and the society in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
