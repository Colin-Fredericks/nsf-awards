 "awd_abstract_narration": "MSPnet Phase II is a facilitated electronic learning network serving the MSP community from 2008-2011. This network will continue the functionality of the current MSPnet, while undertaking substantial new initiatives and expanding its reach to serve newly funded Institute and RETA projects. MSPnet Phase II builds on the very successful current MSP learning network, which has had over 319,000 visits (from 190,000 unique visitors) and has served over one million page views. It is accessed by all 71 currently funded NSF MSP projects, and serves each project by collecting, sharing, and disseminating research, resources, and tools generated by Comprehensive, Targeted, Institute, and RETA MSP efforts. Furthermore, it is used as an effective dissemination vehicle sharing selected research and resources with The Department of Education's MSP program as well as the public at large.\r\nMSPnet Phase II will ensure that all MSP projects will benefit from an electronic learning network that facilitates sharing within and between projects.    MSPnet will continue to play an important role in the MSP efforts to synthesize research and lessons learned from projects as they reach maturity.  This will ensure that an online archive will be accessible to researchers, future STEM programs, and the public. \r\n\r\nMSPnet Phase II will:\r\n.\tIncrease and sustain members' awareness of activities, events, accomplishments, and conferences related to the MSP community at large;\r\n.\tIncrease and sustain sharing and access to resources, tools, research, and conference archives between MSP projects;\r\n.\tIncrease and sustain communication of partners and constituents within MSP projects;\r\n.\tEnable the continued dissemination of activities, resources and findings to related programs such as the Department of Education's  MSP projects, as well as the public at large;\r\n.\tCreate a complete archive and synthesis recording the research and lessons learned through this program;\r\n.\tServe as a cyber-infrastructure model for future NSF programs concerned with sharing research within and across programs. \r\n.\tResearch and evaluate the role of on line communities such as MSPnet on supporting the five key features of the MSP program. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
