 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collarorative award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometrallic Chemistry program supports Professors Leroy Peterson at Francis Marion University and Hanno zur Loye at the University of South Carolina to continue reserach focused on two coupled areas of research: 1) the synthesis of new ligands and their incorporation into new mixed-metal organic/inorganic hybrid materials and 2) the investigation of new heterometallic semiconducting frameworks based on polyhalobismuthate and polyhaloplumbate materials.  The research builds on preparing metal-pyrazinecarboxylate complexes and using them in the preparation of organic/inorganic framework materials.  Pyrazinecarboxylate ligands will be used to prepare metal-containing geometric building blocks that can be:  a.) linear-bidentate, b.) bent-bidentate and c.) T-shaped-tridentate.  Utilizing equipment at FMU as well as large-scale modern instruments (X-ray diffractometers, TGA, DSC, Mass Spectrometers, SQUID and BET systems) at USC, the student researchers and faculty at FMU will fully characterize their products. Equipment training and workshops will be conducted at USC by Dr. zur Loye on directed supramolecular assembly of organic, inorganic, and/or organometallic modules into functional solids\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this work are to advance undergraduate research for underrepresented minorities and women, while promoting teaching, training and learning to prepare these students for future graduate studies. The collaboration involves the nurturing of a chemistry culture at Francis Marian University (FMU) that will include participation at local and national chemistry society meetings (poster and oral presentations), the development of an FMU undergraduate chemistry symposium, and the enhancement of the FMU research infrastructure via the creation of a modern materials characterization facility. \r\n",
