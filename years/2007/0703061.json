 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project, a collaboration among Greenville Technical College, Clemson University, North Carolina A&T University, Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, and Trident Technical College, is developing and implementing a virtual simulated inspection (ViSIns) laboratory.  The laboratory is a national resource for the use of high fidelity 3-D knowledge objects to train aircraft maintenance technology students. The project is developing and disseminating curriculum and education materials based on the ViSIns laboratory to support the training in non-destructive methods in aircraft inspection and maintenance training operations.  It also is providing professional development in the use and assessment of ViSIns for college teaching faculty members and in the use of virtual reality as a pedagogical tool for regional secondary school teachers.  In addition, the project is assessing the effectiveness of ViSIns in supporting inspection and maintenance training and the transferability of the training to on-the-job skills. The industry partners contribute experienced practitioners, a diversity of inspection tasks, and test beds for integrating the virtual reality products.  This effort is filling state and national needs for well-prepared students entering the aircraft maintenance industry, and it is providing a better understanding of the use of 3D knowledge objects as a pedagogical tool.  The evaluation effort, led by an outside evaluator, is using surveys from high school and community college students and from employers. Dissemination plans include presenting the material through project websites, faculty and teacher development workshops, journal publication, and conferences presentations at the aviation maintenance, FAA, and technician education meetings. The broader impacts include dissemination of the instructional materials and outreach.",
