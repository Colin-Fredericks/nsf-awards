 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Science and Society Dissertation Improvement Grant provides funds to collect data in various parts of the U.S. relevant to a Ph.D. Dissertation that explores the history of radiation and radioactivity as the terms were understood by the American public in the years between the discovery of X-rays and the use of atomic weapons at Hiroshima. It aims to provide a coherent account of the layperson's experience with radiation to complement the subject's well-documented internalist history. Public interactions with radiation were neither monolithic nor simple, and this study takes account of the social categories like gender or geography that offer insight into the different understandings Americans had of radiation. Starting from the sources of their encounters, from the X-ray table to the comic book, this work traces the divergent paths of understanding across economic, educational, and experiential boundaries. Through six thematic chapters the dissertation establishes what information about radiation was available in a variety of contexts through a range of different media, and explores how this information was parsed by different groups. Chapters dealing with the public's actual, physical interaction with ionizing radiation (in a medical context, in the workplace, or through other consumer technologies) are set against those assessing the impact of rhetorical encounters (science popularization in the press, science fiction, and school textbooks and curricula).  The dissertation will contribute to the emerging literature on \"nuclear culture\" by depicting the totality of Americans' encounters with radiation, rather than isolated incidents or specific populations (e.g., shoe-store fluoroscopes or uranium miners). It will clarify the channels through which nonscientists received (or created) knowledge about science, and illustrate how those knowledges were refracted across geographical, class, and educational boundaries. Furthermore, as a study of how the pre-Hiroshima American public processed and reprocessed information about nuclear energies, it will provide a critical context for that public's reactions afterwards. Radiation was a wholly unexpected phenomenon that had the capacity to physically alter the human body in dramatic and unpredictable ways. Well before any consensus was achieved within the scientific community about its origin or import, radiation was presented to the public as a profoundly powerful agent of change, namely social, physical, and physiological. Beyond specific findings about the public reception of radiation, this dissertation will contribute to our understanding of how Americans in the twentieth century balanced the risks and rewards of scientific discovery. Because it examines different kinds of encounters with radiation, mediated by a range of different forums, this work will also contribute to several cognate fields,in particular, those engaging with the public understanding of science like science journalism and science education. It will also add to the history of medicine as one of a very small number of accounts that engage the broader impact of radiology and radiotherapy from the perspective of the patient.",
