 "awd_abstract_narration": "This goal of this project is to provide partial support for U.S. participants in the 2007 Conference on Laser Ablation (COLA) to be held September 24 thru 28, 2007 on the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Spain.  The primary aim of this international conference is to bring together investigators from diverse disciplines studying a wide variety of materials systems to discuss basic mechanisms and applications that arise from laser/material interactions.  The conference will consist of 8 formal sessions, each consisting of oral presentations and three evening poster sessions.  Invited speakers have been selected on the basis of their relevant expertise while emphasizing a program with gender balance, minority representation, and participation of young investigators that show promise as future scientific leaders.  Topics of high current interest include applications to laser processing applicable to nanotechnology, optoelectronics, and future electronics systems; life sciences and medicine; and applications of ultrafast lasers to understanding surface phenomena.  A one day tutorial precedes the conference and is designed for graduate students and young researchers will present fundamental background material.  Support will aid the attendance and participation of young U.S. participants including graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, and young investigators, principally faculty members.  In maintaining and increasing U.S. competitiveness in this very high technology field, such involvement and exposure is critical.\r\n\r\n",
