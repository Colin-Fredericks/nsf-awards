 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet is a phenomenal success, but problems and weaknesses in\r\nit have become apparent, and this has spurred a search for new\r\ntechnologies and network architectures. Although technical innovation\r\nwill remain fundamental to the Internet's evolution, the importance of\r\nthis key infrastructure for society as a whole means that economic\r\naspects will be critical in determining what innovations are adopted.\r\nThis project, therefore, seeks to investigate -- both qualitatively\r\nand quantitatively -- how economic factors mediate the eventual\r\nsuccess of new network architectures and technologies. Aspects of\r\ninterest include quantifying the benefits of virtualization in\r\nenabling different levels of network integration; evaluating the\r\neffect of a dominant incumbent (today's Internet) on emerging new\r\narchitectures; and devising models for quantifying the value of\r\narchitectural flexibility and openness in facilitating technology\r\nadoption and service creation in the presence of market uncertainties.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research is in developing an\r\neconomic framework for reasoning about network technologies,\r\narchitecture alternatives and trade-offs. The goal is to inform the\r\ndesign of new network architectures by accounting for both their\r\ntechnical dimensions, and the economic mechanisms that will mediate\r\ntheir success or failure. The broader impact of the project will be\r\nin helping select network solutions that are likely to succeed in the\r\nmarket place. The project will also foster a multi-disciplinary\r\ncurriculum involving economics, business and engineering perspectives.\r\nThis will both better prepare engineering students to succeed in a\r\nworld where understanding of economical forces is of paramount\r\nimportance, and promote interactions and collaboration among\r\nengineering and business students.",
