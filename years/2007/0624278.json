A principal contribution is to assess the efficacy of these decisions from the distinctive vantage point of the victims of these abuses, whose perspective is underrepresented in related academic and policy discussions and rarely the subject of primary empirical research.  As a result, the latent question of whether or not victims accept the transitional justice measures that are implemented for purposes of conflict resolution and democratization remains largely unresolved, though the collaborators have conducted relevant research in South Africa and other countries.  This project extends that work by exploring the reciprocal dynamics among (1) transitional justice processes, with a focus on recent truth commissions, designed around the South African model, that emphasize participation by victims; (2) victims' attitudes and behaviors; and (3) trajectories of political and social development.  Primary data will be collected in four post-conflict societies in West Africa --Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone--sing both qualitative (focus groups, interviews) and quantitative (surveys) methods.  These cases afford a useful cross-section of historical legacies and transitional justice measures that are closely linked in practice.  The resulting analysis will constitute the first multi-country study in this field to be based mainly on primary data collected from victims.  In addition, an unprecedented longitudinal study is planned for Liberia.  The comparative research design also permits novel insights concerning the interactions among domestic, regional and international forms of post-conflict accountability and democracy promotion.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe major outputs of the project will include extensive survey data, an executive summary and educational pamphlet of project results, and multiple article and book manuscripts.  These items will be disseminated locally and abroad via posting on websites, presentations at professional conferences, distribution of hard copies and publications.  Among the target audiences are the victim communities and the general public in the study countries, as well as scholars, students, policy-makers and NGOs across Africa and throughout the international community.  Furthermore, the project builds upon existing research and civil society networks, invests resources in employment and capacity building, and benefits curriculum development and training programs related to human rights, transitional justice, comparative democratization and African politics.\r\n",
