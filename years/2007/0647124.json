 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Scott Anderson of the University of Utah will continue investigations on reaction mechanisms of small polyatomic cations, including water, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia and acetylene cations.  The work is aimed at learning how different forms of reactant motion such as translation, vibration, and rotation control reactivity.  Studies will also investigate and explain  the branching between different product channels.  Sophisticated instrumentation such as a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer will be employed to aid in experiments with model polyatomic ions.  Professor Anderson and his team will also couple experimental data with theoretical calculations to explore the dynamical origins of effects observed in the experiments.  \r\n\r\nStudying factors that control the reaction of polyatomic ions will enable extension to reactions of polyatomics in general.  The ions selected for study are of practical importance in atmospheric, cometary, interstellar, and plasma chemistry, for example.  Professor Anderson,  along with two graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow will be the primary researchers on this project, while undergraduate and high-school students will be involved in a related project on instrument development that involves a significant mathematics component.  Prof. Anderson will continue his efforts at recruiting minority students through a number of activities, including his partnership with the Utah MESA/STEP Program.\r\n",
