 "awd_abstract_narration": "E\r\n0708026\r\n\r\n     The investigator continues work on developing a systematic\r\nmathematical theory of crystalline solids starting from first\r\nprinciples, with emphasis on understanding the connection between\r\natomistic/electronic structure models and continuum models.  He\r\nand his collaborators study the continuum limit of electronic\r\nstructure models such as models in Kohn-Sham density functional\r\ntheory.  They also study numerical algorithms that combine\r\nKohn-Sham density functional theory and continuum models.  In\r\nparticular, they study the accuracy of these algorithms and find\r\nstrategies for achieving uniform accuracy.  These issues are\r\ncritical for understanding the electronic structure models and\r\nmaking them powerful and practical tools for material science. \r\nThe project helps to provide the microscopic foundation of the\r\ncontinuum mechanics of solids. \r\n\r\n     From a broader perspective, the project serves as an example\r\nof the kind of work that needs to be done in order to establish\r\nthe foundation for multi-scale, multi-physics modeling.  It is\r\nnow generally recognized across a wide spectrum of scientific\r\ndisciplines that the next major advances will come from\r\nmulti-scale, multi-physics modeling that integrates models from\r\nquantum mechanics with models from classical or continuum\r\nmechanics.  However, due to the lack of a solid foundation, much\r\nof the current activities in multi-scale, multi-physics modeling\r\nare ad hoc in nature.  Such a practice defeats the original\r\npurpose of multi-scale, multi-physics modeling.  This project is\r\naimed at establishing the necessary foundation for the case of\r\ncrystalline solids.  In addition, interest in nanotechnology and\r\nfirst-principle-based material design demands a much better\r\nunderstanding of the connection between the mechanical properties\r\nof solids and their electronic structure.  Traditional concepts\r\nthat are often used in continuum theory will have to be modified\r\nin order to take into account the effects at the electronic\r\nstructure level.  Establishing such a connection is a major focus\r\nof the proposed project.",
