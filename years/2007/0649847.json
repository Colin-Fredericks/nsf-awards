 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for developing an integrated microsystem platform that can incorporate an array of bio-interfaces into an accurate continuous-use electrochemical characterization system suitable for a wide range of proteins. This system would provide capabilities for protein characterization, including: (1) simultaneous activity measurement for many soluble and membrane proteins, (2) rapid, automated interrogation using multiple electrochemical techniques, (3) microthermoregulation of individual protein sites, and (4) reduced costs per assay. A prototype device will be tested by studying novel proteins of Galdieria sulphuraria, including a phosphate transporter, ion channels, and dehydrogenase enzymes. The genome of Galdieria sulphuraria has recently been sequenced at the PI's university. This unicellular eukaryote is able to grow at high temperatures, extremely low pH, and high concentrations of toxic metals. The numerous, highly stable, enzymes and membrane transporters that impart these capabilities are of great interest from the standpoints of structural biology and biotechnology. However, research progress on Galdieria proteomics is hampered by the lack of cost-effective, reliable, and high-throughput methods to rapidly characterize the proteins' functional properties.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of this array microsystem would significantly advance progress in functional proteomics, with potential benefit to biological research and biotechnology development. This multidisciplinary project will be integrated into education by direct involvement of graduate and undergraduate student researchers, the development of a new course, and participation in a novel project-based Multidisciplinary Bioprocessing Laboratory course. In addition, an educational module for K-12 students will be developed and incorporated into programs for students from underrepresented groups, in coordination with the university's Diversity Programs Office.",
