 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals use a diverse set of signals of different sensory modes (\"multimodal signals\") to facilitate social interactions. For instance, most birds use unique acoustic (song) and visual (colorful plumage) signals in attracting mates or defending territories. Recent studies indicate that these multimodal signals are important in distinguishing and maintaining species; however, the underlying reasons why signals are so diverse among species remain little understood. Using a combination of observational, genetic and experimental approaches, this research aims to uncover the processes that generate signal and species diversity. Populations of the chestnut-bellied flycatcher Monarcha castaneiventris show dramatic variation in song and plumage color throughout its range in the Solomon Islands. The work will test if island groups differ in forest habitat, social structure and abundances of feather-degrading bacteria, and whether this variation is linked to the observed differences in song and color among the flycatcher populations. The scientific component of this work will be linked to education and conservation by the development of a field course that will partner undergraduate students with Solomon Island biologists, and the implementation of outreach programs aimed at conserving the endangered habitats of the Solomon Islands. In sum, the research program will provide a unique understanding of the factors that shape biodiversity in nature, which will be used as a platform for conservation outreach, and to train Solomon Island biologists and undergraduate students, especially those from groups underrepresented in the biological sciences.",
