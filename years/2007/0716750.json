 "awd_abstract_narration": "The correct behavior and reliable operation of an information system\r\nrelies not only on what users are permitted to do, but oftentimes on\r\nwhat users are required to do. Such obligatory actions are integral\r\nto the security procedures of many enterprises. The management of\r\nobligations in security policies imposes significant technical\r\nchallenges since obligations bear quite different properties from\r\ntraditional access control. For example, obligations assigned to\r\nusers often cannot be enforced. Thus, even if a system\u00a1\u00afs reference\r\nmonitor is trusted, the failure of obligations must be considered,\r\nand appropriate remedies need to be an integral part of security\r\npolicies. Also, the interaction between obligations and other\r\ncomponents of security policies (e.g., access control) must be\r\nconsidered to ensure their consistency.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a comprehensive framework for the management\r\nof obligations in security policies, which covers the full life\r\ncycle of obligations, including obligation modeling, specification,\r\nanalysis, monitoring and discharges. Specifically, the project\r\nformally identifies the desirable security objectives that are\r\ncharacteristic of systems that involve obligations, and\r\nsystematically investigates dynamic and static means to maintaining\r\nthese objectives while such systems evolve. Though the framework is\r\nformal in nature, and is designed on purpose to be general, the\r\nevaluation of its usefulness and effectiveness is firmly grounded on\r\nreal applications, in particular, in the context of privacy policy\r\nenforcement in health care systems.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to establish a solid foundation for the management\r\nof obligations, and significantly improve the understanding and\r\npractice of obligations in information systems. The societal benefit\r\nof the project also results from the development and dissemination\r\nof education resources on new types of security policies beyond\r\ntraditional access control.",
