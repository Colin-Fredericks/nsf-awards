 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. The Molecular and Cellular Biology Program at Dartmouth will host 6-8 students for a valuable and enriching summer research experience.  The program provides an opportunity for undergraduates from across the country to come to Dartmouth for ten weeks during the summer to participate in research in the biological sciences.  Students participate in research in the labs within the Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) program, with research topics that include microbiology, developmental biology, plant biology, genetics, biochemistry, immunology and evolutionary biology.  Students can choose from over 20 possible faculty mentors and will work side-by-side with faculty and graduate students to gain hands-on experience in experimental design, bench research and science writing.  Key goals of the program are to give students a real feel for what it is like to be a graduate student and to encourage students to pursue a career in research.  Students are selected primarily from groups typically underrepresented in the sciences and from institutions that do not have available research opportunities.  \r\nThe REU Site program integrates a robust laboratory research experience with career development activities.  Students will have opportunities to interact with members of the MCB program (faculty, graduate students and other REU students), attend seminars on such topics as preparing for and applying to graduate school and science ethics, participate in a journal club and present their summer research at a student symposium. The Kaplan GRE preparation course is included and students can take the GRE exam at the end of the summer.  Dartmouth College and Dartmouth Medical School, situated in the Upper Valley of New Hampshire, is an hour from the White Mountains National Forest, two hours from Boston, three hours from Montreal and four hours from New York City.   Students attending the program will be provided with a stipend, room, food allowance and travel reimbursement.  For further information and application materials, please contact Dr. George O'Toole at georgeo@Dartmouth.edu or (603) 650-1248, or visit http://www.dartmouth.edu/~surf.\r\n",
