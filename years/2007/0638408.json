These priorities are directed toward the goal of identifying knowledge that will help people respond to environmental change. The priorities include: (1) developing an integrated pan-Arctic human dimension observation system based on existing data; (2) developing stakeholder networks to identify relevant observations and predictions, and to help understand the dynamics of the Arctic system; and, (3) develop and apply models to a pan-Arctic database to advance our understanding of environmental change and to identify data gaps that could be filled in a Phase Two human-dimensions observation system. The project will focus on four arenas likely to involve climate-human interactions: marine mammal hunting; oil, gas, and mineral development; tourism; and fisheries. A fifth project focus is on indicators of social outcomes of human interactions with environmental change. As part of the Arctic Observation Network, the project will be designed to foster integrated analysis across the physical, natural, and social sciences.\r\n\r\n",
