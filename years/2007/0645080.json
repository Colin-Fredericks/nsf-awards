 "awd_abstract_narration": "0645080\r\nGao\r\n\r\nDespite the intense research efforts in bioanalytical sciences and bioengineering, current technologies do not have sufficient sensitivity or multiplexing capability to detect disease biomarkers on single copy level, which is critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment of deadly diseases such as cancer. This is particularly problematic when the targeted molecules are proteins, since they cannot be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this CAREER project, the principal investigator proposes a new generation of nanoparticle-based encoding technology for multiplexed detection of genes and proteins (or even viruses and bacteria) with PCR-like sensitivity, which is not possible for the existing techniques such as PCR, ELISA, microfluidics and mass spectrometry. The important innovation of the new barcoding technology arises from both conceptual and technical levels. Compared to prior arts, the target molecules are detected by sandwich assays involving multifunctional nanoparticle doped microbeads rather than conventional fluorophores. This versatile and powerful technology platform allows simultaneous analysis of DNA, RNA and protein cancer markers with unprecedented sensitivity and reduced cost. If successful, the proposed project will not only open new opportunities in molecular oncology but also make a strong impact on bio-warfare and forensic sciences. The educational component of this proposal includes the development of two new courses to augment the traditional bioengineering curricula, partnership with the Center of Nanotechnology at University of Washington, and a plan to produce a textbook for formal college education. \r\n",
