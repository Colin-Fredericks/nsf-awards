Planning for the conference and workshop has been a collaborative effort of a faculty group in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech and AEESP's standing committee on conferences.  The theme for the 2007 conference is interactions at the interface: making the connections between environments, disciplines, and nations. In support of the theme, the conference will emphasize the wide range of spatial scales (nano to global) that characterize the frontiers of research in the field of environmental engineering and related disciplines, as well as the increasingly international scale of research and education in these fields. The Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) is the \"glue\" that connects the disparate components of the academic environmental engineering community. AEESP biennial conferences bring engineers and scientists together to discuss the latest developments and trends in environmental research and education. The conference will include workshops, oral and poster technical sessions, and informal opportunities for faculty and student members of the academic community in the field of environmental engineering to interact and collaborate. The workshop for new faculty and for postdoctoral and senior graduate students planning to enter an academic career will provide guidance on proposal preparation, career planning and balancing the many responsibilities associated with successful academic careers today.\r\n",
