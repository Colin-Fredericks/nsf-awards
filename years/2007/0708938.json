The infrastructure, based on open research platforms, consists of\r\na testbed that enables wide and systematic experimental evaluation and comparison of\r\nunderwater acoustic networks. The work, involving this rapidly deployable testbed that\r\ncan be shared by the underwater networking community, aims to demonstrate the ability\r\nof the facility to facilitate field experiments. The project represents a higher-level\r\ncollaborative that arose from two collaborative groups. One group developing the\r\nfacility, the other working mainly on the experiments utilizing the facility. The testbed is\r\nexpected to be a buoy-based system that can be easily taken to different environments.\r\nWhen operational, these systems will be deployed 5 or 6 times a year. The\r\ninfrastructure will consist of two types of nodes with different capabilities. The first type\r\nof node of the rapidly deployable testbed will offer a fixed physical layer capability using\r\nacoustic modems such as the WHOI micromodem or the ISI S-modem to implement a\r\nphysical layer with limited reconfigurability interfaced to a reconfigurable network\r\nprocessor. This network processor will support algorithm/protocol implementation and\r\ntesting at higher network layers. The Network functions on the Fixed Physical Layer\r\ntestbed will be hosted by a Gumstix processor which will then communicate with\r\nphysical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem or USC/ISI S-modem via a\r\nserial port. Ten to fifteen fixed physical layer nodes will be built including up to 3\r\ngateway nodes. Each gateway node of the testbed will be equipped with wireless RF\r\ncommunication enabling real-time monitoring and control of network performance. The\r\nfixed physical layer nodes will be smaller and more easily deployed than the second\r\ntype of node which is the all-layer node. The all-layer node is a more capable node that\r\nwill ultimately support algorithm/protocol implementation and acoustic data collection at\r\nall networking layers. In addition to the equipment included in the fixed physical layer\r\nnodes (i.e., a gumstix network processor and the ability to support relatively fixed\r\nphysical layer modems such as the WHOI Micromodem and the ISI S-modem), the\r\nall-layer nodes will also include a general purpose data acquisition system (D/A and\r\nA/D) with substantial disk storage and in-situ processing capability. The MIT r-modem\r\nsoftware will be implemented on this general purpose hardware and, along with\r\nMATLAB, will enable user implementation and testing of algorithms and the gathering of\r\nacoustics data at the physical layer in addition to the testing at higher network layers\r\nthat it will share in common with the fixed physical layer nodes. Three to five all-layer\r\nnodes will be built. The rapidly deployable testbed, using two types of nodes with\r\nvarying capabilities, should significantly enhance research at all network layers while\r\nsetting the stage for future infrastructure improvements.\r\n\r\nMany research groups investigating fundamental questions about how to design such\r\nnetworked systems that utilize acoustic communications in complex underwater\r\nenvironments have had their overall effort significantly slowed by the lack of common\r\nmeans to test and compare protocols under realistic environmental conditions. This\r\ninfrastructure responds to the need for consensus on analytic or simulation models for\r\nunderwater networks where researchers need the ability to gather experimental data\r\nunder real world conditions in order to make progress.\r\n\r\nThe network stack will be modular by design with sockets used to enable cross layer\r\ncontrol and communication. The physical, MAC, Network and Application layers will be\r\npopulated with sample components to enable users test their own algorithms or\r\nprotocols without having to populate the entire stack. Users will be able to write modules\r\nto test their own algorithms or protocols at different layers and selectively replace the\r\nsample modules with their own. While the development of the modular architecture and\r\nsample modules for the network stack will be done with close coordination between all\r\nparticipating institutions, the lead institution for the layers that will be provided are\r\nPhysical Layer (MIT for the all-layer system, WHOI for the Fixed-PHY system), MAC\r\nLayer (USC/ISI), Network Layer (UConn, a geo-routing protocol), and Application Layer\r\n(UMass, a DTN routine service). The open characteristic of the testbeds and their\r\nusefulness for conducting research will be demonstrated by the members of the team\r\n(primarily UConn and UMass as described above) and a few selected outside\r\nparticipants. In addition, acoustic receptions suitable for physical layer research will be\r\nmade available to the general research community via the Internet.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This work enables the essential capability of research groups to\r\nexamine fundamental research questions and their potential solutions in the real world.\r\nThe infrastructure will directly benefit many on-going research projects in this field A\r\nlarge number of potential users in the community may benefit from this testbed\r\ninfrastructure. In addition to the significant research impact, the infrastructure is\r\nexpected to make a very strong educational impact as well, supporting classes bringing\r\nremote access to field experiments to students for whom traditional experiments would\r\nhave been too costly. The infrastructure can accelerate research and education in the\r\nunderwater networking field.",
