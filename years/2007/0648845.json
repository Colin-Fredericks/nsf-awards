The program will be a 10-week comprehensive program that will engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research projects at the cutting-edge of advanced rapid prototyping technologies.  Students will also be involved in interdisciplinary group sessions and seminars, facility tours including a visit to a graduate school, PowerPoint presentations, posters, and writing of research papers in a strongly mentored environment.  This program will contribute significantly to the development of independent, well-rounded engineers by providing opportunities for students' professional growth, knowledge, experience, creativity and confidence.  The program will culminate with students making conference presentations.  \r\n\r\nThe REU Site program can be a primary motivator for participants to pursue graduate education in science and engineering.  The activities will help participants develop a passion for lifelong learning, an interest in continued education in advanced science and engineering, and will encourage entrepreneurship and global impact involving the useful, sometimes patentable devices that will be created. Recruitment efforts will be targeted to first-generation and traditionally underrepresented students from across the U.S., especially from second tier/non Ph.D. granting institutions.  \r\n",
