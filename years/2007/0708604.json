This demand is motivated by factors such as the need to provide pertinent resources and information to users based on their physical location context (e.g., yellow pages and location-based services), provide location based public safety services (e.g., enhanced 911 services), and assist seamless mobility of users across different spaces by dynamically adapting the applications on their mobile computing devices based on the location. Challenges in building such context-aware computing environments and applications stem from the high complexity in developing applications due to the need of integration of different kinds of technologies, context-based security and privacy requirements, need to identify required pertinent resources and information, and timely detection and querying of context information. The infrastructure contributes to address these challenges through research in\r\n.\tProgramming environments and middleware architectures for context-aware applications;\r\n.\tSpatio-temporal query processing with privacy preserving techniques,\r\n.\tSpatio-temporal data mining, profiling, and prefetching methods, and\r\n.\tAgent-based distributed event data stream processing for context detection.\r\nThese synergistic projects use \r\n.\tContext information in providing security and privacy to these applications,\r\n.\tSpatio-temporal data mining for context-based adaptations, \r\n.\tContinuous query processing for context-based information retrieval, and\r\n.\tProgramming abstractions and middleware architectures for rapid construction of these applications from their high level specifications.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The infrastructure advances knowledge and contributes to develop new software infrastructure for building context-aware applications. The project actively seeks and encourages participation of students from under-represented groups, facilitates students' theses, and collaborates with an IGERT initiative.\r\n",
