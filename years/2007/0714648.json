 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometry plays an important role in any theory of quantum gravity, such as string\r\ntheory. Recent advances in string theory have demonstrated the importance of new\r\ntypes of geometrical spaces that previously have not been much studied. For string\r\ntheory constructions of phenomenologically realistic models of elementary particles via\r\ncompactifying extra dimensions,the presence of fluxes for fixing moduli, and hence\r\ndetermining coupling constants and masses, has now been deemed essential. With\r\nfluxes, the generic internal geometry is no longer Calabi-Yau, but involves non-Kahler\r\nmanifolds with torsion. Yet much of the structure of non-Kahler geometries is not known.\r\nIn a rather different direction, there has been considerable progress recently in\r\nunderstanding the gravity/gauge theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence in quite a rich class\r\nof geometrical backgrounds. In particular, our understanding of Sasaki-Einstein\r\ngeometry has improved greatly, and there are now a number of infinite families of\r\nSasaki-Einstein AdS/CFT duals where both sides of the duality are known explicitly. In\r\ngeneral, the AdS/CFT correspondence predicts a fascinating relationship between\r\ngeometry and properties of conformal field theory. This project has two main\r\ncomponents. The PI will investigate the geometry of flux compactifications in heterotic\r\nstring theory. The objective is to understand the underlying mathematical structure of\r\nnon-Kahler geometries of interest so that important physical questions like the number\r\nof massless particles and their interactions can be answered. Besides geometrical\r\nanalysis, the application of string dualities and string worldsheet methods will be utilized\r\nin the investigations. In addition, the PI will further develop Sasaki-Einstein geometry,\r\nwith application to the AdS/CFT correspondence and conformal field theory. Goals\r\ninclude formulating, as a precise mathematical statement, the map from geometry to\r\nconformal field theory, and addressing the important issue of existence and uniqueness\r\nof Sasaki-Einstein metrics. Another goal is to describe the geometrical structures\r\nunderlying more general AdS/CFT backgrounds with fluxes, and also to study the\r\ngeometric description of renormlization group flows. The proposed project is at the\r\nfrontier of string theory research and is expected to make a substantial contribution to\r\nthe understanding of physics beyond the Standard Model, conformal field theory, and\r\nstring theory dualities. This will be achieved by addressing some of the foundational\r\nmathematical problems that have arisen in the recent development of string theory. It is\r\nexpected that the results of the proposed program will also have a profound impact in\r\ndifferent areas of mathematics, such as differential geometry and algebraic geometry.\r\nBroader Impact: A central aspect of this project is the training of graduate students and\r\npostdoctoral fellows in applying the modern tools of mathematics to theoretical physics\r\nand developing new mathematics to solve physical problems. The PI has a strong\r\nrecord in organizing workshops and conferences, including the annual Strings 2006\r\nconference in Beijing, for the string and mathematical physics community. He will also\r\ncontinue to reach out to the media to publicize and educate the general public on the\r\nresearch of the math and physics communities.",
