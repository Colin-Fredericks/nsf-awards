 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer and Computational Algebra is a fast growing field with\r\nmany applications in education, science, engineering, medical fields,\r\netc. To develop and explore such applications close cooperation is\r\nneeded between mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers, and\r\nscientists. To facilitate such cooperation the Department of Mathematics\r\nat Oakland University is organizing an international conference\r\nduring the month of July 2007 at Oakland University. The main goals\r\nof this conference will be to promote the applications of Computer\r\nAlgebra and Symbolic Computation and to bring together researchers\r\nfrom mathematics, computer science, engineering, and other sciences\r\nin order to further cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe applications discussed in the conference are important in areas\r\nsuch as education, mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering,\r\nindustrial applications etc. For example, one of the sessions is\r\norganized by Charles Wampler who is the head of the GM Research\r\nand Development group on robotics. The group's main activities are\r\nbased on techniques which make heavy use of computer algebra. These\r\ntechniques will be discussed in detail in the conference and will introduce\r\nother researchers and students to the needs of the auto industry,\r\nwhich is quite important for the economy of the Detroit area. Other\r\napplications include coding theory and cryptography which are very\r\nimportant decoding terrorist threats and securing safe communication\r\nchannels. Several of the session organizers are members of the NATO\r\nAdvanced Study Institute which will be organized in Albania in 2008.\r\nThis summer institute is funded by NATO and aims at training mathematicians,\r\ncomputer scientists, and engineers from Eastern Europe\r\nand Mediterranean countries to monitor the terrorist elements in those\r\ncountries. Finally, the organizers of the Applications of Computer Al-\r\ngebra (ACA) conference at Oakland University hope that the new ideas\r\ngenerated in this conference will have direct impact on industrial applications\r\nand combating terrorism.",
