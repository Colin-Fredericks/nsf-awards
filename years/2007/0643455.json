 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER grant supports research on developing an innovative fabrication technology using a hierarchical molding process that will enable three-dimensional (3-D) integration of topological and chemical nanostructures into polymer-based microfluidic chips with an envisioned aim of improving performances for bioanalytic devices. The main obstacle in the development of polymer-based bioanalytic devices is the lack of technology to achieve stable modification of polymer surfaces within microchannels. The 3-D integration of topological and chemical nanopatterns into microchips will allow control over a broad range of surface properties with high stability such as surface wetting and will offer tunable transport and sensing properties of reagents that flow through the channels. The technological development will be combined with the study of its science base of materials deformation. This research project is highly interdisciplinary, integrating materials, mechanics, and manufacturing techniques.\r\n\r\nThe main focus of the educational activities of this project is to promote interdisciplinary training in order to better prepare our students for the rapidly changing diversity of today's engineering professions. The educational activities include (1) the development of laboratory and presentation modules for outreach to K-12 students and the general public, (2) an introduction to modern undergraduate and graduate courses that integrates advances in polymer micro- and nanofabrications and materials, (3) exposure of undergraduate and graduate students to a multidisciplinary environment, and (4) the development of recruiting programs for minority students\r\n",
