 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anthropogenic climate change will alter patterns of natural selection and pose strong evolutionary challenges to wild organisms. Plant species that have experienced genome doubling, or polyploidy, may have an advantage over those possessing a single copy of the genome because they can evolve faster or in novel directions in response to climate change. Examination of the creative role of polyploidy is important given that genome duplication is thought to have occurred in 47%-70 % of flowering plant species. This research will test the evolutionary potential of polyploids by imposing artificial selection for increased drought tolerance in a polyploid species (goldenrod, Solidago altissima) that varies naturally in chromosome number (2, 4, and 6 copies). The central hypothesis of this research will be supported if plants with higher chromosome numbers evolve faster in response to artificial selection. \r\n\r\nThis work will provide a large number of students with intensive hands-on training in lab and field techniques and provide opportunities for independent research at the graduate and undergraduate level. This research fulfills the objectives of the RUI program by addressing a question of great interest to society, the impact of climate change, and by providing solid training to a diversity of students who will become the next generation of scientists. \r\n",

This research has addressed this important gap in our understanding relating to the creative role of polyploidy in natural plant populations.  This work is particularly important in light of the environmental challenges that populations face in the 21st century, such as climate change as well as other anthropogenic and natural environmental change. \n\nThis research showed that polyploids represent a source of standing genetic variation in natural populations that is often be overlooked but is important because it can be mobilized by natural selection for adaptive evolution in different ways than consideration of diploids alone.
