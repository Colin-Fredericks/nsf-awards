As CMOS technology is pushed to its basic physical limits, alternate technologies are required for on-chip communication.    In this project, we will explore carbon nanotube-based interconnect solutions for future VLSI applications.\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n   Metallic carbon nanotubes are a promising replacement for on-chip copper interconnect due to their large conductivity and current carrying capabilities.  We will investigate and develop equivalent circuit models to facilitate the development of nanotube-based interconnect solutions.  Using the proposed models, we will examine the performance and reliability of nanotube interconnect structures in future process technologies.  \r\nNanotube-based interconnect solutions have the potential to revolutionize next generation integrated circuits for a large array of VLSI applications.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nIn addition, the educational and outreach programs associated with the proposed research, which target minority, undergraduate, and graduate students, will be instrumental in promoting the scientific principles related to carbon nanotubes and nanoscale integrated circuits.  \r\n",
