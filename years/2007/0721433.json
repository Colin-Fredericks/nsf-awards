 "awd_abstract_narration": "The wireless network of the future is envisioned to be a seamless integration of several existing and emerging wireless networks.  A key enabler for this network of the future is the cognitive software defined radio (SDR) which takes advantage of programmable hardware modules to dynamically and adaptively modify the functionality of various radio subsystems.  The goal of this research is to facilitate seamless integration of wireless networks where information sent from a source to a destination can traverse multiple links that belong to heterogeneous underlying networks.  The design and operation of the resulting hybrid wireless network is determined by three characteristics of future software defined radios:  Cognition, Collaboration, and Competition.   Research results will demonstrate how inherently competitive SDRs (i) work together to learn about current local network conditions; and (ii) use this information to construct adaptive links and routes across these local networks (and \"non-networks\") so that end-to end quality of service requirements are met.  Specific research outcomes will include distributed, collaborative algorithms that aid cognitive SDRs in spectrum sensing and hybrid wireless network formation.\r\n\r\nThis research will impact both commercial and military service providers who wish to extend network capacity and coverage by interconnecting existing and emerging wireless systems. The PIs aim to demonstrate broader impact of hybrid wireless networks by offering short workshops that educate rural Pennsylvania communities on its benefits. Additionally, research results will be disseminated and incorporated into wireless communications and networking courses at the respective institutions.\r\n\r\n",
