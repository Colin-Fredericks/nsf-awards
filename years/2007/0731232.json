 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to organize and host a national workshop on STEM concept inventories (CIs) designed for engineering and engineering science courses. The investigators are planning a two-day workshop to address the following questions: (1) What is the current state of concept inventory development across the STEM disciplines? (2) What CIs are missing from the current portfolio? (3) What infrastructural needs (e.g., a national database and strategies for organizing and supporting the ongoing efforts) would facilitate CI development and refinement? and (4) How can the results of CIs be disseminated to inform faculty how to utilize CIs to assess their teaching and ultimately change their pedagogical practice? A steering committee is inviting educators who have been involved in CI work and is organizing a two-tiered format in the workshop, with large-group activities highlighting successful approaches and methods, followed by small-group sessions to explore opportunities for broadening and adapting these approaches.  The steering committee also is inviting a second group of participants who have limited experience with CIs but who provide more diversity, with an emphasis on underrepresented groups. Activities during the workshop are being designed to foster greater collaboration between inventory developers and instill the desire to begin new inventories.  Evaluation data is being collected using a survey with both forced choices and open-ended responses.  Additional workshops and formal presentations at professional society meetings, along with a website, are being developed to disseminate the results of this effort.  The participation of a diverse set of faculty members and the dissemination of the material will contribute to the workshop's broader impacts.\r\n",
