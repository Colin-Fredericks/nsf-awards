 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the continued development, assessment, and dissemination of Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILT) for advanced undergraduate courses. QuILTs are based upon a field-tested cognitive-apprenticeship model of learning and emphasize modeling, coaching, and scaffolding. To aid instructors, the various concept-based and problem-based QuILT modules will be keyed with most of the common textbooks. However, every effort will be made to ensure that the different modules fit together as a coherent whole and help students organize their knowledge in a hierarchical fashion. Some QuILT modules expose students to contemporary and exciting topics such quantum teleportation that can be taught using simple two level systems. The objective of this program is to motivate and prepare future scientists and engineers for the demands of the high-tech workplace with its growing dependence on quantum phenomena. The QuILTs can also be adapted for graduate level quantum mechanics courses and used by graduate students as a self-study tool.",
