 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two kinases that protect cells from viral infection have been identified in zebrafish.  The structure of one has features that distinguish it from its mammalian counterpart.  The other is unique to fish.  The activities of these two enzymes will be characterized and compared in the laboratory and their expression will be investigated in cultured zebrafish cells and zebrafish in response to infection and immune stimulators.  On a broader level, the results derived from this project will provide tools for the investigation of fish responses to infection.  The work will benefit society by contributing to the aquaculture industry since a better knowledge of the fish immune system is essential to the development of the aquatic animal health sector.  A wider understanding of these kinases also has the potential to provide tools to assess health and nutritional status of wild and captive fish populations.  The project will also provide research experiences/training to high school students, undergraduate interns and area high school teachers.  It will also support the training of a minority Ph.D. student.",
