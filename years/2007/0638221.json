 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I effort will develop an innovative single and multilayer nano-composite coating system for High Temperature Polymer Matrix Composites (HTPMC) using vacuum based thin film Cathodic Arc Physical Vapor Deposition (CAPVD) and Plasma Enhanced Magnetron Sputtering (PEMS) processes. The expected benefits of economical, high-performance civilian aircraft designs under development for the future will be realized only through the development of light-weight, high-temperature composite materials for engine applications to reduce weight, fuel consumption, and operating costs. It is believed that every pound of weight reduction in the engine can effectively save more than a million dollars over the life of the aircraft. However, these high temperature composites need better erosion protection, especially when they are subjected to severe environments such as desert sand. The proposed innovation will address these issues and also aim for extending the overall life of the engine components.\r\n\r\n Successful implementation of this project will lead to enabling technology for other applications such as automotives, wind turbine blades, construction industry and other defense applications, thereby opening up new opportunities for the future. The proposed partnership with a leading research institution and a major aerospace industry in this program will enable the training of knowledgeable work force and provide strong competitive advantage to U.S. manufacturing industry. \r\n\r\n",
