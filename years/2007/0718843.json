 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fletcher, Jennifer C.\r\nProposal #0718843\r\nRole of ULTRAPETALA1 in Regulating Arabidopsis Floral Meristem Function?\r\n\r\nPlants, like animals, contain stem cells that are critical for their growth and development. Plant stem cells are found at the apex of developing shoots and flowers, in structures called meristems, and provide cells for the formation of new organs such as leaves and petals.  The main research objective is to understand the molecular mechanisms that control stem cell activity in shoots and flowers, and thus specify overall plant architecture.  This project continues studies of the ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1) gene from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that acts to regulate the number of stem cells that are made by shoots and flowers.  Genetic, molecular and biochemical techniques will be used to analyze the biological function of this gene.  The identity of other genes that are directly controlled by the ULT1 gene, the mechanism of activity of the ULT1 protein, and a more thorough understanding of the genetic factors that maintain flower stem cell activity are the expected results of this research. These studies will provide insights into how plants are able to continuously form new organs, and will establish a basis for optimizing the architecture of both ornamental and crop plants.  An important component of this project is to integrate research and education in a laboratory environment. Undergraduates from groups traditionally under-represented in science and local community college students will obtain their first exposure to scientific research by assisting with the project, and will be supervised by postdoctoral scholars and graduate students to provide valuable training and mentoring experience.",
