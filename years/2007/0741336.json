These discharges are thought to consume less energy and generate less ozone than existing technologies for a range of applications including photocopiers, laser printers, and air cleaners. The approach is potentially very beneficial for medical applications, also providing a potentially valuable application of nanotechnology. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the present research is to contribute to the limited data available on the discharge behavior of nanostructures in an open atmosphere.  It could also desirably lead to a new theory of the nanoscale corona (e.g., nanocorona initiation criteria) due to the unique plasma physics associated with a discharge electrode being much smaller than the mean free path of electrons and ions in the atmospheric corona.\r\n\r\nIn the process and outcome of this research, the PI plans to provide research experiences for undergraduates, to recruit underrepresented students (especially women and minorities), to integrate small nanotechnology projects into an existing core ME course, and to collaborate with the Wisconsin Career Academy to provide outreach to K-12 students, teachers, and the general public through ?Science Saturdays? and science fairs.  \r\n\r\nThis is a combined GOALI (Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with Industry) and SGER (Small Grants for Exploratory Research) award.  The intent of an SGER award is develop key data needed to anchor larger funding grants, and the academic-industry interaction of a GOALI provides excellent opportunities for cross-fertilization, impacting the students, faculty, and industrial participants.\r\n",
