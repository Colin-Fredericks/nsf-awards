 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to The College of Charleston Grice Marine Lab under the direction of Dr. Louis Burnett to provide support for the renovation of one of their older buildings to accommodate new growth and research directions at the Grice Marine Lab. This new facility will accommodate new faculty research laboratories and offices, establish a common instrument room, and provide a laboratory for visiting scientists. The need for these new faculty spaces comes from a new Marine Genomics program that will expand our offerings in the Marine Biology graduate program, in addition to the relocation of some faculty from the downtown campus.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe College of Charleston demonstrates the success of their programs with the placement of their graduates. The impacts of these young men and women graduates who enter science careers including marine science will help to promote interest in the field of science for future generations. The research productivity of faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students provides convincing evidence of a vital scientific community. GRICE has an excellent record of summer NSF-REU support for young scientists, and shows good tracking methods of those students that continue on scientific career paths. The GML has a strong history of education (undergrad and graduate), the 'Bridge' program for minorities is especially noteworthy as are outreach programs such as 'student shadowing' and the Ocean Bowl.\r\n\r\n",
