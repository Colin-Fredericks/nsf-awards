 "awd_abstract_narration": "Young U.S. scientists will participate in the Seventeenth Congress of the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) from 28 July to 3 August 2007 in Cairns, Australia.  The scientists to be supported will be primarily young U.S. scientists involved in Quaternary research who otherwise might have difficulty in obtaining travel funds to present the results of their research at such an international Conference. \r\n\r\nQuaternary research includes the study of all aspects of climatic, biological, and anthropological changes associated with the ice ages of the around the most recent two million years.  Such study is intended to provide new insights about climatic and biotic responses associated with these ice ages and to do so on an interdisciplinary basis.\r\n\r\nSupporting the participation of young U.S. scientists in this Congress is expected to also have the corollary benefit of enabling U.S. graduate level researchers to develop international contacts that could provide a sound basis for international cooperation in such research in the future.\r\n",
