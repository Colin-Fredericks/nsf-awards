The IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) is an international society with more than 9,000 members and 80 chapters worldwide. The society promotes the advancement of microwave theory and its applications, including RF, microwave, millimeter-wave, and terahertz technologies.  The Society's premier conference, the International Microwave Symposium, for 2007 will held in Honolulu, HI on June 3-8. The Conference features a large trade show as well as a wide variety of technical papers and workshops. \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is evidenced by the innovative ideas that have originated from the microwave community and many of which had their beginnings in presentations, workshops, and discussions held at meeting.  By supporting the presence of these promising young student researches, the NSF guarantees a vibrant and innovative microwave community for decades to come.  The IMS is the major international symposium in the microwave field and a focus of research results in wireless telecommunications.  The average attendance for the past several years has been over 10,000 attendees.  The students funded by this proposal will be exposed to technical presentations which have been subjected to a high-quality peer selection process.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of these travel grants is the steps it takes to encourage the pursuit of microwave engineering by U.S. students.  By encouraging women and underrepresented minorities, much needed diversity is brought to the microwave engineering field.  The resulting infusion of differing backgrounds and viewpoints can greatly encourage innovative ideas and research directions.\r\n",
