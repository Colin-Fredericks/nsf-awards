 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide variety of problems of multiplicative number theory will be pursued.\r\nThe problem of gaps between sums of two squares will be tackled in a new way,\r\nwhich if successful could be developed into a major new tool for the study of\r\nthe coefficients of automorphic functions in short intervals.  Sieve methods\r\nwill be studied not by {\\it ad hoc} choices of sifting functions but rather by\r\nallowing the sieve to reveal where its extremal configurations lie.  The goal is\r\nto determine, in all dimensions, the optimal upper and lower bounds.  The local\r\ndistribution of zeros of the zeta function will be studied by locating optimal\r\nkernels to use in conjunction with pair correlation information.   \r\nStatistics relating to the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions as\r\none averages over different arithmetic progressions will be determined. \r\n\r\nFor several decades, Hardy and Littlewood maintained a list of research\r\nproblems.  Among the problems remaining on their final list is to\r\nderive a better upper bound for the gap between numbers that can be expressed\r\nas a sum of two squares.  Here better means simply better than the trivial\r\nbound one obtains by the greedy algorithm.  This problem is to be attacked\r\nin a new way, and if the approach is successful, then the method may apply\r\nin greater generality.  As was pointed out by Selberg, the problem of sieving efficiently is\r\nfundamentally a problem of linear programming.  Existing sieves are\r\nsomewhat ad hoc, and in most cases the bound obtained is either not\r\noptimal or at least not known to be optimal.  It is proposed to\r\nemphasize the linear programming aspect of the problem, and to identify\r\nextremals, for both the primal and the dual problems.  This is to be\r\ndone first in the simplest of situations, and then in successively more\r\nchallenging ones, so that eventually one will be able to identify\r\nextremals in realistic problems of great interest.",
