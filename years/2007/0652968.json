 "awd_abstract_narration": "This STEP project is using innovative mentoring and professional development activities to (1) institutionalize Integrated Learning Communities for at-risk engineering freshmen, (2) increase engineering and science degrees by 55 degrees per year, (3) support and encourage community college transfer students, and (4) double the graduation rate of at-risk engineering students, defined as those beginning their education in pre-calculus mathematics.  Project components include faculty-coordinated Integrated Learning Communities (ILCs), pre-transfer support of community college students, a \"Mathematics Boot Camp\" to support students' performance on the Mathematics Placement Exam, the integration of science and engineering modules in the algebra series, the Engineering Success and Professional Development Center, and incentive awards. Leveraged support of the NSF-funded Louis Stokes New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation Program (New Mexico AMP) ensures that all students enjoy a broad range of interventions and resources. The  STEP project is contributing to the graduation and professional success of STEM students, including those who are historically underrepresented, by improving the educational experiences that lead to greater retention and progression; and providing support and encouragement for students to enroll in graduate studies, including the pursuit of the Ph.D. Project development is being informed by both formative and summative assessment approaches.  Results are being shared with local, regional, and national audiences through professional publications and presentations.  \r\n",
