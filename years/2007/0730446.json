 "awd_abstract_narration": "0730446 \r\nGuo \r\nHigh frequency and high sensitivity ultrasound imaging at the frequency range of 30-100MHz is capable of resolving structures almost down to the cellular level. The proposed research will boost optical detection of ultrasound from the current experimental system carried out on an optical table to a compact and robust device that is perfectly suitable for interventional imaging application. The integrated optics concept and the novel implementation of photonic microresonators as ultrasonic detectors and metallic nanoparticles based ultrasound sources are the corner stones of the proposed development. The program will focus on the understanding of underlying physical principles and explore a number of candidate device structures in order to set a solid foundation for the future implementation of novel all-optical integrated transducer arrays for intravascular and intra-catheter applications. \r\n\r\nDeveloping such an imaging modality for clinical use could have a tremendous impact on the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in many different clinical areas. The cardio-vascular clinician will be able to visualize in great detail the arterial walls of the coronary arteries and the heart interior structure. The diagnostics of cancer using biopsy will be revolutionized as in-situ microscopy could replace the traditional procedure. Imaging guided therapy could be developed since the diagnosed pathology can be localized at a great precision. The technology can enable high resolution intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging and early cancer detection. \r\n\r\nIntegrating research into education is another major effort of this program. The project requires a multidisciplinary approach, and will involve student researchers at all levels. The PI will encourage and promote both graduate and undergraduate students' participation in interdisciplinary researches. This Biophotonics program will feature a strong collaboration with researchers in the biomedical ultrasound field, and will benefit all the participating students. The results will set the scientific and engineering foundation for a new generation of compact, all-optical based ultrasound imagers that are especially useful for in-vivo applications. Progress and new findings made in the project will be made available on a website for dissemination to the general scientific community.\r\n",
