 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a conference, held in Birmingham, Alabama in November 2007, on current research in mathematical and computational analysis of reaction-diffusion equations and their applications.  The three-day meeting is part of the successful series of biennial Mississippi State - UAB Conferences on Differential Equations and Computational Simulations.  The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nEleven plenary lectures and approximately 125 contributed talks are devoted to research themes in partial differential equations with a broad array of applications.  This multidisciplinary conference brings together workers in mathematical modeling and analysis, numerical analysis, scientific computation, and engineering.  The conference provides opportunities for graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients to present their work, to learn about current research in the area, and to develop collaborations with one another and with senior researchers. \r\n\r\nConference web site: http://www.msstate.edu/dept/math/events/de.conf/de2007/\r\n",
