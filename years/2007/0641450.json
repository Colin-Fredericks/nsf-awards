 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the role of fungi in ecosystems has been hampered by little sampling and characterization of fungal diversity. Fungal endophytes reside inside living plant tissues and form beneficial or harmful relationships with plants. Studies suggest that beneficial endophytes have evolved to protect plants from diseases. Trees in the wild have less disease incidence than trees in plantations, and endophytes may play a role in their protection. This project will characterize fungal endophytes in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) to evaluate their potential role as plant protectors. Endophyte diversity will be evaluated in trees in native forests (Peru) and plantations (Brazil) through fieldwork and laboratory work. The ability of these endophytes to protect plants will be evaluated. \r\n\r\nDisease has limited the production of rubber trees in the Americas. Many fear that the spread of this disease to plantations throughout the world could have severe economic and social implications. Findings from this study will uncover new endophytic species and potential protectors against rubber diseases. The study of fungi needs to be undertaken in remaining forests, or many species that are important to humans and natural ecosystems may disappear before they are discovered. This project will also provide training to students at Howard University.\r\n",
