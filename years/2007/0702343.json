Device scaling of silicon transistors has been the fundamental basis for the phenomenal success of the semiconductor and electronics industry. While there have been significant accomplishments in scientific discovery in recent years at the single-device level at the nanoscale, a major gap exists between such single-device-level results and the research required to harness the science into practical design technologies competitive with silicon technologies at the end of device scaling. This project uses an interdisciplinary approach to overcome fundamental challenges by combining novel CNFET-based robust imperfection-immune design and automation techniques together with new CNFET modeling and processing techniques.  The ideas developed in this project will be experimentally validated through working CNFET-based circuits. This research program also integrates research and education required to explore novel, nanoscale electronic designs through graduate and undergraduate training, and public education on nanotechnology.\r\n\r\n",
