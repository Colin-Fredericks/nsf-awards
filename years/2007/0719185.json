 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Matthew McCarroll of Southern Illinois University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the fundamental phenomenon of chiral recognition and to develop novel methods of examining and improving chiral separations.  The research aims to (1) develop systems to characterize chiral interactions and methods for a priori optimization of separation parameters, (2) develop and evaluate chiral brush polymers as chiral stationary phase materials, and (3) develop a system for the rapid determination of enantiomeric composition.  \r\n\r\nThis project will lead to new knowledge relevant to chiral stationary phase development, the study of protein-ligand interactions, evaluation of catalysts, and the development of chiral drugs.  In addition, the project offers an ideal training opportunity for both undergraduate and graduate students, as they will be involved in a broad range of scientific concepts and techniques.  Efforts will be made to include individuals from underrepresented groups, as a diverse and interdisciplinary atmosphere will provide skills and experience that will serve all students well as they mature into future scientists.",
