YEUNG\r\nINSTITUTION:\t\t\tGeorgia Institute of Technology\r\n\r\n\"NSF WORKSHOP ON CYBER-FLUID DYNAMICS: NEW FRONTIERS IN RESEARCH AND EDUCATION\"\r\n\r\nThe grant is for partial funding, primarily for the travel and attendance at the NSF Workshop on \"Cyber-Fluid Dynamics: New Frontiers in Research and Education\". The National Science Foundation has made investment in Cyberinfrastructure, including multiple aspects of Cyber-enabled Discovery and Innovation (CDI), a major priority. Fluid dynamics has found advanced computation very useful, and has, indeed, led in many computational advances. However, to maximize the impact of NSF-sponsored computational resources, there is a critical need to enable systematic sharing of both codes and data. This Workshop will invite leading members of the research community, NSF Program Officers, and representatives the supercomputing community, to engage in exchanging ideas and to build synergistic partnerships that will address the challenges and opportunities at new frontiers in both research and education. The 1.5-day program will include presentations by selected invitees and NSF officials, as well as group and plenary discussion periods. We hope this Workshop will give a new meaning to the acronym CFD  as Cyber Fluid Dynamics, a broader concept than traditional \"computational\" fluid dynamics.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed activity will benefit both fluid dynamics and advanced computation, especially through the concept of Virtual Organizations (nsf07- 558). Wider availability of data, algorithms, and expertise via follow-up actions to the Workshop will invigorate the \"simulation-based science\" approach which is applicable to many fluid flow problems. The demanding requirements of these problems will, in turn, provide feedback and further impetus for NSF-supported supercomputer centers to improve on tools and policies serving the scientific user community. Recommendations in the Workshop report will also highlight how to leverage the exciting frontiers of Cyberinfrastructure to increase public awareness of fluid dynamics, recruit students from underrepresented groups, and contribute to training a new workforce in computational science and engineering. All presentations will be posted and maintained on a conference website hosted at Georgia Tech. A formal report that includes a set of recommendations will be delivered to NSF.\r\n\r\n",
