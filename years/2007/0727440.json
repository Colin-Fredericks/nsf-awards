 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college is establishing a scholarship program to recruit and support academically talented, financially needy students and enable them to attain higher education degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The project's goals and objectives are being achieved by providing a cluster of academic, enrichment, and research support activities that are designed to promote student success in the completion of an associate's degree and/or transfer to a baccalaureate institution as a STEM major. In addition, the program provides a high level of student-faculty interaction and ample opportunities for the scholars to work with peers and bond as a student cohort. Recipients are recruited and selected from students planning to major in physical sciences (chemistry and physics), biological sciences, mathematics, and engineering. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Through a wide range of support structures and resources, as well as the leadership of an experienced management team, the project is ensuring that scholarship recipients receive all crucial support necessary to achieve success in STEM disciplines. The summer research experiences that are integrated into the program provide invaluable opportunities for selected cohorts from the scholarship recipients to engage in authentic research in established STEM laboratories at partner institutions. This experience prepares students for a seamless transfer to a baccalaureate program in their chosen STEM discipline, as well as increases their likelihood to pursue a career in the field upon graduation.\r\n \r\nBroader Impact: The project impact goes beyond just providing scholarships to eligible students in STEM disciplines. It integrates many of the college's existing academic resources with the proposed S-STEM support programs into a unique infrastructure that promotes student success in rigorous STEM curricula and better prepares community college students to pursue a degree or a career in STEM fields. The project is assessing the impact of the program on student retention and success, as well as contributing to the knowledge on effective practices that best prepare community college students for careers in STEM fields. The program is recruiting high qualified students, especially applicants from a diverse population that are historically underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.",
