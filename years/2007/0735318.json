 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Meshing Roundtable is the conference dedicated to meshing issues.  Mesh generation techniques have been playing an important role in computational design and analysis.  A geometric model created with a Computer Aided Design system must be translated into a mesh model, which a Finite Element, Finite Difference, or Finite Volume solver can recognize.  The International Meshing Roundtable is a unique conference that focuses on the mesh generation problem, and it is a rare opportunity for researchers in the field of the mesh generation to exchange ideas with other researchers and to meet with users who utilize mesh technology to solve real-world problems.\r\n\r\nThe Finite Element, Finite Difference, and Finite Volume Methods can numerically solve complex scientific and engineering problems and have been applied in traditional engineering disciplines such as structural, fluid, vibration, and heat transfer applications.  The applications include automotive and aviation industries, chemical and material companies, bio-medical researches, environmental researches.  Entertainment applications such as computer graphics and gaming also make use of these numerical-analysis methods since mesh-based simulations can produce realistic visual effects.  For these applications, a high-quality mesh is needed for obtaining a good result.  However, it takes a considerable computational and labor cost to create a high-quality mesh.  More research needs to be conducted to deal with increasingly complex and detailed geometry and to meet the demand for the more accurate analysis.  The conference is also a good educational opportunity for the students who is working on the meshing research and/or related applications.\r\n",
