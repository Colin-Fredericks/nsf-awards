 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a meeting, held at Murray State University in October 2007, on current research topics in differential equations.  The two-day meeting is part of the successful and well-attended Southeastern Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE) series, which changes venue annually.  The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nThree plenary lectures and sixty contributed talks are devoted to research themes in differential equations with a broad array of applications, including mathematical biology, financial mathematics, engineering, and physics.  This conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of research in differential equations, with emphasis on providing opportunities for new researchers to present their work.  The conference will be especially beneficial to young researchers, including graduate students and postdocs. \r\n\r\nConference web site: http://www.searcde.org",
