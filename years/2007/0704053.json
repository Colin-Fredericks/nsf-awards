 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main theme of this project is the application of Heegaard Floer homology\r\nand gauge theory for problems in low-dimensional topology \r\nand knot theory. New surgery formulas in Heegaard Floer homology allow the PI \r\nto study applications for surgery problems in three-manifolds, and surgery \r\ncharacterization for knots.In a different direction Floer homology is used to \r\ninvestigate unknotting numbers for knots in the 3-sphere. The project includes \r\nfoundational problems for knot Floer homology and the study of combinatorial \r\ntechniques as well. In a different direction, gauge theoretical techniquesare used \r\nin the search for  small exotic 4-manifolds. \r\n\r\nThe project studies three and four dimensional spaces and some central problems\r\nin knot theory and low dimensional Topology. One of the main tools is a relatively \r\nnew theory called Heegaard Floer homology. This theory has close ties to gauge \r\ntheoretical invariants that originated from interactions between Mathematics \r\nand Mathematical Physics. It is expected that advances in Heegaard Floer homology \r\nwill lead to  a better understanding of these gauge theoretical invariants as well.\r\nAnother integral part of the project is the study of unknotting numbers for knots.\r\nWhile this  is a classical invariant in knot theory, the unknotting process is also \r\nrelevant in the  study of knotted DNA. A way to measure the complexity is to \r\nstudy how many times the strand  has to be cut by an enzyme and recombine itself to \r\nbe unknotted.",
