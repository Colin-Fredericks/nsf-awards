 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is devoted to the study of stochastic analysis in\r\ninfinite dimensions. The main topic is stochastic differential\r\nequations (SDEs) in infinite-dimensional spaces, such as\r\ninfinite-dimensional groups, loop groups and path spaces,\r\nnon-commutative $L^p$-spaces. The questions of existence and\r\nuniqueness of solutions of the SDEs and smoothness of solutions will\r\nbe studied. These solutions will be used to construct and study heat\r\nkernel measures (a non-commutative analogue of Gaussian or Wiener\r\nmeasure) on infinite-dimensional manifolds such as an\r\ninfinite-dimensional Heisenberg group and the Virasoro group. In\r\ngeneral these infinite-dimensional spaces do not have an analogue of\r\nthe Lebesgue measure or a Haar measure in the group case. The PI\r\nintends to study Cameron-Martin type quasi-invariance of these\r\nmeasures. It is an interesting question in itself, and in addition it\r\ncan give rise to unitary representations of the infinite-dimensional\r\ngroups. It is proposed to study properties of square-integrable\r\nholomorphic functions, including non-linear analogues of the\r\nSegal-Bargmann transform and bosonic Fock space representations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is in providing a better\r\nunderstanding of Gaussian-type measures on infinite-dimensional\r\ncurved spaces. In particular, the proposed research will connect\r\ndiverse fields: stochastic analysis, geometric analysis and\r\nmathematical physics. This research project has broader impacts on\r\ndiverse areas of mathematics, and it involves activities which help\r\nto disseminate the knowledge of new findings in the field. The\r\nproposed research is motivated by several subjects.\r\nInfinite-dimensional spaces such as loop groups and path spaces\r\nappear in physics, for example, in quantum field theory and string\r\ntheory. The PI proposes to formalize and study some of the notions\r\nused in physics, such as measures on certain infinite-dimensional\r\nspaces. In addition, it has a significant educational component,\r\nnamely, it involves two graduate students of the PI.",
