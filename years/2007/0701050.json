 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  main  goals  of  this  project are  basic  research  in  real algebraic  geometry  and  the  Schubert calculus,  training  the  next generation  of  mathematical scientists,  and  deepening ties  between mathematics and the applied sciences.  It will support Sottile''''s basic research  in real  algebraic geometry  and Schubert  calculus  and his interdisciplinary work  on applications of  algebraic geometry.  These all  have  a  substantial  combinatorial component  and  an  essential omputational/experimental  core.   This  activity  will result in a better  understanding  of  real  solutions to  systems  of  polynomial equations through experimentation and conjectures by obtaining tighter fewnomial upper bounds and by  developing a theory of lower bounds for the  number of real  solutions to  structured polynomial  systems.  It will also  result in  the dissemination of  ideas and  techniques from algebraic  geometry  to  other  fields  and  the  development  of  new directions  in mathematics  inspired  by problems  from these  fields. Some of  this work will be  carried out by Sottile''''s  research team at Texas  A&M  consisting of  students  and  postdocs,  and will  include substantial  experimentation.   This  team  approach to  research  and training  is  consciously  modeled  on  work  patterns  in  the  other sciences.    It  will  also   support  Sottile''''s   efforts  organizing large-scale international and interdisciplinary scientific meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile  algebraic geometry  is concerned  with basic  questions about solutions  to equations,  its value  to other  disciplines  is through concrete  objects  and computational  tools,  as applications  require knowledge   of  specific   geometric  objects   and   explicit,  often real-number,  solutions.  Modern  tools  from computational  algebraic geometry have great potential  in applications, but their use requires a  concerted effort  to transfer  this  technology into  the hands  of applied  scientists.   This project  is  intended  to facilitate  this technology transfer.",
