 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid progress in additive manufacturing processes opens new horizons for cellular solids as it makes possible to fabricate parts of any arbitrary material composition and internal micro-architectures at mesoscopic length scale. In order to realize the full potential of what cellular solids have to offer, the challenge is to develop a robust understanding and modeling of property-topology relationships in cellular solids, and identify the influence of the independent parameters of cellular topology on overall mechanical response. The objective of this project is to bridge this emerging gap in the design of functionally optimized cellular structures by developing a strong scientific knowledge base and mathematical framework to model topology-mechanical behavior relationship in cellular solids with particular emphasis on the interaction between cellular topology, yield surfaces and dynamic response. This objective will be achieved by a multi-faceted research program that integrates manufacturing, experimental, computational and analytical modeling components. \r\n\r\nAs part of the project, an educational outreach program will be initiated to stimulate the curiosity and enthusiasm of high school students towards engineering and sciences by exposing them to the fascinating aspects of advanced research and its impact on our everyday lives. A website will also be established to serve as an information portal on the scientific and technological aspects of cellular solids for the dissemination of knowledge to and promotion of interest in a broader body of graduate and undergraduate students nationwide. \r\n\r\n",
