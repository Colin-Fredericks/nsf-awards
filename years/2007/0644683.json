 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award provides funding to develop a framework for bridge condition assessment that integrates information collected through structural health monitoring (SHM) and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) into a model updating program for bridge decision-making and management.  Two of the major challenges that limit the successful use of model updating for condition assessment are the development of the a priori model that creates a well-conditioned parameter estimation scenario and the quality of the collected data. This research will address these challenges by advancing the analytical and experimental components of model updating. This framework includes the creation of a bridge finite element model with respect to parameter estimation for model updating requirements, which increases the available a priori information and will shift the traditional elemental bridge design paradigm. The research will also present a structural engineering application for vision-based displacement measurements and a structural condition assessment application for weigh-in-motion station (WIMS), which are both traditionally ITS measurements.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide bridge managers with a model updating platform for simultaneously post-processing collected SHM and ITS data.  The model updating procedure will exploit SHM and ITS data for a selected bridge in New Hampshire providing information relating to the performance (SHM) and usage (ITS) of the bridge as a proof-of-concept.  As this research advances bridge assessment technology, it will advance public understanding of bridge importance by providing a fun and educational activity using build-able bridge models that tell the story of engineering in relation to social studies, science and math. These build-able bridge kits will include drawings, construction sequences, social and economic impacts and education material. The kits will be integrated as hands-on educational enhancement activities into NH after-school programming.",
