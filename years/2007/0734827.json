 "awd_abstract_narration": "2007 KUMUNU conference to be held at the\r\nUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln, September 8-9. KUMUNU is an annual weekend conference anchored\r\nby the Universities of Kansas (KU), Missouri-Columbia (MU) and Nebraska-Lincoln (NU),\r\npromoting interaction among researchers, postdocs and graduate students in commutative algebra\r\nand related disciplines (such as algebraic geometry, representation theory, combinatorics, K-theory\r\nand coding theory) at regional schools. The KUMUNU triad has significant strength in these areas.\r\n The KUMUNU conference has a tradition of playing a strong regional mentoring role at\r\nall levels, including graduate students, recent PhD's and faculty at nonPhD granting institutions.\r\nKUMUNU accomplishes this by providing an annual venue bringing these groups together with\r\nsenior researchers at KU, MU and NU in addition to one or two senior researchers from outside\r\nthe region. KUMUNU stimulates interaction by having a series of 7 short (45 minute) talks,\r\naccessible to graduate students, by speakers representing a diverse mix of senior researchers, young\r\nfaculty and postdocs, with plenty of time reserved outside of talks for additional interaction. In\r\naddition to faculty and postdocs at KU, MU and NU, speakers in the past have come from Colorado\r\nState University, Kansas State University, Michigan, Michigan State, New Mexico State, Notre\r\nDame, Purdue, Texas Tech University, University of Texas-Austin, and Washington University.\r\nOther participants have come from such diverse institutions as Benedictine College, University of\r\nMissouri-Kansas City, Missouri State University, Georgia State University, University of Arkansas\r\nand Gustavus Adolphus College.\r\nTravel and lodging support, especially for graduate students, is a key element for KUMUNU\r\nto achieve its main goals of showcasing the research of postdocs and young faculty, and of helping\r\nrecent Ph.D.s and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines enrich their\r\nresearch programs by meeting experienced researchers based at KU, MU, NU and elsewhere, by\r\nlearning about recent developments in commutative algebra, by exchanging ideas with one another,\r\nand by developing collaborations for future research.\r\n",
