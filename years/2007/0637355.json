 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will result in the demonstration of an innovative new form of 3D lithography to be used for fabricating imaging arrays and photonic-crystal waveguides in thick photopolymers that are cheaper, higher performance, lighter, more flexible and have capabilities that are not currently possible with current \"stack and draw\" manufacturing. Thick photopolymers respond to 3D optical exposure with a self-developing index structure, typically proportional to absorbed energy.  Traditional mask-projection lithography cannot address these thick volumes.  In this project, the image of the mask is projected perpendicular to the surface of the polymer and translated through an arbitrarily long polymer sample.  An unchanging mask will write translational-invariant waveguide arrays or photonic crystal fibers.  These photonic crystal fibers do not require large index contrast, matching the properties of photopolymers. Dynamic masks including spatial light modulators or mask rotations extend the capability to complex waveguides with adiabatic variations along their length.    The proposed project will evaluate the potential properties of the guided-wave structures, their capabilities for lightweight heads-up displays, and will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed lithography method.\r\n\r\nThe imaging arrays have significant commercial potential as replacements for current endoscopes, fiber faceplates and image converters.  The proposed technology is also enabling for new market applications including inexpensive eye monitoring for public safety applications, wearable gaze tracking for human-computer interface for cursor control, market studies, and control of wheel chairs for the handicapped. The technology also has application for military applications for the fabrication of non-intrusive, eyeglass frame embedded heads-up displays. \r\n\r\n",
