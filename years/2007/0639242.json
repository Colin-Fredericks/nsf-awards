 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department at Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College will acquire a high resolution time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometer with this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi User program (CRIF:MU).  The requested instrument will be used in a diverse range of research projects including the investigation of conjugated systems displaying tunable energy transfer; synthesis and study of novel sensing agents; synthetic tailoring of end groups in conducting poly(alkylheteroarene)s; characterization of inorganic-organic supramolecules; synthesis and characterization of fluorescent porphyrinoid bioconjugates; and new synthetic methods using oxime ethers. \r\n\r\nMass spectroscopy is a tool widely employed by physical and biological scientists to identify and characterize materials and chemical species by accurate measurement of their mass as they are vaporized and fragmented in the instrument.  Undergraduates would be exposed to this instrumentation via classroom connections and laboratories, as well as undergraduate research programs and summer programs.  PhD students will benefit from formalized, hands-on training.  Additionally, another main goal of this project is to create a regional mass spectrometry resource with enhanced availability to external users by inclusion of easy access, high security cyber infrastructure that will be built into the facility to provide remote access to off site users from regional institutions. \r\n\r\n",
