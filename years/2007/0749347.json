Mc Duff\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal as submitted requested five items for the R/Vs Thompson and Barnes.  Four of the five items are requested to improve the safety of the vessel and users. One item was proposed as a ship maintenance tool.  Safety items benefit all users of the ship. The UW prides themselves on the ship operations support of educational and outreach through numerous program, such as, REVEL, Teachers at Sea and national outreach to students in K through 12.  Periodically the University holds open house on the ship and provides tours to students from 3rd grade through high school senior students.  It should be noted the R/V Thompson is required by USCG and IMO regulations to install the Voyage Data Recorder by July 2008.  The winch upgrade is a must for continued support of oceanographic research and sampling and the Communication system for R/V Barnes is required by the UNOLS safety standards.  \r\nFollowing the review of the proposal the winch monitoring system ceased to work properly.  The PI is requesting a replacement winch monitoring system as an add-on to the proposal.   The requested winch upgrade will improve the abilities of the ship to support oceanographic research, improve the efficiency of the over-the-side operations, winch/wire safety and require less maintenance.   \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n",
