 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the purchase of a controlled source audio-frequency magneto-telluric (CSAMT) and electrical resistivity/induced polarization systems at Oklahoma State University. The proposed instrumentation will be used to address research questions in neotectonics, hydrogeology, and biogeophysics. In neotectonics, the proposed instrument will form the central core of an International Research Experience for Students' program in Botswana and Zambia focused on investigating the interplay between neotectonics and surficial processes due to rifting. Geophysical imaging of subsurface fault geometry and fault linkage patterns will (1) answer critical questions of how faults bounding a rift basin form, grow, and propagate during rift initiation; and (2) provide important insights into the interplay between neotectonic activity and surficial processes due to rifting. Projects are designed to develop and enhance the international research capabilities of students, while contributing to the scientific understanding of how neotectonic activity due to rifting influences surficial processes. In addition, the proposed CSAMT system will be used to investigate the geometry of normal faults in the Menderes Massif of the Western Anatolai Extended Terrane (WAET), in Turkey. The Menderes Massif is a key locale in identifying fundamental plate tectonic processes that facilitate extension in the continental lithosphere. The proposed instrumentation will be used to provide near surface imaging of faults, crucial to determining the geometry and evolution of the normal faults that formed during the Cenozoic extension in the region. The data obtained will be used to better understand cause and kinematics of the Cenozoic Extension in the WAET in Turkey. In biogeophysics research, which focuses on understanding and documenting the effect of microbial processes on geophysical properties, the proposed resistivity/IP imaging system will enable the up-scaling of current laboratory investigations to field-scale geophysical investigation of subsurface microbial processes. Other projects that will benefit from the proposed instrumentation include: (1) studies of the Arbuckle-Simpson aquifer of south-central Oklahoma which is the principal water resource for nearly 40,000 people in the region and (2) determining the near-surface geometry of thrust faults in the Frontal Ouachitas Fold-Thrust Belt and Arkoma Basin Transition zone, in southern Oklahoma. The proposed instrumentation will provide hands-on field geophysical research experience for students, while addressing basic research questions in the geosciences. Students engaged in the international projects will conduct field work in Botswana, Zambia, and Turkey. By interacting with peers from universities in Botswana, Zambia, and Turkey, the U.S. students will acquire an enriching cultural experience, make personal contacts, and build relationships that will form the central core of future international research collaborations. Our international field programs will provide an excellent opportunity to engage students from underrepresented groups.",
