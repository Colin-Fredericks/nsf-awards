 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the universal deployment of mobile and cellular communications\r\nand the proliferation of wireless LAN technology, today's society is becoming\r\nfirmly dependent on wireless networking technologies.  As wireless networking\r\ncontinues to advance with new services and applications, researchers have an\r\nincreasing interest in understanding the limits of current and future wireless\r\nnetworks.  To a large extent, many of the performance limits associated with\r\nwireless networks are deeply intertwined with underlying physical layer\r\ntechnologies.  From a research perspective, technology advances at the physical\r\nlayer usually introduce new problems at the networking layer that cannot be\r\naddressed by simply extending existing theories and algorithms.  In many cases,\r\ndue to the disruptive nature of new physical layer technologies, problems at\r\nthe network level are extremely challenging and call for the development of new\r\ntheories and algorithms.  Such new theoretical developments usually require\r\ninterdisciplinary expertise in networking, wireless communications, algorithms,\r\nand optimization.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this workshop is to gather a group of researchers from\r\nmultiple disciplines to explore the important issues involved in developing a\r\ncomprehensive future research agenda to bridge the gap between wireless\r\nnetworking technologies and advances at the physical layer. A final workshop\r\ndocumenting the presentations, discussions, summary, and recommendations of the\r\ntwo-day workshop will be made available for public dissemination via a web\r\nsite.  Our expectation is that such findings will offer timely input to the\r\nwireless networking research community, and will have a long-term impact on\r\nfuture research.\r\n",
