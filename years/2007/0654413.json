Note that only few results\r\nabout statistical properties of orbits of large nonamenable groups are known.\r\nA part of this project addresses the question about the distribution of\r\norbits of lattices in Lie groups acting on homogeneous spaces. The methods,\r\nwhich utilize the equidistribution properties of unipotent flows (due to Ratner\r\nand others), apply to a large variety of natural actions of lattices. Since\r\nthe methods based on the Ratner theory do not provide effective estimates\r\non the rate of convergence, it is intended to develop a different approach\r\nthat gives effective error terms. The expected results of the proposal have\r\nseveral potential applications to number theory. In particular, we plan to\r\ninvestigate distribution of values at integer points of systems consisting\r\nof linear and quadratic forms. Another direction of research is the study\r\nof mixing properties of large groups of automorphisms of nilmanifolds.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this project is to investigate distribution of orbits\r\nof large discrete and continuous groups of motions on various spaces.\r\nQuestions about asymptotic distribution of families of mathematical objects\r\nappear in many different areas of mathematics: ergodic theory, number theory\r\n(e.g., distribution of prime numbers), geometry (e.g., distribution of closed\r\ngeodesics on a compact surface), PDE (e.g., distribution of eigenvalues of the\r\nLaplace operator), and others. When a family of the objects exhibits very\r\ncomplicated behavior, statistical properties of this family provide important\r\ninsights into its structure. In this project, we use methods of the theory of\r\ndynamical systems to derive results in number theory on the distribution of\r\ninteger points. Our study uncovers promising interplay between ergodic theory\r\nand number theory simultaneously enriching both of these areas of research.\r\nThis subject and its connections with many other branches of mathematics\r\nprovide an excellent introduction for graduate as well as undergraduate\r\nstudents to active research and can be used for presentations accessible to\r\naudiences of different levels.\r\n",
