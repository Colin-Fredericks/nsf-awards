 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Education Research Group at the University of Washington continues to do research and develop resources and tools to facilitate the active involvement of college and university physics departments in the professional development of teachers of physics and physical science in K-12 school systems.  Modules in two of the following topics - electrostatics, particulate nature of matter, energy, waves, and kinetics and dynamics - are added to the 10 modules already developed for Physics by Inquiry, the laboratory-based professional development curriculum for use by physics faculty.  Tutorials in Physics, a new curriculum modeled after the Tutorials in Introductory Physics, is comprised of in-depth supplements to college courses or for use in awareness workshops that help teachers reflect on their own learning and become aware of the difficulties their student will have with the concepts. Instructor Guides are developed as a resource to help physics faculty implement the above curricula.  Part I of a Learning Assessment Manual guides physics faculty in assessing progress in teacher learning; Part II helps teachers develop skills needed to monitor the progress of their students.  Summer institutes in physics and physical science and associated academic year continuation courses provide the environment for carrying out the research, and developing and testing the modules.  The research investigates how students and teachers learn specific content and reasoning skills for applying concepts to real world situations; how teachers can learn specific content in a way that helps them promote student learning; and how teachers can learn to assess student understanding in a way that guides them in promoting student learning.  Strategies to overcome intellectual barriers to the adoption of inquiry-oriented instructional materials are developed.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project was developed in response to the need to increase the number of elementary, middle and high school teachers able to teach science effectively.  In particular, the primary goals related to the need to help teachers: (1) develop an in-depth understanding of the science content that they are expected to teach; (2) implement inquiry-oriented curriculum in their classrooms; and (3) learn how to assess student understanding in a way that informs instruction.  The focus was on physics and physical science, areas in which the need for well-prepared teachers is especially acute.  As no single project can meet the needs for professional development for all teachers, another goal was to facilitate the involvement of physics faculty at other colleges and universities in providing preparation and professional development for teachers. \n\nThe core of the project was a professional development program for teachers that included intensive summer courses that immersed teachers in an inquiry learning experience, and follow-up courses in which teachers collaborated on implementing inquiry learning in their own classrooms.  In addition to helping participating teachers refine their knowledge and skills, the program provided the context for research on the learning and teaching of physics and for the development of resources that enable physics faculty at other colleges and universities to provide similar experiences for teachers.\n\nIntellectual merit:\n\nProject outcomes included research findings, which were published in several articles and presented in numerous talks and workshops.  In these articles and presentations we identified conceptual difficulties with specific physics topics that can impede learning by both teachers and their students.  We also provided evidence of the impact of participation in our program on teachers\u00c6 own conceptual knowledge and their skill in teaching.  Other outcomes included resources for physics faculty and other providers of courses and workshops aimed at improving teacher knowledge and skills.  The primary resource is a second edition of Physics by Inquiry.  Physics by Inquiry is a set of modules that describe experiments and exercises on a variety of topics typically covered in school science courses and that promote the development of deep conceptual understanding and strengthened scientific reasoning ability.  Also developed were an online guide for teaching with these materials (sample test questions, equipment lists, etc.) that enable others to design and conduct their own courses.  Since the first edition of Physics by Inquiry was published by John Wiley &amp; Sons in 1996, numerous others have conducted their own courses and reported the impact on teachers and their students in articles and talks.  The new edition covers new topics and updated versions of previously published modules. \n\nBetter prepared teachers are another direct outcome of the project.  During the project 134 individual teachers received a minimum of 160 hours of professional development.  Many of these teachers participated in additional courses over the lifetime of the project for up to 500 hours of professional development.  Six teachers became peer instructors and mentors in the courses themselves.  Data collected during the project indicates that teachers\u00c6 knowledge of science concepts improved, as did their scientific reasoning skills.  Observations made in teachers\u00c6 classrooms indicate that they improved their ability to teach in ways that engage students in learning.  Also benefiting from the project were 97 university students who took part in similar courses aimed at prospective teachers.  These courses were not directly supported by the grant, but students were able to study from the most up-to-date versions of course materials that were under development.  Many participants have pursued formal teaching credentials.\n\nBroader impacts:\n\nThe broader impact of the project includes the preparation of college and univers..."
