Millions of everyday users pass their personnel \r\ninformation over the Internet to their health-care providers, to \r\ntheir banks, to insurance companies and other service providers. \r\n\r\nOnce such personnel information is transferred, in many cases, it is \r\noutsourced to other parties (some of which may even reside in \r\nforeign countries) for storage and processing. It may be sold or \r\nresold for data mining. \r\n\r\nThe collection, processing and resale of private data is a \r\nmulti-million dollar industry that has serious security and privacy \r\nbreaches including inadvertently revealing or loosing the \r\npersonal information of thousands or millions of people. \r\n\r\nWhile there is a clear need for knowledge discovery for commercial \r\n(e.g., marketing, insurance design), scientific and even security \r\nreasons (e.g., identifying public health problem outbreaks such as \r\nepidemics, biological warfare instances), at present, ``data \r\nproducers'' (i.e., users like all of us) have no control of who, \r\nhow, and what exactly is done with such private and sensitive data. \r\n\r\nThis proposal considers the above fundamental problem by introducing \r\na novel mechanism called secure and auditable privacy \r\ncontracting (SAP-Contracting). An SAP-Contract can be used to \r\ndefine a tradeoff between level of privacy and amount of data \r\nmining. Such a tradeoff can be negotiated and customized between \r\ndata sources and data miners. An SAP-Contract defines precisely the \r\nfunctions and permitions that can be performed in personnel records. \r\nIt aims to bridge the need for privacy with the need for data \r\ncollection, transfer, marketing and processing; thus, enable \r\nsensitive private data to be treated as a commodity. \r\n\r\nSAP-Contracting is different from the current state of art such as \r\nprivacy preserving data mining approaches since it does not rely on \r\nserver based data hiding. It complements and benefits from the \r\nresearch on cryptographic databases. \r\n\r\nThe PIs propose to design, implement and test a prototype of this \r\nparadigm to establish a proof of a concept and show provable \r\nsecurity properties of SAP-Contracts, including \r\nconfidentiality, integrity, and auditability. \r\n\r\nIf successful this project will provide provable and auditable \r\nprivacy. It will marry privacy and data mining research with \r\ndifferent economical models and venture into new research areas. \r\n \r\n \r\n",
