 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves understanding the computational complexity of\r\nfundamental machine learning problems.  In particular, the\r\ninvestigators study which classic learning problems are unlikely to\r\nadmit efficient solutions.  In terms of broader impact, this line of\r\nresearch aids practitioners and algorithm designers as it outlines\r\nfundamental stumbling blocks for creating powerful learning systems.\r\nFor example, can we reduce difficult open problems from cryptography\r\n(e.g., factoring) and complexity theory (e.g., NP-complete languages)\r\nto certain problems in machine learning?  If so, this provides strong\r\nevidence that particular machine learning problems are hopelessly\r\nintractable.  Another avenue of research is to prove unconditional\r\nlower bounds on the resources required to infer functions in\r\nrestricted learning models.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the research lies in finding new reductions\r\nbetween problems in cryptography and complexity theory-- in particular\r\ncommunication complexity-- and problems from learning theory.  For\r\nexample, the PI studies the impact of lattice-based cryptography in\r\nmachine learning and examines its implications for the DNF learning\r\nproblem.  Additionally, the PI researches the use of communication\r\ncomplexity to rule out learning simple concept classes via small sets\r\nof arbitrary features.  We further delineate the role of Fourier\r\nanalysis in proving lower bounds in the well known model of\r\nStatistical Query learning.  Finally, this research investigates the\r\nrelationships between NP-completeness and circuit complexity to\r\ngeneral questions about proper learning and distribution-specific\r\nquery learning.\r\n",
