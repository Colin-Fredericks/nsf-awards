Similarly, given a never-ending stream \r\nof network traffic information, how can one monitor for anomalies, intrusions, \r\nand potential failures? The main idea behind this proposal is to treat both \r\nproblems using the theory of tensors. Despite the seemingly wide differences in \r\nthe two settings, they both boil down to finding patterns in multidimensional \r\narrays, sparse or dense. Tensors are exactly generalizations of matrices, \r\nand correspond roughly to ``DataCubes'' of data mining.  Matrix analysis \r\nand decompositions are part of the standard toolbox for data mining, \r\nproviding methods for dimensionality reduction, pattern discovery and\r\n``hidden variable'' discovery. Extending these tools to higher dimensionalities \r\nis valuable and tensors provide the tools to do this generalization. \r\nHowever, these tools have not yet been put to use in large volume data mining. \r\nThis is the main contribution of this proposal. The investigators propose \r\n(a) to design tensor decomposition algorithms that scale for large datasets,\r\nwith special attention to sparse datasets, and to never-ending streams of data \r\nand (b) to apply them on two driving applications, fMRI data analysis and network\r\ndata analysis.\r\n \r\nThe investigators propose to analyze large volumes of fMRI data performing\r\nthe following sub-tasks: cluster voxels with similar behavior over time for\r\na given subject and/or task or across subjects and/or tasks, \r\nclassify patterns of brain activity, and detect lag correlations\r\nand spatio-temporal patterns among fMRI time sequences. \r\nThe investigators also propose to perform the following inter-related \r\ntasks on multiple GigaBytes of network flow data: anomaly detection, \r\npattern discovery, and compression.\r\n\r\nBoth of these applications are important for medicine, health management,\r\nand for computer and national security. Analysis of fMRI data can help understanding\r\nhow the brain functions, which parts of the brain collaborate with what other parts, \r\nand whether there are variations across subjects and across task-related activities. \r\nFor the network traffic monitoring setting, fast detection of anomalies is important,\r\nto spot malware, port-scanning attempts, and just plain non-malicious failures.\r\n\r\nThe educational goals include incorporating the research findings in \r\nadvanced graduate courses at CMU (15-826) and at Temple (9664, 9665)\r\nand proposing tutorials in leading conferences in databases, \r\ndata mining and bio-informatics audiences.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the web page:  \r\nhttp://knight.cis.temple.edu/~vasilis/research/tensors.html\r\n\r\n",
