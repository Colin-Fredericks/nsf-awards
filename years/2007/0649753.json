 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides an NSF support for the Workshops on Quantitative Proteomics conducted by Middle Tennessee State University. Mathematics and computational science have become crucial technologies for the study of complex models of biological processes. The workshop will concentrate on the current research advances of proteomic data processing using mathematical tools and statistical techniques. The main themes that guide the topics of the workshops include (1) mathematical framework for modeling and representing proteomic mass spectrometry data, (2) data mining tools for feature extraction and biomarker discovery, (3) algorithms designing and software development for proteomic data processing and statistical analysis, and (4) proteomic data based survival models and survival analysis. \r\n\r\nThe workshop provides top scholars of applied mathematicians/statisticians and medical scientists in proteomics an opportunity to present their research results as well as collaborate on new research. One of the main goals of the workshop is to create a special opportunity for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and other young researchers, particularly those from the underrepresented groups, to meet the leading experts in this interdisciplinary  field, as well as to learn from them and their own peers about current developments, future trends, mathematical analysis in general, and the computational and statistical aspects of medical data analysis in particular, can be applied to solve problems in the medical sciences. \r\nThis workshop will play a crucial role in creating a significant impact of the new developing Ph.D. programs in the interdisciplinary sciences at Middle Tennessee State University. The experience is expected to prepare graduates for interdisciplinary science research training and influence them to continue their careers in this direction.\r\nOther than the interdisciplinary nature of this project, the workshop will also benefit both graduate and undergraduate students, and postdoctoral associates in the study of mathematics, biochemistry, bioinformatics, biostatistics, as well as computer science and biology. \r\n",
