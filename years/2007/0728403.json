 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science Scholars Program (SSP) is awarding scholarships averaging over $5,000 per year to approximately 50 academically talented, financially disadvantaged community college students over a four-year period. The students are pursuing careers or transfer degrees in astronomy, biology, biotechnology, botany, chemistry, environmental science, geology, marine science, oceanography, and physics. Scholars are chosen based on need, academic potential and other indicators of likely success. Scholarship recipients meeting the academic eligibility requirements may receive up to two years of support. Support for the science scholars includes extensive mentoring  and other forms of academic assistance, the establishment of cohort groups through shared math and science classes, programs to monitor student progress and identify students who are at risk, and programs to help students move into the workforce or to transfer to four-year institutions. The latter programs are supported by strong partnerships with industry and four-year institutions.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this work lies in the potential for the scholarships to recruit, educate, and mentor students from populations underrepresented in STEM fields. A strong recruiting program is reaching a large financially disadvantaged population that is very diverse. In addition, the project activities and advising paradigm are benefiting all STEM students, resulting in greater retention and in a cohort of faculty experienced in supporting and encouraging STEM students.",
