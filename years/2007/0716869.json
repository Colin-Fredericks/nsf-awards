 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tLakes of the northern forest regions of the U.S. vary widely in nutrient concentrations and water quality because of natural variation in the composition and configuration of vegetation in the watershed, and because of variation in inputs due to human activities.  Air pollution is the dominant human source of nitrogen loading, and lakeshore development is a primary source of phosphorus loading.  This research will use a novel, spatially-explicit modeling approach to quantify the watershed controls on nutrient concentrations across a set of more than 350 lakes within New York's Adirondack Park.  The research involves sampling the chemistry of each of the lakes, and then using datasets on the topography and vegetation of each watershed to estimate the rates of nutrient input from different vegetation types.  The research will also examine how lakeshore vegetation modifies inputs from the rest of the watershed.  \r\n\tThe Adirondack Park is a unique mix of public and private lands, and the shorelines of more than half of the lakes are in private property.  Staff from the Adirondack Park Agency view this research as a critical tool in the identification of lakes that are particularly sensitive to changes in nutrient loading as a function of changes in land-use. Results from this research will also be used to develop teaching materials for the IES Ecosystem Literacy Initiative (ELI).  This initiative provides educational outreach to teachers, students, and the public to develop an understanding of how human welfare depends on ecosystem services.\r\n",
