 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is increasing the number of underrepresented students in the mathematical sciences (mathematics, applied mathematics with tracks in mathematical biology, mathematical economics, computational mathematics, and statistics).  It is supporting a cohort of up to 25 scholars per year.  This program provides special faculty mentoring and includes a weekly seminar featuring invited speakers, expository lectures, problem sessions, technology topics, research topics, and student presentations for the cohort. In addition, the cohort is participating in local and regional conferences, self- (vertical) mentoring, MAA Student Chapter activities, and meetings with similar students from other universities.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is based on the evidence that student cohorts involved in unique extracurricular activities create a supportive environment that ensures their retention, academic success, and timely graduation. In addition, by working together, these students are engaging in more challenging problems and areas of research than would otherwise be possible. This project is producing broad impact on society because it is increasing the number of students in the STEM areas, and also drawing upon groups of people who have previously participated at low rates.",
