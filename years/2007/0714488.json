 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organomeallic (IBO) Chemistry Program supports work by Professor David N. Hendrickson at the University of California, San Diego, to advance our understanding and ability to control the quantum properties of single-molecule magnets (SMMs).  The miniaturization of magnetic devices to the nanometer size using conventional fabrication techniques has serious limitations, chiefly associated with the difficulty in realizing monodisperse nanomagnets with well-defined structure, composition and characteristics.  For this reason, there is a growing interest in a molecule-based approach whereby magnetic nanostructures are synthesized chemically in solution at ambient temperatures.  SMMs enable fundamental studies of quantum effects associated with magnetic nanostructures that have previously been inaccessible.  For instance, these molecular nanomagnets allow for the first time the study of quantum tunneling of magnetization.  The magnetic moment (spin) of an individual molecular magnet changes direction from \"\"spin up\"\" to \"\"spin down\"\" by quantum tunneling, not by being thermally activated to change the direction of its magnetic moment.  Research has been designed to address some of the important fundamental questions related to nanomagnetism, and to explore avenues for the implementation of SMMs in future devices. The properties of SMMs depend on many factors, e.g. spin of the ground state, shape, chemical composition, symmetry/anisotropy, and proximity to other SMMs.  New SMMs are being prepared with an eye to adjusting the various factors controlling the nature of magnetization dynamics.  The mechanism of magnetization tunneling is not well understood.  Single-molecule magnets offer the potential for data storage on the nanoscale.  Even more importantly they could serve as quantum computing devices.  Collaborations involve several physics groups in three different countries and several chemistry groups.   Graduate students will receive a high level training in physical methods, particularly those relating to magnetism.\r\n",
