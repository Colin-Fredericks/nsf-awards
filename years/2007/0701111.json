 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Lu and Szekely  build on their previous work in combinatorics and graph theory and continue their research on problems related to  graph visualization and graph drawing; random graph models; tree indices relevant for chemistry; models for biomolecular sequence evolution; and phylogeny reconstruction for species evolution. They also  continue their long-running projects on fundamental questions in extremal set theory, extremal graph theory, and discrete geometry. \r\nThe particular problems on which they work include\r\n* the further development of the theory of crossing numbers\r\n  of graphs and of better graph drawing algorithms;\r\n* improving current bounds on Turan type extremal problem on hypergraphs,\r\n  one of the toughest problems in extremal combinatorics;\r\n* improving our knowledge on Property B, where notoriously\r\n  hard problems provide testing ground for new techniques;\r\n* extending current  probabilistic tools in combinatorics\r\n  to be applicable in a new or more general scenario;\r\n* work towards the unification of random graph models;\r\n* searching for new insights on antichains and on\r\n  intersecting families of subsets;\r\n* reach a much better understanding  of the Randic index,\r\n  a concept of extremal graph theory that has been introduced and widely\r\n  used in chemistry;\r\n* continuing the study of models of  biomolecular\r\n  sequence evolution and phylogenetic trees, of phylogenetic tree\r\n  reconstruction algorithms, in particular the maximum likelihood method,\r\n  and investigating the phylogeny problem in the setting of inverting\r\n  random functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is increasing demand to understand ``optimal''\r\nextreme structures  and ``typical'' random structures in discrete mathematics as this understanding often leads to  new  algorithms This project will investigate basic combinatorial questions about structures and will look for various applications of discrete mathematics in computer science, biology, and engineering.\r\nIn addition, the proposers plan to continue their interdisciplinary collaborations with colleagues from engineering, biology, statistics, and computer science, and expect to solve some of their new problems.\r\n",
