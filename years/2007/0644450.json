 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cellular networks are part of our critical information infrastructure.\r\nHowever, the upcoming broadband cellular data networks and mobile\r\ndevices have unique vulnerabilities that have attracted little\r\nresearch attention.  The PI proposes a five-year plan for\r\nunderstanding the inherent vulnerabilities and developing technologies\r\nfor improving the security of cellular data networks and mobile\r\ndevices.  Particularly, the PI will focus on the following unique\r\nvulnerabilities in cellular data systems: (1) Scarce battery power in\r\nmobile devices; (2) Expensive wireless bandwidth; (3) Scarce wireless\r\nresources shared among benign and malicious mobile devices.  To\r\naddress these vulnerabilities, the PI proposes a comprehensive\r\nsolution consisting of three components: (1) On mobile devices,\r\ndesigning and enforcing access control policies on power consumption;\r\n(2) At mobile switching centers (MSC), designing and deploying\r\nfirewalls configurable by individual mobile devices but verifiable by\r\nthe MSC; (3) At base stations, detecting malicious mobile devices that\r\nabuse shared resources.\r\n\r\nThis project will have direct, visible impact on improving the\r\nsecurity of broadband cellular data networks.  The discovered\r\nvulnerabilities and proposed defense mechanisms will help cellular\r\nproviders secure their networks proactively before the adversaries\r\ndeliver devastating attacks.  Experiences gained in this project will\r\nhelp guide the security design of future cellular data networks.  The\r\nnovel analysis, simulation, and evaluation techniques developed in\r\nthis project will be valuable to teachers and researchers in\r\nin security, networking, and programming languages.\r\n\r\nThe proposed education mission is to train students to become capable\r\nsecurity researchers or practitioners through classroom teaching, \r\nreal-life problem solving, and research advising.\r\n",
