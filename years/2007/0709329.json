The large-scale sensor network and grid computing platform service the following research projects:\r\n.\tHigh-Throughput Networking Protocols;\r\n.\tAn Autonomic Sensor Grid System Framework;\r\n.\tCollaborative Dynamic Tracking and Information Processing;\r\n.\tIntrusion Detection; and\r\n.\tEnabling Multidisciplinary Applications.\r\nThe first project investigates techniques to enhance dynamic sensor network throughput while contributing to meet the emerging data intensive and high data rate requirements of many applications. The second designs, implements, and evaluates the ASGC framework that integrates sensor networks and grid computing technologies with self-managing capabilities providing self-managing middleware and user and programming interfaces for query, visualization, analysis, and physical discovery phenomena, and further command and control of actuators/robots for synergistic tasks in coordinated manners. The third develops high confidence coordination algorithms and tools for hybrid (static and motion-enabled) sensor networks and explores power-aware collaborative information processing techniques. The fourth investigates attack modeling and analysis, large-scale intrusion detection and tracing, and deceiving attackers' techniques. The fifth includes Precision Agriculture and Ranching, Protective Clothing, Vehicle Navigation, Homeland Security, Environmental Monitoring, and Rapid Disaster Recovery.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The infrastructure contributes in the development of new courses, recruiting under-represented/minority students, outreach and minority participation, and technology transfer to industry. The new courses include Cooperative Robotic Networks, Sensor Networks, Embedded Systems, and Grid Computing. Plans include involving Native Americans and Langston University, an HBCU. Moreover, the facility contributes to broaden education and research in an EPCSoR state. Precision agriculture in crop and livestock production appears to be an interesting and useful application for the state.\r\n",
