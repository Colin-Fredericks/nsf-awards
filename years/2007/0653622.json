 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests operational funding to support scientists working at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) on the VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) project. High-energy particle astrophysics has been revolutionized during the last decade as a result of discoveries made by both space-borne and ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. At GeV energies, the EGRET satellite telescope detected over 300 point sources of which less than one-fourth have been positively associated with known objects at other wavelengths. Similarly, ground-based telescopes using the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique have now detected more than 35 point sources of gamma-radiation at energies above 100 GeV.  With these detections, we are beginning to explore and understand the acceleration and emission mechanisms taking place in the most energetic objects in the universe. The need to more fully explore the high-energy sky to search for, and understand, these cosmic accelerators is stronger now than ever. \r\n\r\nOn the ground, VERITAS, an array of four large atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, will start full operations in March 2007. VERITAS will be an order of magnitude more sensitive, and operate at a significantly lower energy threshold, than the earlier generation of instruments. It will also be the most sensitive gamma-ray telescope in the northern hemisphere and will be comparable in performance to the four-telescope H.E.S.S. array in the south. The construction of the VERITAS array is on track for completion by December 2006. Operation of the first telescope in 2005 demonstrated that all performance attributes of the instrument have been achieved. Two telescopes have detected several Very High Energy gamma-ray sources and have verified the principle of array operation. Science observations with the four-telescope array will start in March 2007 at a temporary site at the base camp of the Whipple Observatory. \r\n\r\nThe UCLA group is committed to supporting the overall VERITAS Education and Public Outreach (EPO) program, which it helped to develop. The EPO program will reach local audiences at the Whipple Observatory Visitor's Center, museum audiences at the Adler Planetarium, and the general public through the VERITAS education web site. VERITAS materials will also be used for local EPO efforts at UCLA involving schools in the Los Angeles area. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
