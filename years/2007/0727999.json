 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gasoline engines from a mechanical engineering point-of-view are torque producers for\r\ntransportation and power generating systems. Traditionally, mechanical engineers investigate fueling\r\ncontrol solutions that maintain the engine exhaust AFR at 14.1 and avoid engine misfires. From a\r\nchemical engineering view point, gasoline engines are emissions producers that feed chemical\r\nreactors (exhaust aftertreatment systems). This research project seeks a revolutionary approach to\r\nengine fueling controller design and exhaust aftertreatment design for lean burn operations, and the\r\noptimal integration of the engine with the exhaust aftertreatment system through nonlinear control.\r\nCollectively these efforts will produce maximal fuel economy while ensuring zero tailpipe emissions.\r\nThese step advancements in transportation system powertrains will be the results of a close\r\ncollaboration between mechanical engineers and chemical engineers. Moreover, this research will\r\nadvance an interdisciplinary research project facilitated through a cross-disciplinary education. This\r\nnew graduate education model builds on cross-training by having ME students take ChemE course\r\nand ChemE students taking ME courses. Our approach has mechanical engineering students taking\r\nChemE reaction engineering and catalysis courses so that chemical reactions producing exotherms\r\ncan be integrated into their heat transfer knowledge base. The chemical engineers will take MECE\r\nsystems modeling (lumped parameter modeling), robust controls and systems diagnostics.\r\nUltimately, the 21st century ultra-clean and ultra-efficient power transformation engineer will be\r\nproduced. The national impact of these engineers will lead to a decrease in dependence on foreign\r\noil and will have a positive impact on the environment. It is anticipated that this work will lead to\r\nultra-efficient next generation engines that will be environmentally friendly since the combustion\r\nevent will be used to clean the air.",
