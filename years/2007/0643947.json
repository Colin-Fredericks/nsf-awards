 "awd_abstract_narration": "On the surface, analyzing the 2003 blackout in New York City, evaluating transportation systems for bottlenecks and emergency preparedness, and imaging a cell's genetic activity are very different challenges. However, these and many other important problems are all characterized by limited measurements of discrete events, such as a cascading series of system failure events, vehicles passing a small number of checkpoints in a transportation network, or tiny pulses of light emitted by a gene-triggered dye. This research is focused on the development of innovative theoretical and computational tools based on sophisticated statistical analyses for extracting meaningful information from small numbers of indirectly observed discrete events. Several educational programs are tightly coupled with these research pursuits, including the development of novel hands-on student activities focused on deriving information from indirect measurements.\r\n\r\nThese programs are designed to stimulate interest in engineering disciplines through real-world examples and ultimately improve technical literacy. Data-starved inference on high-dimensional point processes encompasses a wide variety of fundamental theoretical challenges coupled with many critical applications, including fluorescence microscopy, network traffic analysis, astrophysics, and spectroscopy. This research comprises the development of a theoretical and methodological framework for analyzing and guiding the design of high-dimensional, data-starved, and complex event-based systems which may be dynamically changing, marked with auxiliary feature vectors, or supported on irregular topologies. The educational aspects of this work are tightly integrated with the research activities and help further advance the understanding of signal processing challenges and tools among both engineers and society at large. In particular, the investigators are designing outreach activities for primary and secondary school students and developing undergraduate- and graduate-level courses on multidimensional and statistical signal processing.\r\n\r\n",

The new method displayed estimates the structure in the underlying scene by learning key features and patterns in the image from very noisy data. \n\n\n\n\n\nData-starved inference for point processes also plays a key role in a wide variety of non-imaging contexts. For example, when monitoring interactions within a social network, meetings or contacts between different members of the network are recorded, and understanding the underlying pattern for a series of events makes it possible to identify structure and correlations among the people. The method developed under this project was applied to social network data extracted from the Enron email database and allowed the PI to correctly identify anomalous email patterns corresponding to significant events in the company\u00c6s history. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne common thread underlying all the research is this project is the importance of exploiting signal structure to make signal reconstruction robust to noise, missing data, or constrained sensing resources.
