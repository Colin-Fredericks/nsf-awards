 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate and apply models describing light-tissue interaction in the muscle tissue. A Monte Carlo model is proposed with validation sought using a hyperspectral imaging system. The model will be applied to detecting sarcomere length changes which is motivated by its impact on muscular diseases and its importance to the meat industry. Additional advancements include examining polarized light propagation and developing a multilayer model. These models enable the assessment of sarcomere length, which provides a valuable means for judging meat quality in meat industry.  In the long-term, these models could also potentially have a high impact on clinical medicine, especially in the area of muscular diseases (aging, muscular dystrophy, etc).  The education and outreach plan will explore student-centered active learning/teaching methodology, educating diverse student groups, and organizing summer research experiences.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
