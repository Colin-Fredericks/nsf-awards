  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\nSalish Kootenai College had two complementary goals and six objectives that the activities of this five-year project were designed to achieve.\nGoal 1: Increase the number of baccalaureate STEM degree offerings at SKC in order to increase the number of Native American students successfully entering the STEM workforce or going on to STEM graduate programs.\nObjective 1: Develop and introduce a new B.S. in Life Sciences degree program.\nSKC was accredited to offer this degree in November 2010, and the first graduates were in June 2012. There were 14 declared B.S in Life Sciences majors in the 2012-13 academic year.\nObjective 2: Develop and introduce a new B.S. in Computer Engineering degree program.\nSKC was accredited to offer this degree starting in 2007, the first baccalaureate engineering degree at a tribal college. There were three computer engineering graduates by June 2012, and all three have gone on to full time employment in their field, two with federal agnecies (NASA and the National Security Agency). There were 12 declared B.S in Computer Engineering majors in the 2012-13 academic year.\nObjective 3: Develop and introduce the new science, engineering, and mathematics course offerings needed to meet Objectives 1-2 using curricula in these courses that incorporate rigorous mathematical approaches.\n29 new courses in science, engineering, and mathematics have been added to SKC course offerings through this project. Three new full time faculty positions were created to support increased student enrollment and expanded course offerings, one each in chemistry, mathematics, and computer engineering.\nGoal 2: Improve and enhance the existing STEM course and degree offerings of SKC to increase student achievement in these classes and thereby increase the number of graduates from these degree offerings, and also improve the success of these students upon entering the STEM workforce or upon entering STEM graduate programs.\nObjective 4: Develop and introduce new course offerings to enable students graduating from the existing B.S. in Information Technology degree program to successfully enter graduate programs in computer science and information technology.\nFive new core computer science courses (Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms and Data Structures, Computer Organization, Computer Architecture, and Operating Systems) were created as part of development of the B.S in Computer Engineering program. SKC B.S. in Information Technology students who complete these core computer science courses along with programming and calculus classes meet requirements for entry into graduate-level computer science programs.\nObjective 5: Modify existing science, technology, and engineering course offerings to more fully incorporate rigorous mathematical approaches.\n54 existing science, engineering, and mathematics courses have been improved through this project.\nObjective 6: Offer ten internship experiences per year to students pursuing STEM baccalaureate degrees that are designed to bridge the transition into the STEM workforce or into STEM graduate programs.\nA total of 68 student internship experiences working with SKC faculty and staff were provided for students during the five-year project. These experiences included research in environmental toxicology, search for new bacteriophages, natural products chemistry, planetary surface robotic rover concept development, submersible vehicle design for fisheries research, scientific camera design and development for flights on a high-altitude balloon and a small satellite, solar spectrometer design, satellite ground station design, weather station design, IT support services, and ISP support services.\nBroader Impacts\nIn addition to providing new B.S. in Life Sciences and B.S. in Computer Engineering degrees for SKC students, these degree programs offer students from other tribal colleges the possibility of a 2 + 2 transfer to another tribal college, rather than to a non-tribal college.
