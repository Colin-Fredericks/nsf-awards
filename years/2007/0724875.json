 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a new family of n-type conjugated semiconducting polymers for use in plastic photovoltaics and other organic electronic devices.  New n-type semiconducting polymers with good solubility, environmental stability, and high charge carrier mobility are needed to fabricate efficient organic solar cells and other electronic devices. During the Phase I project several n-type semiconducting polymers were fabricated via simple reactions. In Phase II the polymers will be optimized to improve their solubility and charge mobility. Partnership with a major developer of organic photovoltaics will allow the materials to be optimized for use in organic solar cells.\r\n\r\nThe further development of these n-type semiconducting polymers will result in the manufacture and sale of these materials as specialty chemicals to the organic electronic industry for the fabrication of a variety of organic devices including photovoltaic devices, thin film transistors, organic light emitting diodes, and others. The novelty of this chemistry over the chemistry of current n-type organic semiconductors has the potential for significant academic and scientific value and could lead to a cascade of new discoveries and technology advancements, in addition to the primary objective of creating a new business.",
