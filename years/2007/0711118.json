 "awd_abstract_narration": "The population of new Mexicans and first generation Mexican Americans is increasing dramatically in the southeastern United States. New teachers of science are finding it difficult to work with the new group that includes a large number of students from families of low socioeconomic status, with intermittent school attendance patterns in their home country and who lack literacy skills in Spanish as well. The conference and its accompanying Cyberconference are to establish a research agenda to strengthen pre-service education of teachers of science who teach this population of students. The study of existing programs elsewhere forms the basis for understanding their effectiveness, the differences between programs, and the knowledge and skill base needed by the teachers who serve this community. Conference participants include researchers in teacher education, science education, English as a Second Language, bilingual education, second language acquisition and learning, assessment, and sociology of education, as well as pre- and in-service teachers, administrators, and state department personnel from high need, Hispanic-serving school systems and schools. The diverse audience for the conference provides a forum for discussion of major priorities and research areas along with methodological concerns and strategies to implement the research in pre-service teacher education. A post-conference website provides a forum for the continuation of the discussion and the posting of research results.",
