 "awd_abstract_narration": "Washburn and Paulson\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to understand friction at the atomic and mesoscopic scales.  At this level friction is poorly understood, though as mechanical and electromechanical devices shrink, the effects of friction become dominant.  The approach is to combine sensitive frictional force measurements with state of the art microscopy and diffraction techniques capable of determining the positions of individual atoms on both surfaces.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: For decades technology has relied on the further miniaturization of electrical and mechanical systems.   At nanometer size scales currently attainable by state of the art fabrication techniques, friction (andstiction) is orders of magnitude larger than forces such as gravity. A fundamental understanding of friction at the nanometer length scale is crucial to design and engineering in future nanoscale technologies. Carbon nanotubes will be used as model surfaces nearly free of dangling bonds and defects, and will provide data to compare with theoretical and computational models.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Beyond the scientific impact of the work, the results of the study will underpin future technological advances toward electromechanical devices in the workplace as sensors, etc.  Device structures in this work should provide testbeds for the next generation of nanometer electrical and mechanical devices.  A separate beneficial \"\"side-effect\"\" of this work will be to launch the next generation of scientists.  The increased participation of under-represented groups at UNC will ripple through the future of the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
