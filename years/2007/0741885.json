This method relies on the use of micro-scale fluid flows to create droplets of organic solvents with very regular sizes. If the droplets contain dissolved polymers and/or dispersed nanoparticles, then simply by removing the organic solvent, nearly monodisperse collections of solid particles can be prepared. By working with well defined droplet sizes, fundamental questions about how phase separation and interfacial segregation occur in these droplets as the solvent is removed can be systematically addressed, and new particles with interesting morphologies and enhanced functionalities can be produced.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the goals of the project are to:\r\n1) Understand the behavior of amphiphilic block copolymers dissolved in a shrinking droplet of organic solvent, and use this approach to prepare new polymeric assemblies, such as hexosomes and dendritic particles\r\n2) Prepare multifunctional micro- and nanoparticles that serve as fluorescent barcodes or combine complementary properties of different types of nanoparticles \r\n3) Determine how aggregation and interfacial segregation of nanoparticles within composite particles can be tuned by factors such as the interactions between nanoparticle ligands and the composite particle matrix\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe scientific outcomes of the proposed work will contribute to our basic understanding of phase separation in composite micro- and nanoparticles, and result in formation of novel particles that may find applications in drug delivery and cancer therapy. Elements of this work will be incorporated into an outreach program at UMass called Science & Engineering Saturdays, which provides opportunities for K-12 science teachers to learn about areas of current research interest, including microfluidics and nanotechnology. Undergraduate and graduate students will learn about interdisciplinary and technologically-important areas of soft materials and nanotechnology, both in a research and a classroom setting. Finally, the program will provide the student community at UMass the opportunity for solid introductory training in an area that is too often neglected in graduate science education: how to teach effectively. This experience will provide the next generation of science educators with a working knowledge of effective teaching practices that extend beyond the traditional lecture format, such as active and project-based learning. By doing so, this program seeks to improve the quality of science education, and its accessibility to a diverse audience, at programs throughout the country.\r\n",
