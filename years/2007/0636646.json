Differential\r\ngeometry plays a vital role in the study of quantum field theory\r\nthrough index theory, microlocal analysis, and mirror\r\nsymmetry. Homotopy theory has become an essential tool in the\r\nstudy of geometry and physics, through the tools of A-infinity\r\ncategories and derived categories.  Representation theory and\r\nnumber theory have been developing links with conformal field\r\ntheory through analogies between the Langlands program and the\r\ngeometric Langlands program. Northwestern University is fortunate\r\nto have on its faculty world leaders in each of these directions\r\nof research. It is the ambition of this group to attain national\r\nleadership in training students and postdoctoral researchers in\r\nthese fields.\r\n\r\nThe physical world writes its laws in the language of\r\nmathematics, and progress in physics is intimately connected to\r\nprogress in the development of mathematical methods and\r\ntheories. In contemporary mathematical physics, geometry, in many\r\ndifferent forms, and representation theory (the study of\r\nsymmetry) play a central role. The mathematical physics group at\r\nNorthwestern is particularly well-placed to attain its goal of\r\nincreasing the number of US citizens who pursue careers in\r\nmathematical physics: the university attracts a particularly\r\nstrong group of undergraduates (through its renowned Integrated\r\nScience Program, for example); the graduate program has become\r\nmore selective; and the mathematics department has developed a\r\npostdoctoral program, which has been consistently successful at\r\nattracting women and has consistently placed postdocs in\r\nsuccessful academic positions.\r\n",
