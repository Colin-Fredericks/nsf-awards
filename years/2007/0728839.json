 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental Algorithms for Data Management\r\n\r\nWe are in an era where data (entertainment, media) is expected to be available on demand, and not primarily through broadcast methods such as TV. Storage technologies will need to cope with extremely high demand, with high quality of service. Storing large amounts of data and making it accessible to a very large number of users will be a challenge. The focus of this research is to develop fundamental algorithms for managing data in large scale storage systems. This research focuses on data of all types, ranging from multimedia data stored on a collection of disks, as well as data that is being collected and stored in a distributed sensor network. This research addresses the question of how to develop algorithms to manage this data effectively and efficiently. This project will involve training of a graduate student, and the development of a course on data management methods.\r\n\r\nThis research develops tools and methods for managing data, with a special focus on data layout and  data migration. The data layout specifies for a storage system, how many replicas are required to cope with the demand, and which servers they should reside on.\r\nThis problem is NP-hard and our goal is to develop fast and practical approximation algorithms for it.\r\nThe goal of data migration is to focus on the problem of re-organizing the layout when the demand pattern changes over time.\r\nWe also consider energy issues in data collection and monitoring in sensor networks.\r\n",
