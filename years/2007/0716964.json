This research will combine field observations, controlled laboratory\r\nexperiments and modern molecular tools to address fundamental questions regarding\r\nthe distributional patterns observed among three topminnow species in the Fundulus\r\nnotatus species complex. Throughout the Midwestern and Southern United States, the\r\nspecies encounter one another in numerous hybrid zones, making them an ideal group\r\nfor study.\r\nThe proposed research will comprehensively address the evolutionary history of the F.\r\nnotatus species group and will increase our understanding of the role evolutionary and\r\necological processes play in producing and maintaining the species diversity we\r\nobserve today. Moreover, this research has important conservation implications and will\r\nbe of interest to various state agencies. The research program will integrate teaching\r\nand research by involving undergraduate and graduate students in the research\r\nenterprise at the two diverse universities. Personnel active in the research will\r\nparticipate in existing outreach programs aimed at recruiting underrepresented groups\r\ninto the sciences and improving science literacy in pre-collegiate students.",
