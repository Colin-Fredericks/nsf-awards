The students will conduct research in New Caledonia with research scientist from the Bureau de Geologie de la Nouvelle-Caledonie, the University of New Caledonia, and the University of Auckland. This is a three year project to study the Noumea Basin involving up to fourteen undergraduate students and one MSc student.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the research is to determine the volcanic history of the basin by combining basic geologic mapping techniques with modern geochemical analyses. This work will identify the nature, style, extent and age of volcanism, in addition to possible relationships between the units (both mafic and felsic) in order to better understand the processes responsible for generating the volcanism.  The active tectonic processes along the eastern Gondwana margin will also be explored.  Once a model for the volcanic history of the Noumea Basin is constructed, the results of the study will then be used to investigate the possible effects of volcanic hazards on the region during the late Cretaceous (such as possible extinctions, climate changes, changes in drainage etc). Finally the results of this work will be combined with findings in New Zealand, Australia and Antarctica to further our understanding of volcanism within the region and the tectonic processes responsible for magma generation.\r\n\r\nThis research will provide undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to participate in research with scientists from around the world; international cultural experiences, critical thinking opportunities and hand-on field and laboratory experience. This project will be the basis of further international scientific projects between scientists in the U.S.A., France, New Zealand and New Caledonia on sedimentology, volcanology, igneous and metamorphic petrology, geophysics and tectonics of the greater region. Increased opportunities are expected for future collaborations, funding opportunities, cultural awareness, and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, a better understanding of the tectonic history and metamorphism in the igneous and sedimentary units may have implications for exploration and exploration strategies in an area of extensive nickel and gold mining.\r\n",
