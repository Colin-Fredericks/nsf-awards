 "awd_abstract_narration": "This symposium will provide an opportunity to deal with the recent advances in synthesis of nanophase and nanocomposite materials.  Numerous studies have been conducted on nanoscale materials over the last two decades or so, and industrial applications are in sight.  The nanoscale materials can be engineered as homogeneous ceramics, metals, semiconductors or as ceramic-ceramic, metal-ceramic, metal-metal, metal-semiconductor, and inorganic-organic composite materials in order to impart special properties to bulk materials and coatings and for use in nanotechnology.  \r\n\r\nThe nanotechnology arena is expanding, and as it expands, we are seeing more fragmentation to the research area.  This area of continuous phase materials is still growing (both in academic as well as government and industrial labs), and the number of contributions that are made each time this symposium is organized is also growing. This symposium is planned to bring together scientists from a multitude of disciplines within science and engineering to present and discuss the progress made in these materials and their applications.\r\n",
