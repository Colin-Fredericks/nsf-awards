 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This program will enable a group of scientists and engineers early in their careers to attend the 2007 International Conference on Electroceramics. The conference will be held in Arusha, Tanzania. Supporting this travel has two important outcomes: 1) A diverse group of young researchers will participate in a conference venue involving the world's leading researchers in the fundamentally and commercially important field of electronic ceramic materials, and 2) The group will receive an important introduction to East African culture and establish ties to African scientists that form future collaborations beneficial to our respective countries. This travel assistance program will involve greater than 50% participation by groups underrepresented in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: Electroceramic materials serve as the foundation for numerous existing technologies and the source for new property-performance combinations that contribute to the world's most important technical needs. To meet these challenges a continuous influx of bright young researchers must be recruited and trained. Providing this travel experience to a group of NSF Travel Fellows will influence career paths, support a diverse and vibrant scientific community, and maintain the leadership role of the United States in science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.",
