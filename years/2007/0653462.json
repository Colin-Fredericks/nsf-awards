 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the Penn State group's participation in and support of LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) activities.  Work supported under this award includes the analysis of LIGO data for gravitational wave bursts arising from astronomical sources, including but not limited to supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and black hole mergers; the development of simulated data sets to support the analysis activities of other LSC research groups; investigations into detector noise sources and their mitigation; and the interpretation of LIGO observations with the goal of astronomical discovery.\r\nAll these activities center on making tighter the connection between LIGO observations and their astrophysical interpretation, and increasing the sensitivity of LIGO observations through more sophisticated and discriminating analysis techniques, and through improved data quality and understanding of the detector.  The broader impact of these activities includes enabling the broader LIGO mission, the development of gravitational wave observations as a tool of astronomical discovery, the research education and training of postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students",
