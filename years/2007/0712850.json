 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Argentina award will support a planning visit by Dr. R Paul Singh of the University of California, Davis, to Santa Fe, Argentina to establish collaborative research projects with his counterparts, Dr. Susana E. Zorrilla at Instituto de Desarrollo Tecnologico para la Industria Quimica (INTEC) in Santa Fe, and with Drs. Noemi E. Zaritzky and Viviana O. Salvadori , at Centro de Investigacion y Desarrollo en Criotecnologia de Alimentos (CIDCA), in La Plata, Argentina.  Their collaboration involves advanced simulation for mathematical modeling in food processing.\r\nArgentina has great potential in food processing, and the counterpart researchers are interested in building capacities for using modern techniques for the design of new equipment and processes for the food industry. \r\n\r\nThis visit will allow Dr. Singh to strengthen the relationship he has started with his counterparts in Argentina with his own group at UC, Davis.  They will study new problems related to modeling and simulation, and integrate knowledge reached by the Argentine groups and Dr. Singh's lab.  The results of this project will provide a venue for an integrated (multidisciplinary and international) research effort aimed at solving problems in this important area.  It will offer an excellent setting for training future scientists, both in the US and in Argentina.  The US university involved will benefit by attracting excellent Argentine students to their PhD programs and this attraction will extend well beyond the life of the anticipated research project.\r\n",
