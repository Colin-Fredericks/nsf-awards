 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research - Midscal Instrumentation program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activity in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate supports a collaborative team from University of Illinois Chicago, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, and the University of Michigan to construct a new instrument. The instrument called Intermediate Energy X-ray Collaborative Development Team (IEX-CDT) will be located at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) and will combine two techniques: angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and soft x-ray resonant scattering studies of materials and patterned devices, with a spot size of order of few micrometer. Uniting these two techniques in a single facility will allow to investigate new materials and, more broadly, to bridge the realms of synchrotron-based x-ray scattering and spectroscopy. In addition, the Department of Energy, through the APS budget, will provide $ 3.17 M million towards the construction costs. The APS will also provide engineering expertise, strict safety oversight, and quality assurance procedures.   \r\nThe instrument will be a user facility available to the general users through the APS peer-reviewed general user program. The facility will also be available for hands on training within the Argonne's National Laboratory's School on Neutron and X-Ray Scattering. In addition the PIs, plan to organize a soft x-ray science workshop where results obtained at the proposed instrument and similar facilities in other nations, are disseminated through the scientific community. The facility will be maintained and operated by the APS.",
