 "awd_abstract_narration": "L'evy processes form a family of models  that is the cornerstone of\r\nthe modern probability. Research related to L'evy processes is broad\r\nand deep, and the results are used in further research in probability,\r\nin other areas of mathematics, and in numerous applications. This\r\nproposal is designed to make funds available to support researchers \r\nfrom the United States who are interested in participating in the 5th\r\nL'evy conference in Denmark in August 2007. This will serve to\r\nincrease timely dissemination of ideas between the specialists \r\nworking on L'evy processes, and stimulate the research by the younger\r\npeople, particularly by the students.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is at least a perception, and it is based on available evidence,\r\nsome of which is provided in the proposal, that much of the research\r\nactivity on L'evy processes is conducted outside of the US, mostly in\r\nEurope and Japan. This proposal aims to take a step towards improving\r\nthe visibility of the research on L'evy processes done in the United\r\nStates and also making it more obvious to graduate students and junior\r\nresearchers that research in L'evy processes is an important and\r\ninteresting area to pursue.",
