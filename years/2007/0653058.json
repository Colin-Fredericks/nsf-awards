Retention is being increased by a new learning community model, called a learning village or meta-community. The learning village model incorporates various learning communities as well as service learning projects for engineering students in their second and third years of study. First-year and gateway engineering courses are being reviewed to better engage students, to provide flexibility, and to support transfer students. The ACCESS program makes gateway courses available through distance education. Student-centered advising broadens the diversity of students enrolled in engineering and makes students aware of the various paths to successfully completing an engineering degree, including transfer from a community college. ISU Extension is a partner on the project to develop the STEM TEC (Talent in Every County) initiative.\r\n",

Undergraduate enrollments in engineering consistently increased during the grant period to 7272 in fall 2013. The gains in engineering students enrolled and graduated were 28% and 58%, which are higher than national gains reported by ASEE over the same time period of 19% and 25%,respectively.

Engineering transfer learning communities are now available at Iowa State. These strategies have engaged community college transfer students while still at the community college and early in their transition.
