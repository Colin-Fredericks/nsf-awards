 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports attendance by U.S. participants in a summer school and a subsequent conference to be held in Montreal, Canada in June, 2008:\r\n\r\n(1)  The Summer School on Symmetries and Integrability of Difference Equations, to be held 9-21 June 2008, is organized as a NATO Advanced Study Institute in the framework of the Seminaire de Mathematiques Superieures (SMS), a series of summer schools organized at the Universite de Montreal annually since 1962.\r\n\r\n(2)  The conference, Symmetries and Integrability of Difference Equations, to be held 23-29 June 2008, is the 8th in a series, begun in 1994, of biennial meetings in the field.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the summer school is to make the recent progress in the field of symmetries and integrability of difference equations available to researchers at the graduate-student, postdoctoral, and junior faculty levels.  Specific topics to be covered are: \r\n(1) Discrete integrable and isomonodromic systems; \r\n(2) Discrete Painleve equations; \r\n(3) Singularity confinement, algebraic entropy and Nevanlinna theory; \r\n(4) Discrete differential geometry; \r\n(5) Special functions as solutions of difference or q-difference equations; \r\n(6) Integrability, symmetry and numerical methods; \r\n(7) Lie symmetries of difference systems; \r\n(8) Integrable chains; \r\n(9) Coding theory, sparse recovery, and image reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent conference is intended to bring together leading experts in the field, including mathematicians, physicists, and engineers, to exchange information on significant recent progress in the research area.  \r\n\r\nA proceedings volume is to be published by the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques Press and distributed by the American Mathematical Society.  A panel discussion on the status of the field and future prospects for advances and applications will be an integral part of the conference and will be posted on the conference web site, together with copies of slides of conference presentations and posters.  NSF funds will be used to foster U.S. participation, particularly by graduate students and postdocs.  Women and underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply for support.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://www.physics.utu.fi/theory/SIDE/ \r\n",
