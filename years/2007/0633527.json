 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical Engineering (53)\r\n\r\nDeveloping commercial-scale processes based on recent advances in biotechnology, pharmaceutical, medical technology, and chemical industries requires that new chemical engineers clearly understand the biochemical principles in addition to the chemical engineering fundamentals behind the technology.  The objective of this project is to improve undergraduate courses and laboratories through the development of exciting, visually-appealing experiments that use colorful proteins to teach biochemical engineering and bioseparation principles.  Eight modules are being developed that introduce students to the physical properties of proteins and the fundamentals of bioprocess performance.  The modules focus on separating mixtures of colorful proteins with different physical properties.  These modules allow students to investigate the driving forces behind individual bioseparation techniques.  Individual experiments in chromatographic (ion exchange, size exclusion, and hydrophobic interaction) and membrane-based separations are being developed.  These techniques rely on three separate physical properties of the proteins: charge, size, and hydrophobicity.  Each experiment can be modified to illustrate the sensitivity of separation performance to protein properties and operating conditions.  Modules on protein production and protein property prediction are also in development.  During module development, equipment needs and cost, ease of use, and repeatability will be evaluated.  These modules will be adopted in freshman, junior, and senior level courses, with effectiveness evaluated through student surveys, interviews, and instructor assessment. \r\n",
