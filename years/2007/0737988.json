The key to the future of wireless communications systems is the flexibility made possible by SDR.  The full potential of SDR can only be realized through common goals and collaborative efforts among the entire wireless community.  This workshop brings together hardware, software, and communications theory experts from both academia and industry to connect the heavily fragmented development efforts and draft an open architecture for SDR.  The architecture will provide the community with a framework to explore and develop software-defined wireless communication systems across all layers of the protocol stack.  The researchers have chosen to approach the development of this architecture from an open-source perspective, where access to the architecture, software source code, and hardware designs are readily available to all members of the community.  This workshop aims to act as a catalyst for accelerated wireless communications research education throughout industry and academia.\r\n\r\n",
