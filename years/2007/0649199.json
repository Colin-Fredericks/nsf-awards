 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Harvard University, named, Materials for Bioengineering Research Initiative Dedicated to Gateway Experiences (BRIDGE), focuses on the interplay of materials science and bioengineering. Each student will work within a research team on an individual project from one of the following areas: studies of the mechanics of cells; enhanced and novel forms of drug delivery; the impact of surfaces on cell function; cellular-scale approaches to regenerative medicine; and other research at the interface of materials and bioengineering. Students will participate in weekly faculty-led seminars and professional development workshops. The 10-week summer program will provide professional and intellectual development opportunities for students without prior research experience and for nontraditional and returning students in a supportive community. A diverse group of students with backgrounds in biology, chemistry, engineering and physics will be recruited for this program. This group will include students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, women, and students from non-research intensive colleges and universities.  \r\nThe REU Site also supports three teachers from local area high schools each year for a six-week summer research experience.  Participating teachers will develop course modules based on their research experience to be used in their classroom. \r\nThis Site is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate, and by the Division of Engineering Education Centers in the Engineering Directorate.\r\n",
