 "awd_abstract_narration": "RACE/ETHNICITY, CRIME, AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE:\r\nDIVERSE RESEARCH AND PARTICIPATION IN THE ACADEMY\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nIntellectual Merit. This project builds on the successful collaboration of a group of scholars from\r\ndiverse backgrounds (African American, Latino, White, etc.), disciplines (Criminology or\r\nCriminal Justice, Family Relations, Law, Public Policy, Political Science, Social Work, and\r\nSociology), and stages of career (assistant-, associate-, and full-professors, and graduate students)\r\nwhose work is oriented to improving the quality of research on the interlinkages among\r\nrace/ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice, and on broadening perspectives and participation in\r\nresearch on this topic. These scholars recently published a book, The Many Colors of Crime, in\r\nwhich they lay out a critical new research agenda (see Peterson, Krivo and Hagan 2006). The\r\nfirst goal of this project is to undertake the kinds of studies called for in the volume, and thereby,\r\nbegin to provide a deeper, and more nuanced, understanding of the interrelationships among\r\nrace/ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice than heretofore available. The second goal of this\r\nproject is to advance the research and professional development of young scholars from\r\nunderrepresented groups for carrying out innovative research on crime and justice by establishing\r\nan annual Summer Research Institute as a follow up to a 2006 pilot institute. The overarching\r\npurpose of the institute is to support the advancement of ethnoracial minorities engaged in the\r\nstudy of crime and justice in order to further democratic inclusion in academe, and advance\r\nknowledge in this area by supporting the potentially diverse perspectives these scholars can offer.\r\nApproaches to Achieving Project Goals. To facilitate achieving the project objectives, the PIs\r\nwill undertake a series of workshops that bring group members together, and hold a summer\r\nresearch and professional development institute for young scholars from underrepresented\r\ngroups. The workshops will be both idea- and product-oriented and serve as the mechanism for\r\nplanning and making progress on collaborative projects. The summer research institute will take\r\nplace in a \"safe\" and resource-rich environment and be structured to provide the support, training,\r\nand mentorship needed by young faculty for completing a research project for journal publication\r\nor grant proposal. The institute will culminate with participants presenting their work at the\r\nRDCJ-N workshop where they will gain feedback and develop networks with other senior and\r\njunior scholars in the field.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. This project is structured to have two important broader impacts on scholarship\r\nand the academy. First, it will draw on the expertise of scholars who are diverse along a number\r\nof dimensions (e.g., race and ethnicity, disciplinary training, and stage of career) to develop and\r\ncarry out significant innovative crime and justice research. This work will have as its central\r\npremise the need to take into account the complexity of race/ethnicity and embed analyses in the\r\ndifferential positioning of groups in society. Through collaborative, multi-method, and\r\ncomparative studies, the researchers will produce a body of original multidisciplinary work that\r\nemphasizes the variable significance of race for crime/criminal justice, and how racialization\r\nrelates to the understanding of citizenship and democracy, nationally and around the world.\r\nSecond, the project will broaden participation in crime and justice research by fostering the\r\ncareers of scholars from underrepresented groups. Together the workshops and summer research\r\ninstitute will have a general impact in bringing diversity in perspectives and participation to\r\nresearch and curricula on crime and criminal justice.",
