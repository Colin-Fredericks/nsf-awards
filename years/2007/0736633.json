 "awd_abstract_narration": "McMat 2007, the ASME Applied Mechanics and Materials Conference, will be held at the University of Texas at Austin, June 3-7, 2007. This established conference series offers a forum for the exchange of ideas from mechanics and materials science perspectives. The conference is expected to have more than 600 presentations on a broad spectrum of mechanics and materials subjects, encompassing all scales from the structural to the nano level in subjects that include solid, fluid, biological, geological mechanics and materials and others.\r\n\r\nApproximately 400 participants are expected from more than 30 countries. In addition to senior researchers from academia, industry and government laboratories, young faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and under-represented minorities have been strongly encouraged to participate by the organizers. The funds requested from the National Science Foundation will be devoted to the support of the young researchers by keeping the registration fee at a low level. The conference will publish the abstracts of all presentations on the conference website, and will also disseminate them using compact disks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
