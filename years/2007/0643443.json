 "awd_abstract_narration": "Internet growth has outpaced the development of tools and techniques to understand its flaws and faults.  Users have assumed the role of administrators of small networks without the background and skills of their professional counterparts.  To address this changing domain, this project focuses on techniques for embedding diagnostic techniques into commonly-used wireless and transport protocols.  In this new design, diagnostic information bypasses the narrow error-reporting interface used by \"sockets\" and instead reports directly to the user such performance faults as a congested wireless domain, a failed cable modem connection, or significant queuing that degrades voice performance.  With this diagnostic information, the new administrators of small networks may make more informed decisions about hardware purchasing and service provisioning.  Software module prototypes to extend the Linux kernel TCP implementation and atheros 802.11 driver, as well as an intelligent user interface to diagnostic reports are planned.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\n\r\nDevelopments in techniques for understanding the network as operators and users will enhance the educational experience for students, exposing them to real network behavior without sacrificing focus on fundamental concepts of naming, routing, and transport protocols.  Students trained in this project will be well-equipped to develop new protocols, conduct systems experiments on the PlanetLab test-bed, and validate measurements of network faults.  \r\n",
