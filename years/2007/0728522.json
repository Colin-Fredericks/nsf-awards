 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing scholarships to science, technology, and mathematics students who are pursuing Master of Science degrees in Biology, Chemistry, or Professional Science (with concentrations in Biostatistics or Biotechnology).  It is affording talented, financially needy students the opportunity to enroll full-time and to participate in student support services that increase graduation rates and career placement in a team-centered industry.  Through this award, students are being encouraged through hands-on learning and collaborative mentoring at all levels within academia and appropriate regional industry to remain in science, technology, and mathematic career paths.  Support of real-world professional activities and skills, such as actively participating in research, publishing, attending seminars and scientific meetings, working with collaborators, and presenting at scientific conferences, are providing additional engagement opportunities and excitement about careers in science, technology, and mathematics.  Additionally, these activities are also teaching students other valuable skills, such as communication and teamwork, that are highly regarded in the scientific community.  With the help of this program, financially needy, talented students are able to achieve their career goals sooner.",
