 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance of civil infrastructures plays an important role in maintaining the\r\nquality of life of the U.S. citizens as well as in the nation's defense systems. The project attacks several\r\ncritical issues involved in the new generation of smart civil infrastructure system with built-in sensor\r\nnetwork. Performance assessment of civil infrastructure is usually a long-term task (i.e. several years) the\r\npower supply for the sensor network becomes a problem, especially for the embedded sensors in\r\nstructures. The first focus is to provide a reliable energy harvesting method for the sensors and a power\r\nmanagement plan for the sensor network. For long-term performance assessment, processing the large\r\namount of data obtained from the sensor network is a difficult and important task, the second focus is how\r\nto configure the sensor network and assemble the measured data in a more meaningful way in order to use\r\nthe available information to predict future structural performance. To this end, this project is to develop\r\nan integrated Power Aware Sensor-Simulation Network system for long-term performance\r\nassessment of concrete infrastructures. The system consists of three subsystems\r\nincluding an energy harvesting and power management system for the sensors, a combined sensor-based\r\nnumerical simulation system, and a massively parallel computing system for the numerical calculations.\r\nBuilt-in sensors have found their applications not only in civil, and aerospace structures, but\r\nalso in mechanical engineering and medical devices such as artificial hearts. Therefore, the\r\nresearch will have a great impact in many areas of science and technologies.",
