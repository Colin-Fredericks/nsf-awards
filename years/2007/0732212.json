The study includes 2\u00bd years of preparation and support for all the ILs within a large urban school district with a substantial minority student enrollment. These ILs will implement the PSC with the mathematics teachers in their schools. Researchers will analyze the preparation and support that ILs need, the quality of their implementation, and the impact of the PD process on ILs, teachers, and students.",
