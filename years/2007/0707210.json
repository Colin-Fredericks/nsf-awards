 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to study and develop applications of the apparatus of differential graded categories (DG) to several  problems of geometry and mathematical physics.  First, the PI would like to develop a DG  version of the microlocal theory of constructible sheafs due to Kashiwara-Schapira and then, using this apparatus, given a  symplectic manifold, he would like to  construct a dg-category and to compare it with the  Fukaya category.\r\nThe PI would also like to continue his work on  mathematically rigorous Poisson sigma-model,  non-commutative calculus (with his collaborators), and  theory of n-categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential graded (DG) categories play an important role in a variety of  problems in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. The goal of this project is to further develop some applications of DG categories. One of these  applications is aimed at providing an alternative construction of the  celebrated Fukaya category, this construction is supposed to be more geometric and transparent  in spirit. The PI would also like to continue on several topics from his previous  research such as  mathematically rigorous models of quantum field theory,  non-commutative calculus (with his collaborators), and further development  of the apparatus of DG categories.",
