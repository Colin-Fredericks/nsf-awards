 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current Internet network controls are realized by an ad hoc\r\ncombination of protocols, automated configurations, and manual\r\nconfigurations. This ad hoc environment makes it difficult to provide\r\nconcrete behavioral assurances. Moreover, the entire system might\r\nexhibit harmful emergent behaviors that are difficult to anticipate,\r\ntest for, debug, or correct.\r\n\r\nThe architecture for the future Internet should thus eliminate the\r\ncurrent ad hoc practices and start from a clean slate. This project is\r\ndeveloping a new architecture in which each network control function\r\nis realized as an application that runs on top of an operating\r\nplatform. The operating platform provides crucial abstractions,\r\ninterfaces, and services to allow applications to effect changes in\r\nthe underlying network nodes, to enable the composition and concurrent\r\nexecutions of multiple applications, and to provide protection\r\nmechanisms to guard against potentially harmful actions of\r\napplications. Intellectual challenges such as scheduling,\r\nsynchronization, inter-application communication, resource\r\nmultiplexing, and operational invariant protection for the new breed\r\nof network control applications are being investigated.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project directly addresses a key challenge for\r\nfuture networks, namely network manageability.  Problems in network\r\nmanageability affect the health of the networks we depend on, \r\nand they affect the manner in it is possible for innovation and \r\neconomic growth to occur with these networks. Our new approach to \r\nmanageability, the operating platform architecture, can potentially \r\nstimulate a market for a variety of 3rd-party network control applications. \r\nFinally, this project provides particularly exciting opportunities \r\nfor the training of undergraduate and graduate students because they \r\ndevelop applications in a fundamental way, but addressing high-impact \r\ncurrent issues.  We expect to diffuse the findings from this project \r\ninto cutting-edge courses on network management.",
