 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in understanding small scale animal-fluid interactions have been driven largely by innovative technologies, particularly the development of digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV), that permit quantification of hydrodynamic interactions in the laboratory. However, a variety of important marine organisms, including zooplankton and some small nekton, are not amenable to laboratory study and require a different methodological approach. The PIs have built a prototype in situ digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) system, the Self- Contained Underwater Velocimetry Apparatus (SCUVA), to address this problem and have performed preliminary tests to determine its feasibility. The PIs request funds to develop the second phase version of the SCUVA system that will incorporate real time data processing and display for in situ diver evaluation, three dimensional flow measurement using particle tracking velocimetry (PTV), motion stabilization and improved ergonomics. The second phase SCUVA will be field tested and tutorial materials for its use developed to facilitate exchange of this technology with other interested investigators. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe proposed instrumentation will be available to other researchers for their projects. A proposed manual will aid in the ability of other researchers to use and test the SCUVA. In addition, there are plans to include undergraduate and graduate students in the building and testing of the apparatus. Costello and Colin have a solid track record in including students in their research. In the past, their undergraduate students have presented their work at national scientific meetings. This will be a great learning opportunity in interdisciplinary research and instrumentation development for these students.\r\n",
