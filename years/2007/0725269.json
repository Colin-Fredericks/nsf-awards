 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the forces that shaped the appearance and development of modern humans has been a leading goal of biological anthropology for decades. As technology has improved, our capability to investigate key questions about the factors affecting the shape of our anatomy have advanced significantly. Here, an interdisciplinary team of anthropologists and engineers will use engineering and experimental methods to examine how the shape of the skull has evolved in order to adapt to the forces associated with feeding on different types of food items. Specifically, the researchers will take a highly interdisciplinary approach to examining whether the skulls of these early humans were well designed to crack open and chew such hard, brittle objects. Dietary adaptations are thought to have been critical factors influencing the course of early human evolution, so this research project will provide valuable insights into the functional anatomy, diet, ecology and behavior of the earliest human ancestors. \r\n\r\nWith respect to intellectual merit, this project will: (a) examine the functional and evolutionary relationships between diet and skull form, (b) test a leading hypothesis explaining the evolution of the earliest humans, (c) collect and integrate multiple types of raw data critical to an understanding of feeding biomechanics, (d) develop methods for the rapid construction of engineering models that can be applied to research questions in a wide range of disciplines, (e) integrate ecological, comparative, experimental, and engineering techniques for the investigation of evolutionary questions, and (f) rapidly disseminate data, models and findings to the scientific community. \r\n\r\nWith respect to broader impacts, this study will: (a) promote interdisciplinarity, diversity and internationalism in science, (b) collect data about skull biomechanics that are relevant to dentistry and craniofacial medicine, (c) support the research of three junior investigators each in the first year of their academic appointments, (d) support female graduate students at several universities, (e) provide support to undergraduates at a university whose student body has a high proportion of minorities, (f) provide training for international students in developing nations (Brazil, Suriname), which will ultimately support the development of scientific infrastructure and institutions in those countries, (g) provide content to an exhibit focusing on human biology and evolution at the Georgia Children?s Museum, (h) using engineering models, limit the need for, or at least increase the analytical power of, future experimental studies requiring the use of live animals, (i) generate data relevant to conservation efforts by documenting the relationship between ecology and adaptation in certain primates, (j) strengthen collaborations between anthropologists and engineers in ten universities and two countries, (k) heighten awareness in the engineering community about how their methods are applicable to evolutionary questions.",
