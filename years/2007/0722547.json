 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department at Eastern Illinois University will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer with a charge coupled detector (CCD) and low temperature capability.  The instrumentation will support the research programs of faculty at EIU, and programs at Manhattan College, Oakland University, St. Joseph's University, University of Central Missouri, University of North Carolina at Wilmington, University of Tulsa, and Western Illinois University. The primary research that would be supported by the proposed diffractometer falls into four broad categories: i) constrained molecular frameworks, ii) functional materials, iii) supramolecular assemblies and iv) the investigation of synthetic processes.  \r\n\r\nX-ray diffractometers are widely used to provide characterization of reaction products and materials.  Often characterization by other means is difficult or ambiguous.  X-ray diffraction patterns provide accurate measurements of the three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, as well as the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.  The results of these studies contribute to a broad range of areas, including inorganic, organic, organometallic, biological, and materials chemistry.   Eastern Illinois University plans to establish an integrative applied crystallography center open to students and faculty in the greater academic community of small colleges and universities that are supporting undergraduate research activities.   \r\n",
