These problems give rise to challenging nonlinear\r\ninitial boundary value problems, the mathematical statements of\r\nwhich involve one or more nonlinear parabolic equations,\r\ngoverning the diffusion of heat and the diffusion of a chemical\r\nconcentration, the time harmonic version of Maxwell's equations,\r\nand in the case of ohmic heating, a nonlinear potential problem. \r\nThese equations are coupled together in a nonlinear fashion and,\r\nin addition, nonlinear heat balances are required in certain\r\napplications where surface temperatures produce significant\r\nthermal radiation.  The investigator develops and uses asymptotic\r\nmethods, dictated by certain physical limits, to mathematically\r\nmodel these physical problems.  These models are analyzed, using\r\nboth analytical and numerical methods, to obtain accurate\r\ndescriptions of the processes.\r\n\r\n     The rapid heating of ceramics by microwave and other forms\r\nof electrical energy is the basis of several emerging industrial\r\nprocesses such as sintering, fiber coating, joining, and chemical\r\nvapor infiltration. These processes may be capable of efficiently\r\nproducing high quality materials for use in high temperature\r\napplications, such as heat exchangers, combustion liners, pump\r\nseals, and rocket nozzles.  The development and exploitation of\r\nthese promising technologies remain hindered by the basic physics\r\nof the process.  The first problem is the occurrence of\r\nnonuniform heating, which causes the deleterious effect of\r\nnonuniform material properties. The second, in the case of\r\nmicrowave heating, is the catastrophic phenomenon of thermal\r\nrunaway, in which a slight change of power causes the temperature\r\nto increase rapidly to the melting point of the ceramic.  It is\r\nthe understanding, control, and use of these phenomena and the\r\ndevelopment of accurate and efficient mathematical tools to\r\nquantify them that is addressed by the investigator and his\r\nstudents.",
