 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on the synthetic applications of axially chiral amides.  A better understanding of the structural features effecting nitrogen-aromatic rotation barriers of axially chiral anilides bearing a single ortho-substituent will be developed.  New radical translocations followed by radical addition or cyclization with potential transfer of both axial and helical chirality will be investigated.  Ionic and organometallic reactions of axially chiral anilides will also be studied.  In addition, radical reactions of axially chiral amides, 5-endo cyclizations of alpha-haloenamides, oxidative rearomatizations with O2 will be explored.   \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Dennis P. Curran of the Department of Chemistry at University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Curran's research efforts revolve around axially chiral amides and their synthetic applications.  The project is of considerable significance to the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, as it could impact how organic molecules are prepared.",
