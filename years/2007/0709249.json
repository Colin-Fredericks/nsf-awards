Studies reveal two pressing needs: to\r\n.\tImprove research tools for observing first responders interactions in complex socio-technical contexts and\r\n.\tDevelop computer tools and methodologies that support these interactions.\r\nMICL will consist of six main components: a mobile coordination post built on a truck chassis, a customized light hovercraft vehicle, two personal mobile platforms, two robotic miniature helicopters, two miniature ground robotic systems, and ten personal rugged wearable computer systems. All components will be equipped with robust and interoperable communication hardware, data persistence, and audio/video capture and processing devices, with related software to securely capture, store, transmit, and provide feedback regarding on-scene data gathering in chaotic environments. Currently, researchers are compelled to use stationary laboratories away from the disaster site to conduct inherently dynamic and mobile research; MICL should facilitate work in location affected by extreme events. This work supports \r\n.\tUnderstanding of underlying principles, adequate uses of IT and appropriate algorithms that govern interaction among diverse responders and organizations;\r\n.\tIntegration of secure data models & communication frameworks that support group interactions in extreme conditions;\r\n.\tDevelopment of a computer infrastructure to support interactions among first responders to reduce the negative impacts that extreme events have on homeland security and national economy;\r\n.\tIntegration of many academic areas including civil engineering, architecture, computer science, sociology, business, education that focus on interactions of key users in chaotic contexts, bringing real-world challenges.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Addressing needs benefiting national security, this infrastructure provides first responders aid to address critical issues such as security and vulnerability, along with expertise to prepare, respond, and recover from disaster. Moreover, it addresses education and training in this vibrant area.\r\n\r\n",
