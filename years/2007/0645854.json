 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quiescence is a poorly understood but universal state of cells on earth.  Quiescent cells, from unculturable microbes to M. tuberculosis and stem cells, play important roles in the survival of all species.  Dr. Werner-Washburne and co-workers have recently discovered that when yeast colonies exhaust glucose, cells in the culture undergo an asymmetric cell division leading to the production of a quiescent daughter cell and non-quiescent mother cell.  The physiological and morphological differences between the quiescent and non-quiescent cells are remarkable and are reminiscent of the differentiation seen in the production of other quiescent cells, such as neurons and stem cells.  This research project will examine the cell division after glucose exhaustion through a time-course analysis of changes in mRNA transcript abundance and identification of genes required for this process.  mRNA will be studied using oligonucleotide-based microarrays.  Genes required for the formation and survival of quiescent and non-quiescent cells will be identified using a yeast deletion set composed of approximately 6000 yeast strains, each carrying a deletion in a specific gene.  Characterization of the changes in mRNA levels and mutants will lead to a better understanding of the development of vegetative, quiescent yeast cells.  It will also lead to a better understanding of the evolutionary conservation of this asymmetric cell division and, thus, the role of this cell division in the production of quiescent cells in all organisms.  The broader impact of this work comes from the cross-disciplinary interactions in the Werner-Washburne laboratory, with close collaborations in computer sciences and math, and from training of students from under-represented groups at the undergraduate, graduate and post doctoral levels.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:  The research supported by this funding led to a more complete understanding of the developmental process leading to the formation of quiescent and non-quiescent cell types in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  These cell types, in a model organism that was the first fully sequenced eukaryote, were unknown prior to our work.  From this funding came 11 publications in high level journals and this work has continued in other laboratories. This funding allowed characterization of quiescent and non-quiescent cells at the level of the transcriptome, the proteome, and, using a set of deletion strains that allowed us to identify almost every gene involved in formation and stability of quiescent cells.  The application of this work has been in brewing and fermentation industries.  It should also be useful for biosensors and in learning about the evolution of the quiescent state &ndash; from bacteria to stem cells.  This is a fundamentally important area of study and the outcomes of this work will be seen for years to come.\n\n \n\nBroader impacts:  Not only was this work exciting for students intellectually because it showed that there were still new areas to investigate in an organism that has been studied since the time of Pasteur, but, having this work done in New Mexico, we have been able to involve many minority students in the research.  My students and I gave many talks around the United States and at meetings such as SACNAS.   My students won awards for their presentations and are now research professors at UNM, staff at the National Institute for Aging, graduate students at U Michigan, and faculty.  In this time, there were 11 undergraduates in the laboratory, 7 of whom were minorities.  There was one post baccalaureate student (Navajo), who is in graduate school at the U of Michigan.  Four students received PhDs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/06/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Margaret C Werner-Washburne"
