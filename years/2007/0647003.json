The environmental fate of chelating agents has been a topic of interest and concern in recent years. Chelating agents are compounds that form strong, water-soluble complexes with metal ions. This affects the availability of metal ions to organisms and for other biogeochemical processes. Chelating agents are used in many industrial and consumer processes. Their presence in the environment might lead to remobilization of metals from sediments, posing potential risks to drinking water. Many chelating agents are not readily biodegradable and persist for long times in the environment. Due to these aspects, chelating agents are under scrutiny in most countries and are under heavy regulatory pressure. The workshop will (i) discuss discrepancies between regulators and scientists concerning perceptions on the environmental implications of chelating agents; (ii) identify trends regarding use of chelating agents and their environmental implications; and (iii) discuss new chelating agents and their potential environmental impacts. Interdisciplinary group discussions on use of chelating agents from scientific, industrial, and regulatory perspectives will lead to the development of a position paper on these issues. The workshop will include industry and legal authorities and provide a bridge between science and applications. The workshop should produce a better understanding of the potential benefits and concerns related to widespread use of chelating agents. The journal Environmental Pollution will publish a special section with selected papers from the workshop. \r\n",
