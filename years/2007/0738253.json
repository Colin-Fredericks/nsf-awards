 "awd_abstract_narration": "Societal implications of nanotechnology have been well-recognized as critical to the life-cycle success of new nano-based products arising from recent exciting scientific discoveries. Much of the current societal emphasis has been on environmental and health effects of nanoparticles and nanotubes. In contrast, an area in which significant gaps of knowledge exist, with much less ongoing research, is the study of the industrial safety. In particular, while the potential explosion hazards of micron-size particles in coal mines, in the food and pharmaceutical industries, and in powder processing facilities are well known, safety guidelines do not exist for nanoparticles. Thus, the objective of this Center supplement is to better understand and mitigate the risk of fire and explosion during processing, handling, and transportation of nanoscale particles, wires, fibers, and films.  The specific focus of the research is on metallic heterostructures (e.g., Aluminum and Nickel) whose exothermic reactivity can be harnessed for nanoscale (spatial and temporal) heating, but can also create the risk of accidental explosion. The intellectual merit of this research focuses on a fundamental understanding through integrated modeling and experiments of: (1) the effect of size, shape, agglomeration, and environment on ignition and explosion risk; (2) the effect of separation membranes to control both the ignition and the reaction propagation rate; and (3) methods of packaging nanoheaters to optimize effectiveness while minimizing safety risks during handling, transportation, and use.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental understanding will be applicable to a broader range of nanostructures. Thus, as the demand for larger quantities of nanoparticulates increases, the broader impacts of this research include reducing the risk of industrial accidents that can cause significant loss of life, damage to equipment and buildings, delay in production output, and loss of public trust in new technology. The knowledge gained from this research will be disseminated through the existing infrastructure of the Center for High-rate Nanomanufacturing, including incorporation into EHS seminars to industry. In addition, our strong international connections will help to facilitate global discussion and implementation of more effective safety guidelines.",
