 "awd_abstract_narration": "All cells need to minimize changes to their genetic information. The potential for genetic change is not uniform across the genome: some sequences are intrinsically more mutable. Mutational hotspots are found in imperfect inverted repeat sequences from bacteria to humans. The mechanism for mutagenesis at these sites involves a polymerase template switch, whereby the replicating strand realigns and the mutational changes are templated from other sequences in the inverted repeat. This process may drive the formation of inverted repeat sequences, abundant in many genomes. Despite the prevalence and universality of this process, little is known about factors that promote mutation or act to avoid them. Using a natural mutational hotspot in the thyA gene of Escherichia coli, this project will identify the factors that control template-switch mutagenesis, a process that likely impacts all genomes. The unusually high rate of mutagenesis at this site provides a unique opportunity to screen for genes that influence hotspot mutagenesis. This approach will provide new insights into the mechanism of mutagenesis and mutation avoidance. Other experiments seek to clarify whether chromosomal context or damage to the replication fork affects the frequency of such events. Undergraduate and graduate students will perform the proposed experiments and the laboratory has a strong track record of the participation of undergraduate, as well as graduate, students in research. A broader impact of the proposal, therefore, is the training of students in state-of-the art genetic analysis and their mentorship for careers in research and education in the public or private sector.",
