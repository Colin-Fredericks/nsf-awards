 "awd_abstract_narration": "A great deal of our knowledge of the Earth's interior comes from seismology: the analysis of elastic waves propagating through the Earth.  Seismometers measure these waves, and the science of building more and more sensitive seismometers extends back for many years.  Almost all seismometers consist of a mass suspended by a spring.  Usually an electronic circuit senses the displacement of the mass (with respect to the seismometer's frame) when a seismic wave produces a local vibration.  Under continuing funding from the National Science Foundation, we are developing a new seismometer which uses optics instead of electronics to sense mass motion.  New signal-processing electronics allow us to analyze laser light reflected from the seismometer mass and detect displacements as small as a trillionth of a meter.  A variety of advantages are afforded from this new technique, including a high dynamic range and wide bandwidth, a calibration based on the wavelength of laser light, a connection to the sensor via fiber optic cables rather than electrical ones, and elimination of electronics in the sensor package.  Our research over the next two years will include further noise-reduction efforts and independently monitored tests of our new seismometer at seismic observatories other than our own.",

But the mainstay observatory-class seismometer used by global networks for the past two decades is obsolete and is no longer manufactured.  In this project, we set out to develop a new observatory-class seismometer that is fundamentally different from those of the past in that we employ laser interferometry rather than traditional electronics to accomplish significant improvements.\n\n \n\nThe      interferometer provides a linear, high-resolution displacement sensor&mdash; the      optical sensor includes the functionality of a digitizer providing about a      30-bit resolution digital output;\n\n\nAbsolute displacement measurements referenced to the wavelength of light;\nRange of the instrument is sufficient to record the largest teleseisms and most regional and local earthquakes;\nOnly optical fiber connections to the seismometer are required, eliminating heat from electronics in the sensor package and noise pickup from connecting electrical cables;\n\n\n \n\nOur new seismometer has shown that our optical technique works and that it has improved upon current technology.  These improvements are important for advancing our knowledge of Earth because it will ultimately result in clearer seismic images of the interior.
