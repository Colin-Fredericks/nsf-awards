Principal investigator, Abhaya K. Datye of the University of New Mexico and colleagues from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Iowa State University, and the University of Virginia will cooperate with partners from the Technical University of Denmark and Haldor Topsoe A/S, in Denmark, and with German counterparts at the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society and the Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Surfaces.  Their five year plan for collaborative research focuses on metal-catalyzed conversion of carbohydrates and their derivatives to chemicals, fuels and materials. The educational aspects of the collaboration draw upon the shared intellectual and physical resources of each partner to provide multi-faceted international experiences for sixty U.S. graduate and twenty undergraduate students. The resulting internationally distributed, virtual PIRE center should help prepare a new generation of globally-engaged science and engineers while the research partners pursue compelling research questions associated with biomass conversion and enhanced engineering of metal catalyzed reactions. \r\n\r\nComplementary strengths enable PIRE teamwork.  In this case, the U.S. partners specialize in aqueous phase processing, microkinetic modeling, and kinetic and mechanistic characterization of catalysts.  The German counterparts are well known for novel catalyst synthesis and modeling of chemical reactions.  Danish partners bring strengths in surface science approaches to studying new catalysts and theoretical expertise in modeling catalytic reactions. Together, the University of New Mexico-led PIRE team will work to achieve conversion of specific C-C or C-O bonds in the presence of multiple similar functional groups and to improve our understanding of:\r\n1) adsorption of molecules with a high level of functionality on metal surfaces, 2) the role of water or solvent in liquid phase processing, and 3) how to build in hydrothermal stability into catalysts.  If successful, results should lead to innovative molecular engineering for conversion of biomass-derived reactants to fuels, chemicals and materials.\r\n\r\nSustainable production of chemicals, materials and energy from renewable resources provides a rich source of research problems that can be integrated with the education of students participating in PIRE activities. This model includes international mentoring, research internships and summer research for U.S. graduate and undergraduate students, as well as summer schools and course development.  Domestically, participating U.S. faculty will conduct a series of workshops and short courses aimed at high school and middle school teachers. Furthermore, their curricular innovations will be widely disseminated through professional society meetings and web-based tools.  Overall, results stemming from this PIRE should fulfill the program objectives of building international partnerships that advance research and provide innovative educational opportunities through valuable contributions to future engineering in the areas of biomass conversion, sustainable energy and renewable resource development.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
