Popovic, University of Colorado at Boulder\r\nCOLLABORATIVE RESEARCH:  A Heterogeneous Integrated, Self Powered Wireless System\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  \r\nThis project considers the design and implementation of a wireless transceiver that is low cost, battery-less (i.e., does not require traditional batteries), miniaturized, sensitive, low power, and highly efficient.  The research uses a recently developed heterogeneous integration technology to integrate an ultra-low power subthreshold complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) radio frequency (RF) receiver chip with a highly efficient power amplifier and embedded passive components.  The integrated system can be used as a self-powered long-range and high data-rate wireless sensor node as well as an implantable miniaturized electronic system.  Applications include monitoring in-vivo activities, nerve actuation, and drug delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThis research will impact research and education, as well as the marketplace.  The research will be linked to multiple undergraduate and graduate courses at the collaborating institutions.  Emphasis will be placed in attracting underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students through existing programs at the University of Colorado, including the \"SMART\" and \"IMPART\" programs and an Alliances for Graduate Education Program (AGEP) award from the National Science Foundation.  This research will also be integrated with existing recruitment programs at Purdue University, an NSF Alliances For Graduate Education (AGEP) award, the NSF-supported Indiana Louis Stock Alliance for Minority Partnership (LSAMP), an NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award, a Department of Education Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) award, and the Engineering Projects In Community Service (EPICS) program.  The investigators will establish EPICS and graduate course projects.  Research results will be disseminated broadly via publications in scientific journal and presentations at technical conferences.\r\n",
