Over100 participants attended, including EPA regional project  managers who are directly involved in hazardous waste site clean-ups. The workshop addressed site remediation using state of the art nanomaterials. In addition, ecological   and human risk analysis for the use of nanomaterials in the environment was presented.\r\nIncreasing research and practice in the application of nanotechnology for remediation, monitoring, and treatment justifies an updated conference addressing new research and  practice in the field. As a result, we are proposing the International Environmental Nanotechnology Conference: Applications and Implications to be held in late spring of 2008 in Chicago with 200 to 300 participants. This new conference will address applications for remediation of toxic substances in water, soil, sediment, and air. The conference will also address environment and human health implications of the use of these nanomaterials.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the conference is to bring together national and international experts to examine the state of the research and practice in nanotechnology as it applies to remediation, monitoring, treatment, and possible risk of these technologies. \r\n",
