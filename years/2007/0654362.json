 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will address issues related to the accuracy of models used by decision makers (buyers and sellers) in the context of revenue management and dynamic pricing.  The research will develop mathematical frameworks within which the long run dynamic behavior of such pricing processes will be studied.  Emphasis will be given to developing an understanding of positive and negative consequences of the application of structurally inaccurate models by decision makers, who attempt to learn about model parameters using data and who make a sequence of pricing or buying decisions over time.  The impact of the accuracy of the decision makers' models on some natural performance measures such as long run accrued revenues will be analyzed.  These studies will involve the development of a theory characterizing long run performance as well as experimentation via computer simulations.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the proposed work will help revenue management professionals understand the consequences of using inaccurate models.  This is an issue of practical interest, since models of human behavior used in revenue management applications are often inaccurate. Specific settings that may benefit from this research include those with: (1) competing sellers of substitutable products who attempt to learn the relationship between prices and demand, such as sellers of mobile phone services; (2) multiple buyers who individually attempt to learn the probability that a particular product will be available for purchase, such as buyers of discount airline tickets who want to decide whether to purchase a ticket early or wait until later; or (3) a single seller of substitutable products who attempts to learn how buyers choose among the products, such as a manufacturer who wants to know how buyers will choose among various lead times as a function of lead times' prices.  Results of this research may alert practitioners of the importance of considering interactions between learning and decision-making, and the effect of a model's structure on this interaction.  This, in turn, may lead to the development of models that are robust to departures from their assumptions, and ultimately to more effective methods of pricing in these industries.",
