 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project is focused on developing technologies to enable High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HIPIMS) to become cost competitive. This research will develop new sputtering cathodes and other rate enhancements for use with high powered, short duration HIPIMS power supplies. These HIPIMS supplies generate highly ionized deposition fluxes (up to 95%) that are essential to controllably fill vias, ion bombard growing films and manipulate thin film properties to improve wear, corrosion, optical and other properties, but to date their use has been precluded commercially by low deposition rates. The investigators will use a combination of modeling and proprietary technical innovation in magnetron cathode design and power supply modification to address this critical rate issue. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project will be that rate enhanced sputtering tools will permit commercialization of recent HIPIMS developments. HIPIMS power supplies are currently manufactured in Sweden, the U.K., and Poland and HIPIMS specific cathodes are not available. The impact of this technology is estimated to be more significant than multi-cathode unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The demand for sputtered films continues to increase, with the market for sputtering target materials alone expected to exceed $1.8 billion in 2006. \r\n",
