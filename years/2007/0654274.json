 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposer proposes to study several topics in probabilistic and geometric\r\ncombinatorics. These topics are related to theoretical computer\r\nscience and other academic disciplines. The proposal is divided into two areas.\r\n\r\nPart I concerns the study of influences, threshold behaviors and Fourier Analysis.\r\nInfluence of variables on Boolean functions and the related notion of\r\npivotality are of central importance in combinatorics, various other\r\nareas of mathematics, computer science and other areas as \r\ngame theory, reliability theory and statistical physics. \r\nWhat is the correct notion of power or influence in\r\ncomplicated social situations? or in complex computer networks? How does\r\nnoise effect such systems? and what is the correct way of modeling noise?\r\nIt turns out that these questions are related to a recent mathematical theory \r\nwhich involve combinatorics, probability and ``Fourier analysis''.\r\nThe proposer will study some basic open problems in\r\nthis area. This is closely\r\nrelated to the study of Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, and to noise. \r\n\r\nPart II concerns Helly type theorems and convex polytopes:\r\nOne important theme in combinatorial geometry is to try to\r\nextract the combinatorial and topological content of various\r\ngeometric theorems. The study of topological Helly type theorems is \r\none example. Extending results from polytopes\r\nto simplicial and polyhedral spheres is another.\r\nSome of these problems are surprisingly\r\neasy to state and still they were not solved for many decades\r\nand any progress is expected to involve some deep new insights. \r\nThese problems are related to the area of ``optimization'' and especially\r\nto ``linear programming''. Optimization - trying to find the best solution\r\nin a complicated situation with various constraints - \r\nis one of the most important applications of mathematics.\r\nThe proposer presented some problems in this direction that he intends\r\nto study.\r\n",
