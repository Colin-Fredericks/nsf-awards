 "awd_abstract_narration": "0651835 May\r\n\r\nThis International Research Experiences for Students project, entitled SURE (Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering/Science) International, will provide research experience and mentoring to fifteen U.S. undergraduates in an international collaborative research setting in Metz, France, over a three-year period.  The students will be drawn exclusively from under-represented groups and recruited nationally by the PI and coPI team of Gary May, Paul Voss, James Brown, and Lily McNair from Georgia Tech, Morehouse College, and Spelman College.  Students will conduct research in several laboratories affiliated with the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in the fields of electrical and computer engineering and computer science.  This project is done in collaboration with the Georgia Tech Lorraine campus in Metz, France.  SURE International is an expansion of the existing SURE program held at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nSURE International will incorporate ten weeks of challenging research in areas related to electrical and computer engineering and science.   Each undergraduate student will be paired with both a French faculty advisor and Georgia Tech faculty advisor, as well as a graduate student mentor.  Involvement of the Georgia Tech faculty advisor will provide guidance on the U. S. graduate school experiences, while the French advisor provides an immersive experience in a foreign lab.  Students will also have opportunities to visit industrial research sites of multinational corporations such as Alcatel and Thales, as well as smaller local R&D organizations such as Leach International.\r\n\r\nResearch will be conducted at three partner labs in France involved in the CNRS Unite Mixte structure:  \r\n.\tLMOPS UMR 7132, Universite de Paul Verlaine-Metz, Supelec, Metz; \r\n.\tLPMM, UMR 7544, Universite de Paul Verlaine Metz, ENSAM, Metz; and\r\n.\tFEMBTO-ST UMR 6174, Universite de Franche-Comte, Besancon.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThis program will foster the training of globally engaged STEM researchers from members of under-represented groups.  15 students will be able to profit from this program.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
