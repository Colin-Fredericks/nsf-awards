 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Salish language (Iso-639 code FLA) is becoming more and more a memory. Once the language of tens of thousands, it is now spoken by less than 60. Of that total only 30 are considered fluent speakers. As with many indigenous people, time, history, encroachment and cultural pressures have devastated the Salish language. With support from the National Science Foundation, Joshua Brown of the Salish Kootenai College, together with three linguists, the Salish-Pend d'Oreille Culture Committee, the Tribal People's Center, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribal Preservation Office and fluent speakers from the community, will preserve and expand on an extensive collection of recordings. Currently, the Salish-Pend d'Oreille Culture Committee has an archive of magnetic cassette tapes with over 1000 hours of Salish conversations recorded primarily between the early 1970's and early 1980's. They also have a video archive of over 200 tapes from this same time period. Most of the individuals included on the recordings are now dead. These recordings are one of the only links to those who were raised with the language from birth. \r\n\r\nThe first focus will be on archival transfers and preservation. These archival materials will be rounded out with recordings from the remaining fluent speakers. This community driven project is one that is urgently needed. Within these archives lay keys to syntax, grammar, diction, dialect, cultural norms, history and the full power of the Salish language. Preservation of the language must also include the use of tools and resources that are accurate, accessible and up-to-date. These resources will then be available to teachers, school administrators, tribal members, scholars and the entire Reservation community.     \r\n",
