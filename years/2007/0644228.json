Silicon photonics is a rapidly developing technology that will replace existing copper interconnects on computer chips with optical interconnects. This radical change in chip design promises to dramatically increase the performance of computers by increasing data transfer speeds and reducing the thermal load on electronic circuits. The success of silicon photonics relies on the integration of on-chip light sources and miniature optical waveguides. This research program aims to develop and nanostructured semiconductor light sources and nanoscale metal waveguides for integration into the silicon photonics platform. The light source will consist of semiconductor nanocrystals and rare earth ions, embedded in silica based oxides. The electronic properties of the nanocrystals enable efficient excitation of the rare earth ions, resulting in the emission of 1.53 um light that can be used to transport information. Additionally, nanoscale waveguides based on the use of charge waves or surface plasmons will be fabricated. The hybrid integration of these two nanophotonic optical elements could play a central role in silicon photonics. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe establishment of this program at the University of Central Florida will contribute to the education of the next generation of scientists and engineers that will work in the area nanophotonics. The results of this research program will be integrated in a new course on Nanophotonics, and the course material will be made available online using SharePoint technology. The course will also be offered via online streaming, making the material accessible to local industries and to the general public. Additionally, a new Nanophotonics seminar series will be initiated, bringing internationally renowned speakers to the Central Florida region. These initiatives together will expose many young scientists to the fascinating area of nanophotonics. \r\n\r\n",
