 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop and run a summer school on Language-Based Techniques for Integrating with the External World. The aim of the school is to prepare graduate students, post-docs, and researchers in academia\r\nand industry to conduct research on this topic.\r\nThe school will present and discuss material on several related topics in this area. See Section 3 for\r\nthe importance of the topic area and Section 4 for the specific topics and speakers. Specifically, the panels\r\noutlined at the end of Section 4 show the interrelated and synergistic nature of many of the topics.\r\nEach topic will be covered for approximately four hours of lectures, providing ample time for speakers\r\nto address the topic from three perspectives:\r\n1. Foundational Theory Each speaker will begin with tutorial-level background on the fundamental\r\nprinciples and theory underlying the problems and solutions in the topic area. With this foundational\r\nperspective, the summer-school will cover key issues in areas such as type systems, logic, flow analysis,\r\nstatistics, and distributed computing. These foundations are important because they motivate the\r\nadvanced techniques and provide participants the skills they need to attack new problems.\r\n2. Advanced Techniques Each speaker will cover extensions to the classic theory that bring students upto-\r\nspeed with respect to the latest results from cutting-edge research. The speakers have all published\r\ntop research papers on their topic in the last year or two, so these perspective allows for the rapid\r\ndissemination of important ideas that can motivate additional research.\r\n3. Theory, in Practice Each speaker will describe how the theory and advanced techniques have informed\r\npractical tools used to make software development easier, faster, or more secure. Especially\r\ngiven the topic of external-world integration, the experience of the speakers in using principled engineering\r\nto apply cutting-edge research in the real world is a perspective the summer-school will\r\nemphasize.",
