Kahn\r\nStanford University\r\nExploiting Spatial Dimensions in Multimode Fiber Using Adaptive Optical Signal Processing\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  \r\nMultimode fiber (MMF) is subject to modal dispersion that limits bit rates and transmission distances.  Research on single-mode fiber (SMF) has far outstripped work on MMF, so our understanding of propagation and dispersion is much more advanced for SMF than for MMF.  Adaptive signal processing is essential in wireless and wired communication systems, yet its potential has barely been explored in optical communication systems.  Researchers at Stanford University will exploit concepts developed for SMF to advance understanding of propagation and dispersion in MMF.  They will use adaptive optical signal processing to enhance transmission capacity in MMF.  The research will integrate analysis, simulation and experiment in three major thrusts:  (i) developing a fundamental understanding of multimode propagation and modal dispersion; (ii) mitigation of modal dispersion in single-channel systems; and (iii) mitigation of modal dispersion in multi-channel systems.  Analysis and experiment will address fundamental and practical limits to wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) in mode-division multiplexing (MDM).  MDM and other multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) transmission schemes have yet to realize their potential.  Analysis and simulation will address MDM, particularly how to implement modal multiplexers and demultiplexers, which must be adaptive.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThis project will enable significant increases in transmission capacity on new and previously installed multimode fiber infrastructure, benefiting research, education, healthcare, commerce, and homeland security.  New applications of multimode fibers and waveguides may be inspired, complementing single-mode media.  Research experience will be provided for graduate students.  The principal investigator will continue his commitment to educating students from diverse backgrounds, and to training of future educators.  He will also continue to integrate research closely with course work.  He will continue to emphasize timely dissemination of results in journals and conferences.\r\n",
