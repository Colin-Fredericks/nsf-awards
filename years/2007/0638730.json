The program is centered on the theme of \"molecular science and nanotechnology,\" a combination of biology and engineering at the nanoscale.  Goals include (1) enhancement of the Fellows' understanding and commitment to K-12 education, (2) improved content knowledge and understanding of scientific investigation for partner teachers, their students, and the community at large, and (3) an increase in university research faculty's interest in and ability to work with K-12 schools.  Molecular science/nanotechnology laboratories in the partner schools will be staffed by the teaching fellows and will serve as foci for fellow and teacher generated modules; fellow, teacher, student, research mentor interaction, and hands-on student engagement in science and engineering. A comparable outreach laboratory is established at Louisiana Tech and used to teach teachers molecular science/nanotechnology concepts and scientific investigation principles. In addition a \"Creating Connections\" program connects students, teachers, fellows and research mentors and educates research mentors about the benefits from and mechanisms for involvement with K-12 schools. \r\n\r\n",
