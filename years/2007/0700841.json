 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the project, Solecki will explore several problems whose\r\nsolutions will involve interactions of a number of areas of\r\nmathematics: logic (descriptive set theory and elements of model\r\ntheory), topological dynamics, and combinatorics. For example,\r\nSolecki intends to study questions concerning dynamical properties\r\nof the homeomorphism group of the pseudo-arc. By a recent work of Irwin and\r\nSolecki, these dynamical questions can be approached using\r\nprojective Fra\\\"iss\\'e limits, which are dual versions of the\r\nclassical construction of Fra\\\"iss\\'e limits from model theory.\r\nNow, the corresponding questions about projective Fra\\\"iss\\'e\r\nlimits can be translated to purely combinatorial problems concerning\r\nfinite objects. To solve these problems Solecki will attempt to\r\ndevelop new combinatorial techniques with the guidance of analogies\r\nwith the Ramsey theory for finite structures, a classical branch of\r\ncombinatorics. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research will not only involve applying results\r\nfrom one part of mathematics to another. The expectation is that the\r\ninteractions will be mutually beneficial: the topological dynamics\r\nquestion suggests a new model theoretic construction, which in turn\r\nleads to an interesting combinatorial problem, whose solution\r\nyields, on the one hand, a new combinatorial theorem and, on the\r\nother hand, an answer to the original dynamical question. In a\r\nsimilar manner, other parts of the project feature interactions of\r\ndescriptive set theory, model theory, topological dynamics, and\r\ncombinatorics in the study of extreme amenability, Borel equivalence\r\nrelations, and algebraic properties of isometry groups. It may be hoped that crossing boundaries of subfields of mathematics will lead to new and substantial insights.\r\n",
