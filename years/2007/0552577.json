 "awd_abstract_narration": "James Madison University (JMU) will host an eight-week Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program for eight undergraduates per year during the summers of 2007-2009. The primary goal of the\r\nprogram is to provide its student participants with an authentic mathematical research experience. The components of program include: (1) Working with another student on a research project under the\r\ndirection of a faculty mentor; (2) Writing a research paper containing project results; (3) Participating in a common seminar; (4) Presenting results to the other research groups throughout the program; (4)\r\nParticipating in a poster session with students in the REU programs at JMU in Biology, Chemistry, and Materials Science; (5) The opportunity to visit industrial research facilities in the DC area; (6) The\r\nopportunity to attend the seminars in Biology, Chemistry, and Materials Science; (7) Participating in social activities with undergraduate research students in Biology, Chemistry, and Materials Science; (8) Having results reviewed by appropriate mathematicians outside of JMU; (9) Presenting results at professional meetings during the following academic year; and (10) Continued contact with the mentors after the end of the project.",
