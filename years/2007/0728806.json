Investigations of prediction and \r\ncompression are focused on computation by finite-state devices and\r\nextend methods of ergodic number theory.  Computational complexity\r\nresearch topics include derandomization, diagonalization, and \r\ndimension characterizations of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity.\r\nOverall, the project is developing new analytic methods for use in\r\ntheoretical computer science, working to achieve a greater unity \r\nbetween computational complexity and information theory, and \r\ntraining young researchers to cross traditional boundaries in the\r\nconduct of rigorous research.",
