 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alabama A&M University (AAMU), one of the historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), is sponsoring a Summer Undergraduate Research Program.  The program will provide hands-on high quality research experience to undergraduates and will mentor future 21st century scientists and citizens in the environmental and natural resource sciences. Minorities, women, and groups currently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are strongly encouraged to apply.  Students will be trained through mentored research, seminars, workshops, and field and laboratory activities.  REU students will be exposed to a broad range of biological science, environmental, and natural resource research fields. With guidance and assistance of faculty mentors and research personnel, students will participate in scientific writing workshops, complete their individual research projects, perform data analysis, serve as peer-reviewers, and collaborate in the preparation of scientific manuscripts.  Participants will complete the program by presenting their research finings at an on-campus symposium.  REU students will closely interact with graduate students through the program, and the experience will prepare students to pursue a graduate degree or research career of their interest.  Students will also be provided social opportunities to integrate and to explore the nature and culture of northern Alabama.  Research stipends, housing, and travel funds are provided.  For more information, contact Dr. Yong Wang 256-372-4229 (yong.wang@aamu.edu) or Dr. Elica Moss 256-372-8219 (elica.moss@aamu.edu), or visit http://saes.aamu.edu/reu.htm.\r\n",
