 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most plants and animals live in variable environments and respond by adjusting their behavior and morphology in ways that improve their performance. There has been tremendous interest in understanding the evolution and ecology of such ?plasticity,? but biologists lack understanding of the process of evolution of plasticity at the among-species level. The PI proposes to examine the plasticity of behavioral, morphological, and life-history traits in 50 species of amphibians in response to predation. This project is a collaborative effort across the United States and represents one of the most extensive approaches to understanding the evolution of plasticity in any system to date.\r\n\r\nThe research will train seven graduate students and six undergraduate students including individuals from under-represented groups. Benefits to society include developing insights into how organisms evolve in response to environmental change. The results will be disseminated by the PI through teaching modules for regional middle and high school teachers.  \r\n\r\n",
