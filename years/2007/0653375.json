 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ground-based gravitational wave detectors now operating may soon open a new window on the universe. Gravitational wave observations have the potential to shed light on a variety of phenomena such as gamma ray bursters and black hole collisions.  To exploit fully this rich information requires theoretical modeling of possible sources.  These models will be crucial for confronting experimental data with predictions for the extraction of the physical information.  It is within the context of both modeling relevant phenomena and making contact with the data analysis effort that the research supported by this award seeks to numerically model binary systems able to produce the most likely detectable signals.  Such modeling will incorporate novel techniques to obtain a robust and accurate description of the system and to efficiently exploit present and future available computational resources.  A number of issues at the interface between model and analysis which constrain the sharpness of the required models as well as understanding how to optimize the usefulness of the gradually available information provided by the models will be addressed.  This research will yield advanced numerical techniques for an important scientific problem, and aid in the growing field at the interface between simulations of gravitational wave sources and analysis of gravitational wave data.  Young researchers will be trained in this area of research.\r\n",
