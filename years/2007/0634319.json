 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rochester Institute of Technology proposes a planning activity to develop Project ACE: Accessible Education for visually impaired students.  Despite advances in assistive technologies, relatively few visually impaired students participate in university-level computing courses. Significant factors in this under representation include lack of relevant precollege preparation, lack of role models, access to resources, and the highly visual nature of modern computing.  Visually based notations, tools and user interfaces have lead to visually intensive instruction, making it difficult for students with visual impairments to follow traditional classroom activities.  This planning grant will develop a project to increase the participation of students with visual impairments in computing through the development of accessible class materials, resources, and teacher professional development.  Potential activities include summer and year-round, theme-based activities for students and parents that encourage exploration in networking, programming, and robotics.  These activities will provide a foundation for teacher workshops in accessible lesson development. In addition, online resources will be expanded to provide students and education access to tutorials, tools, and discussion to bring together industry practitioners, educators, and students to promote the exploration of issues and successes regarding participation in computing by the visually impaired.",
