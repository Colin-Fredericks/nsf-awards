 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fifth Annual RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Comparative Genomics will be held at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), September 16-18, 2007. This workshop, co-chaired by Glenn Tesler (UCSD) and Dannie Durand (Carnegie Mellon University), promises to be an excellent professional development opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers. It will allow them to present their research, enhance their scientific communication skills, and make both domestic and international contacts that will be of great value to the development of their careers. Comparison of related genomes offers enormous inferential power, revealing a wealth of knowledge both about genome evolution itself and about genetic function and cellular processes. Recognition of this fact has spurred efforts to sequence a range of closely related primate and mammalian genomes, as well as concerted efforts to sequence multiple genomes in the yeast, Drosophila and nematode lineages. As the data increase, so do the opportunities and the challenges for scientists to interpret them. The RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Comparative Genomics is a forum on computational aspects of this field. \r\nThis award supports the attendance of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career researchers who are United States citizens or permanent residents. It is anticipated that there will be approximately 100 participants, about half of whom will be students. Research faculty within the conference scope will be encouraged to bring their students and have them submit abstracts. Students and underrepresented groups will also be targeted through institutions with summer 2007 bioinformatics programs, including programs at Cal State, Los Angeles and the University of Minnesota. \r\n",
