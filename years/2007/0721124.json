This system is called BOINC, and is best known in an earlier incarnation called SETI@Home. The system leverages volunteer computing, time and compute cycles donated by individual PC's, clusters, and soon gaming devices such as Playstation3. BOINC is the distributed client/server middleware on which science projects build applications. This proposal improves BOINC improves the versatility of the middleware, expands available platform usage, and supports and maintains the software base. The intellectual merit includes further exploration into the utility of volunteer computing, a specific and increasingly important distributed computing model. Broader impact is represented in the more than 30 current BOINC-based projects supporting a wide range of scientific disciplines. The proposed work promises to strengthen support for existing projects and lay the groundwork for new types of projects to make use of BOINC and the distributed resources it can access.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\"Volunteer computing\" is a form of scientific computing in which owners of\nPCs and laptops (Windows, Mac, and Linux) donate their unused processing and storage resources to scientific research projects.  Currently about a million computers participate in volunteer computing,\nproviding over 10 PetaFLOPS of computing power.  Compared to cluster, Grid and Cloud computing, volunteer computing is more cost-effective for scientists and funding agencies because volunteers pay for hardware and electricity.  In addition it has far greater potential capacity because consumer resources outnumber organizational resources by several orders of magnitude.  Although volunteer computing has not generated the fanfare of Grid and Cloud computing, it has done more actual computing than either paradigm.\n\nThis grant funded development and maintenance of BOINC, the dominant middleware system for volunteer computing.   BOINC consists of client software, which volunteers run on their computers, and server software, which scientists use to create volunteer computing projects.  There are currently over 50 such projects, doing research in areas such as astronomy, astrophysics, biochemical modeling, bioinformatics, chemistry, climate modeling, cognitive science, cryptography, environmental modeling, epidemiology, genetics, high-energy physics, mathematics, nanotechnology, and quantum computing.  The computing power provided by volunteer computing has enabled these projects to make scientific discoveries leading to numerous journal publications.\n\nDuring the period funded by this grant, we have advanced BOINC's technology in several important directions.  BOINC now supports applications that run on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and that use multicore CPUs.  We have added support for applications that run in virtual machines, making it easier for scientists to access the extremely heterogeneous pool of consumer resources.  We have maintained BOINC so that it runs on new versions of consumer software (such as Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OS X 10.5 to 10.7) and on new hardware. We have developed new techniques such as \"adaptive replication\" - a low-overhead way of doing reliable computing on unreliable resources - and have developed emulators that let us study, develop, and optimize such techniques in a controlled laboratory environment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/09/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David P Anderson"
