 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proliferation of wireless networks has dramatically changed the way we live and work. However, wireless innovation and deployment has been blocked by the spectrum shortage problem as a result of today's static spectrum assignment. While most spectrum bands have been allocated to existing wireless networks and technologies, they are severely under-utilized. \r\nThis research will seek to improve spectrum utilization using dynamic spectrum access. In this new system, components of future wireless networks no longer have statically assigned spectrum. Instead, they request spectrum on-demand matching their time-varying demand and pay for what they use.  To exploit the full potential of dynamic spectrum access, this research will focus on developing an efficient spectrum auction system which auctions spectrum periodically to wireless nodes and dynamically assign spectrum to minimize interference. Moving away from traditional centralized solutions, this project focuses on distributed auction system to manage large volume of spectrum requests across large geographic areas.  \r\nThe success of this project will advance understanding in dynamic spectrum access systems, and impact development of cognitive radios and future wireless networks. The educational impacts of the project include integration of research with interdisciplinary training programs at both undergraduate and graduate levels.",
