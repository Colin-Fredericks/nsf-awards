Eight colleges and universities in Virginia and North Carolina comprise the proposed VA-NC AMP:  Four historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), including two Master's Colleges and Universities; and four Doctorate-Granting/Research-Extensive Universities, forging a strong public-private institutional partnership dedicated to student success across the Alliance.  \r\n\r\nVA-NC AMP's goal is to double the number of STEM baccalaureate degrees awarded to students from underrepresented populations in STEM fields from an Alliance yearly average base, measured over academic years 2001 through 2005, of 524 to 1,053 by the end of 2012.",
