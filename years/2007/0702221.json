The approach\r\ncombines inspiration from neuroscience with mathematical advances in control\r\ntheory. The algorithms have a hierarchical structure reminiscent of the way\r\nthe brain generates complex behavior. The lower level of the hierarchy\r\naugments the body and makes it easier to control. The higher level monitors\r\nprogress and steers the system towards achievement of the common task. In\r\nthis way the complexities due to the body are separated from those due to\r\nthe task.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThe project includes two complementary classes of algorithms. The first\r\nclass represents a significant advance in the theory of stochastic optimal\r\ncontrol. A general family of problems are identified where the fundamental\r\nequations characterizing the optimal solution turn out to be linear, even\r\nthough the controlled system is nonlinear. The second class of algorithms\r\nrepresents a practical framework for attacking high-dimensional nonlinear\r\nproblems, particularly those that arise in biomechanics.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\nThe proposed theoretical developments represent foundational work which is\r\nlikely to have a lasting impact. The proposed numerical algorithms have the\r\npotential to extend the range of practically-solvable optimal control\r\nproblems. Optimal control is of interest in many fields of science and\r\nengineering, including the recovery of motor function via brain-machine\r\ninterfaces. Educational activities include mentoring of the graduate\r\nstudents funded by this proposal, as well as design and teaching of both\r\ngraduate and undergraduate classes at the interface of Neuroscience and\r\nEngineering.\r\n\r\n",
