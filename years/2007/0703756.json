 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tele-immersive environments allow people separated by distance to physically interact and communicate in real time inside a shared 3D virtual environment through the use of large camera networks that enable the capture and reconstruction of 3D images and sound and the subsequent integration of this multimedia data from geographically distributed sites. This project develops and deploys a next generation tele-immersive environment built for the common user who does not have the luxury of expensive supercomputing facilities and dedicated networks. More particularly, the vision of this project is to create a geographically distributed and cost effective tele-immersive environment that facilitates ordinary people performing physical activities in their homes or schools or doctor''s offices or job training facilities under the supervision of a trainer, therapist, or teacher who is not co-located.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is in facilitating physical interaction and communication of the elderly and persons with disabilities in their homes and work places with relatives, health care providers, and other service providers, in particular whenever they need some interaction during a period of rehabilitation, recovery or training. This project will also examine multimedia distributed communication using common Internet connectivity, which does not require high bandwidth or extremely expensive equipment, and thus may promote wider use of tele-immersive environments.",
