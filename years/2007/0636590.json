The research activities are organized around five topics that play a fundamental role in emerging technologies: multifunctional materials, polymers and composites including carbon nanotubes, orthopaedic biomaterials, dynamics of thin material layers, and material behavior of laser welding.  Within each topic, investigations focus on fundamental model development, mathematical solution, numerical simulation, and control design.  Each project involves substantial collaboration with experimental colleagues that provides interdisciplinary training opportunities to mathematics students and postdocs.  The training component is designed to prepare students and postdocs for the varied roles of interdisciplinary research mathematicians.  This includes training modules that introduce participants to research and career topics not typically covered in coursework, targeted courses on topics pertaining to research areas and national research agendas, and participation in summer internships and national conferences.\r\n\r\n\"Mathematics of Materials\" is an interdisciplinary research training group program designed for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs in the mathematical sciences.
