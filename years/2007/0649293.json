 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's goal for this REU site is to introduce students to the interdisciplinary nature of solar and space physics as a model for integrated research in a competitive academic environment.  The REU site program will include a two-week undergraduate summer school in solar and space physics that will emulate the successful NSF-funded CISM graduate summer school.  This undergraduate course will take a 'whole system' approach to studying the Sun and its interactions.  The summer school will be required for all REU site undergraduates, but will be open to any qualified undergraduate interested in participating.  After the summer school, 12 REU undergraduates (8 supported by NSF and 4 supported by consortium members) would participate in a 6- to 8-week research experience involving science projects across the institutions and spanning a wide range of topics, from helioseismology to spacecraft operation anomalies.\r\n\r\nParticipating institutions of the consortium include the University of Colorado, NCAR's High Altitude Observatory, NOAA's Space Environment Center, NWRA's Colorado Research Associates (all located in Boulder, Colorado) and the Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling hosted at Boston University. The associated student research will be performed at the facilities of consortium members in Boulder.\r\n \r\nThe National Research Council, in its 2003 decadal study of solar and space physics, raised concerns regarding the number of solar and space physicists engaged in the field.  Declining enrollments in undergraduate programs in both physics and Earth sciences has led to limited availability of courses in solar and space physics, threatening the pipeline of future researchers in the field.  As part of their recommendation, the National Research Council panel suggested that undergraduates should be encouraged to pursue research in solar and space physics through programs such as the NSF's REU program.  This REU site will support that effort through its broad-based consortium of solar and space physicists.  This REU program and its associated summer school has the potential to generate a significant number of undergraduates with increased interest and backgrounds in solar and space physics, and this will supply graduate programs across the country.  At the end of the award period, 60 undergraduates will have participated in the research program, with an even larger number enrolling in the summer school.  \r\n\r\nThis site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
