 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has as its objective the development and demonstration of a hardware-based security platform for the protection of applications and confidential data in mobile phones. The end-product components consist of (i) an ultra-low-power security chip protected against attacks, by means of a unique compilation-driven instruction set obfuscation technology, built-in cryptographic acceleration support, and secure storage; (ii) mobile security firmware supporting the Mobile Trusted Platform Module (TPM) specification of the Trusted Computing Group industry consortium and a unique mobile application protection technology with secure software plug-ins, and (iii) associated development tools to facilitate the use of our technology, including a security-focused compiler. Innovations in these areas, when taken together, will permit the securing of applications and data on mobile phones. \r\n\r\nIf successful this project will address key technical obstacles that are at present standing in the way of expanding the use of mobile phones in financial transactions and enterprise applications. Currently, mobile phones simply do not have the amount of built-in security that would lead to the widespread use on them of electronic wallets, for example, or to allowing users to securely execute mobile enterprise applications. By focusing on ultra-low-power approaches, the proposed solutions can be used by battery-powered applications and will not greatly reduce the time between recharges.",
