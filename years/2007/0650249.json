 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project proposes to develop an Integrated Technology Innovation and Commercialization (InTICo) program.  The proposed work involves two basic areas of concentration. The Idea to Product (I2P) pilot program introduced entrepreneurial ideas into the technological curriculum; and the Technology Innovation Mapping (TIM) tool will explore potential markets and commercialization opportunities through reverse function mapping of new technologies and intellectual properties to find these potential markets.  Function maps have been used with product design methodologies to create solutions for known problems. The TIM tool, which will be further developed and refined, inverts this process to explore functional capabilities and potential applications for technologies.  The program features collaboration among faculty and students within the University of Texas at Austin in the College of Natural Science, College of Engineering, McCombs School of Business, UT Center for Nano & Molecular Science & Technology, and Department of Computer Sciences.  University Commercialization Program Partners include the UT Austin Office of Technology Commercialization, Austin Technology Incubator, IC2 Institute, and MootCorp Competition.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed program should be readily transferable to other universities.  The creation of the InTICo program will leverage the I2P program and the TIM tool and will integrate several academic programs.  Moreover, the proposed work also supports global outreach and the participation of underrepresented groups.  The University of Texas (UT) awards the largest number of Ph.D. degrees to Hispanic students in the United States and the University of Texas is sixteenth in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded to African-American students.  The university has been pro-active in the past in recruiting underrepresented groups and women.\r\n\r\nPARTNERS:  The partners include the University of Texas (lead institution) and the following corporate partners: Fish & Richardson, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary, Austin Ventures, and Sematech.\r\n\r\n",
