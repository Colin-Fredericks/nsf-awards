 "awd_abstract_narration": "We anticipate that the demands for sand, clay, and coal could be diminished by 40-75% when foundries employ a novel ultrasonic-cavitation process to reclaim green sand and bag house dust.  At PSU will  conduct nano-scale analyses of reclaimed green sand and bag house dust samples that he collected during successful pilot trials of this process at Neenah. The objectives are to: (1) advance the capabilities of this ultrasonic-cavitation process for cleaning and separating the components of waste green sand and waste bag house dust, so that the sand, clay, and coal can be reused in the iron foundry; (2) advance the fundamental understand of this process so that it can be yet further improved. Nanoscale analyses will include electron microscopy, x-ray spectroscopy, pore structure, surface charge, water sorption, and TGA-mass spectroscopy.  From these analyses, we will devise yet better modes of ultrasonics-cavitation processing, for use at Neenah Foundry and others.  As intellectual merits, our team will develop a fundamental understanding of how the nano-scale characteristics of these materials impact performance-related properties of green sand systems.  As broader Impacts, this research will yet further enhance the infrastructure of an eight-year partnership among Penn State, Neenah (and other) foundries, and Furness-Newburge.  This ultrasonic-cavitation process could annually save US foundries $0.5-4 billion.  \r\n",
