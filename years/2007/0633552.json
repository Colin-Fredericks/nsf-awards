 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (59)\r\n\r\nThe project is developing a computer simulation environment that is helping students understand the underlying science and engineering principles, as well as the applications of medical imaging modalities, through a series of computer simulations.   The software environment has three layers. The first layer, which deals with the physics of radiology, allows students to simulate measurements of various electromagnetic (i.e. x-ray, gamma-ray and NMR) or acoustic (i.e. ultrasound) energy sources as well as energy attenuation through various tissue types. The second layer, which simulates projection and tomographic imaging, enables students to study and implement image reconstruction techniques for different modalities. With the third layer students explore various image processing and analysis algorithms used in typical clinical procedures and bio-medical research. This software is reconfigurable to accommodate multiple modes so that it can provide effective training for students with different backgrounds.   Evaluation efforts, which are being planned with guidance from the University's center for innovation in engineering and science education, include student attitude surveys, rubrics to access the quality of student work, and student focus groups and interviews.  The software is also being tested at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, University of Pittsburgh, and Purdue University.  The material is being distributed through several digital libraries, including the NSFs NSDL and it is being posted on a web site that is linked to several biomedical engineering sites.  The investigators are establishing a user friendly interface to allow other faculty members to contribute material to the site.  Project materials and results are being described in engineering education and biomedical engineering journals and conferences.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of an affordable approach for providing undergraduate biomedical engineering students with an effective laboratory experience.\r\n",
