Our recently developed giant piezoelectric epitaxial thin-films directly on silicon can drastically increase the motion range and speed, with even potentially greater response by using engineered nanoscale strain distributions and domain structures. We will integrate epitaxial thin film heterostructures of giant piezoelectric materials directly on silicon to make hyper-active nano-electromechanical systems. These heterostructures are compatible with silicon nanofabrication processes, can be integrated with silicon-based electronics, and have large enough response to revolutionize active NEMS actuators. This research will develop a fundamental scientific understanding of nanoscale piezoelectric phenomena in active nanoscale electromechanical devices, with applications in high performance signal processing, communications, sensors, and nano-positioning actuators. The relationship between piezo-response and nanoscale strain and domain configurations developed here can be applied to multifunctional materials to develop new NEMS devices. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This research will resolve the fundamental issues that control nanoscale performance of piezoelectric materials in NEMS devices. Future generations of NEMS devices enabled by this research are likely to find wide-ranging applications and bring technological advances to many parts of society. Our Education goal is a broad experience for all students. This includes first-year student rotation through research groups, working in international and industrial laboratories, research interactions with individuals of diverse backgrounds, and participating in outreach programs. In Outreach, secondary school science teachers from Mayaguez, Puerto Rico will be brought to UW-Madison each summer for a nanotechnology learning/research experience. They will develop classroom material in both English and Spanish, and put in place programs for implementation secondary schools across the country. Graduate students will be involved as mentors to the teachers. \r\n \r\n",
