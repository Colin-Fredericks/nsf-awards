 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Robotic BioTelemetry\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop new algorithms and systems to quantitatively measure natural habitats and animal activities via remotely controlled networked robotic cameras. Since human activity can be very disturbing to the animal under scrutiny and its colony, the project will develop new non-intrusive biotelemetry methods based on emerging advances in high-resolution networked robotic cameras and long-range wireless networking. With the potential of changing the way to study nature, the project will allow groups of scientists, via the internet, to remotely identify and measure in real-time important variables such as quantity, size, volume, speed, motion pattern, and behavior characteristics. Since objects or its collection in a natural environment are often nonlinear, non-deterministic, non-convex/concave, irregular, deformable, and time-variant / transient, the challenging problem requires new algorithm and system development. Collaborating with natural scientists, the project undertake this long term effort by building prototypes and investigating new metrics, mathematical models, algorithms, and architectures for robot biotelemetry systems in a five-year integrated research and educational project that will emphasize active robotic actuation,  automation, collaboration, and optimal system design.\r\n\r\n",
