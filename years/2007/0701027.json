 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed lies in the area of ergodic theory and has \r\nseveral potential applications in combinatorics.\r\n In ergodic theory, the investigator plans to carry out an\r\nin depth analysis of the limiting behavior of multiple ergodic\r\naverages along various integer sequences, including  polynomial \r\nsequences, sequences related to the prime numbers, Hardy\r\nsequences, and random non-lacunary sequences. The tools to be used\r\ninclude recent advances in the theory of characteristic factors\r\nand the theory of nilpotent Lie groups. The combinatorial \r\nimplications are related to problems of finding (and in some cases\r\n``counting'') certain configurations that occur within every subset of\r\nthe integers with positive density, thus obtaining several far\r\nreaching extensions of Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic\r\nprogressions. Furthermore, it is plausible that the same\r\nconfigurations occur within the set of primes.\r\n\r\n The project studies the long term behavior of physical and \r\nmathematical systems, evolving over time, whose dynamics is too\r\ncomplicated to be followed in microscopic detail. Ergodic theory\r\nintroduces mathematical tools for understanding the asymptotic and\r\naverage behavior of such systems. These tools have also come to \r\nplay an important role in studying complicated number theoretic\r\nand combinatorial structures and the proposed project seeks to\r\nbring new light on these areas of research.\r\n",
