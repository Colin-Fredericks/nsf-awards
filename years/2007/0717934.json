 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the motivations for popular participation in civil war.  Considerable research has already explored what sorts of countries tend to engage in civil war, but little has been done to investigate why individual citizens, formerly peaceful, decide to take up arms.  This work seeks to determine 1) what needs, desires, and events are most likely to drive people to the battlefront and 2) what sorts of individual characteristics are associated with civil war participation.\r\n     These questions are best addressed through surveys of civilians and former fighters.  Survey research is becoming the technique of choice in studying civil war, given the gaps in our current understanding of conflict dynamics.  Prior to the introduction of survey research into the field, political science relied heavily on cross-national studies and qualitative accounts.  Cross-national quantitative studies had suggested an abundance of primary commodity exportables and significant ethnic heterogeneity are strongly associated with war outbreaks, but these findings have failed to withstand scrutiny. Qualitative studies have offered intuition and several hypotheses, but most have yet to be rigorously tested on a large scale.   Surveys allow for the statistical test of hypotheses about motivations for participation using data from a broad sample of average citizens who found themselves in an extraordinary situation.  \r\n     A survey will be conducted of nearly 2000 former fighters and civilians in Burundi.  This data, combined with narratives from former fighters, will help explain participation Burundi''s revolution.  In addition, a sister survey will be conducted in Liberia, where the dynamics, objectives and outcome of the war were very different.  Liberia serves as a contrasting case in many important ways: participation in Liberia was often coerced while in Burundi it was largely voluntary; Liberia''s natural resources are abundant while Burundi''s are scarce; and Liberia has sixteen ethnic groups living within its borders, while Burundi, with twice the population, has only three.  By varying the social environments in which people make their participation decisions, which motivations are most important will be tested across different cultures and conflicts.  \r\n     This research agenda can make an important contribution to policymaking as well as academia.  While civil wars are initiated by individuals with the resources, power and motivation to begin an insurgency, they are perpetuated through the support and participation of normal citizens.  Understanding under what conditions individuals fight can help interested parties predict not just which countries might break into conflict, but which citizens will participate in it.  This knowledge can make efforts at prevention targeted towards specific classes of people and social conditions, thus making conflict prevention more effective.",
