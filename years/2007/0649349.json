 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the development of integrated patch-clamp instrumentation for recording the electrical potential of individual cell membranes with higher sensitivity and throughput. This instrumentation will allow measurements of the opening and closing of individual ion-channels whose conductance has previously been too low to measure. Integrated circuitry will be developed to increase the density of recording sites and miniaturize the recording equipment. The circuit design will feature the silicon-on-sapphire technology. This integrated-circuit technology provides low-noise amplification of ion-channel currents and high-density integration of electronic components. An integrated patch-clamp amplifier will give better electrical performance, due to the reduction of cabling and parasitic capacitances that lower the measurement sensitivity.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance the understanding of ion channels, fundamental components of living cells. Using the proposed instrumentation, it may be possible to characterize the function of the products of the approximately 400 ion channel genes. The PIs are involved in CPEP: the Connecticut Pre-Engineering Program for under-represented minority and women students. Within this program, the PIs are working with children and teachers from K to 12, to promote practical science projects and to develop interest, abilities and communication skills. The PIs excite students' interest through presentations in local schools, participation to the New Haven Science Fair, and organizing laboratory tours and weekend science projects.\r\n",
