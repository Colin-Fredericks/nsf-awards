 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial funding for the purchase of a thermal-ionization mass spectrometer to be housed in the Department of Geological Sciences at UT Austin.  The new mass spectrometer will benefit several faculty and research scientists within the department by enabling the very precise isotopic analysis of a wide range of elements of geologic interest, such as Sr, Nd, Pb, and Os.  High-precision isotope analysis is a critical tool utilized in a wide range of geologic research.  Isotopic variations in geologic materials can provide important insights into the timing of geologic processes ranging from volcanism to planetary differentiation.  Isotopic variations also serve as \"tracers\" of geologic processes ranging from melt depletion of the mantle to the chemical weathering of continental rocks.  The new mass spectrometer will allow investigation of a wide range of topics, ranging from the timing and mechanisms of solar system formation and early Earth differentiation, to modern-day core/mantle interaction and the origin and nature of mantle plumes, to the response of hydrologic systems to climate change.  In addition to serving the research needs of the Department of Geological Sciences at UT Austin, the mass spectrometer that will be acquired through this grant will also aid the Department to fulfill its academic mission by providing students access to and instruction in the use of cutting-edge research technologies utilized in the Geological Sciences.",
