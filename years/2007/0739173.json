 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of New Jersey proposes a Demonstration Project to broaden participation in computing by exposing Middle School students to the emerging field of interactive journalism. Journalism has undergone a profound shift due to the Internet and now provides a good venue for engaging students who might not see themselves as ?computing types.? Through interactive journalism, these students will have hands-on experience writing, information gathering and analysis, and using digital media, from graphics to still media to animation and video.  Underlying both journalism and the computing disciplines are foundational principles of information access and dissemination, fact analysis, process description, and decision-making for results presentation. Balanced presentations of the journalistic processes and the underlying computational thinking, should engage students and dispel many of the misconceptions they may have about computing careers. In addition, this program will help students navigate the culture of a traditional computing classroom, while improving their academic preparation for entry into existing undergraduate programs. Program activities include a weeklong summer Interactive Journalism Institute, follow on activities through the school year, training for teacher and undergraduate mentors, and outreach to parents. The predicted outcomes include increased skill in core computing concepts, increased awareness of requisite skills for computing careers, and increased enrollment in high school courses that lead to careers in computing.  \r\n\r\n",
