Scientific studies, clinical research, and technological applications of channel proteins would all benefit greatly from a robust, long-lived, compact, and easily operated membrane platform. The objective of this research is to address these technological needs through the development of two innovations: (1) long-lived, mechanically stabilized membranes and (2) microfluidic systems capable of forming membranes quickly and automatically in an on-demand manner. Preliminary work by the principal investigator's (PI's) laboratory has shown significant improvements in mechanical stability and longevity of a free-standing lipid bilayer membrane can be achieved by encapsulating the membrane within an in situ photo-polymerized hydrogel. In the proposed work, the gel properties will be varied to optimize durability and extend the lifetime of the encapsulated membranes. The PI's laboratory has also developed a novel method of automated membrane formation in a microfluidic device driven by the solvent extraction properties of polydimethylsiloxane. In the proposed work, the existing prototype device will be optimized and generation device--consisting of a planar array of membranes individually addressable through multiplexed channels--will be developed and constructed. In addition to training graduate students, the PI is part of a number of programs to attract and host high school and undergraduate students in his laboratory. \r\n",
