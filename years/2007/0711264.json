 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following on the heels of two successful regional conferences, this project uses funds to\r\ncover participants' costs to attend two national conferences which focus upon supporting\r\nincipient science education research projects. A primary objective of this project is to provide a\r\nvenue in which researchers, especially those considered rising stars in the field, can describe\r\ntheir lines of inquiry and to then receive guidance and input about refining those ambitions. The\r\nother primary objective is to promote an innovative conference design in which a structured\r\npresentation format serves as an incubator for scholarly work. Underwriting by NSF is crucial\r\nbecause it will allow wider participation in this project than would otherwise be affordable.\r\nProducts of the conference include an electronic proceedings that will be posted to the\r\nconference website (www.sciedxroads.org) as well as a book (under contract) documenting the\r\nscope and successes of the conference. In addition, the promising scholars attending will\r\ngenerate research papers to be disseminated and published for a wider audience. Ultimately, this\r\nproject supports developments within science education research even as it advances a fresh\r\nvision for professional conferences. As a result, more school-based research will be conducted,\r\nmore policy-shaping documents will be generated, and more emphasis will be made upon\r\nincreasing the quality of science learning opportunities for all students.\r\n\r\n",
