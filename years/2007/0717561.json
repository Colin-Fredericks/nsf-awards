 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\nAssessment/ Research (91)\r\nThis project is addressing the goal of building robust assessments that effectively guide and enable transformative improvement of engineering design education in American Schools of engineering. Four diverse lead institutions, partnering with strategically selected design education consultants, are producing methods of assessment to define, measure, and facilitate improved student achievement in capstone engineering design courses. This project is creating and disseminating proven assessment instruments that span desired student performances.  It is defining research-informed strategies for sustaining effective assessment implementation in capstone design courses at diverse institutions. \r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT \r\nThe assessment tools being developed in this project and in an earlier project are designed to provide formative feedback for student learning as well as summative evaluation for documenting achievements and supporting ABET accreditation of programs. Implementation strategies are also being developed based on the results of qualitative research conducted on the experiences of adopters of the project's capstone design assessments. Research questions are being addressed that focus on assessment quality, user attitudes, and best practices. Faculty and teaching assistants using assessments are participating in the study as they are introduced to assessments, receive training, administer assessments, and score and interpret results. Analysis of attitudes, beliefs, implementation practices, and how they change over time are being investigated. Ultimately, recommendations will be made for building communities of practice and for effective, sustainable use of assessments for formative and summative purposes. \r\nBROADER IMPACTS \r\nThe broadly defined outcomes in this project ensure that the assessment tools being developed are also valid for use in multidisciplinary capstone courses outside of engineering. Research results on adoption practices and attitudes will help guide practices that support effective adoption of assessments.  Numerous engineering departments have already committed to trying out this assessment approach.  \r\n",
