 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is one of the world's top\r\nconsumers of supercomputer cycles. As with many other applications,\r\nthe computational bottlenecks are traced to numerical linear algebra\r\nproblems. Lattice QCD gives rise to Hermitian matrix problems, where\r\nmethods such as Conjugate Gradient (CG) or Lanczos converge\r\noptimally. Yet, the matrices are of enormous size, and preconditioners\r\nthat speedup convergence by more than a factor of two or three have\r\nbeen elusive. Equally important, lattice QCD involves two of the still\r\noutstanding problems in numerical linear algebra: to find methods that\r\nsolve optimally a linear system with multiple right hand sides and an\r\neigenvalue problem for a large number of eigenpairs. \r\nThis research aims at developing new methods, theory, and\r\nsoftware that address the above numerical linear algebra problems,\r\nboth in general and as guided by the physics of the particular QCD\r\nproblems, thereby speeding considerably lattice QCD computations and\r\nenabling further understanding of the structure of matter. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe key contribution of this research is to provide a unified view of\r\nlinear system and eigenvalue methods that leads to algorithms that\r\nsolve both problems at once in a nearly optimal way. The investigators\r\nstudy new numerical techniques for efficient computation of quark\r\npropagators in lattice QCD and extend them for improving the\r\nefficiency of Hybrid Monte Carlo.  They explore a new CG method that uses\r\npreviously developed recurrence-like restarting to obtain eigenvectors\r\nand use the method to share information between successive correction\r\nequations in the Jacobi-Davidson eigensolvers.  Finally the investigators\r\ndevelop well designed, tuned implementations of the above methods to the\r\nChroma package for lattice QCD, and to the state-of-the-art eigenvalue\r\npackage PRIMME.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
