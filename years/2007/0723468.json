This technical conference is the premiere venue for presenting new research results in the area of data mining, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field.\r\n\r\nAttending this conference is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with other graduate students as well as hundreds of other leading researchers in the area of data mining. The travel support targets graduate students with accepted papers and in particular women and under-represented minority students in order to enhance their educational experience and foster diversity in the data mining research area.\r\n",
