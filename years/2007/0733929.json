These earlier crises and disasters include famines, often caused by Hudson Bay Company policies, epidemics of novel diseases, endemic diseases with very high mortality rates, particularly tuberculosis, and frequent forced relocations, often with disastrous consequences.  The purpose of this research is to develop and pretest new analytical tools for understanding how native peoples formerly more effectively dealt, or have been able to partially deal, with this history of vulnerability and crises.  These new analytical tools may help us to more usefully understand contemporary crises in Labrador native communities.\r\n",
