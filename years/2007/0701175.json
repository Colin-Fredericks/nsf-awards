 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on two areas where combinatorics\r\nand other parts of mathematics meet:\r\ncorrelation inequalities, and applications of entropy to\r\ncombinatorial problems.\r\nCorrelation inequalities deal with positive and negative\r\nreinforcement among events in a probability space\r\n(e.g. how does knowing event A has occurred\r\naffect the probability of event B?).\r\nQuestions of this type are fundamental for probability\r\nand statistical mechanics, and also play important\r\nroles in, e.g., statistics, computer science\r\nand discrete mathematics.\r\nNonetheless, despite a great deal of activity over the\r\nlast forty-five years, some basic insights seem to be lacking,\r\nand even some of the simplest questions remain open.\r\nThe project contains a mix of old and new problems,\r\nsome quite specific, others more general,\r\nbut all intended to push in the direction of some of those\r\nmissing insights.\r\nShannon entropy, introduced in\r\n1948 for coding-theoretic purposes,\r\nhas, mostly in the last ten or fifteen years,\r\nturned out to be a valuable tool\r\nfor certain kinds of combinatorial extremal problems.\r\n(For example:  how many independent sets---i.e. sets\r\nof vertices spanning no edges---can one have in a regular\r\ngraph with given degree and number of vertices?)\r\nThe project considers a number of problems of this type,\r\neach thought to be both of independent interest and\r\nlikely to force further development of entropy\r\ntechniques.\r\n \r\nOne theme common to the two parts of the project is an interest\r\nin applying ideas and methods across mathematical boundaries,\r\nmeaning, on the one hand, bringing the principal investigator's\r\ncombinatorial perspective to bear on problems from other areas that have mostly been considered by specialists in those areas, and,\r\non the other, using extra-combinatorial ideas to attack\r\ncombinatorial problems.\r\nMany of the problems proposed seem quite hard, but also\r\nquite fundamental, as evidenced in particular by the fact that\r\nthey arise in so many disparate contexts.\r\n(This last refers especially to the first part of the project,\r\nbut not entirely; for instance, though recent applications have\r\nbeen mostly combinatorial, the PI's original contributions to\r\nentropy methods were developed to attack problems\r\n in probability and statistical mechanics.)\r\nIt is also true that the difficulties underlying some of\r\nthese problems appear to show up elsewhere, for instance in\r\nthe now very active area of \"Markov chain Monte Carlo,\"\r\nand in \"Mason's Conjecture,\" a celebrated, 35-year-old problem\r\nin matroid theory.  So it seems likely that progress on some of\r\nthe present questions would have further repercussions.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThe grantee works mostly on combinatorial problems.\nSome of these are problems arising in other areas\n(e.g. probability, statistical physics, theoretical computer\nscience).  They are usually problems that have some\nhistory of intractability, and the ideas used to attack\nthem are often drawn from other mathematical disciplines.\nA few of the successes from this grant period are:\n\n1.  The resolution of ``Shamir's Problem,\"\nwhich asks (e.g.) for the intensity at which a ``perfect\npacking\" appears in a system of random triples.\nThis had been one of the basic---and most intensively\nstudied---problems of probabilistic\ncombinatorics since it was proposed more than thirty years ago.\n(Actually Shamir's Problem is just an example of\nthe full result, which also, for instance, resolves a whole class of conjectures\non factors in random graphs that had been open for more\nthan twenty years.)\nIdeas from probability and information theory are among the underpinnings of this work.  One of the uses to which it has since been put (by other researchers) is the first correct proof of Zuk's Theorem, a major result in the\n(superficially unrelated) theory of random groups.\n\n\n2.  Asymptotic determination---that is, up to lower order terms---of\nthe number of 3-SAT functions.  (Such functions are a\nbasic construct in the theory of computation.)\nThe far easier case of 2-SAT had been settled earlier,\nthough not easily, but there had been essentially no progress\nbeyond this.\nOne key ingredient here is the ``hypergraph regularity\nlemma,\" a powerful tool originally developed to attack\nproblems in number theory, again a subject quite different\nfrom the one under discussion\n\n\n3.  Determination of the thresholds (or, as above,``intensities\") at which a random graph satisfies\n(a) Mantel's Theorem and (b) equality of cycle and triangle spaces.\nThresholds, which are closely\nrelated to the phase transitions of statistical mechanics,\nare the most basic objects of study in the theory of random graphs.\nThe results mentioned, each of which again settles a problem that\nhad been open for some time (more than 20 years in the first case)\nbelong to one of the central combinatorial trends of recent\nyears:  an attempt to understand the extent to which some of\nthe subject's fundamental results hold in a random setting.\n(Mantel's Theorem of 1907 is generally considered the result\nthat initiated the now huge field of extremal graph theory.\nThe problem in (b) is the first case of a general\nconjecture about the homological behavior of the ``clique complex\"\nof a random graph, a problem from topology rather than\ncombinatorics.)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/17/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffry N Kahn"
