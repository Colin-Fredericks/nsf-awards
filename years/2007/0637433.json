 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project combines observational and laboratory investigations of mesospheric and thermospheric oxygen chemistry.   The first task is elucidation of the chemical mechanism that is responsible for the large variability in the sodium D2/D1 line ratio in the nightglow.  Although a newly recognized phenomenon, it is now evident from repeated measurements in different locations and environments that the ratio represents a window into the mesospheric chemistry that links Na, NaO, O(3P), O2, and O3.  It appears likely that the variability reflects the changing [O]/[O2] ratio within the sodium nightglow region, and thus represents a probe of this ratio.  The second task involves laboratory studies of the loss rate coefficients of O2(b) molecules over the vibrational range of v = 3-8 range, using both O2 and O-atoms as colliders.  This will lead to an improved understanding of the atmospheric production rates of these molecules and their production mechanisms.  The third task is an investigation of the O2 Atmospheric band emissions seen in the mesosphere.  It has been observed that the various vibrational levels do not vary in concert.  The project will test the hypothesis that the emission intensity ratios can be related to variations in the mesospheric O-atom density.  The fourth task seeks to explain a discrepancy between theory and observations for the oxygen red line emissions and those from the nitrogen doublet at 520 nm as they decay throughout the night.  When the emissions are most intense in the early evening, there is a substantial difference between the observed and modeled intensity ratio, the red lines being more intense with respect to the nitrogen emissions than predicted.   The project will carry out further measurements and data evaluations to understand the source of this difference.  The broader impacts of these studies include the support of a postdoctoral scholar and contributions to other disciplines; for the latter, the O2 laboratory studies, which investigate the lower vibrational levels of the lower O2 electronic states, are of direct relevance to O2 COIL laser studies, to plasma etching, and to non-equilibrium processes in gas discharge system, while the sodium study will lead to important insights into the chemistry of meteor trails.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            \"Studies on the Terrestrial Atmosphere\" was devoted to expanding our knowledge of oxygen species (O, O2, O3) in the Earth's mesosphere and thermosphere (altitude &gt; 60 km).  Such work involves both optical observations of atmospheric emission called airglow, and laboratory measurements that simulate the atmospheric chemistry.\n\n            \"Airglow\" is a manifestation of chemistry taking place in the atmosphere.  The primary energy input is the sun\u00c6s radiation, which initiates processes that result in the production of excited atoms and molecules and ultimately in light emission.  On the dayside of the Earth such processes may be prompt, in that a solar photon is absorbed and then immediately re-emitted by an atom or molecule, but on the night side the atomic and molecular states that emit radiation are formed at a more leisurely pace, involving various chemical pathways.  A well-known example of such an oxygen-related process is that between a hydrogen atom and ozone, generating excited hydroxyl radicals, OH, that give off light in the visible and infrared spectral regions.\n\n            A major accomplishment of the work carried out on this program was to discover the nature of the so-called nightglow continuum.  The nightglow is composed of hundreds of atomic and molecular spectral lines, but often these sharp features overlap each other creating a broad emission continuum, and its origins have been discussed for many years.  This continuum has consistently been attributed to the NO2 molecule, produced by the reaction between an oxygen atom and the NO molecule. \n\n            We have pioneered the use of astronomical sky spectra (emission astronomers must look through to observe stars) to study the atmosphere.  Using data from astronomical sky spectra, we were able to show that at a wavelength between 500 and 650 nm there is a reproducible emission, which does not resemble what is known from laboratory studies on NO2. We made the identification that the source of this emission is iron monoxide (FeO) because this new emission is very similar to a) emission from the FeO molecule generated in laboratory experiments, and b) meteor train emission, where iron atoms are boiled off as a meteor heats up on penetrating the atmosphere.  Observing the same emission in the quiescent nightglow is a consequence of the fact that there is a layer of iron atoms present at altitudes near 90 km (from meteor ablation), and that the other ingredient for the initiating reaction &ndash; ozone &ndash; is also present.  To reconcile discrepancies between observations and previous laboratory measurements, we generated the FeO emission in the laboratory and showed that laser ablation of an iron rod in the presence of ozone leads to the same emission as that observed in the atmosphere.\n\n            The practical consequences of this FeO study is that it provides additional information on ozone, which is chemically involved in the H + O3 reaction mentioned above, and in the generation of nightglow sodium emission, another focus of this project.  With three different radiation sources all depending on ozone chemistry, we can improve atmospheric models with a new observational tool and elucidate the chemistry of meteoric metals in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAnother noteworthy accomplishment involves studies relevant to emissions from excited atomic oxygen, O(1S), an important feature in the airglows of all three terrestrial planets.  This emission is associated with an ultraviolet (UV) component. Using space-based atmospheric observations we were able to measure the ratio of the green and UV line intensities. This information provides 1) a reference to check the calibration of any detection system that simultaneously records these two spectral features, and 2) invaluable \"ground truth\" to test the validity of relevant atomic theoretical calculations.  These green line studies mesh with ongoing work on Venus nightglow emissions.\n\nFinally, during ..."
