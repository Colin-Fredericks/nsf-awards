 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechatronics is a manufacturing capability that integrates mechanical and electronic systems. This project is recruiting and preparing 150-200 high schools students, including minorities, females and disabled populations, for the Mechatronics program at Owensboro Community and Technical College (OCTC). Total enrollment in OCTC's manufacturing programs is expected to rise to a 10% representation of females, minorities and/or disabled populations, an increase from the current 2%. 75 high school students are enrolling in the Mechatronics Level 1 certificate program in their junior/senior years. 100% of OCTC manufacturing students are being exposed to real-life industry settings. 120 high school teachers and two-year college faculty throughout Kentucky are being trained on advanced manufacturing concepts involved in Mechatronics. The curriculum is provided by Siemens through a partnership agreement with the Kentucky Community and Technical College System, which in turn is providing training sites for the Siemens Mechatronics Systems Instructor Certification program. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
