 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dramatic progress has been made in the fields of cell and developmental biology in recent years, largely due to the application of new technical approaches to classical problems.  This has led to the need for advanced courses to train new investigators to study those animal models, such as the frog, Xenopus, that have been important in making new discoveries.  The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory course on \"Cell and Developmental Biology of Xenopus\", which has been taught for fifteen years as part of an integrated set of courses in a number of areas of modern biology, provides extensive laboratory exposure to the biology and manipulation of embryos from the frogs Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis. The course is suited for those who have a knowledge of molecular biology and developmental biology, but have had no experience with Xenopus, as well as those with some Xenopus experience who wish to learn newly developed, advanced techniques.  It is anticipated that the basic organization of the course and some of the basic course material will remain unchanged during the proposed period of support.  However, new and fast-developing topics will be discussed and integrated into the course as the field progresses. The course will continue to recruit and support students from diverse backgrounds and under-represented groups.",
