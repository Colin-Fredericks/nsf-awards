The proposed study purports to quantify, with robust error estimates, Davis Strait watermass variability, volume, liquid freshwater, heat and ice fluxes at weekly to inter-annual timescales.  These measurements will be used to advance understanding of the impacts of these exchanges on large scale characteristics of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed observation system, currently under development in Davis Strait, employs complementary techniques to resolve critical aspects of the exchange. The system includes: \r\n(1) A sparse array of subsurface moorings, each instrumented with an upward looking sonar, an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), conductivity-temperature (CT) sensors, and (deep) conventional current meters, will provide time series of upper ocean currents, ice velocity, and  ice thickness, \r\n(2) Shelf sites instrumented with ADCPs, CT sensors and an innovative, low-cost package for collecting CT time series in the ice-threatened near-surface region, and \r\n(3) Acoustically navigated Seagliders to provide year-round, repeated, high-resolution hydrographic sections across the straits.\r\nThe Davis Strait network will be undertaken in collaboration with the Bedford Institution of Oceanography.  \r\n\r\n",
