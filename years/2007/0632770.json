 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Keeling curve is a graph showing the increase in the mixing ratio of carbon dioxide in the global free troposphere as measured continuously since 1958 at the Mauna Loa Observatory by the late C. D. Keeling and his coworkers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO).  This graph registers a number of scientifically fundamental properties of the planetary carbon metabolism including the secular rise in atmospheric CO2 attributed to anthropogenic fossil fuels combustion, the annual seasonal change in the uptake of CO2 by vegetation, and by inference the differential uptake of fossil fuel carbon by the ocean and terrestrial sinks.  By now the Keeling curve is iconic for the discussion of global climate change issues and global warming.\r\n\r\nThis award is for an additional three years of funding of the SIO measurement and flask sampling network and the exacting high precision measurements pioneered by C. D. Keeling.  A number of uncompleted tasks associated with validation of the C. D. Keeling time series, including confirmation of historic manometric measurementscales and the continued dissemination of SIO archival data sets will also be completed.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant continued activities of the Scripps CO2 program including the sustaining of the longest global records of CO2 concentrations and the isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2.  Despite the large expansion in CO2 measurements over the past decades by various programs, the Scripps program stills play a critical role by sustaining flask sampling at 10 stations and sustaining in situ measurements at the Mauna Loa Observatory.  With coverage that is essentially Pole to Pole and distributed with latitude, the Scripps program continues to provide data critical to global assessments, such as carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  \n\nOver this grant period, while updating records of CO2 concentrations and isotopes, we also carried out studies of changes in carbon cycling, relying on results collected over the many decades of the program.  These studies address key questions such as: What is controlling the growth rate of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?  And how is the cycling of carbon dioxide changing as a result of climate changes and other natural or human-induced processes?\n\nThe major new findings during this time period involved assessing changes in land carbon processes, as made evident through small changes in average CO2 concentration with latitude, year-to-year changes in the CO2 growth rate, and changes in the seasonal cycle in CO2. An isotopic study published during this time frame provided a powerful new basis for assessing global land gross primary production, a fundamental measure of planetary metatoblism which is relevant to modeling almost all aspects of land ecosystem process. We also published an analysis of radiocarbon content of CO2, providing the most detailed global survey on decadal time scale of atmospheric radiocarbon which is relevant to assessing a range of processes, including the exchange of CO2 with the oceans, with land biota, and rates of fossil-fuel combustion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ralph F Keeling"
