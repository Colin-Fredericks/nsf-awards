 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to acquire a high resolution environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) with atomic force microscope (AFM) and hot stage attachments for use in a broad array of research and education projects. The ESEM will be located in an open-access laboratory within the Carnegie Mellon University engineering college.  Key advantages of this system over conventional SEM equipment are its ability to image specimens at elevated temperatures (up to 1000 deg. C), imaging of specimens that are not conductive (such as ceramics and polymers) and low vacuum imaging, ideal for biosystems in ?wet? environments. Furthermore, integrated AFM capabilities allow topological imaging, metrology and in-situ nano-scale probing of samples as they are observed in the SEM. Prior to this award, no ESEM equipment existed on the CMU campus and none was available at nearby institutions. Research and education projects impacted by acquisition of this equipment span the Carnegie Mellon Engineering College, and include projects in the CMU Mellon College of Science and the University of Pittsburgh Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nMiniaturization and nano-scale visualization technologies developed over the last two decades have created a new frontier in engineering research, focused on physical phenomena at the micro and nano scales. Carnegie Mellon researchers in mechanics, materials, biomedical engineering, biology and areas that combine these disciplines require sub-micron imaging, characterization, manipulation and in-situ experimentation capabilities for their research. Acquisition of this ESEM equipment will have significant impact in furthering our understanding of fundamental phenomena at the micro/nano size scales in a broad range of application areas.  The University of Pittsburgh has needs for an ESEM that are nearly identical to those of CMU. Access to ESEM equipment at CMU will also have a dramatic impact on their research capabilities. \r\n\r\nCarnegie Mellon also sees ESEM use in the study of micro- and nanoscale systems as strategically critical in the education of future engineers at the pre-college, undergraduate and graduate levels. This networked equipment will allow not only ?broadcasting? of SEM images to laboratory or classroom environments, but also remote control of some functions, greatly enhancing student learning. By using this equipment for undergraduate and graduate education, the PIs will significantly advance integration of micro/nano-scale research with education. The equipment will also be used to enhance existing outreach programs led by Carnegie Mellon.\r\n",
