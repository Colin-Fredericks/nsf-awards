 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a 12-month standard award to support a Doctoral Colloquium program at the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work to be held in San Diego, CA (November 7-13, 2008). This will bring together 15 dissertation-stage doctoral students in the field of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) for one and a half days of talks and interaction with five faculty members selected from among distinguished CSCW researchers. The students come from both the US and abroad, and represent a variety of CSCW subfields. This project provides support for the travel and lodging of the students as well as the direct expenses of putting on the Doctoral Colloquium at the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the CSCW Doctoral Colloquium is the students? doctoral dissertations. These represent state-of-the-art research in the field of computer supported cooperative work. The Doctoral Colloquium provides both an opportunity for these projects to be shaped through intellectual exchange as well as communicating the character of the work to a key group of young professionals.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe Doctoral Colloquium has been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars. It brings together the best of the next generation of CSCW researchers. This allows them to create a social network both among themselves and with several senior researchers, which plays a major role in their enculturation into the profession. Since the students and faculty are a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, scientific discipline), the students? horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development. Many of today?s leading CSCW researchers participated in earlier Colloquia.",
