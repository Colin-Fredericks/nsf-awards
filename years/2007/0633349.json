 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a fundamentally different curriculum for the introductory statistics course that emphasizes the entire process of statistical investigations, from design of data collection through statistical inference, throughout the course. The inference techniques are based on randomness introduced in data collection, specifically randomization and permutation tests, rather than on normal-based probability models. The goal is to lead students to develop a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts of statistical inference and of the process through which statisticians investigate research questions by collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project is creating new learning materials and teaching strategies, assessing learning, evaluating innovations, and class-testing curricular materials. As with materials developed by the project team for statistics courses for mathematically intensive majors, these materials consist primarily of learning activities that guide students to discover and explore statistical ideas, but also provide sufficient exposition for a stand-alone text to provide students with reference and reinforcement. Real data from genuine studies motivates all of the activities, which make extensive use of technology. \r\n\r\nAssessment and evaluation are especially important aspects of this project. The investigators systematically investigate the effectiveness of this new curriculum in terms of students' levels of conceptual understanding. The testable hypotheses include that a randomization-based curriculum leads to a deeper understanding of p-values, as well as a better understanding of the entire statistical process, than a standard parametric approach. The investigators are also studying two alternative conceptualizations of the concept of confidence to determine whether students develop deeper understandings with one or the other. The investigators are employing a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods in a program of classroom-based research at the institution.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The project provides introductory statistics instructors throughout the country materials for teaching an alternative curriculum that can lead to deeper conceptual understanding and better appreciation for the role of statistics in scientific investigations. The assessment instruments developed are having a broad impact for statistics education researchers, and the research conducted is providing statistics teachers with empirical evidence of teaching effectiveness. The integration of curricular development and educational research is consistent with the spirit of collaboration that has marked statistics education reform and also with the combined training and experiences in statistics, curricular development, and research on teaching and learning of the team.\r\n\r\n",
