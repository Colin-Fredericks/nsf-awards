 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) Both University of Wisconsin - Platteville and Madison Area Technical College are teaching all their introductory physics classes in integrated lecture/lab classrooms. In the lecture/lab classrooms instructors can combine lecture, interactive learning, and laboratory experiences all within a single class period. Between the two institutions, at least 12 instructors with a wide range of teaching styles are teaching introductory physics in an integrated lecture/lab environment.   \r\n\r\nThis project consists of four activities: (1) the development of hands-on instructional materials, (2) faculty training, (3) the purchase of laboratory equipment, and (4) assessment of student learning and attitudes and faculty teaching styles and attitudes. Existing hands-on learning materials and laboratory exercises are being adapted to the equipment available at the two institutions. Training in proven interactive and active learning methods is being provided for all the faculty at both institutions. Both institutions are purchasing new lab equipment. Finally, the assessments provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different teaching styles within an integrated lecture/lab environment. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Physics education researchers have shown that student learning improves when interactive and hands-on activities are introduced into the physics classroom, even in classrooms with enrollments around 50 students. The integrated lecture/lab approach used here is similar to the approach used at several universities, in particular North Carolina State University. The primary goal of switching to lecture/lab classrooms at UWP is to provide more effective physics instruction through increased use of active-learning instructional methods. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This project impacts students, faculty, and the physics education community. The physics students at both institutions benefit from interactive and hands-on activities introduced into the integrated lecture/lab classrooms. The faculty benefit from the hands-on instructional materials and the training in active-learning methods. Finally, the physics education community benefits. The correlation studies between student learning and teaching styles are an extension to physics education research into the effects of teaching styles on student learning in an integrated lecture/lab environment. Other universities, colleges, and technical schools considering a switch to a lecture/lab environment can benefit from the experiences in this project.",
