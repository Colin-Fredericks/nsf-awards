 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental quantum optics project continues work exploring the measurement and control of complex quantum mechanical systems with the ultimate goal of harnessing quantum mechanical systems as building blocks for practical tasks such as metrology, simulation, and information processing.  The overriding goals of the research program are to perform experiments in which two basic questions of quantum mechanics are addressed: measurement of a system and control of the state of a quantum system in a manner that is robust against noise and errors. The specific quantum-mechanical systems to be controlled are in the form of individual atoms and in the form of many-body states of large ensembles of atoms.  The experiments will be carried out in laser-cooled atomic gases.  The specific goals of the project are to (1) control the 16-dimensional ground manifold of the Cs atom and (2) control and measure the collective spin of an atomic ensemble.  The control in the first experiment will be affected through an interaction Hamiltonian generated by microwave and magnetic fields and optical lattices.  In the second experiment the Hamiltonian will include optical feedback, continuous measurement, and quantum erasure. The broader impact of this work lies first in its connection to quantum control in chemistry, atomic clocks, and quantum information science.  The second broader impact of this project is the education of graduate students as well as interaction with a network of university, national laboratory, and industry scientists studying quantum information science.",
