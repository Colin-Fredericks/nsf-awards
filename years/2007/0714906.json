 "awd_abstract_narration": "0714906\r\nWith the popularity of crime shows such as \"CSI\" and \"The New Detectives,\" interest in forensic science has skyrocketed. This increased interest has made the discipline an excellent vehicle to introduce scientific concepts, such as the scientific method, coupled with critical thinking skills, to a greater number of students. This project, based at Saint Augustine's College (NC) and shared by the Department of Biological and Physical Sciences with the Criminal Justice Department, will establish a forensic science laboratory that will house and be the focal point of laboratory learning and research. Forensic science technologies and analyses will be included in labs for forensic science majors, STEM majors, and nonscience majors, this broadening the curriculum and student learning experiences as well. (All students at St. Augustine's are required to take one of these labs.) \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The application of forensic science in classroom learning will provide opportunites for students to learn science as well as to learn how to approach problem solving, and how to use critical thinking skills to find a solution. St. Augustine's curriculum and facilities also will be improved through this project.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Student learning opportunities will be improved in science and in critical thinking capability. Increased science experiences will improve students' analytical abilities and skill in working with data, which should prepare them better for graduate studies. The establishment of the laboratory is also expected to have significant impact on the local community through partnerships with K-12 schools, and with municipal and state science facilities.\r\n",
