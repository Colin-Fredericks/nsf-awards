 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the investigation, development, and integration of multi-modal and mobilitybased\r\nsensor networking technologies. In particular, future sensor networking technologies will include\r\n(i) multi-modal sensing that mixes complex data types such as audio, images or video and (ii) mobilitybased\r\nsensing, where parts of the sensor network may be dynamic. The objectives of this proposal\r\ninclude the study of the following topics:\r\nLogical Association and Organization Framework: It has been observed that network connectivity via ad\r\nhoc routing algorithms does not reflect the physical placement of sensors within the environment. The\r\ninclusion of multi-modal sensing and mobility into sensor networking systems requires logical\r\norganization ability. This project will focus on develping a multi-layer organization and routing\r\nmechanism that supports logical associations, allowing for efficient organization of sensor networks in\r\napplication meaningful ways.\r\nMobility-based Localization, Organization, and Calibration: Besides actuation capability, mobility opens\r\nup new ways of effectively coordinating and organizing the sensor network. This subtask explores the\r\ndesign and implementation of algorithms that exploit user, coordinated and autonomous mobility for\r\nrobust, mobility-assisted calibration, logical association, and localization.\r\nThis project will be performed in the context of a flexible and extensible sensor networking framework\r\ncalled Cascades. Cascades is a Python-based framework combining highly optimized applicationspecific\r\ncode segments, such as video processing or video compression, into a script-based architecture\r\nthat is readily deployable into a sensor network.",
