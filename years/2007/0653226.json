The school will provide a\r\ncomprehensive introduction to the methods and applications of lattice QCD. The INT\r\nwill provide administrative support and the expenses of the lecturers, organizers and\r\nsome students. This proposal is to provide support for roughly 10 additional students.\r\nThe broader impacts are that the school presents an excellent opportunity for young\r\nstudents and physicists to be brought up to speed on the latest theoretical and\r\nnumerical issues in Lattice Gauge Theory. A special effort will be made to attract\r\nwomen and minority students. There will also be evening talks by students that will\r\nenable students to get practice in making presentations to their peers.",
