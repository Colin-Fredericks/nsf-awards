The major goal of the research is to extend the diagnostic utility of two measurements of ear function. The specific aims are: (1) to measure and quantify middle-ear transmission in the newborns through ear-canal wide-band reflectance measurements (WBR); and (2) to measure and quantify middle-ear transmission changes that are caused by increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) by using ear-canal measurements of wide-band reflectance as well as otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs).  The research work will benefit the general public by providing new auditory diagnostic methodologies for infants and adults. Especially non-invasive measurements of  ICP can have profound clinical and commercial implications. The research work will occur at an undergraduate women's college (Smith College), and has significant involvement of undergraduates. The educational activities include curriculum development in Smith College, K12 outreach, and undergraduates working in the hospital research setting (Mass General Hospital).",
