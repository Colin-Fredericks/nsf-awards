 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this research is the development of a pen-input display technology similar to that used in current tablet personal computers and personal digital assistants. The approach is to use a recently discovered magnetoresistive effect in organic light-emitting diodes. The envisioned product will consist of a magnetic pen and an array of sensors fabricated directly on the display substrate. The display pixels detect the presence of the magnetic pen through a change in driving current, thereby locating the position of the pen. This will in turn lead to the desired display response.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in magnetoelectronic effects in organic semiconductors, spurred in part by the discovery of the organic magnetoresistance (OMAR). This effect is highly interesting from the scientific point of view since \"common knowledge\" has been that large magnetoresistance can only occur in ferromagnetic materials. Our research will therefore lead to a deeper understanding of charge and spin transport processes in organics and magnetoresistance in general.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: Pen-input is expected to surpass keyboard or mouse-based data entry in the near future. Our technology has the advantage that the display and touch sensors are one and the same, whereas in other technologies the touch sensitive system is an expensive add-on. We have initiated a new conference series (\"Spins in Organic Semiconductors\", SPINOR) to facilitate interdisciplinary discussion and put special emphasis on underrepresented minority participation. The combination of scientific investigation and product engineering will ensure a well-rounded education for the students.\r\n",
