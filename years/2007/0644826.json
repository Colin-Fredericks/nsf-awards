 "awd_abstract_narration": "0644826 Moss The project will explain the mechanism of amyloid fibril aggregation. Three aims are proposed: 1) screen compound libraries for inhibitors to amyloid fibril aggregation; 2) use the effective inhibitors to probe the aggregation processes in bulk solution and 3) on phospholipid surface. This work will involve a series of biochemical and biophysical analytical tools. The education program consists of a number of components: a caregiver shadowing program, providing lab research opportunities for undergraduate students, developing biomedical engineering courses, and mentoring minority and women students.\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on the amyloid-beta protein which is a primary component of plaques found in Alzheimer's patients. This research will likely advance the knowledge of protein aggregation and potentially give rise to more effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease.  \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe assembly of monomeric protein into amyloid aggregates has wide-reaching implications.  When associated with disease or the manufacture of biological therapeutics, the formation of amyloid is detrimental.  When exploited for the assembly of nanostructures, the formation of amyloid can be used beneficially.  While the proteins capable of assembling into amyloid are different, the amyloid aggregates formed by these proteins display common structural features, pointing to the common mechanisms within the amyloid assembly process.  However, little is known about this process, even though a fundamental understanding of the process of amyloid aggregation has the potential to identify effective therapeutic targets for amyloidosis diseases, to advance pharmaceutical processes, and to identify optimal conditions for assembly of nanomaterials.\n\n \n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\n\nSelective inhibition of individual mechanisms within the amyloid aggregation process offers an opportunity to promote a fundamental understanding of amyloid aggregation.  The funded research identified and characterized inhibitors capable of selectivity inhibiting distinct aggregation mechanisms and then using these inhibitors as tools to study amyloid aggregation both in solution and at the surface of a lipid bilayer, which mimics the location of amyloid aggregation in the body.\n\nInhibitors were identified from three sources:  a novel group of synthesized compounds, commercially available small molecules, and peptides.  Several molecules selectively inhibited the addition of monomer onto growing aggregates, a process termed elongation.  Other compounds specifically inhibited the lateral joining of aggregates, a process termed association.  One effective inhibitor from the group of synthesized compounds was used in a quantitative comparison among inhibition mechanisms.  This compound inhibited association, but not elongation, and its action revealed that the prevention of association abrogated the formation of large amyloid aggregates.  Comparisons among inhibitors also revealed that certain functional groups impart inhibitory capability.  Structures found within dyes that bind amyloid proteins increased inhibition and directed inhibition toward particular steps within the amyloid aggregation pathway that correlated with the aggregate types recognized by dyes.  In addition, aromatic ring structures with hydroxyl (-OH) groups imparted inhibitory capabilities, and this effect was dependent upon the number and position of hydroxyl groups.  Finally, a group of commercially available dihydropyridine compounds revealed that selectively inhibiting elongation and association steps has a parallel effect on aggregate morphology, creating aggregates that are thicker and shorter or longer and thinner, respectively.  Thus, characterization of mechanistic-specific inhibitors and their application in bulk solution allowed the identification of structural features of effective inhibitors and provided insight into the importance of specific steps in the aggregation pathway for the formation and morphology of amyloid aggregates.\n\nTo understand aggregation at the surface of a lipid bilayer, we developed a novel technique to monitor aggregate growth at a surface.  This technique uses a quartz crystal microbalance, which can sensitively detect mass added to a quartz crystal surface.  By coating the crystal surface with a lipid bilayer, we could detect the added mass of aggregating protein to monitor the aggregation process.  This technique was first applied to examine the effect of the lipid type on amyloid aggregation by comparing two bilayers with differing amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, thought to be a healthy component of diet.  Lipid bilayers with more unsaturated fatty acids led to less interaction with amyloid aggregates, slower aggregation, and less stable aggregates.  When an effective inhibitor was added to amyloid proteins aggregating at a lipid bilayer surface, th..."
