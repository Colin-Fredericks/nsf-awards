 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is aimed at developing a novel continuous ultrasonic process for fast (order of seconds) dispersion of CNTs and CNFs in polymers. The process is intended to replace the currently used inefficient technology requiring a multi-step batch solution process with prolonged ultrasonic irradiation (minutes and hours) followed by the removal of solvent. It is expected that better dispersion and stronger interaction between the polymer and the individual CNT's and CNF's will produce nanocomposites with significantly enhanced properties including strength, modulus, electrical conductivity, permeability, thermal resistance, and heat distortion temperature. Environmental impact of the technology will be also evaluated by determining potentials for airborne release of CNTs and CNFs during processing.\r\nThe model, mechanisms and processing parameters associated with the break up of bundles of CNT's and CNF's in polymers will be identified. This will provide a scientific basis and elucidate the phenomena governing the preparation of a new class of light weight high performance materials specifically designed to have a unique and unprecedented combination of properties. \r\nNew materials will be useful in a variety of civil, military, aerospace, electronic and biomedical applications. The light weight nanocomposites containing CNT's and CNF's are intended for use in the field of aerospace and military allowing them to achieve higher speeds and increased payloads. The research results will be used to educate students and implemented in various industrial applications where light weight high performance composites are utilized. The research will be a significant step towards a wide acceptance of nanocomposites in engineering applications. \r\n",
