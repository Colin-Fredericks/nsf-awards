 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents the first award to National Ecological Observatory Network Inc. (NEON, Inc.), a corporation formed for the purpose of managing, designing, implementing, and operating the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). NEON is a continental scale research platform consisting of distributed instrumentation networked via cyberinfrastructure.  \r\n\r\nThis award will support the following activities: \r\n1) To develop a NEON, Inc. Employee Handbook, \r\n2) To procure sensor equipment required for NEON diagnostic testbed development, and management softwares \r\n3)  To develop a Scoring Matrix for selecting sites for deployment of infrastructure, \r\n4) To design the NEON Measurement Standards and Specification (MSS) template, and apply it to develop MSS documents \r\n5) To develop a work breakdown structure (WBS) detailing the activities that will guide the data population of the MSS, and \r\n6) To coordinate NEON activities with those of the other networked observatories. \r\n\r\nThese activities will ensure that NEON Inc., will serve the ecological community as a robust organization that is capable of managing the responsibilities associated with design, construction, and operation of NEON as a national facility. \r\n",
