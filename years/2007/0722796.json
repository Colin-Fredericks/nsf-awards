 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests funding for the acquisition of a suite of instrumentation for geophysical analysis of coastal systems.  The proposed instrumentation package will build on current research capabilities at CCU by adding a multibeam echosounder and an integrated process-oriented bottom boundary layer (bbl) instrumentation package. The bbl observing system will consist of a Nortek Acoustic Wave and Current Profiler (AWAC), Broad Band Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (BBADCP), Acoustic Backscatter Sensor, Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissometer (LISST), and a sector scanning sonar with azimuth drive for reconstructing micro-scale bathymetry.  The proposed instrumentation will complement existing instrumentation (sub-bottom profiler) and help establish an integrated geophysical processes laboratory, which will serve to support multiple research efforts including:  benthic habitat mapping and sediment distribution; sediment dynamics in marine hardbottoms; bottom boundary layer modeling; hurricane impact modeling (inundation and coastal response), coastal and beach erosion modeling, and submarine groundwater discharge assessment.    \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe proposed instrumentation will also support student research efforts, as well as be used in several undergraduate and graduate courses at Coastal Carolina University.  The PIs demonstrate effective use of existing instrumentation and proposed use of the requested instrumentation that reflects a strong commitment to both individual student research and hands-on coursework at undergraduate and graduate levels.  Research collaborations are articulated in the proposal and supporting documentation that demonstrate a broader community use of the proposed instrumentation.",
