 "awd_abstract_narration": "The on-going shift in processor technology to favor multicore\r\nmultiprocessors is opening new opportunities for software speculation,\r\nwhere program code is speculatively executed to improve speed at the\r\ncost of having to monitor for errors and the risk of having to\r\nre-execute code when an error happens.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a new, behavior-based approach, which allows a\r\nuser or a profiling tool to parallelize or optimize a program based on\r\npartial information about the program code and the input.  It mainly\r\ndevelops two programming techniques: Behavior-oriented parallelization\r\n(BOP), which speculatively executes possibly parallel regions, and\r\nFast track, which uses software speculation to support the use of\r\nunsafely optimized code.\r\n\r\nThe exponential increase in microprocessor performance over the past\r\n30 years has had incalculable impact on science, commerce, government,\r\nand quality of life.  Continuing this revolution through the coming\r\ndecade will depend on a large degree of processor-level parallelism.\r\nBehavior-based oftware speculation promises to improve the performance\r\nof existing, sequential software and of new software that reuses an\r\nexisting code base.  It simplifies parallelization and should thus\r\nimprove the productivity of future software development.  The outcome\r\nof this proposal will be a suite of techniques for general-purpose\r\nsoftware, and new tools that will be transitioned to industrial\r\npartners wherever possible, and will be used in both undergraduate and\r\ngraduate courses.",
