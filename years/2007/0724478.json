 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II research project proposes to develop and commercialize advanced high- resolution ceramic microchannel plates (s-MCPs) for applications in low- and night vision devices, scientific detectors and biomedical imaging. Conventional glass-fiber MCP technology has reached its fundamental limits in spatial and temporal resolution, fixed pattern noise, high count rate capabilities, thermal performance, yield and reproducibility, stability and lifetime. This is a unique approach based on nanoporous ceramics, which allows reaching ultra-high sub-micron resolution. Due their ceramic nature, the proposed s-MCPs are capable of processing temperatures up to 1000 degrees celsius, enabling direct integration of advanced photocathodes for expanded spectral range and sensitivity, and are also expected to have greater lifetime than those produced with existing methods. In addition ceramic s-MCPs can be produced at a much lower cost than glass MCPs. A robust ceramic structure with the required dimensions and resistance has been developed. The remaimimg challenge is to fabricate functional s-MCP prototypes from this structural material, along with validation of s-MCP performance.\r\n\r\nThe expected result of the proposed work is a manufacturing technology for production of commercially viable sub-microchannel plate intensifiers with better performance, longer lifetime and lower cost. This could open up new opportunities in the development of the next generation particle and photon detection systems for the infrared, UV, x-ray and gamma ray astrophysics applications. Spin-off applications for ceramic MCPs include \"lobster eye\" optics for x-ray detectors as well as gas avalanche detectors. Commercial applications include detectors for high-energy physics, scientific instrumentation, biomedical imaging, commercial satellite mapping, vision augmentation, as well as consumer night vision products. \r\n",
