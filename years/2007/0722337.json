 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe importance of marine N2 fixation to present ocean productivity and global nutrient and carbon biogeochemistry is now universally recognized. Marine N2 fixation rates and oceanic N inventories are also thought to have varied over geological time due to climate variability and change. However, almost nothing is known about the responses of dominant N2 fixers in the ocean such as Trichodesmium and unicellular N2 fixing cyanobacteria to past, present and future global atmospheric CO2 regimes. Our preliminary data demonstrate that N2 and CO2 fixation rates, growth rates, and elemental ratios of Atlantic and Pacific Trichodesmium isolates are controlled by the ambient CO2 concentration at which they are grown. At projected year 2100 pCO2 (750 ppm), N2 fixation rates of both strains increased 35-100%, with simultaneous increases in C fixation rates and cellular N:P and C:P ratios.  Surprisingly, these increases in N2 and C fixation due to elevated CO2 were of similar relative magnitude regardless of the growth temperature or P availability. Thus, the influence of CO2 appears to be independent of other common growth-limiting factors.  Equally important, Trichodesmium growth and N2 fixation were completely halted at low pCO2 levels (150 ppm), suggesting that diazotrophy by this genus may have been marginal at best at last glacial maximum pCO2 levels of ~190 ppm. Genetic evidence indicates that Trichodesmium diazotrophy is subject to CO2 control because this cyanobacterium lacks high-affinity dissolved inorganic carbon transport capabilities. These findings may force a re-evaluation of the hypothesized role of past marine N2 fixation in glacial/interglacial climate changes, as well as consideration of the potential for increased ocean diazotrophy and altered nutrient and carbon cycling in the future high-CO2 ocean.  We propose an interdisciplinary project to examine the relationship between ocean N2 fixing cyanobacteria and changing pCO2. A combined field and laboratory approach will incorporate in situ measurements with experimental manipulations using natural and cultured populations of Trichodesmium and unicellular N2 fixers over range of pCO2 spanning glacial era to future concentrations (150-1500 ppm). We will also examine how effects of pCO2 on N2 and C fixation and elemental stoichiometry are moderated by the availability of other potentially growth-limiting variables such as Fe, P, temperature, and light. We plan to obtain a detailed picture of the full range of responses of important oceanic diazotrophs to changing pCO2, including growth rates, N2 and CO2 fixation, cellular elemental ratios, fixed N release, photosynthetic physiology, and expression of key genes involved in carbon and nitrogen acquisition at both the transcript and protein level.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis project will provide educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students with all three PIs and for a postdoctoral scholar. Undergraduate and K-12 education will be furthered through involvement in REU mentoring, high school senior thesis research projects, and classroom curriculum development. Public outreach is planned in the form of a series of public lectures on ocean global change issues.  This research has the potential to evolutionize our understanding of controls on N2 fixation in the ocean. Many of our current ideas about the interactions between oceanic N2 fixation, atmospheric CO2, nutrient biogeochemistry, ocean productivity, and global climate change may need revision to take into account previously unrecognized feedback mechanisms between atmospheric composition and diazotrophs. Our findings could thus have major implications for human society, and its increasing dependence on ocean resources in an uncertain future. This project will take the first vital steps towards understanding how a biogeochemically-critical process, the fixation of N2 in the ocean, may respond to our rapidly changing world during the century to come.\r\n",
