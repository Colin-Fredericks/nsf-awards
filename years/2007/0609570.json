 "awd_abstract_narration": "0609570\r\nMoore\r\nThe seasonal snowpack has a dominating role in physical, chemical, and biological\r\nprocesses occurring in most western North American watersheds. Snow is a natural water storage\r\nmechanism and is therefore the determinant of hydroelectric production, irrigation, and aquatic\r\nhealth. Snowmelt also triggers the growing season, and earlier snowmelt appears to initiate\r\nsummer landscape drying, accentuating drought conditions and recently accelerating the\r\nfrequency of major wildfire events. The inability of current methods to forecast (or even\r\nbackcast) the temporal and spatial response of snow water dominated river basins to natural or\r\nhuman disturbances, including variations in climatic conditions, hinders our ability to fully\r\nunderstand and thus manage these watersheds. New approaches are needed to extrapolate snow\r\nwater equivalent measurements over complex landscapes, model temporal and spatial basin\r\nwater yields and predict ecologic and hydrologic response to local disturbance, regional climate\r\nchange and extreme events. This project aims to understand fundamental relationships between\r\nclimate change, snowpack, and runoff in the northern Rocky Mountains. The research approach\r\npresented is based on existing observations and theories about snow-dominated watersheds; both\r\nprocess-based research and hydrologic observatory design questions/hypotheses are posed. The\r\nresearch will use integrated physical and ecologic modeling to link three different hydrologic\r\nsettings: 1) Paleo-Hydrology; 2) Historical to present hydrology, and; 3) Future Hydrology.\r\nThe snow component of the work plan will emphasize estimating spatial variability of\r\nsnowpack characteristics at the local to the regional length scale and developing a suite of\r\ntime/space snowpack models, as input forcing to watershed models. Runoff trends will be\r\nanalyzed with the goal of determining the amount of change and variability of the instrumental\r\nrecords. Runoff analysis will integrate snow data, automatic weather station data, and remote\r\nsensed data with field water quality data and runoff records to look at the continuum of processes\r\nreleasing water from basins are several scales. Time and space scales of forcing/response will be\r\nelucidated using an integrated physical-ecologic model system (RHEESys). The model will be\r\nused to simulate watershed processes during the instrumental era, and past hydrologic and\r\necologic responses to known megadroughts, These modeling results will guide simulations of\r\nfuture change within this snow dominated watershed.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nBroader impacts from this project will be in three areas: formal education; informal\r\neducation; and science experience for under-represented groups. University of Montana students\r\nwill be involved in the research at the graduate to undergraduate levels and information from this\r\nwork will be incorporated into numerous courses taught by the PIs. Because of the broad nature\r\nof this research it gives tremendous opportunity for teaching interdisciplinary concepts and tools\r\nin the formal university environment. In addition, the spectacular landscapes of the region draws\r\nat least two million tourists each year. We will reach this audience through presentations within\r\nGlacier National Park's public lecturing program, lectures to Park and other local educators and\r\ninterpreters, and active participation with a regional science and management conference. We\r\nwill also pursue a program to create and install interpretative display panels on climate change\r\nand the hydrologic cycle, from past mega-droughts to current and future changes. We will also\r\nexpand our working relationship with both the Confederated Salish-Kootenai Tribe's hydrology\r\nprogram and tribal college. Tribal staff and student interns will be involved in field research and\r\nanalyses. The long-term goal is to develop joint research on Tribal lands within the region.\r\n\r\n",
