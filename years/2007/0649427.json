 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this SGER award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Prof. Thomas M. Fischer of Florida State University and his postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will conduct exploratory research to study the combination of directed and autonomous motion of patterned magnetic nanoparticles in order to develop a better understanding of the means to direct the motion of complex systems of particles.\r\n\r\nThrough these exploratory studies, Prof. Fischer and his group will learn design rules for the manipulation of large numbers of microscopic particles.  The results of these studies should help in the development of cutting-edge technologies -- e.g. lab-on-a-chip devices, as well as providing analogs for complicated natural systems -- e.g. transport in biological systems.  The students in Prof. Fischer's laboratory will receive training in a variety of disciplines from materials science to nanotechnology.  Built into this award is a pilot program for international research experiences for undergraduates.\r\n",
