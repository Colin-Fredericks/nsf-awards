They are supporting an unique online repository for sharing game related curricular materials between institutions.  The repository is enabling both instructors to share curricular modules, and students to share visually appealing projects.  Finally, through instructor training sessions held in conjunction with the Center for Youth Workforce Preparation, they are impacting computer science education at local high schools.",
