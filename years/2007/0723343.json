 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fourth International Polar Year begins March 1, 2007 following in the footsteps of IPY 1882, 1932 and 1957. IPY is intended to be a burst of intense research and education activities that focus on the polar regions and their importance to the earth system. This IPY Symposium, \"New York and Polar Research - A Partnership Spanning the Centuries\", will be hosted at the American Museum of Natural History, in New York City on Saturday and Sunday, March 10 and 11, 2007. The goal is to engage the public in understanding and appreciating the polar regions, by focusing on New York's relationship with the poles. The symposium will consist of a lecture series, film series, and interactive Polar Fair. Presenters represent a number of New York institutions brought together for the first time to celebrate and showcase the Arctic and Antarctic: the American Museum of Natural History, Barnard College, Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the Explorers Club, Wings World Quest, New York Times, New York University, NASA/Goddard Institute of Space Studies, and possibly Hunter College and the Central Park Zoo. From scientists, journalists and explorers, to anthropologists and artists, New York has been at the forefront of polar advances for centuries. Looking ahead, New York stands to be impacted by future polar warming, through sea level rise and other environmental changes. This IPY symposium will provide an opportunity for direct interaction of polar scientists and scholars with the general public. More than 2,000 people, including families with young children, will participate in the lecture and film series, and the Polar Fair. While some will be drawn specifically to the program by our advertising of the event, many will be drawn from the usual visitor population - ca. 18 thousand people visit the American Museum of Natural History each weekend. Because the program is hosted by the Museum, located in New York City, we anticipate that 30% will be from under-served communities. The format we have chosen deliberately allows and encourages people to learn in several different ways: passive listening and viewing as well as one-on-one question and answer, demonstrations, and personal participation. By involving ca. 35 local scientists and other scholars in developing general presentations, activities and resources, we will also build their capacity to become active and articulate spokespeople throughout the duration of the IPY and beyond.\r\n",
