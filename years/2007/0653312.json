 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics of the strong interaction, which binds atomic nuclei, is naturally described at low energies using composite protons and neutrons (collectively called hadrons) and at high energies using quarks and gluons, which are their constituents. This project will continue the development of methods to achieve model-independent, computationally efficient, microscopic calculations of nuclei at low energies, and provide insight into the crossover from hadronic to quark-gluon descriptions. It will address forefront problems in nuclear physics, such as the physics of nuclei far from stability, which is relevant for astrophysics and studied at existing and proposed rare-isotope accelerators, with potential applications to nuclear energy and homeland security (through the stockpile stewardship program).  A key tool is the \"renormalization group\", which allows the forces between hadrons to be evolved to more tractable forms. The development of increasingly sophisticated models of quark-hadron duality, as well as improved theoretical tools for the investigation of short-range structures in light nuclei, have strong and direct ties to the experimental program at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will have broader impacts in many ways.  There is an emphasis on universal aspects of physical systems, which leads to enhanced collaborations between disciplines (including condensed matter and atomic physics, and quantum chemistry). The training received by undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates in carrying out the project's activities contributes directly to the building of a diverse scientific workforce. The mix of analytical and numerical computation our students and postdocs must employ is excellent preparation for both academic and industrial research. The PI's have successfully mentored several members of under-represented groups, including four who have obtained faculty positions. Undergraduate will be actively involved in the research (with funding by the NSF REU program); all previous REU students who have graduated are either working in industry, or business, or enrolled in professional or graduate school. In addition, outreach efforts will bring interactive science to a wide range of Ohio residents.\r\n\r\n",
