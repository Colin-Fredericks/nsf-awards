 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER program, located on the central Georgia coast, was established in 2000. The study domain encompasses three adjacent sounds (Altamaha, Doboy, Sapelo) and includes upland (mainland, barrier islands, marsh hammocks), intertidal (fresh, brackish and salt marsh) and submerged (river, estuary, continental shelf) habitats. Patterns and processes in this complex landscape vary spatially within and between sites, and temporally on multiple scales (tidal, diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Overlain on this spatial and temporal variation are long-term trends caused by climate change, sea level rise, and human alterations of the landscape. These long-term trends are likely to manifest in many ways, including changes in water quality, river discharge, runoff and tidal inundation patterns throughout the estuarine landscape. The overarching goal of the GCE program is to understand the mechanisms by which variation in the quality, source and amount of both fresh and salt water create temporal and spatial variability in estuarine habitats and processes, in order to predict directional changes that will occur in response to long-term shifts in estuarine salinity patterns. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the current project cycle are 1) to continue to document long-term patterns of environmental forcing to the coastal zone, 2) to link environmental forcing to observed spatial and temporal patterns of biogeochemical processes, primary production, community dynamics, decomposition and disturbance, 3) to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which environmental gradients along the longitudinal (freshwater-saltwater) and 4) lateral (upland-subtidal) axes of estuaries drive ecosystem change, and 5) to explore the relative importance of larval transport and the conditions of the adult environment in determining community and genetic structure across both the longitudinal and vertical gradients of the estuary. To meet these objectives, the investigators utilize a suite of approaches including long-term monitoring of abiotic drivers and ecosystem responses; manipulative and natural experiments designed to enable us to examine the importance of key ecosystem drivers; and modeling. \r\n\r\nThe goal of GCE outreach is to enhance scientific understanding of Georgia coastal ecosystems by teachers and students, coastal managers, and the general public. The GCE schoolyard program is built around long-term contact and mentoring of educators, and has involved 40 teachers to date. At the college level, both undergraduate and graduate students are routinely incorporated into our work, and several investigators have integrated GCE research into the classroom. To reach coastal managers, the scientists partner with the Georgia Coastal Research Council (GCRC) to promote science-based management of Georgia coastal resources by facilitating information transfer between scientists and managers. The GCRC has representation from 9 Universities, 6 Federal agencies, and 4 State and regional agencies. It hosts workshops, assists management agencies with scientific assessments, and distributes information on coastal issues. To reach the general public, GCE scientists routinely participate in public meetings and workshops, and partner with non-profit organizations on the Georgia coast to address questions of public interest. Data collected by the GCE-LTER project can be accessed by other scientists and the general public via the website (http://gce-lter.marsci.uga.edu/lter/), which uses a state-of-the-art information system to manage and display information on study sites, research, taxonomy, data sets, publications, and project administration.  \r\n",
