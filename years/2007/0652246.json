Lebby, OIDA\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits\r\nWith this grant, the National Science Foundation joins the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Optoelectronics Industry Development Association (OIDA) in sponsoring the OIDA Annual Forum. The Forum brings together high-level representatives from industry, government, and academia to address the technology, market forces, and policy decisions that affect the optoelectronics industry. The forum consists of both individual presentations by invited speakers as well as focused panel discussions. The panels bring together the CEOs and CTOs of major corporations and start-ups, as well as venture capitalists to present their perspectives on critical technical and financial issues.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nA portion of the grant will help defray the cost of student participation in the Forum. Up to 15 invited graduate students will present the results of their research at a poster session. The grant expands the breadth of the audience and Forum participants by providing a venue for students to interact with industry, as well as to learn about the real-life issues that influence the development of optoelectronics technology.  \r\n\r\n",
