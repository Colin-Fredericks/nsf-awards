 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Materials Science (57)\r\n\r\nThis project is focused on increasing student involvement in active undergraduate research activities across engineering disciplines, primarily in the freshmen and sophomore years. This is being done by developing a two stage program.  The first aspect is an intensive summer camp to provide basic information about research skills and techniques that are broadly applicable to science and engineering.  After successfully completing the week-long summer program, students enter the second stage of the program; a mentoring and seminar program during the school year to pair students with faculty on campus.  Faculty members from four engineering disciplines are participating in both the camp and school year programs.  Up to 20 students per year are participating in the program. The program is creating new teaching strategies while providing a core group of faculty from several engineering programs an opportunity to develop expertise in a unique format of education not commonly carried out at universities.  The program is being evaluated via a control group to assess measurable outcomes that include increased student participation in research and retention in engineering.",
