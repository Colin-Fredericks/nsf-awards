 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nInteroperation between systems which use extensive formalized knowledge\r\nis hampered by the wide variety of formalisms currently in use in such\r\nsystems. Attempts to create World-wide Web standards have already\r\nyielded a collection of such formalisms, not all mutually compatible. \r\nThis situation results in part from a methodology which views deductive\r\nefficiency of inference engines, rather than semantic clarity, as the\r\nprimary design criterion for new formalisms. Recent work (reviving an \r\nolder idea) has focussed instead on the design of a single, \r\nhighly expressive, logic into which a wide number of existing \r\nformalisms can be straightforwardly mapped, essentially treating \r\nthem as subsets or simple ontologies (theories) within the \r\nsingle common formalism. The resulting logic, \r\ncalled the Interoperation Knowledge Language (IKL), \r\ncan express many representational strategies and the relationships\r\nbetween them in a single formalism, in principle overcoming this \r\ninteroperation problem in many common cases. To realize this potential \r\nin practice requires an inference engine to process IKL.\r\n\r\nAlthough IKL is more expressive than first-order logic and so is\r\nnot decidable, many of the formalisms translated into it have very \r\ntractable inference behavior.  This project implements a new design \r\nof a reasoner which is theoretically complete for IKL, while also having\r\nthe ability to recognize many of the known tractable subcases and \r\nuse efficient inference strategies on inputs which fit into these \r\nknown cases. The behavior of the engine is directed by scripts\r\nwhich control its search behavior in a highly flexible multi-directional \r\nsearch space combining hyper-resolution, rule-saturation and \r\ntableaux reasoning. The engine is designed as an experimental \r\nworkbench rather than a production engine, with a focus on inventing\r\nuseful techniques for controlling its behavior, running large\r\nexperiment suites semi-automatically, and gathering information \r\nrelevant to the search process. We plan to make use of this engine\r\nin a series of projects devoted to learning new inference strategies \r\nfrom empirical ontological data. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. \r\n\r\nThe code created by this project will be publicly available \r\nunder the GNU Lesser General Public Licence. \r\n\r\nDetails of the project can be found on the project web page at \r\nhttp://homam.ihmc.us/silkie/Home.html",
