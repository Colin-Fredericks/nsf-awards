 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary:\r\nProposal to the National Science Foundation Requesting Supplemental Travel\r\nFunds\r\nGordon Research Conference, Polymers (West), January 7-12, 2007, Ventura, CA\r\nJimmy Mays, Chair\r\nDarrin Pochan, Vice-Chair\r\nThe Polymers (West) Gordon Research Conference (GRC) seeks to supplement the\r\navailable funds for travel support to enhance participation of post doctoral and senior\r\ngraduate students at this meeting. This request is for $3,000 for supporting\r\napproximately 6 supplemental travel packages at approximately $500/person. Funding\r\nrequests by junior faculty will also be considered provided they can demonstrate no other\r\nsource of support for travel to the conference.\r\nTechnical Merit: The technical merit of this proposal is to facilitate enhanced\r\nparticipation of young polymer scientists in a Gordon Conference that addresses several\r\nkey areas at the frontiers of polymer science and engineering. The invited speakers are\r\ninternationally known, world class experts in their respective areas of polymer chemistry,\r\nphysics and engineering, as well as emerging young stars. Having such distinguished\r\nleading experts participate as speakers and discussion leaders is critical to assuring that\r\nthe GRC is highly successful. Another criterion that is viewed as an important measure\r\nof the success of a GRC is attendance and active participation of young researchers. For\r\nmany of us, including the Chair and Co-Chair of this conference, early career attendance\r\nat GRCs provided scientific stimulation, development of professional relationships, and\r\ncollaborations with other scientists that have been important in our professional\r\ndevelopment. Our motivation for the present request is to give as many young polymer\r\nscientists as possible the opportunity to experience their first GRC in Ventura next\r\nJanuary. NSF funding is critical to achieving this goal.\r\nBroader Impact: The broader impact lies in the cultivation and development of\r\ntomorrow's leaders in the polymer field and related interdisciplinary fields and to further\r\ndiversity in the scientific force performing this interdisciplinary research. In keeping\r\nwith the past tradition of the Polymers (West) GRC, the Programmatic Themes of this\r\nyear's conference cover a range of important and timely topics spanning the range from\r\npolymer synthesis to polymer physics and engineering, including industrial trends in\r\npolymer science. These programmatic themes are Bioactive Polymers, Controlled\r\nPolymer Architectures, Polymers for Microelectronics and Optics, Block Copolymers,\r\nNanoparticles and Nanotechnology, Bio-Rheology and Gels, Polymers for Energy Needs.\r\nFinally, a new Graduate Research Seminar meeting will be held the weekend prior to the\r\nfull Gordon Research Conference that will be fully organized, run, and attended by\r\ngraduate students and post-doctoral researchers chosen by Mays and Pochan. This will\r\ncertainly lead to increased participation of younger researchers in the interdisciplinary\r\nfield of polymer science and engineering.\r\n\r\n",
