 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nCareer: Lattice QCD Calculations of Nuclear Interactions\r\n\r\nA fundamental goal of modern nuclear physics is to rigorously compute the properties and interactions of nuclei. However, presently there is little understanding of nuclear physics in terms of the underlying theory of the strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  Aside from the intrinsic interest in understanding the origin of nuclear forces from first principles, there is practical motivation for establishing quantitative links between nuclear physics and QCD: many nuclear phenomena relevant to our understanding of astrophysical objects like neutron stars, as well as to searches for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, cannot presently be determined experimentally or can only be poorly determined. This CAREER proposal outlines a program to perform pioneering calculations of simple nuclear properties using lattice QCD, a form of QCD amenable to large-scale computer simulations. Primary goals of the proposed research are a computation of the properties of the simplest nucleus ---the deuteron--- using lattice QCD, and the determination of hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon scattering parameters that are relevant to an understanding of the equation-of-state of high-density baryonic matter. In addition, the PI proposes to perform precision calculations of fundamental particle properties that are essential for a deeper understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics and its possible extensions.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER project will also focus on the teaching of elementary physics, at the high-school and undergraduate levels, through the construction of simple computer programs. An initial goal will be to provide New Hampshire high-school teachers with a program of study involving real-world problems ---like projectile motion with drag--- using a computer program implemented with a basic desktop spreadsheet, which is a universally-available platform. This will be important in providing teachers with a method of teaching physics and other mathematical sciences that considers real-world problems from the onset using very-basic numerical methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
