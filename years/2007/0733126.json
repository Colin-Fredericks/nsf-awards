 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his collaborators study the Smoluchowski\r\nequation arising in the kinetic molecular theory of nematic liquid\r\ncrystalline polymers.  The intermolecular interaction of excluded\r\nvolume effects, which is responsible for the isotropic-nematic\r\nphase transition, is modeled by a mean-field potential.  Both the\r\nMayer-Saupe and the Onsager potentials are used.  The main purpose\r\nof the project is a rigorous study of the dynamics and rheological\r\nproperties of such systems.  The problems to be addressed include\r\nbifurcation analysis of both the equilibrium and the shear flow\r\ncase, and questions arising in the treatment of the equations by\r\nmeans of the classical theory of infinite dimensional systems. \r\nOne of the central problems is the question of the existence of\r\ninertial manifolds on which the partial differential equation\r\nreduces to a finite system of ordinary differential equations, the\r\nso-called inertial form.  The starting point of the project is\r\nrecent results in which the isotropic-nematic phase transition was\r\nresolved for the Smoluchowski equation using the Mayer-Saupe\r\npotential in the equilibrium case (no external flow), as well as\r\nthe existence of absorbing balls (cones) in Gevrey spaces of\r\nanalytic functions.  These questions remain open for the Onsager\r\npotential, and are addressed in the study.  In the absence of the\r\nflow, the Smoluchowski equation is a gradient system that\r\npreserves uniaxial symmetry, and as such it exhibits fairly simple\r\ndynamical behavior.  However, even a passive interaction with a\r\nsymmetry-breaking shear flow introduces complicated dynamical\r\nfeatures, such as different kinds of periodic solutions (tumbling,\r\nkayaking, log-rolling), and even chaos.  These are characteristic\r\nfor intermediate shear rates.  At low and high shear rates flow\r\naligning takes place.  A rigorous investigation of these dynamical\r\nfeatures is conducted in the project. \r\n\r\n     The main goal of the project is a mathematical understanding\r\nof the transition that occurs in a class of polymeric materials\r\ncontaining anisotropic molecules known as mesogens to a so-called\r\nliquid crystal phase.  Due to their anisotropy, the molecules\r\ninteract with each other, resulting in alignment.  This long-range\r\norientational order resembles the one found in solid crystals,\r\nwhile, unlike solid crystals, the material retains fluidity due to\r\nthe absence of the long-range positional order of molecules.  The\r\ntransition to such a phase is induced by changes in the\r\ntemperature and the concentration of the mesogens in the solution. \r\nThe distribution of the molecules can be described by a partial\r\ndifferential equation known as the Smoluchowski equation, which is\r\nthe main subject of this project.  It was already employed\r\nsuccessfully to explain the transition to the liquid crystal phase\r\nunder some very special conditions, with many unanswered questions\r\nstill remaining.  The significance of these liquid crystalline\r\npolymers lies in the fact that crystal-like properties, combined\r\nwith many of the useful and versatile properties of polymers, make\r\nthese materials suitable for a wide range of important\r\napplications.  For example, liquid crystalline polymers are\r\nabundant in living systems such as DNA, polypeptides, and cell\r\nmembranes.  Accordingly, they attract particular attention in the\r\nfield of biomimetic chemistry.  An application of liquid\r\ncrystalline polymers that has been successfully developed for\r\nindustry is the area of high strength fibers.  Kevlar, which is\r\nused to make such things as helmets and bullet-proof vests, is\r\njust one example of the use of polymer liquid crystals in\r\napplications calling for strong, light-weight materials.  The\r\noptical properties of liquid crystalline polymers lead to\r\napplications in optical imaging and the display industry.  Liquid\r\ncrystalline polymers can be used to coat drugs in the\r\npharmaceutical industry.  However, as very complex materials,\r\nliquid crystalline polymers exhibit very complex behavior, and\r\nmany of the actual and potential applications of these materials\r\ndepend on multidisciplinary research.  A better mathematical\r\nunderstanding of the process of aligning is essential for better\r\nunderstanding of the behavior of liquid crystalline polymers. \r\nThis project addresses some of the central questions regarding\r\nthis process. \r\n",
