 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi User (CRIF:MU) program, the Chemistry Department at Ohio State University will acquire a Raman Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) micro-spectroscopy system.  The spectrometer will advance research projects including spatial distributions of protein-surfactant interactions; positional behavior of surface plasmon resonances in microchannel arrays; the correlation between micro structural details and phase distributions on electron transport processes and chemical reactions; spectra of nanobasket molecules at near micrometer spatial resolution; and real time mapping of chemical species and reaction mechanisms as they occur over heterogeneous surfaces.  At the practical end of the research project continuum, projects will be pursued including production of reliable and sensitive sensors to control combustion and reduce pollution; and design of cheaper fuels and less polluting engines. \r\n\r\nInfra red and Raman spectra probe the structure and bonding of molecules at the atomic level.  The spectral data is employed for quantitative and qualitative measurements of minute quantities of materials to identify what is present and how much.  The cyber enabled system working via the Ohio Supercomputer Center's fiber optic network will allow researchers and students at Ohio State as well as colleagues at California State University, Dominguez Hills and Oakwood College, Alabama to access a unique, versatile and innovative instrument. Graduate students and postdocs trained on the instrument will be better prepared for academic and industrial employment. Curricular content at all three institutions will be enhanced by access to this equipment, including development of new courses.  Ohio State U., via the cyber connection, will provide undergraduate colleges and branch campuses in Ohio access to the instrument and also use the instrument for outreach demonstrations.\r\n",
