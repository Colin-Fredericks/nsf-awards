 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation and extension of a prior NSF-MARGINS effort to use space geodetic techniques, and most importantly GPS observations, to measure directly active rifting processes within the northern and central Red Sea. The project is now extended to include the full Arabia-Nubia-Somalia zone of plate interaction (the Afar Rift-Rift-Rift Triple Junction). The project involves maintaining existing continuous GPS stations (Saudi Arabia, Eritrea, Egypt), repeat observations of existing survey GPS sites, and establishing new continuous GPS stations in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. New survey GPS sites are being set and surveyed along the Danakil Block (Eritrea), across the Danakil Depression (Eritrea and Ethiopia), and across the Main Ethiopian Rift. All work is in cooperation with our host-country partners.\r\n\r\nThis research is aimed at clarifying the character of crustal deformation associated with active rifting of the continental lithosphere, particularly as a function of the stage of rifting (from rifting of the continental lithosphere to ocean spreading along the central rift valley). In addition, the observations in the Afar will help constrain magmatic processes beneath the Triple Junction. Other relevant geologic and geophysical observations will be integrated with the geodetic results to constrain models for the mechanics of active crustal deformation. Overall, this research should enhance understanding of the mechanics of rifting, the rheology of the continental lithosphere, the role of magmatic intrusion in driving or localizing rifting processes, and the fundamental mechanical processes responsible for driving plate tectonics.",
