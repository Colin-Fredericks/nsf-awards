 "awd_abstract_narration": "String theory has emerged as a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity, i.e., a\r\ntheory that encompasses both quantum mechanics and Einstein?s theory of general\r\nrelativity. A remaining challenge is the identification of the appropriate set of background\r\nconditions relevant to the formation of our universe, i.e., compactifying the ten\r\ndimensional string theory (or eleven-dimensional M theory/supergravity) can lead to a very large number of (non-)supersymmetric four dimensional vacua. The projects outlined in this proposal address two important aspects of string compactifications. On one hand, the PI will study how in the context of flux\r\ncompactifications one can find vacua which exhibit Standard Model like spectra. He will\r\nalso use constraints from cosmology, such as the cosmic microwave background, to put\r\nrestrictions on the inflationary type potentials obtained from string theory. The second\r\napproach will be made in studying black hole physics in terms of four- and\r\nfive-dimensional BPS solutions. This will provide important\r\ninformation in trying to understand the black hole information puzzle. This proposal is\r\nvery timely since, during the course of the next few years, the Large Hadron Collider\r\n(LHC) at CERN will start running, which will provide interesting information of what\r\noccurs beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, more accurate observations of the\r\ncosmic microwave background using the PLANCK satellite, will provide even tighter\r\nconstraints on the possible\r\ninflationary scenarios arising in string theory.\r\nThe goal of the project outlined in this proposal is two-fold: (1) facilitate the continuation\r\nand expansion of a research program in theoretical particle physics, with emphasis on\r\nstring theory, at the University of New Hampshire (UNH), and (2) develop a strong\r\noutreach program taking the frontiers of particle physics into local high schools, that\r\nnurtures the excitement young people have for science in general, while promoting\r\nphysics in particular. Results from the proposed work will be of interest to several\r\nsectors of the mathematics and physics community. Thus, this project will foster\r\ncollaborations and\r\nintellectual exchange between UNH physicists and mathematicians and those from\r\nneighboring, as well as national and international, institutions. The program will\r\ncapitalize on the existing infrastructure at the University of New Hampshire for\r\ninteractions with high schools and bring cutting-edge science into local high schools.\r\nSpecifically, the PI will work with the NSF supported Partnerships for Research\r\nOpportunities to Benefit Education (PROBE)program to organize workshops at UNH for\r\nhigh school teachers, visit local high schools in order for both teachers and students to\r\nbe able to answer questions, and allow interested high school students to visit UNH to\r\nlearn about research in theoretical particle physics. The PI\r\nwill also participate in a summer program for high school students at UNH, Project\r\nSMART,(Science and Mathematics Achievement through Research Training) and\r\ndevelop enrichment lectures and activities in Particle Physics and Cosmology for these\r\nhigh school students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
