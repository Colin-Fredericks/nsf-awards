Additional curricular materials are being developed through this Phase 2 project that are being rigorously tested by the project team. The materials being developed include modules on topics such as low-power design that are fully integrated with CAD tools. The need for curricular materials in the emerging area of asynchronous digital design is well-documented and there is strong industry support for this project. The materials are being designed and developed for maximum portability to other campuses across the nation. Through this project several 3-day summer faculty workshops are being conducted to disseminate project deliverables on a nationwide basis. Outreach to local high schools is also being conducted through this project using the curricular modules that are being developed to encourage students to enroll in computer engineering programs.",
