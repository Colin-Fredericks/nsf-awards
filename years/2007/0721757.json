The conference has been an important event in experimental mechanics held every two years attracting many scientists, engineers and researchers from academia, government laboratories, and industry internationally. The objectives of the conference are to bring together researchers and engineers to discuss recent advances in experimental mechanics and to serve as a catalyst for international collaboration and partnership in the broad area of experimental mechanics. \r\n\r\nThe US delegates will be selected from a pool of active researchers in US.   It is anticipated that a number of delegates from USA will be the keynote/plenary speakers of the conference. The conference will serve as a vehicle/forum to build partnership toward international collaboration benefiting US higher education in general.\r\n",
