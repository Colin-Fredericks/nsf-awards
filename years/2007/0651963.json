 "awd_abstract_narration": "0651963\r\nLee \r\nThe basic hypothesis in this project is that adipogenesis and hypertrophic enlargement are governed through the concerted actions of a network of regulatory molecules. In that respect, in specific aim 1, fluorescence-based reported plasmids will be generated for real-time gene expression and activation measurement of a panel of regulatory molecules- such as transcription factors and signaling kinases- that have well established roles in adipogenesis. In specific aim 2 a multivariate statistical method developed in the laboratory of the PI and co-PI will be employed in order to determine regulatory molecules that discriminate the adipogenic differentiation and hypertrophy modalities. Finally in the third specific aim, the expression of uncoupling protein-1 will be utilized in order to decrease fat accumulation during adipocyte hypertrophy and determine its effect on the descriminant regulatory molecules identified from aims 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nObesity is a big health problem. As a chronic condition, obesity increases the risk from many diseases and disorders, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and even cancer. The result of this proposal- in the long term- will be to identify alternative molecular targets for regulating adiposity through the elucidation of the regulatory basis underlying adipogenesis and hypertrophy. Educationally, the project will form a cornerstone of a new integrated research and education program. The subject of this research will become a core topic of a course taught by the PI on Systems Biology and by the co-PI on metabolic and cell engineering. \r\n",
