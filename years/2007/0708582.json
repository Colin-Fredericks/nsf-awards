 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIntellectual Merit: This program will investigate novel optoelectronic devices that incorporate organic molecules and nanofabricated contacts in order to study the interactions between optical and electrical properties at the single-molecule scale.  The goals of the program are to develop i) a single platform that will allow the study of both the electrical and optical properties of molecules, ideally down to the single-molecule level, and ii) proof-of-principle experiments to explore the relationships between molecular properties (structure and oxidation/reduction states) and the electrical/optical properties of molecules immobilized between contacts. The proposed experimental effort includes chemical synthesis of appropriate molecules, device fabrication of contact and nano-antenna structures, electrical and optical characterization of the molecular devices and optoelectronic measurements including photoconductivity near optical resonances and optical spectroscopy as a function of applied voltage.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The broader impacts of the proposed work include advancing the miniaturization that is achieved by bringing molecules into a union with devices, which can significantly impact technology at a global level through increased power efficiency and decreased usage of materials. A breakthrough in nanoscale optoelectronics could enable high-performance and low-cost devices for revolutionizing the communications and computer industry. As a part of the research program, students from undergraduate to graduate levels will be exposed to new classes that address the challenges to be met for achieving the goals of miniaturization. Students at the 3rd to 8th grade levels will be able to interact with displays showing the use of molecules interfaced with nanodevices in solar cell technology at Bloomington and West Lafayette.\r\n",
