 "awd_abstract_narration": "ChunkyStore: Physical Database Design for Next-Generation Databases\r\n\r\nTraditional databases lay out tables on disk in a row-major format, but recent research has shown that other physical layouts (e.g., using a column-major format) can yield substantial (order-of-magnitude) performance gains in many applications. The broad goal of the ChunkyStore project is to explore this relationship between physical storage layouts and database performance.  The primary mechanism for doing this is to partition database tables into \"chunks\" of varying numbers of co-located rows and columns and adaptively adjusting these chunks over time to optimize performance.\r\n\r\nSpecific techniques used to achieve this goal include:  (1) investigation of the performance of different \"chunking\" algorithms under different workloads and applications, including scientific data management and data warehousing;  (2) building an automatic storage designer that chooses the best chunking of tables based on models of historical workload patterns; (3) studying chunk-based representations and layout of non-tabular data, such as arrays of imagery (which are particularly important in scientific applications); and (4) using the storage designer, array management techniques, and various replication and distribution strategies to deploy a software system with high performance on large data sets.\r\n\r\nChunkyStore will substantially improve the performance of database systems and demonstrate that they can be used to manage a variety of scientific data.  Education and dissemination efforts will be conducted via research papers, an open source release, several workshops for users, and integration with course projects in the graduate database systems class at MIT.
