 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe cornerstone of the Bonanza Creek (BNZ) LTER research has been the state factor\r\napproach, which allows prediction of ecosystem properties based on independent controls such\r\nas climate, parent material, topography, potential biota, and time and interactive controls, i.e.,\r\nprocesses internal to ecosystems that both affect and respond to ecosystem processes. The\r\nintellectual merit of the proposed research involves expansion of this theoretical framework to\r\naddress processes underlying ecosystem resilience and vulnerability. Our objective is to identify\r\nfactors that buffer systems from radical changes in structure and functioning (resilience) vs.\r\nfactors that might precipitate changes to alternative states (vulnerability). This requires an\r\nextension beyond the assumptions of steady state dynamics to ask under what conditions changes\r\nin drivers might trigger a fundamental change in the nature of boreal ecosystems. The central\r\nquestion of our research is: How are boreal ecosystems responding, both gradually and\r\nabruptly, to climate warming, and what new landscape patterns are emerging?\r\nWe study the dynamics of change in several steps. (1) Climate sensitivity of physical\r\nand biological processes to temporal variation in the environment, which defines the limits of\r\nresilience to climate change; (2) changes in the successional dynamics caused by changes in\r\nclimate and disturbance regime, which define the points in the adaptive cycle of disturbance and\r\nrecovery at which ecosystems are most vulnerable to change; (3) threshold changes that are\r\nlikely to cause the boreal forest to function in a qualitatively new way and (4) integration and\r\nsynthesis in which we integrate these modes of climate response across multiple temporal and\r\nspatial scales and explore their societal consequences.\r\nThe research design combines long-term observations, long-term experiments, and\r\nprocess studies to identify ecological changes and to document controls over ecosystem\r\nprocesses and successional dynamics in three landscape units: floodplains, uplands, and\r\nwetlands. We test hypotheses about controls over ecosystem dynamics by manipulating selected\r\ninteractive controls. These plot-level studies are extended to larger spatial scales (watersheds,\r\nregions, and the state of Alaska) in a hierarchical research design, using extensive measurements,\r\nremote sensing, and modeling. Temporal scales of the research span hours (weather), years\r\n(growth, populations), successional cycles (stand-age reconstructions), and millennia (vegetation\r\nand climate reconstructions).\r\nWe explore societal consequences by identifying past and potential future changes in\r\necosystem services that boreal forests provide both locally (e.g., subsistence resources) and\r\nglobally (e.g., carbon sequestration). Involvement in LTER cross-site comparisons enables us to\r\nunderstand boreal processes in a broader context. To make this information available and useful\r\nto a broader community, we work closely with schools, community outreach programs, the\r\nbroader scientific community, and resource managers through collaborations, outreach, and webbased\r\ndata management. Information management emphasizes secure archival of the information\r\nwe have collected, promotion of its use in synthesis, and development of web-based databases to\r\nfacilitate its use by the scientific community.\r\n",
