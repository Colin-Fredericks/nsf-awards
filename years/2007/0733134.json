The conference is expected to be attended by internationally known experts and decision makers from industry, government, and academia to discuss issues related to mesoscopic methods. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe funds will be used to support students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculties from US institutions to actively participate in the International Conference for Mesoscopic Methods in Engineering and Science (ICMMES). We will give special consideration to under-represented minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and those in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). The creation of the ICMMES international Conference series is a direct response to the increasing interest in multi-scale and multi-physics phenomena observed in nano- or micro-systems and biological systems, and the increasing importance of computational science to research in all disciplines, especially to the aforementioned areas. The focus of the ICMMES conference series is mesoscopic/kinetic methods (e.g., lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), lattice gas cellular automata (LGCA), discrete velocity models (DVM), gas-kinetic schemes (GKS), dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and various hybrid methods) for computational mechanics in its broadest sense. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to, mesoscopic/kinetic methods applied to: computational fluid dynamics (CFD), rheology of complex fluids and soft-condensed matter, multi-scale/physics phenomena in macro-, nano- or micro-systems, thermo-chemically nonequilibrium systems, new algorithms and special computer hardware. The objectives of the ICMMES Conferences are: (1) To bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, research institutions and industry to exchange experiences, disseminate up-to-date information, and explore new opportunities in the field; (2) To expose young or new researchers to the state of the art in the field, by means of, in addition to the Conferences, short courses and the internet media; and (3) To actively encourage underrepresented minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and students in HBCUs to participate in frontier research by attending the ICMMES Conferences.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe main intellectual merit of this proposal is to expose new or young US scientists to research frontiers in a new, important and rapidly growing field by active participation in ICMMES Conferences, which constitute an ideal environment for encouraging dialog and inquiry. Broader impacts of this proposal include an improved networking between US researchers and others all over the world; disseminating up-to-date research information to the scientific community at large; helping create a more inclusive and diverse community for young scientists; fostering a synergy among researchers from different disciplines and institutions; and strengthening the US position in a fast-growing field of research.\r\n\r\n",
