 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cellular engineering is a field with enormous potential to make truly significant contributions to mankind in both medical and non-medical fields over the next decades. The next generation of therapeutics (following recombinant proteins and peptides) will likely utilize cells and tissues. Many new technologies in fields such as environmental engineering and chemical production will also be based on advances in cellular engineering.  This exciting, interdisciplinary field, where Rice University offers great depth of research opportunities and expertise, will provide undergraduate students with exciting and impacting research experiences. Under this REU program, ten undergraduate will be selected each summer to work on any of a number of projects under the mentorship of faculty.  Students will be recruited nationwide, with particular emphasis on recruiting women and under-represented minorities.  The students will participate in cutting-edge research and professional development activities for 10 weeks each summer. More information is available at http://cohesion.rice.edu/CentersAndInst/IBB2/emplibrary/IBB2007SummerInternshipWebsite.pdf, or by contacting Dr. Jennifer West (Principal Investigator) or Kimberly M'Carver (Program Coordinator) at 713-348-6034 or Kimberly@rice.edu.",
