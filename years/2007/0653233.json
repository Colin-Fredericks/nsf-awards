 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific objective of this project is to build time-domain models for the Input Optics system of the Advanced LIGO (AdvLIGO) detector using the LIGO end-to-end (e2e) simulation package. With these models, various numerical tests will be performed to better understand the detector's performance and assess the AdvLIGO design.  The LIGO detectors are Michelson interferometers designed to detect extremely small strain of space-time.  To increase the optical path, the arms are configured as optical cavities.  The input optics system is placed between the laser source and the interferometer, and its main function is to reduce the spatial jitter of the incoming laser beam and mode match the output beam to the interferometer.\r\nThese activities are complementary to the tasks of various LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) working groups, each of which focuses on designing a certain AdvLIGO subsystem.  The role of this project is to combine those subsystem models developed by other groups, and study the performance of the integrated system.  To this end, (1) an e2e model of the integrated system is built, (2) the built model is validated through comparison with measurement and (3) the system's performance is assessed under various realistic conditions.  This project will provide valuable opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in the project and thus to learn not only related physics but also basic collaborative skills as a member of the project team such as responsibility and time management.\r\n",
