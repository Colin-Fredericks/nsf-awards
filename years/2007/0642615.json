 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nCHE-0642615\r\nZharov/Utah\r\n\r\nProfessor Zharov and his coworkers in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah are establishing a research program exploring the properties and applications of surface modified nano-porous synthetic opal films and membranes.  The focus of this work, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program, is on molecular transport through these modified opal nanopores.  Modification with molecular recognition modifiers, study of the mechanism of molecular transport through the opals, and efforts to improve the mechanical strength and permselectivity of the membranes, are the major goals of the work.  Work to develop interactive chemistry exhibits for the Utah Museum of Science and Technology forms the focus of the educational aspects of this Career Award.  \r\n\r\nThe self assembly of sub-micron sized silica spheres to form synthetic opals is the subject of this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor Zharov and his team are working to modify the surface chemistry of these nanoporous opal membranes in order to control and understand the mechanism of molecular transport through these materials.  Educational aspects of this program are focused on development of interactive chemistry exhibits for a local science museum.\r\n",
