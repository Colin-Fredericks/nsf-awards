 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rosales\r\n0703937\r\n\r\n     Aggregation, the coalescence of monomers into large,\r\nstructured clusters, is found at the heart of many phenomena in\r\nscience and industry.  In a simplified model, cluster growth is a\r\ndiscrete stochastic process of adding or shedding monomers, one\r\nat a time.  The Becker-Doring (BD) ordinary differential\r\nequations govern the growth of small clusters by surface\r\nreactions.  Large clusters, growing by the diffusion of the\r\nsurrounding monomers, are described by the Lifshitz-Slyozov\r\nequations.  Small clusters nucleate and form large ones by a slow\r\nprocess caused by fluctuations over a free-energy barrier.  The\r\ninvestigator, Joseph Farjoun, studies the following aspects of\r\nnucleation:\r\n (a) The Zeldovich nucleation formula disagrees with the\r\nexperimental results.  It is highly sensitive to the\r\nsuper-saturation's value, and hence on the distribution of\r\ncluster-sizes.  The investigator seeks a more accurate formula by\r\nresolving the super-saturation to higher order.  In addition, a\r\nsimulation based on renormalized Monte-Carlo methods is providing\r\nmore data on the nucleation rate. \r\n (b) The long-term distribution of clusters sizes, as determined\r\nby the Zeldovich nucleation rate and LS growth rate, is a\r\nclassical problem.  The investigator studies a connection to the\r\nsmooth similarity-solution: A deeper analysis of the partial\r\nanswer in his PhD thesis. \r\n (c) The analysis of 2-dimensional nucleation is a natural\r\nextension of the work in the investigator's PhD thesis.  The\r\nlogarithmic behavior of monomer concentration about nuclei in\r\n2-dimensions forces the nucleation process to be spatially\r\nnon-homogeneous.  The investigator studies this by connecting to\r\nprevious work on 2-dimensional diffusion. \r\n (d) The investigator studies the dynamic dependency of the\r\naggregation process on other physical parameters.  Specifically,\r\nhe analyzes aggregation in a system with a varying temperature. \r\nThe nucleation rate and the total amount of clusters formed are\r\ndetermined by a balance between the decreasing temperature and\r\nthe depletion of monomers, which have competing effects on the\r\nsuper-saturation. \r\n\r\n     Phenomena that are modeled by aggregation -- solidification,\r\nprecipitation, and the condensation of vapor into droplets --\r\nappear in many biophysical and industrial contexts:\r\nGlass-to-crystal transformations, crystal nucleation in\r\nunder-cooled liquids, and in polymers, colloidal crystallization,\r\ngrowth of spherical aggregates beyond the critical micelle\r\nconcentration (CMC), and the segregation by coarsening of binary\r\nalloys quenched into the miscibility gap, to name but a few\r\nspecific examples.  The field of micro-chip fabrication stands to\r\nbenefit greatly from a theory capable of predicting the short-\r\nand long-term behavior of 2-dimensional clusters.  Resolving the\r\nlong-standing disagreement between the Zeldovich formula (which\r\npredicts the rate at which clusters are created) and the\r\nexperiments, finding the time-scales of the various phases of the\r\naggregation process, and a theory for 2-dimensional aggregation\r\n(all of which are topics of research in this project) allows for\r\nmore accurate predictions and better design.  A more realistic\r\nmodel, which accounts for the varying temperature, can be used in\r\nthe design of vapor-forming industries (e.g. power plants), and\r\nin weather prediction.  The current state of the art in\r\naggregation is that of extremes: the behavior at very short and\r\nvery long times, the behavior of very small or very large\r\nclusters have been studied extensively.  In this project, the\r\nwork of the investigator, Joseph Farjoun, bridges these gaps. \r\n",
