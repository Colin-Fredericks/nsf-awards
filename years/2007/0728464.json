 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to promote retention and success, the SMaRT (Science Math and Related Technologies) Scholars for Success program offers scholarships annually to full-time students in Biology, Biotechnology, Chemistry, Chemical Technology, Computer Science, Engineering, Engineering Technology, and Math/Physics majors. All scholars enroll in a learning community that includes tutors, student success specialists, and faculty. Along with financial and academic supports, the SMaRT Scholars program also integrates student service and peer support structures. These components are designed to help the SMaRT Scholar develop an image of him or herself as a successful participant in a community of scientists, engineers, technicians, and mathematicians. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project has three objectives. \r\n(1) Through a coordinated, intensive high school recruitment program, the college is providing scholarships annually to financially disadvantaged, academically talented students, thus increasing the number of full-time STEM majors by 15%. \r\n(2) At least 80% of participants are successfully completing the required first semester mathematics courses (College Algebra and Calculus), which have traditionally had high failure rates. \r\n(3) The college is providing 100% of SMaRT Scholars who successfully complete coursework transfer or job placement assistance, depending on the individual scholar''s goals. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project comprehensively addresses financial, academic, and emotional barriers to student success in STEM disciplines. By building a strong cohort of scholars, as well as a community of supportive mentors around the cohort, the SMaRT Scholars for Success program works to address student feelings and emotional barriers that can prove significant for all students, and often impact traditionally underrepresented students most significantly. With this project, the college is implementing and disseminating a model that can help to overcome all three categories of barriers.",
