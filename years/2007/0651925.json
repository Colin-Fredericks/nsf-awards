 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction between noncommutative geometry and number theory\r\nrepresents a new direction, which has rapidly matured in the past\r\nfew years. The proposed collaborative research project is devoted to\r\napplying the methods and tools of noncommutative geometry to\r\nspecific topics in number theory, pertaining to the study of the\r\nexplicit class field theory problem (Hilbert's 12th problem), of the\r\nRiemann zeta function and of the L-functions of algebraic varieties.\r\nOne anticipated outcome will be a novel understanding of the Weil\r\nexplicit formulae as Lefschetz trace formulae in the context of\r\ncyclic cohomology.  Another central aspect of the project involves\r\nsupplementing Manin's approach to Stark's conjectures for real\r\nquadratic fields  (via noncommutative tori with real multiplication)\r\nwith ideas stemming from the recent investigation of the quantum\r\nstatistical mechanical properties of noncommutative spaces of\r\nQ-lattices modulo commensurability. New results on modular forms and\r\nHecke operators are expected, arising from the transfer of\r\ntransverse geometry concepts and constructions to the setting of\r\nmodular forms. The formalism of spectral triples together with the\r\nlocal index formula in noncommutative geometry will be exploited to\r\ninvestigate rigid analytic spaces more general than Mumford curves.\r\nSignificant progress is also anticipated in the uncovering of the\r\nrelationship between residues of Feynman graphs in quantum field\r\ntheory and periods of mixed Tate motives.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative research project aims to shed light on a number\r\nof important topics pertaining to the rich and largely untapped\r\ninterconnection between the fields of noncommutative geometry,\r\nnumber theory and mathematical physics. These topics address central\r\naspects and open problems, that involve some of the key mathematical\r\nobjects in the latter fields, such as  the celebrated Riemann zeta\r\nfunction and its generalizations called L-functions in number theory\r\nand Feynman integrals in perturbative quantum field theory. Their\r\ninvestigation will be approached in a novel and unified manner,\r\nthrough the methods of noncommutative geometry, a discipline which\r\ngrew out of the fusion between one of the oldest branches of\r\nmathematics -- geometry, and one of the youngest -- quantum\r\nmechanics.",
