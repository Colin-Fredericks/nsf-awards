 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fourth International School and Conference on Spintronics and Quantum Information Technology continues a tradition starting with Spintech I (Maui, 2001), and continuing with Spintech II (Brugge, 2003) and Spintech III (Osaka, 2005). Spintech IV will highlight both fundamental physical phenomena related to spin-dependent effects in semiconductors as well as advances in the development of new types of semiconductor spintronic materials and devices. This includes the current understanding of spin related\r\nbehavior in (magnetic) semiconductor and hybrid magnetic/semiconductor structures and the prospects of exploiting these phenomena in future electronic, magnetic, or optical applications. The Spintech IV school will take place during the first half of the week to orient graduate students and new researchers to this emerging and exciting field. The Spintech IV conference will take place during the second half of the week and will be aimed at stimulating rapid progress in the fabrication, measurement, and theory of semiconductor spintronic systems. Participants will tackle the new challenges for materials and nanostructure designs that have emerged from measurements and calculations in this field, including electron and nuclear spin coherence times, electronic spin transport, measurement fidelity, and exchange interaction strength. \r\n\r\nThe requested funds will be used support approximately 22 Graduate Students for their attendance and participation in the Fourth International School and Conference on Spintronics and Quantum Information Technology in Maui, Hawaii",
