 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal requests funding to subsidize the travel expenses incurred by students attending the 39th Annual North American Power Symposium to be held at Las Cruces, NM, from September 30 to October 2, 2007. It is anticipated that this subsidy will positively impact the extent of student participation at the conference. The North American Power Symposium (NAPS) is a non-profit event that is aimed primarily at student participation. Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of the papers are presented by students. At the 2007 NAPS, the organizers are taking several other steps to foster and encourage student participation. This includes arrangement for free accommodation of registered students. Additional measures are being taken to encourage women and minorities to participate.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nNAPS is unique in its focus on students preparing and presenting technical papers. This conference provides a unique opportunity for NSF to interact with and promote interaction among students, academia and power industry to promote and discuss NSF's vision of technical challenges in power and energy, complex systems, sensing, communication and control as well as its economic, educational and sociological impact.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nNAPS conferences have a history of giving students their first opportunity at research presentations. Further, NAPS encourages discussion of systematic integration of research and teaching. Based on recent history of NAPS conferences the student program has been able to attract 20% minorities and women.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
