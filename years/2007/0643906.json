Despite the\r\ntremendous research effort in combating worms, new computer and\r\nsystem vulnerabilities are continuously reported and new worm\r\nattacks keep succeeding. Another significant trend in worm attacks\r\nis that the number of worm attacks against emergent networks, such\r\nas P2P networks, cellphone networks, and sensor networks, is\r\nrapidly growing. Because of the unique communication models and/or\r\nresource constraints of the emergent networks, most of the\r\nexisting solutions for Internet worm defenses are not directly\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to combat worm propagation in\r\nthese emergent networks. Specifically, various approaches are\r\ndesigned for rapidly distributing security patches to P2P nodes\r\ninfected by worms propagating via file sharing applications and\r\ntopological scanning. Also, both device and network sides defenses\r\nare used to contain cellphone worms that propagate through either\r\nmultimedia messaging services or Bluetooth interfaces. Finally, it\r\nincludes mechanisms to confine worms that propagate by exploiting\r\nthe monoculture of sensor programs in sensor networks. The\r\nproposed research will provide fundamental services and tools to\r\ncombat worms in emergent networks. It draws upon a variety of\r\ntopics including cryptography, graph theory (graph coloring,\r\npercolation theory, partition, dominating set), system (mobile\r\nsystems), networking (P2P, cellular network, sensor network) and\r\nstatistics. The results of the project will be disseminated widely\r\nthrough publications and talks, and the proposed research will\r\nalso be integrated with the education curricula.\r\n",

We developed an automatic maturity rating algorithm for mobile apps.\n\n\n\n\nFig:  Distribution of mobile apps with incorrect maturity ratings in Google Play\n\n-Web attacks based on malicious javescript code is very popular. The attacks can become very difficult to detect  when the malicious javascript code is obfuscated (for some simple obfuscation, no existing anti-software is able to detect it). We developed an efficient algorithm to detect obfuscated malicious javascript code.\n\n- For more flexible while powerful trust management, we developed a partial trust revocation method. Here, a user accusing another user in the system can choose to partially lose its capability in the system (the accused user will lose the same level of capability).  The incentive is that when the accusation is judged to be valid, the accuser can get some bonus. We show such a system works very robust in various accusion scenarios (e.g., good users accuse bad users, bad users accuse good users) even the judgment system is not perfect.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sencun Zhu"
