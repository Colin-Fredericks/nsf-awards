 "awd_abstract_narration": "HPCA is one of the top-tier conferences in the field of Computer Architecture. This year's\r\nprogram has twenty-eight technical papers selected from 174 submissions (an acceptance rate of\r\n16%). The conference addresses a broad spectrum of foundational concerns for computer\r\narchitecture and computer design including microarchitecture, cache and memory system design,\r\nparallel computer architectures, power-efficient architectures, embedded and reconfigurable\r\narchitectures, I/O systems, and performance evaluation.\r\nThis year's conference is also the host to eight workshops and three tutorials. Detailed\r\ndescriptions of the workshops, tutorials and the full technical program are available on the\r\nconference web site, http://www.hpcaconf.org. The conference is sponsored by the IEEE\r\nComputer Society's Technical Committee on Computer Architecture and is held annually. The\r\nlead organizers for the 2007 conference include Professor Ahmed Louri of The University of\r\nArizona (general chair) and Mazin Yousif of Intel Corporation (co-general chair), and Professor\r\nTrevor Mudge of The University of Michigan (program chair).\r\n",
