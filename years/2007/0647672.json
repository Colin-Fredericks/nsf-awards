 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis REU site is designed to actively engage undergraduates in faculty-mentored, independent research in the areas of Ecology and Physiological Ecology in south central Alaska. Each year a total of 8 students will be selected to participate in a 10-week summer program. The opportunities offered by Alaska as a natural laboratory for high latitude ecological studies are unparalleled. The program is intended to positively influence undergraduates toward postgraduate education and careers in the sciences. It will be guided by four main objectives: 1) to help students develop critical thinking skills, 2) to increase student interest in pursuing careers in sciences and to engage students directly in discussions surrounding graduate school and career options, 3) to increase student independence as researchers, and 4) to attract a diverse range of students into the program. The program will be structured to involve students in all aspects of scientific investigation and inspire them through direct exposure to ecological and physiology phenomena in Alaska. Weekly research seminars, a series of career development workshops, and a variety of fieldtrips and social activities will facilitate student learning and development. The program will conclude with a research symposium where the results of student independent projects will be presented to student peers, colleagues and mentors. Students from underrepresented minority groups and from institutions with limited opportunities for research are encouraged to apply.
