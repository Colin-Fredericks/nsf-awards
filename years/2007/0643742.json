 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistical machine translation systems have seen increasing success in recent years, due to improved statistical methods and larger quantities of training data.  However, their ability to generalize has been limited by overly simplistic representations, which are not sensitive to linguistic structure.  This project investigates techniques for syntax-aware machine translation in three directions: (1) extending monolingual grammar induction models to the multilingual case, (2) designing discriminative tree-to-tree models which account for structural divergences between languages, and (3) building efficient inference systems for such models.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop general models and algorithms for syntactic translation, as well as building end-to-end translation systems.  A particular focus is on language pairs for which monolingual resources do exist, but for which large bilingual training texts are unavailable.  Another focus is exploring the way in which monolingual algorithms can be extended or applied to the multilingual case.  In addition to the production of new translation systems and algorithms, a central goal is to develop and make available educational materials suitable for use in training undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of machine translation specifically and artificial intelligence more broadly.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow can we improve machines' ability to translate from one language to another?  Under this grant, we investigated ways to enrich and enhance current approaches under two main directions.\n\nAlgorithms for Multilingual Analysis\n\nModern machine translation (MT) systems create new translations by remixing fragments of past translations.  In syntactic MT systems, those fragments reflect the syntactic structures of the input and output sentences.  Syntactic analysis is a challenging task in any language, but we showed that when analyzing a sentence (in one language) and its translation (in another) at the same time, it is possible to improve both analyses by forcing them to be consistent.  In essence, each language constrains the other.  Improved analyses can in turn lead to improved translations.\n\nAlgorithms for Faster Translation\n\nWhen recombining fragments of past translations, the sheer number of candidate fragments can cause translation systems to bog down.  We showed multiple new algorithms that can speed up syntactic translation by improving the representation of translation rules and changing the ways in which fluency constraints are imposed.  In one approach, we took advantage of the tendency of translation rules to be very word-specific in current systems; such rules can be matched in efficient, word-driven ways.  In another, we demonstrated an approach that translates a sentence in multiple phrases; early phases translate into very fuzzy word classes that slowly coalesce phase by phase into a complete final translation.\n\nEducation in Artificial Intelligence\n\nIn addition to our work on machine translation and multilingual analysis, this work had an educational component in which we developed new materials for a college-level Artificial Intelligence class.  Our materials have been used by dozens of schools, and our class has been offered as a MOOC (free online course) taken by tens of thousands of students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dan Klein"
