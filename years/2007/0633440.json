 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to partially support  a five-day workshop on ``Higher Structures in  Geometry and Physics'', to be held at the Institut Henri Poincare, Paris, France, from  Jan 15 to Jan 19, 2007. The workshop is organized by PI with Alberto Cattaneo from  Zurich University, Switzerland. It is part of the  IHP  trimester program on ``Groupoids and stacks in Physics and Geometry\", where many graduate  courses are offered to  students and young researchers. Higher structures,  in particular homotopy algebras, have appeared in many branches of mathematics and particularly in mathematical physics ranging from deformation quantization, mirror symmetry, Poisson geometry and integrable systems. The workshop aims to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists  and groups working on related areas from different aspects. It brings together leading experts  and young researchers in these subjects to address the important questions.\r\n\r\nThere are many bright young people working in these subjects around the world and this workshop will be a great opportunity  to bring US researchers especially  young people to exchange  their ideas with their  international colleagues and to broaden their perspective. PI anticipates inviting many mathematicians at the postdoctoral and graduate student level (mainly from the United States, and  Europe) to the workshop. \r\n",
