 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II research project will develop a fast-neutron imaging detector capable of high resolution and efficiency. Traditionally, fast neutron detection has required a thick, low resolution scintillator material. The proposed research will instead use light-channeling micro-capillaries filled with liquid scintillants. The capillary diameter and length that will yield optimal resolution and efficiency will be determined using a state-of-the-art image-intensified CCD camera capable of creating short time-interval images, in which noise can be identified and filtered out. The detector system will be tested using a new, revolutionary fast neutron source that is being fabricated and sold by the company. Because fast neutrons are highly penetrating, they have the possibility of imaging and interrogating large, high-density objects. The new high-resolution fast-neutron detector will be used with a high-brightness fast neutron source being developed under another program to form a fast-neutron radiographic system. \r\n\r\nThis system will serve the nondestructive testing interests of commercial and military aircraft, public utilities and petrochemical organizations. The detector and generator combinations will increase the safety, reliability and efficiency of nuclear and other power plant facilities. The discovery of fatigue cracks and piping integrity without the removal of insulation, and possibly the detection of aging in polymeric cabling materials will be possible. The imaging system will be portable, permitting imaging inside of thick steel, lead or even uranium for voids, corrosion and cracks. The proposed detector and neutron generator has a large market for screening for contraband, weapons, and explosives. \r\n",
