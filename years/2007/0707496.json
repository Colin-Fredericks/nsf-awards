 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\n\r\nRaman spectroscopy is a powerful technique, with applications ranging from basic science to sensors for healthcare.  Raman spectroscopy probes vibrational energy levels, thereby allowing molecules to be identified, and changes in bonding to be observed.  In medicine, Raman gas analyzers are used for the real-time monitoring of anaesthetic and respiratory gas mixtures.  In spite of this enormous potential, Raman spectroscopy has not been adopted in a widespread fashion, due to very low efficiency of the Raman scattering process.  In this proposal, the PI outlines a plan for the development of a new device for Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering.  In the device, surface plasmon nanostructures integrated with photonic crystals generate intense electromagnetic fields that lead to enhanced Raman scattering from molecules on the device surface.  This will allow smaller quantities of materials to be analyzed, faster acquisition times, and will reduce the instrumentation cost and complexity.  As the devices will be produced by silicon microfabrication, the Raman enhancement will be reproducible, which is highly advantageous for sensor applications.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nBy overcoming the key difficulty of Raman spectroscopy - the very low Raman scattering efficiency - the proposed device could be the enabling technology for a wide variety of applications.  The program provides opportunities for two graduate students and one undergraduate to carry out research work in an interdisciplinary area of nanoscience.  The PI will develop a new laboratory experiment for his graduate photonics course on the topic of surface enhancement Raman scattering in metallic nanostructures.  At the K-12 level, the PI is committed to supporting science education in the Cambridge Public Schools system through seminars for interested teachers and students.\r\n",
