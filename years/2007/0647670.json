 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of an REU site at the Cyclotron Institute at Texas A&M\r\nUniversity (TAMU).   In the first three years of this REU site the research projects for undergraduate students were focused on nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry.  In the current award, the focus has been broadened to include opportunities for research projects in particle science. Students at this REU site will have a chance to participate in projects at the leading edge of NPS, including sub-fields such as nuclear astrophysics, weak interactions, nuclear dynamics and thermodynamics, nuclear structure, RHIC, neutrinos, supersymetry, atomic ionizations, and radiation effects. There are proposed projects both in theoretical and experimental NPS.   In addition, the Cyclotron Institute is a DOE Nuclear Physics Center of Excellence. The facilities include a K500 superconducting cyclotron and associated state-of the art detector systems. The Cyclotron Institute and the department of physics are also home base for involvement in experiments at other facilities, such as Fermilab, CERN, RHIC, ANL, Boulby Mine and TRIUMF. The faculty are leading scientists in the field and have a history of working with undergraduates in their research programs.   Undergraduates involved in this REU program will have a greater understanding of nuclear science, a better appreciation of research, and will become more independent thinkers and problem solvers. Students will also be better prepared for graduate school and more informed about some possible career choices. Particular attention will be paid to assembling a diverse group of students that will benefit from this program.",
