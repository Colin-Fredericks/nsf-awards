 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa will acquire a liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LC-MS) with this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi User (CRIF:MU) program.  The requested LC-MS will facilitate ongoing research projects including: cofactor identification and proteomic analysis of photosynthetic systems; elucidation of the role of chromium in human metabolism and its implications in insulin sensitivity and treatments of diabetes; the development of water-soluble ligands for aqueous-phase catalysis and studies of metal-catalyzed modification of nucleosides; preparation and characterization of pentafluorosulfanyl-benzenes and fluorinated polymers for use in a range of industrial applications; and fundamental and applied studies into the sequencing of metallopeptides and deprotonated peptides.\r\n\r\nMass spectroscopy is a basic tool used by physical and biological scientists to identify and characterize materials and chemical species by accurate measurement of their mass as they are vaporized and fragmented in the instrument.  Liquid chromatography is a purification technique that separates a complex mixture into individual components before introduced to the mass spectrometer.  These are important tools to be used  in the training of young scientists.  Over 60 student researchers will use LC-MS in their research projects over the next few years. This includes graduate students, undergraduate academic year and summer students (including students from UA's NSF REU program), and high school teachers participating in summer programs.  Through the use of an autosampler and cyber-control, educators and researchers located at 4 or more regional undergraduate institutions including two minority serving institutions, will have access to the instrument for the purposes of laboratory classes and undergraduate research. \r\n\r\n",
