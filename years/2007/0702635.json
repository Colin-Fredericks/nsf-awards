Modules often have requirements on how they communicate and collaborate with other modules.  This work extends what can be expressed and checked in a modular way.\r\n\r\nAnnotations of design intent about properties such as aliasing, effects and locking are given a strong semantic foundation using the concept of ``permissions.'' Annotations avoid both the need of a type system to have a single decidable semantics, and the excessive detail of full specification. Rather, a single (in principle undecidable) semantic system can be checked using a variety of different algorithms ranging from syntax-directed analysis to theorem proving.\r\n\r\nThis work has the following objectives: (1) show soundness of a full system of permissions; (2) give a semantics for a wide-range of design-intent annotations; (3) implement permissions checkers; and (4) evaluate their usefulness on large commercial and open-source software.\r\n\r\nThis research uses the techniques of logics, type systems and program analysis.  The investigators use an existing infrastructure integrated with an open-source environment (``Eclipse'').  It is the intent to make the resulting analyses available in open-source and/or commercial products.\r\n\r\n",
