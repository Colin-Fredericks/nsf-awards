Schuster, Lehigh University\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe objective of the proposal is to develop an integrated research and education program in feedback control of fusion plasmas. The research plan will evolve around the following four central topics: (1) Neoclassical Tearing Mode (NTM) Stabilization, (2) Current and Kinetic Profile Control, (3) Resistive Wall Mode (RWM) Control, (4) Control of Plasma Flows. The outcomes of the proposed research will have a strong impact on the technological advancements that are needed to make nuclear fusion a viable source of energy. In addition, the application-motivated theoretical research activity proposed will significantly impact controls by addressing novel and challenging control problems such as (1) viscosity control of parabolic partial differential equations, (2) implementable closed-loop optimal control of distributed parameter systems, (3) robust and adaptive control of systems with structured uncertainties. The proposed research plan makes emphasis on experimental validation of the control solutions at the three most important fusion facilities in the U.S.: DIII-D (General Atomics), NSTX (Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory), Alcator C-MOD (MIT).\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThe proposal includes (1) education of students at the boundary of plasma/fusion physics, computational techniques, and theoretical and applied controls; enhanced by experimental work at the most important fusion facilities in the U.S. (2)-An Curriculum development (courses on Nonlinear Analysis and Control, Control of Distributed Parameter Systems, Nuclear Energy) and upgrade of the Interdisciplinary Automatic Controls Laboratory (IACL). (3) Outreach, which will be achieved by the use of the IACL, through remote access, by G6-12 teachers, non-PhD granting colleges members of the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges (LVAIC), and local industries; and by exciting activities in fusion and controls for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged K-12 students through  already established outreach programs at Lehigh University. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
