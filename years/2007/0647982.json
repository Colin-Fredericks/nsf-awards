 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Microbiology at the University of Iowa will operate an REU Site during the summers of 2007-2009.  The program seeks to encourage students to pursue a career in basic science and to give those students the skills they need to succeed in that career path.  To fulfill these goals, students will spend 9 weeks in a modern laboratory conducting a research project that addresses a substantive scientific question.  In addition, social activities and lectures will promote informal interactions, broaden the students' understanding of microbiology, and educate them about graduate school and career options.  At the end of the summer, students will prepare a written report and present their findings at a University-wide symposium.  Students will also be encouraged to present their results at regional or national meetings.  Students will receive a stipend and money for travel and living expenses.  The program is open to undergraduates who have (1) finished their sophomore or junior year of college, (2) are interested in scientific research, and (3) are U.S. citizens or permanent residents.  Recruitment will emphasize students from demographic groups that are underrepresented in the sciences and/or students from small colleges where opportunities for research are lacking.
