 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT for STEP Proposal # 0653056 \r\nSTEM Talent Expansion via Applied Mathematics (STEAM)\r\nCUNY College of Staten Island, PI Gail Simmons\r\n\r\nThis project is engaged in an initiative to recruit more students as majors in all areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) offered by the college. The initiative, called the STEM Talent Expansion via Applied Mathematics (STEAM), is bringing improved pedgogy to every potential STEM major and is establishing a culture of research in the STEM disciplines. The goal is to assist these students in the successful completion of STEM degrees. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of STEAM lies in the recognition that interdisciplinary applied mathematics can be used as the core of an attractive professionally-oriented science curriculum. The appeal of applied mathematics lies in its universal applicability to all STEM majors and in the portability of the analytic, quantitative and computational skills inherent in applied mathematics to virtually any career. For the purpose of increasing the number of STEM graduates, emphasizing applied mathematic has the double benefit of addressing a major academic weakness of the existing STEM students and of appealing to a larger population of potential STEM students who fail to grasp the many career opportunities that grow out of a STEM degree. \r\n\r\nThe goals of the STEAM project are to: a) increase the population of incoming STEM students, b) help them overcome the early hurdles to success that are presented by their introductory math and science courses, and c) nurture them in their majors toward rewarding careers that utilize the skills and abilities they have acquired through STEM study, leading to increased numbers of STEM graduates. The STEAM initiative spans the entire academic experience of a STEM student, from recruitment to pre-major course work, to declaration of a major, to possible undergraduate research and finally to graduation. Together with the Discovery Institute at the college, STEAM is developing new resources for outreach to area high schools through campus visits, summer programs, and advanced coursework. STEAM is also working with existing CSI student support programs (freshman block programming, faculty mentoring, Honors College and Teacher Academy) to engage and retain a broad spectrum of potential STEM majors. STEAM is providing scholarship support to students and providing faculty with curriculum and professional development centered on applied mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of STEAM is a result of the improved pedagogy in all of the introductory mathematics and science courses, courses taken by both STEM majors and many other majors at CSI, including business and education.",
