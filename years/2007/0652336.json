 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Uruguay award will support ten U.S. researchers to participate in a Workshop on Neuronal Coding, to be held in conjunction with the seventh biennial international meeting on Neural Coding (NC'07) in Montevideo, Uruguay, November 3-7, 2007.   The workshop is co-organized by Dr. Michael Stiber from the University of Washington, Bothell and Dr. Ruben Budelli from the University of Montevideo, Uruguay.  The aim of the workshop is to examine recent advances in the theoretical understanding of neural coding.  Recent contributions from dynamical systems, statistical physics and other multidisciplinary views are fast changing this field and the workshop will provide an opportunity for international experts to discuss the state of art of the field, present challenges and establish a research program that will advance the field.\r\n\r\nParticipants of the workshop will include US experts and young researchers who will interact with their Latin American counterparts.  Researchers are required to stay beyond the workshop, and will visit local research groups; this will both help young researchers gain international experience and inject enthusiasm into local research activity.  The gathering should foster bridges between Latin America and US research centers and lead to longer term relationships among researchers.  \r\n\r\n",
