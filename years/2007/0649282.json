This program will provide 9 undergraduates students each year for three years a 10 week \r\nin-lab research experience in a nano-engineering project applied to biomedicine.  The undergraduate students will also receive formal instruction in research related topics that include defining a research problem, protocol planning, and maintenance of records, library research, and research reporting in oral and written format, intellectual property, statistical analysis, and ethics in engineering. \r\n\r\nBecause Biomedical Engineering is one of the few engineering disciplines that have traditionally attracted women students, this program has the potential to draw women into the field of micro/nano-engineering.  Recruitment efforts will focus on students from colleges and universities that either do not currently have graduate programs in engineering or have limited masters programs in this discipline.  The targeted students will be enrolled in mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry or biology programs. \r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EHR/EPSCoR).\r\n",
