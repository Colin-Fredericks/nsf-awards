 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II research project seeks to transform the Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) industry by bringing to fruition a simple, inexpensive, yet highly accurate approach to location awareness: Near-Field Electromagnetic Ranging (NFER) technology. RTLS is an important and rapidly growing segment within the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) industry. In today's world of just-in-time commerce, Supply Chain Management (SCM) requires inexpensive real-time location data to improve efficiency and maintain competitiveness. Established technologies like the Global Positioning System (GPS), UltraWideBand (UWB), and traditional time-of-flight ranging have proven unable to perform satisfactorily within complicated, real-world, indoor propagation environments. \r\n\r\nThe anticipated result of this research effort will be a pilot installation of a NFER tracking system in a warehouse. It is predicted that: \"RTLS and wireless LAN technologies, combined with innovative applications, will fundamentally change the way businesses manage and track high-value assets.\" Accelerated development of a technology that can meet this market need will bolster the American economy and increase American competitiveness.\r\n\r\n",
