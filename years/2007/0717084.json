 "awd_abstract_narration": "Passiflora represents a diverse group of more than 560 species of vines and trees primarily found in Central and South America. These plants are best known as the source of tropical passionfruit, but are also widely cultivated for their beautiful, complex flowers. Passionflowers appear to be a recently-evolved lineage that has experienced rapid species diversification. Many species are poorly understood with regard to morphology, geographical distribution, and conservation status, especially in the largest lineage of passionflowers, subgenus Decaloba, with 235+ species. This study will synthesize modern and traditional approaches to address these problems, using DNA sequence data, scanning electron microscopy, and observation of fresh and preserved specimens. Field work will enable collection of fresh material and documentation of species distributions. This project will yield a revision of all species in Decaloba, and will provide a modern evolutionary framework within which to address questions about the evolution of floral shape, pollination syndromes, floral development, and the biogeographical history of the lineage. \r\n\r\nThis study will address important biological and evolutionary questions in an especially charismatic group of plants. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research. Undergraduates at Keene State College and Harris-Stowe State University, institutions that primarily enroll underrepresented groups in the sciences, will especially benefit from involvement in this study. Summer workshops at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden will involve students from the local community. Field expeditions will build international collaborations among U.S. scientists and colleagues in Mexico, Central America, and South America. All results of this project will be available through a website hosted by the Missouri Botanical Garden. \r\n \r\n \r\n",

Keene State College (KSC) is a small, liberal arts institution in an EPScoR state.  Approximately 50% of the students at my school are first generation college students and 60% are female.  When I began this research project, few students (approximately 2-5 students per year) were participating in research projects.  Now, five years later, many students (approximately 10-30 students per year) have been or are involved in research outside of the classroom.  Also, when I began this project, three other faculty members in my department had received outside funding for their research endeavors.  Now six (out of nine) other faculty members in my department either have active outside grants or have submitted grants recently to the NIH, NSF, or other outside funding source.   The level of research activity in my department has dramatically increased over a relatively short period of time.  Our institution has devoted significant funds and efforts to increase undergraduate research across our school, and I am happy that I have been able to contribute to this effort.\n\nI have engaged 15 undergraduate students (14 from Keene State and one from Mexico) in research related to this project.  All KSC students have participated in the molecular aspects of this project and have learned how to extract DNA from leaf material, amplify and sequence target genes, assemble and align DNA sequences for particular gene sets, and analyze those sequences to produce evolutionary trees.  We have generated over 500 gene sequences for taxa within Passiflora subgenus Decaloba.  One of these students traveled with me to Mexico (2010) to collect plant samples for this project, and the trip had a profound impact on him.  He was able to meet and work with other undergraduate and graduate students in Mexico, which allowed him to gain a more inte..."
