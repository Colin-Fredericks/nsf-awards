 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fibrin fibers, the structural component of blood clots, have the mechanical task of stemming the flow of blood.   Surprisingly, despite the importance of this task, the mechanical properties of fibrin fibers are largely unknown.  The applicant is developing a novel technique in which the tip of an atomic force microscope is used to stretch these tiny fibers. With this technique, the applicant will determine the comprehensive mechanical properties of fibrin fibers.  \r\nSocietal benefits.  1)  The technique will enable investigations of many other nanoscopic fibers, thus enabling new discovery.  2) The proposed investigation of the properties of fibrin fibers will provide an entirely new understanding of blood clots and, thus, heart attacks, strokes, thrombosis and wound healing.  This may potentially benefit millions of people who suffer and die from those diseases.  3) The project will provide to theoreticians and network modeler the needed data to construct realistic models of blood clots.  4) Preliminary data showed that fibrin fibers are extremely elastic and extensible, making them attractive candidates for new material science and bioengineering applications.  5)  Teaching. The research is conceptually easy to understand and has clear medical implications. It has already been incorporated into three courses at Wake Forest University.  Wake Forest University is a dedicated teaching institution, in which teaching is highly regarded. The applicant has received the Reid-Doyle teaching award.  The material was used for a Science kids show.  6) Training and education. The project includes a minority Graduate student and undergraduate students.  The applicant has a strong track record in including undergraduate students in research. \r\n",
