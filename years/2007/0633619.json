 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anthropology (81)\r\nSocial Sciences - Other (89)\r\nIntellectual Merit and Goals: A misleading, asymmetrical dichotomy has developed between qualitative and quantitative research in the study of human behavior. This dichotomy places high value on quantitative work and underemphasizes the importance of competence in quantitative and qualitative research combined.  In recent years, qualitative research methods and those methods 'bridging' qualitative and quantitative approaches to research have undergone many cycles of innovation and improvement. This process is being accelerated by recent developments in recording and analytic technologies which have created a new and growing range of robust tools and techniques. The Active Research Methods (ARM) Project is \r\n1) Creating a curriculum that systematically brings qualitative, quantitative and bridging methods to undergraduates using interdisciplinary, hands-on, innovative pedagogy; \r\n2) Facilitating the implementation of this curriculum with a state-of-the-art teaching laboratory that uses community-based research and service-learning as a guiding model; and \r\n3) Establishing a consortium of scholars seeking to increase knowledge and proficiency with these methods. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The ARM project is reaching students and faculty from a range of disciplines across the University of Akron. It is stimulating curricular change and encouraging faculty development and interaction, all of which are expected to contribute to student learning.  New coursework and the teaching laboratory facility are serving students by giving them experience with cutting-edge research methods.  Many students within our diverse student body seek skills that will translate directly to the workplace. Additionally, the community-based research, especially the work in public schools, is exposing under-privileged younger people to the possibility of post-secondary education. Students, faculty and the community are gaining from heightened expertise with the evolving range of research methods and their application in community-based research and service-learning.  Consortium members are tooling-up within their disciplines to improve both their teaching and their own research and publications.  \r\n",
