Petters\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to develop a mathematical\r\ntheory of the shadow patterns cast in the cosmos by the action of\r\ngravity on light.  The project aims to characterize the pointwise\r\ntotal magnification and magnification cross section functions of\r\nthese shadow patterns, both in the geometric and wave optics\r\nlimits for certain key gravity models.  This study requires a\r\ngeometric analysis of caustic singularities, diffraction\r\nintegrals, and asymptotics in a curved spacetime setting.  The\r\nproposed research would lay a platform for generalization a study\r\nof shadow patterns to arbitrary Lorentzian manifolds, which in\r\nturn would lead to a new exploration in Lorentzian geometry.  The\r\nfindings will also yield a detailed gravitational lensing\r\ncomparison of current key geometric gravity models like general\r\nrelativity, PPN models, and braneworld gravity, allowing for\r\npredictions that may test these gravity models.\r\n\r\nShadow patterns are all around us. We drive through them on the\r\nway to work and swim among them in pools.  Similar patterns are\r\nalso cast throughout the universe by the gravitational fields of\r\nstars, galaxies, black holes, dark matter, and dark energy.\r\nPerhaps even more mysterious is that these shadow patterns are\r\nconnected with one of the profound questions about the nature of\r\nour physical world -- namely, whether physical space has more\r\nthan the familiar three spatial dimensions of length, width, and\r\nheight.  This research will employ gravity's cosmic shadow\r\npatterns to explore the nature of black holes and dark matter,\r\nand the dimensionality of physical space.  The work will also\r\nformulate predictions that test Einstein's general theory of\r\nrelativity and other gravity models.  The project is\r\ninterdisciplinary and creates a synergistic interaction between\r\nmathematics, physics, and astronomy.\r\n",
