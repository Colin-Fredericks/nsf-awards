 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues use spectral methods to\r\ninvestigate a challenging problem in unsupervised learning and\r\ndata visualization: given a set of unorganized data points\r\nsampled possibly with noise from an underlying manifold, compute\r\na set of global coordinates of the data points with respect to\r\nthe underlying manifold.  The approach is guided by the general\r\nprinciple that global structures can emerge from careful analysis\r\nof local interactions.  The central idea is the exploration of\r\ntangent spaces as representations of local geometry on a\r\nnonlinear manifold using weighted PCA, and the global alignment\r\nof those local tangent spaces to obtain the global structure of\r\nthe manifold by way of computing a partial eigendecomposition of\r\nthe neighborhood connection matrix.  The study focuses on the\r\nfollowing areas: 1) effective local geometric and topological\r\nstructures for manifold learning; 2) the interaction of the local\r\nsampling density, noise level, the regularity of the manifold and\r\nthe local curvature structure, and their effects on the accuracy\r\nof manifold learning; 3) local smoothing methods to make manifold\r\nlearning more robust to noise and outliers; 4) connections with\r\ninfinite mixture models, one-class support vector machines and\r\nlevel set methods; 5) efficient and scalable algorithms for\r\nlarge-scale manifold learning problems.\r\n     With the advancement in modern computing technology, we are\r\nfaced with the challenging problems of extracting useful\r\ninformation from vast amounts of data.  The data generated in a\r\nvariety of applications tend to have tens of thousands of\r\nattributes, leading to the problem characterized by \"curse of\r\ndimensionality.\"  In many applications, however, high-dimensional\r\ndata points are governed by a few intrinsic degrees of freedom.\r\nThink of the set of images depicting a horizontally rotating\r\nface: the images are high-dimensional but the intrinsic degree of\r\nfreedom of the image set is simply one, representing the rotation\r\nangle of the face.  The focus of this proposal is the development\r\nof geometric, statistical, and computational methods for\r\nextracting those latent intrinsic degrees of freedom by modeling\r\nthe set of data points as samples from nonlinear manifolds, and\r\nthe discovery of the global structure of the manifolds from\r\ncareful analysis of local interactions.  The results, algorithms,\r\nand techniques developed have immediate applications in\r\nbioinformatics, especially for gene expression analysis for\r\ndetecting and distinguishing diseases and disease types; in\r\nappearance-based modeling for people detection using video\r\nsequences generated from surveillance cameras; in helping\r\nintelligence analysts to sift through large amount of textual\r\ninformation by more efficient modeling of text document\r\ncollections; and in enhancing computer-supported collaborative\r\nlearning and performance measurement in second language learning.\r\n\r\n",
