 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the University of Minnesota, Morris REU project is to nurture the development of underrepresented individuals in the geological sciences. Eight women will be involved in field and laboratory research to determine the origin of glacial deposits of Quaternary age in west-central Minnesota and late Paleozoic age in western Sao Paulo state, Brazil. This research program will continue a long-established collaborative research effort between UMM and Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP) faculty and students.\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota, research will focus on the history and dynamics of the Des Moines glacial lobe. Individual projects will utilize sediment analysis to determine the origin of problematic deposits, including Tunnel Valley Eskers, a striated and faceted Boulder Pavement, and varved sediments of Glacial Lake Benson. These studies will employ geologic research techniques such as characterization of till and sediment facies, provenance studies, sedimentary petrography, and paleoecological assessments (micropaleontology, palynology, sedimentology and clay chemistry).\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, comparative analysis of Quaternary and Paleozoic sediments (diamictites and varvites) and features (eskers, boulder pavements and wedge casts) will allow students to gain insight into the glacial history of the late Paleozoic Gondwana glaciation. Fieldwork in Brazil will include mapping of sedimentary units, sequence stratigraphy, facies analysis, and the interpretation of glacial features. REU participants will select individual research projects with a focus on Brazil, Minnesota, or comparison of deposits and/or landforms.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing high quality facilities and close faculty guidance, the UMM REU program continues to provide students with opportunities unique to the host institution. On the UMM campus REU students have the opportunity to examine issues in scientific ethics, discuss problems of women in science, meet professional women geoscientists, and begin planning future academic and scientific careers. Participants gain self-confidence by giving a professional talk and leading a field trip. This program not only fosters maturation of these students as scientists and individuals, but it also contributes to the geologic knowledge of west-central Minnesota and Brazil.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.",
