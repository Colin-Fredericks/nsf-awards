It will extend a research direction begun many years ago on classroom assessment initiated by the investigator.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this tool is to improve the instruction of teachers in mathematics and science. It will produce real-time individualized diagnoses of instructional needs to help teachers plan instruction that specifically addresses the learning needs of each student in that class.  Wilson has been working on related techniques for a number of years and in this project will work with two experimental curricula, the IQWST science curriculum from the University of Michigan and Northwestern University, and the CDMW data analysis project from Vanderbilt University.",
