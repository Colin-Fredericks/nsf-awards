 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the development, assessment, and dissemination of resource material for \"Peer Instruction\" in undergraduate Quantum Mechanics courses, ranging from the sophomore level to the senior llevel.  The resource material to be developed includes \"ConcepTests\" for formative assessment, standardized assessment tools for summative assessment and material for Just-In-Time Teaching (JITT) for modern physics and quantum mechanics courses.  This pedagogical method keeps students actively engaged in the learning process and it is hoped that this material will be widely adapted.  The research-based material will be developed using findings of student misconceptions and difficulties in learning quantum mechanics.  The assessment of the project will come from control studies comparing similar courses in Modern Physics and Quantum Mechanics in which Peer Instruction was employed vs. those in which this pedagogical method was not employed.  Such studies will be conducted at several colleges and universities.  It is intended that this project will help better prepare future scientists and engineers for an environment in which an understanding of quantum phenomena is rapidly increasing in importance.",
