 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nWith new device technologies moving towards significantly smaller length-scales, the need for fundamental science to explore how atoms move and arrange themselves on surfaces is becoming imperative for understanding how materials grow.  Although there has been significant recent progress towards understanding some of the mechanisms that dictate atomic assemblies on surfaces, the role of defects (meaning atoms that do not occupy expected positions) has been overlooked.  Because defects can be initially incorporated at the surface and then become buried below it, conventional experimental tools which are sensitive only to the surface cannot see the defects.  In addition, very small crystals (nanocrystals) are subject to new forces (quantum-mechanical forces) that have not been previously considered in theories of crystal growth.  \r\nThis individual investigator award will utilize a beam of x-rays from the Advanced Photon Source, which is the brightest source of x-rays in the United States, to probe, both,  the surface and the subsurface structure as atoms are deposited onto a surface.  It is expected that these experimental studies will lead to essential new insight to growth mechanisms and, thus, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how materials grow at surfaces.  The project will train and mentor graduate students and postdoctoral researchers as well as undergraduate students.  The research activities at the Advanced Photon Source will enhance their educational experience while they will become part of a national resource of future scientists who can utilize these new state-of-the-art facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe main thrust of the project investigates new atomic-scale mechanisms that strongly affect the growth and evolution of nanocrystals and epitaxial films.  Particular emphasis is given to elusive subsurface phenomena, which are uniquely addressed by in situ x-ray scattering.  Experiments will be performed on simple \"model\" systems that lead to clear interpretations and the establishment of fundamental concepts.  The subsurface sensitivity of in situ x-ray scattering enables new insight and solutions to problems that have eluded other surface sensitive techniques.  It will be learned, at the atomic-scale, how defects become incorporated into a film, how these affect the subsequent growth once incorporated, and how defects relate to the evolving surface morphology.  The new results will provide the foundation and a \"stepping stone\" for investigating more complex systems.  These studies will also reveal how interfaces influence the growth of epitaxial nanocrystals and how the small crystal size is manifested in its growth kinetics.  Exploring and exposing the novel growth kinetics of quantum size effect nanocrystals is expected to lead to a new conceptual framework for understanding these systems.  \r\nThe project will utilize the in situ surface scattering facility developed by the PI at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), where the high brightness of the x-ray source and the instrument design provide new capabilities that enable these studies. Because the project addresses fundamental issues that help understand how to manipulate nanomaterials, these studies will broadly impact emerging technologies that have important societal benefits such as computer, communication and medical technologies.  Education and research are extensively integrated into the project, as it involves graduate students, postdocs and undergraduates.  State-of-the-art infrastructure at the APS offers excellent training opportunities for students and postdocs. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith science and technology pushing the limits of materials on ever smaller length scales &ndash; the nanoscale &ndash; there is a need to understand the underlying physical behavior of these materials of small dimensions.  Often, novel physical behavior emerges at the nanoscale and, in order to utilize nanomaterials, one must have a fundamental understanding of the basic physical laws that allow one to fabricate, control and manipulate such materials.\n\nThis project addressed a subset of these issues whereby the surfaces and interfaces play an important role in influencing the way that nanoscale metals form.  Certainly the smallness-of-size will give more importance to the interfaces of nanomaterials.  In the case of metals, confining the conduction electrons into a small region causes novel quantum-mechanical effects that would not otherwise occur and this phenomenon can influence the way nanoscale metals form in remarkable ways.  In addition, as these metals are formed, defects consisting of places in the metal with missing atoms (vacancies) can initiate at the surface and change the properties of the metal.  The project utilized a unique approach to address these issues by using the brightest source of x-rays in North America at the Advanced Photon Source to study the atomic-scale structure of the buried interfaces of nanometals.  The studies used a highly specialized growth chamber facility developed by the PI, which was resident at an x-ray beamline at the APS. \n\nA number of important new results were discovered:   \n\n(1) In the case of lead metal (Pb), an atomically thin layer of Pb forms on a silicon (Si) substrate and the project discovered that its atoms unexpectedly move or slide continuously so that the atomic-scale structure never stabilizes.  This continuous motion is suspected to facilitate a rapid motion of atoms thousands of times faster than previously thought for the formation of Pb nanoparticles.  Such fast motion can radically affect the types of structures that these metallic particles exhibit. \n\n(2) The project found that silver (Ag) nanoislands (pancake-shaped particles just a few atoms thick) can form no thinner that three atomic layers.  This feature of minimum thickness is quite different than other metals such as Pb, which exhibits nanoislands whose stability oscillates with atomic layer thickness.  The project showed that the differences in behavior among metals can be tied to specific features in the electronic structures of these metals.  This discovery is important for understanding how to predict the behavior of the metals when they are created at these very small size scales. \n\n(3) The studies also discovered unexpectedly large voids containing on the order of a hundred missing atoms in thin layers of Ag.  Although it was found that there is a very low population of these voids, their large size causes atomic displacements that have a significant influence on the metal.  These effects were not previously known because they are difficult to predict by theory and nearly impossible to see by other experimental techniques.\n\nThe project trained and mentored graduate students as well as undergraduate students.  In addition to the experience of their research project, their educational experience was enhanced by their work at the Advanced Photon Source, which is a large accelerator facility and a major national resource for the upcoming generation of scientists.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul F Miceli"
