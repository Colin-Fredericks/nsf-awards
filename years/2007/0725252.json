 "awd_abstract_narration": "Joanna Skluzacek, Pennsylvania State University (PSU), is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 academic years.  Skluzacek will build on existing relationships between PSU and the University of Mines and Technology (UMaT) in Tarkwa, Ghana to establish monitoring stations and to develop methods for evaluating water quality in areas of Ghana where development and gold mining have put substantial stress on the environment. This partnership will support the growth of the human and academic capital needed for responsible management of resources in Ghana, while promoting the understanding of local and regional challenges to sustainable development. The data obtained from this project will be used to increase public awareness of the risks and impacts of mining practices and to improve the quality of water available to the local population. Skluzacek also will work with the Penn State Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) and the Alliance for Earth Sciences, Engineering and Development in Africa (AESEDA).  These two centers will support research and outreach efforts that promote the use of science capabilities in service to society. This Discovery Corps project will strengthen international collaborations and encourage a diverse group of students to consider careers linking materials science to water chemistry and remediation. Integrating this work into summer science workshops and undergraduate and graduate courses at PSU will help students recognize the personal and global benefits of international environmental research.\r\n\r\nThis Discovery Corps Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Africa, Near East and South Asia program of the Office of International Science and Engineering. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program seeks new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.",
