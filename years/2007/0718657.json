 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamics of alkane and alcohol activation on transition metal surfaces is the focus of this research project being carried out in the laboratory of Professor Harrison at the University of Virginia.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Harrison and coworkers are using effusive molecular beam scattering methods to measure the dissociative sticking coefficients of small alkane molecules, ranging from methane to neopentane, as well as small alcohol molecules, as a function of incident gas temperature and surface temperature.  A microcanonical unimolecular rate theory is used to describe the data obtained, and to develop an understanding of the interaction energetics that control the reaction dynamics.  In addition, surface infrared spectroscopy and thermal desorption spectroscopy are used to identify reaction intermediates and develop mechanisms for these important small molecule activation processes.  Information gained from these measurements is useful for the design of catalytic hydrogen production schemes.\r\n\r\nProduction of hydrogen from the catalytic activation of small hydrocarbons and alcohol molecules is an enabling technology for the hydrogen economy.  Professor Harrison and coworkers at the University of Virginia are using effusive molecular beam methods coupled with surface analysis tools to investigate the detailed mechanisms and dynamics of small hydrocarbon and alcohol activation on transition metal surfaces.  Measurement of dissociative sticking coefficients is combined with a microcanonical statistical theory to develop a detailed understanding of these technologically important processes.\r\n",
