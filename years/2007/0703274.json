 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central theme of the proposed research is to explore conjugated diblock copolymers\r\nfor solar energy harvesting and to gain a fundamental understanding of the correlation between\r\nmolecular/material structures and photovoltaic (PV) functions. New modular approaches are\r\nproposed to the syntheses of three representative new diblock copolymer systems, rod-rod, rodsemi-rod and rod-coil diblock copolymers. Plans are outlined to elucidate and control the self\r\nassembly and phase behaviors of the resulting materials. The dynamics of charge separation and\r\ncharge transport will be investigated to gain insight into the electronic processes in these\r\nmaterials. Rational approach to modify the ITO surface is proposed in order to direct the\r\ninterfacial assembly of these materials and optimize the charge injection. The resulting materials\r\nwill be used to prepare prototype solar cells in a well defined cell platform for detailed\r\ncharacterization. The feedback from these studies will reveal the limiting factors in photovoltaic\r\nmaterials and guide the development of new materials. These fundamental studies will\r\neventually lead to breakthrough in developing novel and cost-effective OPV materials enabling\r\nhigh solar energy conversion efficiency as well as future commercial vitality.                                           \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity: This proposed research in syntheses\r\nand characterization of novel functional diblock copolymers will have a fundamental impact on\r\nour understanding in charge separation and transport in organic materials. The relationship\r\nbetween molecular structure and solid assembly, further between solid structure/physical\r\nproperties is fundamentally important to polymer science and material science. A well-defined\r\nmolecular system will lead to the formation of defined solid structures, which is invaluable to the\r\nstudies in organic light harvesting materials. The proposed work is an important example of new\r\nfunctions that are introduced into diblock copolymer architectures. The modular synthetic\r\napproaches proposed here will add new knowledge to the synthetic arsenal.                                             \r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed activity: Our nation is currently facing an urgent\r\nneed for renewable energy source. Solar energy is the largest renewable energy source. Plastic\r\nsolar cells offer potentially low costs in materials and processing, the possibility for large area\r\nand flexible structures, and the ease of the structural modification for the fine-tuning of band\r\ngaps. The proposed research is highly beneficial towards our economy and society. The\r\nproposed efforts will inherently provide ample opportunities for the interdisciplinary training of\r\ngraduate and undergraduate students at the frontiers of organic/polymer/material chemistry. We\r\nplan to integrate the proposed research activities with a broad-ranging educational program\r\naimed at college undergraduate and graduate students. The importance of early involvement of\r\nundergraduate students in research activities is widely acknowledged. In this program, we will\r\nput a great effort in recruiting more undergraduate students. This project is ideal for training\r\ngraduate students and enables them to perform original and independent research. From these\r\nhighly intellectual processes, they will develop creative thinking and skills and become mature\r\nscientists.",
