 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a flexible, modern training program in applied mathematics within the Research Training Group program.  \r\n\r\nMathematics is a central component in physical sciences, biological sciences, and engineering, and many diverse disciplines exhibit common mathematical structures.  Work in these fields profits from the involvement of applied mathematicians with broad backgrounds.  This program will train such young applied mathematicians at all levels, from undergraduates through postdoctoral researchers.  \r\n\r\nA significant feature of the program is its interdisciplinary nature -- the group's activities involve not just mathematicians, but engineers and scientists as well.  Thus, group members, while trained as applied mathematicians, will be comfortable interacting with non-mathematicians in research teams.  The research activities will emphasize breadth and flexibility; trainees will be able to tackle problems involving a wide variety of mathematical techniques, ranging from analytical and computational methods to the development of suitable models of physical processes, and they will be able to adapt their research to diverse areas as opportunities arise. \r\n\r\nThe group's activities will involve mathematical research ranging from analytical to computational, in application areas including life sciences (particularly microbiology and biological fluids), fluid mechanics, materials science, and combustion.  A special focus is on interfacial phenomena and phenomena involving multiple scales.\r\n\r\nThe project will produce a group of young applied mathematicians who are multifaceted in their scientific knowledge, able to grasp common mathematical features in problems from a diverse range of application areas, comfortable working and interacting with scientists and engineers in an interdisciplinary environment, and sufficiently flexible to pursue productive research in other areas as national priorities evolve. \r\n",

Four postdocs were supported by this project for a period of three years each.  These postdocs taught applied math courses, worked in teams involving applied math faculty, graduate students and undergraduate students and brought their expertise to bear on a variety of real-world problems which were then tackled using the techniques of applied mathematics.  Of the four postdocs, three came from engineering backgrounds.  Two have since attained faculty positions at major engineering schools where they are using their mathematics background to train engineering students to employ mathematical techniques in their analysis of engineering problems and to be able to engage in interdisciplinary research coupling mathematics and engineering.

Roughly half of the publications were in science and engineering journals as opposed to applied math journals.\n\nWithin the space of this report only a small number of the research discoveries obtained through research supported by this project can be listed.  A selection of these discoveries include:\n\n1 - We have developed a mathematical model for a new and potentially very promising process for the synthesis of chemical catalysts.  There are many external parameters in this process and the mathematics has pointed out how these parameters can be chosen so as to maximize output and quality of the product.\n\n2 - When two species compete for a scarce resource, many times the effect of the competition is nonlocal, that is it does not depend on the populations at a specific point, but rather on an average of the populations in a neighborhood of the point.  For example, if species compete for water in a stream, the effect of the competition depends on the population along the stream not just at one point along the stream.  The nonlocality can make spatially homogeneous equilibrium populations unstable, that is they cannot be observed in real-life. We have shown that in this case the populations aggregate into islands separated by deadzones where the species are essentially extinct.\n\n3 - A biofilm simulation tool has been developed that will enable scientists to check hypotheses concerning biofilm gr..."
