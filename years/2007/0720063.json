 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, there are fewer individuals trained in Quantitative Psychology than there are positions in need of individuals with such skills. There is also an imbalance in the kind of role models and mentors that are available to enhance quantitative training for a diverse group of students including under-represented minorities and women. To address this need, the current project involves 3, three-day conferences to be held in conjunction with at least three days of programs at APA annual meetings in Boston in 2008, in Toronto in 2009, and in San Diego in 2010. The three-year project builds on three previous years of quantitative training. Quantitative training and support will be provided for 40 minority students each year by a group of 10 experts drawn from major quantitative societies. Selection of the 40 participants will be based on (a) interest and achievement in quantitative and research methods; (b) perceptions of how they will benefit from the quantitative training; (c) future goals relevant to quantitative and research methods; and (d) indication that they come from an under-represented group. Conference format involves: several faculty presentations donated from top experts, student interactions with faculty, and student research presentations each day Conference coordinators are members of two major quantitative organizations, the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (SMEP) and Division 5 (Statistics) of the American Psychological Association (APA), of which both recognize the need to train a wider range of individuals pursuing the study of quantitative methods. The approach draws on an organizational theory of diversity that emphasizes addressing social isolation through mentoring networks as well as establishing institutional responsibility for diversity.  Ultimately, individual students from underrepresented groups and leading quantitative organizations will help to broaden and diversify the base of trained quantitative individuals, enhancing the nature of, approaches to, and questions asked in scientific research.",
