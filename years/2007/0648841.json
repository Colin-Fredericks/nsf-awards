 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Division of Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Louisiana State University (LSU) for the summers of 2007-2009. The program director, David Spivak, will be assisted by co-PI Steven Watkins in the ten-week program. The research projects focus on environmental, biological and materials chemistry, areas in which LSU has significant expertise and a contingent of well-supported researchers.  The students will visit advanced research laboratories, discuss graduate school options with faculty and graduate students, and participate in weekly workshops to develop skills in electronic literature searching and computer applications.  Students targeted for the proposed site include chemistry students at small colleges and universities with limited research opportunities, LSU students whose academic year or work schedules prohibit significant research experiences, and students with interests in materials, environmental, or biological chemistry.  The recruitment of a diverse group of undergraduates, including students from HBCUs, is a high priority of this program.  LSU is a leading producer of African American Ph.D.s and thus provides an integrated, supportive environment for students from HBCUs and other students attracted to its REU program.",
