The major contribution of this project in the tenfold increase in the energy delivery of magnetic nanoparticles will be achieved through: (1) FeCo materials developed by the PI with a higher saturation magnetization, (2) control of the material morphology, and (3) application of a secondary magnetic field to orient the particles.  A strength of this project is the use of the technology in a cancer application to test drug delivery, thermal drug release, and MRI imaging.  The research plan includes modeling of the nanoparticle magnetic properties, synthesis capabilities, and fabrication of various biocompatible shell materials whose surfaces can be chemically modified. \r\n\r\nThere are significant teaching components associated with this interdisciplinary project that will benefit high school and undergraduate students who want to learn about research and graduate students who begin their research career and collaborating faculties. Women and minority are encouraged to participate in this research. The most valuable experience that this interdisciplinary project will bring is the collaborative atmosphere among academic researchers with complementary skills to work together.\r\n",
