 "awd_abstract_narration": "Berlyand\r\n0708324\r\n\r\n     The investigator works on the theoretical development and\r\napplications of homogenization theory.  This theory deals with\r\nthe properties of heterogeneous materials, which are of critical\r\nimportance for modern technology.  Modeling of such materials\r\nraises fundamental mathematical questions, primarily in partial\r\ndifferential equations and Calculus of Variations.  The project\r\nfocuses on two areas, with homogenization and multiscale analysis\r\nas their common themes. \r\n Area A.  Ginzburg-Landau models: homogenization, well-posedness,\r\nand near-boundary vortices.  Vortices of the minimizers of the\r\nGinzburg-Landau energy functional capture essential features of\r\nsuperconductors and superfluids.  They have many common features\r\nwith vortices in fluids, defects in liquid crystals, dislocations\r\nin solids, etc.  The investigator studies the homogenization and\r\nrise of a special type of near-boundary vortex for the\r\nGinzburg-Landau functional in the class of maps with the degree\r\n(winding number) prescribed on the boundary of a\r\nmultiply-connected domain.  In this problem, he establishes novel\r\nlocal minimizers that have near-boundary vortices with bounded\r\nenergy. \r\n Area B.  Homogenization of an elasticity problem with many\r\nnonseparated scales and the Cauchy-Born rule.  Homogenization\r\n(upscaling) in the presence of many nonseparated spatial scales\r\nis far from understood from a mathematical standpoint and it\r\narises in the study of turbulence, soils, biological tissues,\r\netc.  The investigator studies such a problem for elasticity\r\nequations and constructs an approximate (upscaled) solution\r\nbelonging to a finite-dimensional functional space.  The\r\nclassical Cauchy-Born rule is a postulate that allows the passage\r\nfrom atomistic to continuum models in monoatomic crystals.  The\r\ninvestigator uses the above approximate solution to derive a\r\ngeneralized Cauchy-Born rule for strongly heterogeneous\r\nmaterials. \r\n\r\n     The investigator focuses on the development of novel\r\ntechniques of applied analysis to address the needs of modern\r\ntechnology.  The Ginzburg-Landau equations arose in modeling\r\nsuperconductivity but have wider implications.  In this project,\r\nthe investigator's work on this topic has potential applications\r\nin the design of superconducting materials (which at certain\r\ntemperatures conduct electric current with no resistance) and\r\nferromagnetic materials.  Additionally it addresses the\r\nunderstanding of vortex behavior, which is one of the major\r\nchallenges for the science of superconductivity and its\r\ntechnological applications.  For the second topic, homogenization\r\nof elasticity problems with nonseparated scales, he aims to\r\ndevelop novel, efficient computational tools suitable for\r\nmodeling strongly heterogeneous (disordered) materials, both\r\nnatural and man-made.  In particular, the issue of elastic\r\n\"cloaking,\" when a portion of a geological medium is shielded\r\nfrom elastic waves, is addressed.  Advances here could help in\r\nthe design of earthquake-proofed buildings.",
