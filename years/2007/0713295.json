The long-term objective is to create a center to \"\"Serve and Archive Virtual Environments\"\" (SAVE), which will ultimately exist as an open repository of scientifically authenticated 3D cultural heritage models. The project will create cost-effective tools to more easily capture the data necessary for the creation of the models. Tools for version control and methods for sustainability will be developed.  The project's workplan includes:\r\n-  development of an innovative 3D acquisition system for efficient, easy creation of 3D models of cultural heritage sites;\r\n- research into archiving and presentation issues for 3D model repositories;\r\n- deployment of a pilot 3D cultural heritage model archive; and,\r\n- implementation of a complete process for editorial review and publication of authenticated 3D models\r\nThe resulting 3D archive will made publicly available as an online resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
