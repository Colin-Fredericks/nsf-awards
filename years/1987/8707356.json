 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dating the age and duration of metamorphism remains one of              the most difficult tasks to be attempted by geochronologists.                   Data on the length of time required for heating and                             metamorphism, however, are a critical keystone for building                     accurate geophysical models of processes of heat and mass                       transfer in the Earth's crust.  The proposed research will                      attempt to determine the growth rate of garnets by measuring                    variations of 87Sr/86Sr in growth shells and in their                           groundmass.  Problems are anticipated in completing the                         difficult task of precisely analyzing isotope ratios of very                    small samples.  Furthermore, the success of the method rests on                 the viability of untested assumptions regarding the behavior of                 the groundmass as a homogeneous reservoir.                                              Progress is impossible in science unless risks are taken.               In the present case, risks are acknowledged but the potential                   great significance of a successful result warrants support for                  a feasibility study.  Successful completion of the proposed                     research will lead to measurement of the rates of mineralogical                 reactions, rates of devolatilization, and rates of heating.  By                 dating garnets that were rotated during growth, it should be                    possible to determine rates of strain during crustal                            deformation.",
