 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a three-year cooperative research project in            solid state physics between Professor Bruce D. McCombe, Department of           Physics and Astronomy, State University of New York at Buffalo, and             Prof. Dr. Friedemar Kuchar, Institute of Solid State Physics,                   University of Vienna, Austria.  The objectives of the joint study are           (1) to improve present understanding of the \"insulator\"-semiconductor           interface in indium-based III-V compounds (InSb, InAs, InP) and to              develop new or improved insulators and metal-insulator-semiconductor            (MIS) structures in the process and (2) to increase understanding of            the basic physics and unique properties of the nearly two-dimensional           electron gas, particularly the Quantum Hall Effect, in several                  semiconductor structures.  Samples will be obtained from a variety of           sources, including in-house fabrication by organometallic chemical              vapor deposition.  A large range of characterization techniques will be         used to study the interfaces and fabrication techniques.  The basic             physics of the nearly 2-dimensional gas in these structures will be             investigated by several experimental methods.  Basic physical phenomena         to be examined are: electron-electron interactions, electron-phonon             interaction, localization effects in the Quantum Hall Effect regime,            and spin-orbit coupling in narrow gap/reduced dimensionality systems.           Use of Transmission Electron Microscopy will permit correlation of the          electrical properties of the samples with the microscopic physical              structure at the interfaces, important in efforts to make better                interfaces.                                                                                                                                                     This project is directed at improving basic understanding of                    semiconductor device structures, whose operation depends on confining           the motion of electrons in one direction, so that for many purposes the         electrons behave as a two-dimensional (rather than three-dimensional)           gas.  The cooperating scientists have considerable experience in                studying such systems of \"reduced dimensionality.\"  There is current            interest in these systems from both technological and scientific points         of view.  The joint study would thus have an impact both in the areas           of electronics technology and in basic physics.  In spite of                    considerable work done over the past decade, a detailed microscopic             understanding of the interface electronic properties of the structures          to be examined here and the variety of physical phenomena associated            with the nearly two-dimensional electron gas that can be produced               within them has not emerged.  The U.S. and Austrian research groups             bring different facilities and techniques to the project, thereby               allowing a much more complete range of investigations to be carried out         than could be conducted by either group working alone.  The                     investigators believe that their dual technology/physics approach,              coupled with the wide range of samples, characterization techniques,            and expertise available through the collaboration, enhances the                 opportunity for substantial progress in both areas.  This award will            support the transportation and overseas subsistence expenses of                 Professor McCombe, as well as some shipping costs.  The Austrian                Science Foundation (FWF) is providing counterpart support to Professor          Kuchar.  This project takes place under the U.S.-Austria Cooperative            Science Program.",
