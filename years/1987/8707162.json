 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past years, research in architecture has                          demonstrated that some classes of designs can be generated                      according to rules.  These designs may be viewed in terms of a                  number of interrelated, multi dimensional descriptions, where                   descriptive rules determine specific aspects and features of                    the object.  For example, these descriptive rules might                         generate geometrical aspects from the plan, elevation, and                      section of a building or might generate functional aspects                      pertaining to the use or purpose of it.  As the descriptive                     rules are exercised, the design is built up along many                          interrelated dimensions.                                                             The principal investigator proposes to study how the rules                 for generating designs can be extended beyond the field of                      architecture. The formal character of these rules lend                          themselves to a domain independent view of design.  The                         research will contribute to our understanding of formal design                  specifications and may enable specialists to communicate across                 disciplinary specifications and may enable specialists to                       communicate across disciplinary boundaries to produce designs                   that are coherent from multiple perspectives.                                        The principal investigator is a well.known researcher in                   the field of architectural design and a forerunner in the field                 of shape grammars.",
