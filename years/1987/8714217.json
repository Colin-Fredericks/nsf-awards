 "awd_abstract_narration": "La Selva Biological Station, a lowland tropical rain forest site                in Costa Rica, is currently one of the world's most active                      centers for research in tropical biology.  The existence of a                   modern biological laboratory adjacent to 50,000 ha of protected                 forests spanning a 3000-m altitudinal transect is unique in the                 humid tropics.  The recent addition to La Selva of 600 ha of                    altered and/or manipulable habitats has fostered a quantum                      increase in large-scale process-oriented research.  An                          exceptionally diverse spectrum of researchers and academic                      institutions are taking advantage of these opportunities.  A                    critical multidisciplinary mass has been reached at La Selva,                   which is simultaneously stimulating new lines of research and                   pushing existing laboratory facilities to their limits.  With                   this Biological Facilities Center proposal, funds are requested                 to equip a modern analytical laboratory to serve this growing                   network of interrelated research efforts.  This analytical                      laboratory with first-rate instrumentation (GIS and standard and                state-of-the-art equipment to permit onsite evaluation) will                    greatly intensify the application of new techniques to the                      biological study of tropical rain forest.  Owing to La Selva's                  ties to a large proportion of the U.S. academic community, this                 facility will benefit users from an unusually broad geographic                  and disciplinary spectrum.  The development of technologically                  advanced infrastructure at a rain forest site with an exceptional               record of multidisciplinary research will have a major impact on                the next generation of knowledge of tropical ecosystems.",
