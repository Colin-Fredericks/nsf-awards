 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project offers twenty-five selected teachers of Mathematics in             Grades 6, 7, and 8 the opportunity to participate in a four-week Honors         Workshop at Michigan State University during the summer of 1987.  This          will enable these teachers from the Midwest to earn 6 hours of credit in        Mathematics Education.                                                                                                                                          The participants will be provided with a special intensive program              designed to update their knowledge of mathematics and its uses.  They           will also study ways to improve their instruction of mathematics at the         middle grade level.  An interesting \"multiplier\" effect of the program          is the attendance of two proteges of each participant during the fourth         week of the program.  These additional teachers will also be active             participants of the Workshop.  All participants will be provided with           materials and plans with which to return to their communities as leaders        in Mathematics Education.  Materials used will be principally those             developed through the Middle Grade Mathematics Project, an NSF-funded           curriculum development project.  Excellent support has been generated           from local school districts to ensure implementation at the school              level.                                                                                                                                                          During the second summer, the participants, with considerable local             support, will conduct workshops for their peers under the guidance of           the project staff.  Throughout the project the focus will be on building        a local network of teachers to continue the project activities in               addition to exchanging ideas and providing broader support.                                                                                                     Dr. Fitzgerald has extensive experience in Mathematics and Mathematics          Education having worked at the secondary as well as at the university           level.  He has organized and conducted many conferences on various              topics in mathematics and served in the capacity of staff member and            director for several NSF-funded programs.  Dr. Lappan, Co PI, has an            equally impressive background, but, in particular, was Project Director         for the NSF-funded Middle Grades Mathematics Program.  These materials          are an integral part of this proposal.                                                                                                                          With a highly qualified staff, a feasible program design, an appropriate        set of materials and supportive school districts, this program stands an        excellent chance of impacting positively on the Mathematics Education of        the region.",
