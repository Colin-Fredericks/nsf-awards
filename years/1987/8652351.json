 "awd_abstract_narration": "This teacher enhancement project is designed to prepare 80 intermediate         grade/middle school teachers, from schools in Illinois and Kentucky, to         incorporate social issues in the teaching of science through a case             study approach to ecological and geological phenomena.  Middle school           teachers from 40 school districts have already participated in the              program and have begun to implement the case study approach to science          in their classrooms.  This project will extend the approach to                  intermediate grade teachers and provide time for articulation between           the two levels of the school system.  The proposal writers have                 definitively described the differences in approach to be used at each           level and have well developed plans for articulation of the two                 approaches in the schools.  Principals of the schools from which the            teachers come will also be involved and there will be an outreach to            involve the communities in which the schools are located.                                                                                                       The intermediate teachers will be involved in a four week summer program        which will upgrade their knowledge of ecology and geology and introduce         the case study approach to the study of social issues in these fields.          Each will be required to develop an original case study to teach during         the academic year.  At the end of the workshop, the middle school               teachers who have participated in the past two summers will join the            intermediate teachers and work on articulation issues involved between          the two levels.  Extensive follow-up from college staff and a resource          teacher, provided by the project, will assist in the academic year              implementation of the project. A two day conference will be held in the         spring.  Personnel from regional environmental/ecological organizations         will serve as consultants to the teachers and staff.                                                                                                            The project staff is qualified to conduct the program, given its                background in science as well as in the case study methods.  Both               institutions involved have a history of working closely with teachers in        the region to foster and improve science education at the precollege            level. Local school districts were involved in the planning of the              proposal and are supportive of the activity.",
