 "awd_abstract_narration": "Juniata College proposes a five-year program including 1) 6 weeks + 2           weeks summer institutes for a total of 120 in-service teachers on               the pertinent theory and use of modern chemical instrumentation with            ample opportunity for hands-on experience, 2) an opportunity for                teachers to work as research scientists within a research group directed        by a Juniata faculty member, 3) a mobile chemistry instrumentation              laboratory staffed by a properly trained, certified science teacher who         will work with participating teachers and deliver modern instrumentation        for use in the schools, and 4) the development of a network of well             trained science teachers throughout the target region to ensure systemic        and lasting program impact.  The project specifically targets science           teachers in a four county region of rural, central Pennsylvania and             focuses primarily on chemistry.  This project is designed to help pre-          college science teachers perceive themselves as scientists as well as           teachers, to provide them with the training and support to improve their        performance as scientist-educators, and to help them produce better             science students and increased student interest in science careers.                                                                                             Due largely to the revolution in technology and instrumentation, the way        scientists operate has changed drastically in recent decades.                   Unfortunately, the teaching of science at the pre-college level remains         essentially unchanged -especially in small, rural school districts              without sufficient resources for modern, fully equipped laboratories.           However, appropriate instrumentation exists and teachers can be trained         so that pre-college students experience educationally sound, hands-on           science learning.  Juniata's experience is that the excitement of               science is most convincingly conveyed to students by those who perceive         themselves to be scientists - albeit scientists who have chosen to              teach.  Further, the observe and think in the manner of modern                  practicing scientists.  This project builds on those principles to              improve the quality of science education in the schools of Central              Pennsylvania.",
