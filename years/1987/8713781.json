 "awd_abstract_narration": "The total ozone abundance over Antarctica has decreased dramatically            during the austral spring seasons of the past decade.  Total ozone              abundances observed in October, 1986 were only about half as large as           those obtained in the late 1960's and early 1970's.  Ozone plays an             essential role in the Earth's ecology because of its absorption of              ultraviolet radiation.  A great deal of recent research has been                directed towards understanding the cause of the change in the                   Antarctic ozone layer.  Ground-based visible absorption spectroscopy            will be used to measure the stratospheric column abundances of ozone,           nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and clorine dioxide (OClO).  This will provide a         means of simultaneously measuring the ozone change and the abundances of        both reactive nitrogen and reactive chlorine species.  Possible                 correlations between simultaneous measurements of the three                     constituents are of particular value in distinguishing between                  proposed mechanisms of the ozone depletion.  Such measurements can be           carried out by using the direct light from the sun or moon (thus                providing information on the diurnal variations of these species) or            by measuring the scattered light from the zenith sky.  The planned              research consists of an extended series of visible absorption                   measurements at McMurdo Station during August, September, and October,          1987.",
