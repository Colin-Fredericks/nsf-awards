 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Smith plans to study the homology between the insulin and                   glucagon produced by the pancreas and the insulin and glucagon                  produced by salivary glands using the rat as an animal model.                   These hormones are important in the regulation of metabolism and                food stuff utilization.  A deficiency of pancreactic insulin                    production results in diabetes.  Smith has evidence that the                    peptides produced by the two glands are identical in terms of                   peptides structure and the genes that regulate production.                      However, the pancreatic peptides are secreted into the blood and                act as hormones, whereas the salivary gland peptides are secreted               into the gastrointestinal tract and have no known function.                     Smith hopes to be able  to determine mechanisms regulating                      production, processing and secretion of the salivary gland                      peptides as compared to the pancreatic peptides in rats of                      varying ages or stages of development and under various hormonal                conditions including the diabetic state.  Apparently, the                       salivary gland peptides are produced in the diabetic state                      indicating some differences in the regulation of gene expression                between the two glands that might lead to a better                              understanding of the hormonal and genetic regulation of insulin                 and glucagon production and to possible mechanisms for gene or                  cell transfer to relieve the diabetic state.",
