 "awd_abstract_narration": "The opportunity to create design and manufacturing protocols for the            creation of engineered polymeric ultrathin film systems (PUFS) may              well rest on the development of sophisticated, in-situ diagnostics.             The Langmuir/Blodgett deposition technique offers the possibility of            providing the foundation for the application of organics to important           emerging fields, such as optical computing, electronics, and                    biotechnology.  These applications depend on precise control of                 materials properties such as positional and orientational order of              active moieties, alternation of layers, and thickness.                                                                                                          With the need to investigate mixtures and compounds of polymers being           deposited in order to create film systems possessing three-dimensional          order, it has become evident that methods need to be developed capable          of tracking the elastodynamic, hydrodynamic, and electrodynamic                 behavior of the monolayers as they are extracted from the air/water             interface.  It is proposed in this project to introduce laser beams at          the contact line, as well as at the upper and lower resting positions.          Second harmonic generation (SHG), which appears to be a very promising          probe, is used here to study the orientation of molecules on the                Langmuir layer, as well as to characterize the order of completed film          systems of optically highly nonlinear dyes.  By comparing the SHG from          the Langmuir layer with that obtained at the water contact line on the          substrate, and later at the upper resting (drying) position, the PI's           are able to measure reorientation of the dye moiety through                     polarization rotation, changes in area/molecule through amplitude               changes, and chemical degradation and drying by examining these same            effects on different molecules and substrates.  In this initial                 effort, the PI's plan to attempt to confirm that such measurements are          possible, and that dynamics are occurring during time scales                    which validate the need to pursue further study.  If such                       dynamical changes are evident, accurate monitoring may allow                    delicate adjustment of trough conditions for improved film                      quality.  These measurements will provide valuable information                  not presently available concerning the distinctions between the                 behavior of the early monolayers and that of subsequent layers.                 The optical return signal will aid in establishing the                          transitional history of the Langmuir layer as it is transformed                 into a specific deposited monolayer.                                                                                                                            If this work is successful, it will open the way to additional                  optical and infrared spectroscopies capable of detecting subtle                 changes in conformation and bonding in thin liquid films.",
