 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Willamette Science and Technology Center, a science museum                  located in the university town of Eugene, Oregon, proposes to                   design, construct and circulate a 1,000 square foot traveling                   mathematics and science exhibition, \"Kaleidoscopes:  Reflections                of Science and Art\" to 15 science museums over a three year                     period, reaching more than one million visitors.  The exhibition                will capitalize on popular interest in this 19th century optical                toy to provide engaging and stimulating examples of mathematics                 and physics principles revealed in the exquisite symmetries and                 surprising patterns of kaleidoscopic reflection.                                                                                                                Interactive exhibit modules will be combined with historic                      examples and the work of contemporary artists to appeal to a                    broad rang of ages and interests of visitors.  Consultants with                 extensive experience with mathematics and mathematics education                 will assist in the design of the exhibit units and in the                       preparation of educational materials that will accompany the                    exhibition.                                                                                                                                                     The Smithsonian Institution Travelling Exhibition Service                       (SITES), will manage the circulation and maintenance of the                     exhibition during its travels and will publish the related                      educational materials and make them available to host museums.                                                                                                  Project staff and consultant are highly qualified to carry out                  this project, which matches an increasing national interest in                  revitalizing mathematics education and a corresponding increased                emphasis on mathematics education at the National Science                       Foundation.  An award $71,310 for FY'87 is recommended.",
