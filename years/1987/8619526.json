 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow Professor Wayne L. Mattice, University of Akron,          to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Lawrence J. Porter,                  Chemistry Division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial               Research, located at Lower Hutt, New Zealand.  The conformational               properties of proanthocyanidin polymers, and the nature of their                complexes with other macromolecules is the focus of the research                investigation.  Proanthocyanidin polymers are widespread in plants and          are of particular interest because plants use them as a natural defense         mechanism.  These polymers are also of commercial interest as natural           adhesives.  The polymer samples will be provided by Dr. Porter, an              organic chemist with an extensive background in working with                    proanthocyanidins as natural products.  Dr. Mattice, a physical                 chemist, will perform circular dichroism and flourescence measurements,         molecular mechanics calculations, and statistical mechanical treatments         of the samples and complexes.                                                                                                                                   This research project fulfills an objective of the U.S.-New Zealand             Cooperative Science Program by bringing together the expertise of               respected physical and organic chemists to conduct investigations that          will be of mutual benefit.  The New Zealand scientist provides the              expertise on sample synthesis, isolation, purification and handling.            The American PI has the expertise in theoretical characterization and           facilities in his laboratory for the spectroscopic analysis and                 computational support.  The NSF Program Director in Materials Research          for the Polymers Program has recommended funding of the bilateral               exchange.  The selection committee in New Zealand has recommended this          project as a high priority mentioning the truly cooperative nature of           the program.",
