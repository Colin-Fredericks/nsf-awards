 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Garland will apply experimental methods, refined in his                     laboratory, to study in formation and behavior of structural                    glasses and the commensurate phases, important research areas in                low temperature physics and chemistry.  Ultrasonic measurements                 provide an excellent method to enhance the basic understanding of               these challenging problems by providing an important tool for                   characterizing the glass \"freezing\" temperature and for                         monitoring prefreezing dynamics in the megahertz frequency range.               In addition, these experimental measurements provide the data                   essential to testing modern theories of critical dynamics in pure               fluids and to point the directions for the development of new                   theory.                                                                         Ultrasonic studies are also advantageous since both the static                  and dynamic response of a system can be determined from                         simultaneous measurements of velocity and attenuation of acoustic               waves as a function of frequency.  Such measurements will be made               as a function of temperature and composition in 1) alkali cyanide               structural glasses, 2) dipolar ferro/antiferroelectric structural               glasses, and 3) crystals exhibiting incommensurate phases.",
