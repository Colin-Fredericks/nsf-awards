 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an indepth study of the atomic geometry and electronic                  structure of several low and high index gallium arsenide surfaces               prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).   The use of MBE-grown                surfaces with in-situ probing of structure, composition, and band               bending will enhance the work on surface reconstruction                         mechanisms and surface unstabilities, encountered with some high-               index surfaces.  The investigation of Schottky barriers formation               at low temperature (LT=70-100oK) will be continued.  The results                obtained on these interfaces where metal clustering, chemical                   reactions and interdiffusion are inhibited, are the first to                    suggest that several independent mechanisms, diversly affected                  by the temperature must be invoked to explain pinning on n- and                 p- type samples.  This work will be extended by studying                        interfaces formed at low temperature between gallium arsenide and               reactive transition metals.  This study will involve complete                   characterizations of low temperature interface morphology, atomic               geometry, rate of reaction, and Fermi level pinning.  A                         generalization of the results found during the past three years                 could be expected to have a substantial impact on current models                of Schottky barriers and be of importance to the microelectronic                industry.",
