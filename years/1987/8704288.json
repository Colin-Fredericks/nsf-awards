 "awd_abstract_narration": "The measurement of atomic momentum distributions can provide            detailed microscopic information on the single particle density                 matrix.  The quantum liquids, helium three and helium four,                     provide an interesting and technically easy system in which to                  study the momentum distribution.  They are an extreme example of                liquids where both quantum zero point motion and quantum                        statistics dominate the behavior.  The bulk liquids have been                   extensively studied theoretically.  Calculations have also been                 made for the mixed Boson-Fermion system of helium three-helium                  four.  Recently, the properties of liquid helium three and helium               four in confined geometries have received considerable attention.               The restricted geometries extend the liquid phase well into the                 region where the bulk solid is stable.  Surface solid layers play               an important role, especially in helium three where a ferromagnet               transition has been observed in the surface solid layer.                                Professor Sokol proposes to use high energy inelastic                   neutron scattering to study the properties of the momentum                      distribution in liquid helium four, helium three, helium three-                 helium four mixtures, and in restricted geometries.  Measurements               of the width of the momentum distribution will be used to study                 the local environment of the particles as a function of                         temperature and pressure.  For restricted geometries the momentum               distribution can be used to extract information on the molecules                bound to the surface as well.  Work will be carried out using                   existing spectrometers at Argonne National Laboratory and                       Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, in the United Kingdom, as well as               a newly constructed dedicated spectrometer at Argonne.",
