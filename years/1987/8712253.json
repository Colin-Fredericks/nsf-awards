 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Peacock will continue her research in the Ituri region of                   Zaire.  A long term multi-investigator study has focussed on two                groups: semi-nomadic Efe pygmies who subsist primarily by hunting               and gathering, and village-living Lese horticulturalists.  While                people such as the Efe are normally expected to have low                        fertility levels - and this in fact is the case - most often                    settled horticulturalists are characterized by just the opposite.               Prior work however has shown that the Lese fertility is low. The                goal of the research is to discover why this is so.                                                                                                             Dr. Peacock will continue longitudinal monitoring of variation of               gonadal function among both groups.  She hypothesizes that high                 work loads among women contribute to disruption of ovarian                      function.  She will monitor ovarian function through the measure                of reproductive hormones in saliva and urine.  Work load will be                assessed through quantitative observations of individual                        behavior.  Estimation of active infection with sexually                         transmitted diseases will be determined through gynecological                   exams.  A pilot study of male gonadal function will also be                     initiated.                                                                                                                                                      Population in Africa is expanding rapidly and this defeats                      efforts to raise the standard of living through development.  The               population explosion is one of the most serious problems facing                 third world countries.  Dr. Peacock's project may provide insight               into natural factors which limit population growth.",
