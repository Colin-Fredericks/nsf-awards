 "awd_abstract_narration": "The upper atmosphere in the polar cap region glows in                      complex patterns as a result of collisions of precipitating                     electrons with molecules of air, and as light is emitted by                     recombining ionospheric plasma.  The upper atmosphere is                        continually in motion, being driven by heating and electric                     fields as energy comes in via the magnetosphere from its                        interaction with the supersonic solar wind.  The motions are                    being studied by use of  modern versions of all sky cameras, that               electronically record images of the whole observable sky in                     specific wavelengths.  Sets of such images are then analyzed by                 using newly developed techniques of computerized image motion                   analysis to derive the velocities of auroral and airglow forms.                 Systematic observation and analysis of these velocities will have               far reaching implications in the understanding of ionosphere-                   magnetosphere coupling.  The principal investigator and his                     associates are leaders in the field of imaging atmospheric                      emissions from space and from the ground.  The observations from                Sondre-Stromfjord, Greenland, will be analyzed in conjunction                   with ongoing radar and spectrographic measurements.",
