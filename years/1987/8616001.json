 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interleukin 2 (IL2) is a glycoprotein hormone that is                      synthesized and secreted by antigen.activated T lymphocytes.                    Activation of T cells also results in the expression of high                    affinity IL2 receptors on the cell surface.  Subsequent binding                 of IL2 drives the unrestricted progression of activated (G1                     phase) T cells through the replicative phases of the cell cycle                 (S, G2, and M).  The molecular mechanism(s) by which IL2                        regulates T cell cycle progression is largely undefined.  The                   overall objective of this research is to compare IL2 dependent                  signal transduction in two homogeneous subpopulations of murine T               cells, L3T4 positive, and Lyt2 positive T cells.  This comparison               will permit a distinction to be drawn between the molecular                     events involved in the common mitogenic pathway and events that                 may reflect subset.specific pleiotropic actions of IL2.   The                   immediate goals of this research are,  (1) to examine the effect                of IL2 on phosphoinositide turnover, calcium mobilization, and                  protein kinase C activation in activated L3T4 positive and Lyt2                 positive T cells, (2) to characterize the early effects of IL2 on               second messenger activated protein kinases and, (3) to determine                whether IL2 stimulation specifically and differentially increases               the expression of specific genes in G1.phase L3T4 positive and                  Lyt2 positive T cells.                                                               These studies will define the early molecular events                       involved in the transmission of the IL2 mitogenic signal in two                 well defined T cell subsets.  The results will help to clarify                  the roles of these signal transmission pathways in the coupling                 between membrane IL2 receptors and the responses in the cell                    nuclei that culminate in T cell proliferation.",
