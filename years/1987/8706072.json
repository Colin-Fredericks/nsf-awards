 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to attack the thorny problem of analyzing              data that comes from measurements made, or observed, repeatedly                 but not regularly over time.  A novel approach using successive                 differences is proposed as the basis for analysis assuming piece-               wise linearity in the interval of varying lengths.  The question                to be studied is how to decide where to subdivide the time                      interval.                                                                               The traditional methods for analyzing data which is                     collected repeatedly over time were developed to answer questions               posed by the financial community.  Financial data is not missing                and can be collected at regular fixed time intervals.  Because of               the structure available in the data driving the early                           developments in this subfield, the assumptions of a fixed and                   rigid data structure is built into these analytic approaches.  In               many fields of research, however, data cannot be collected                      according to a fixed time schedule as can be done when measuring                dollars and cents.  Radically new methods of analysis are needed                to obtain valid tools for such data, in as much as conclusions                  are being drawn and decisions based on results from very ad hoc                 analytical procedures.  This research aims to work toward a                     statistical theory that will be valid for this general framework                of scientific investigation.",
