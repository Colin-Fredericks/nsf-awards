 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a recommendation for an award to support research on the                feasibility of improving the dewatering of sludges derived from                 treatment of wastewater by the use of enzymes.  This work could provide         an alternative for sludge dewatering with substantial savings of energy         and cost.  The work will focus initially on obtaining sludge microbes           which over-produce polysaccharide slimes, followed by isolating other           microbes capable of degrading polysaccharides present in the sludge.            Factors influencing rapid, effective, and adequate polysaccharide               degradation will be identified and verified by addition of slime-               degrading microbial cultures, their bacteriophages, and extracted               depolymerase enzymes to model systems of slime-containing sludges.                                                                                              The proposal leading to this recommendation was submitted in accord with        NSF 86-I9, Small Business Innovation Research.  This proposed work has          objectives consistent with those of the Program in Environmental                Engineering and the investigators have qualifications appropriate for           the work to be done.                                                                                                                                            Award is recommended in the amount of $39,580 for six months starting on        February 1, 1987.  This will be for Phase I as described in NSF 86-19.",
