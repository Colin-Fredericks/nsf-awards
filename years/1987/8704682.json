 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the behavior of finished goods inventories                both from a theoretical, as well as from an empirical perspective.  The         purpose of this research is to account for the importance of inventory          movements in the overall economy and also in specific sectors of the            economy.  The research is based on an inventory model in which the              primary source of uncertainty for producers is the fluctuation in               demand for their products.  In the model inventories arise because of           the need to produce goods in advance of sales, and because of the need          to hold some positive level of inventories.  This research is important         because it will provide a better understanding of inventory and                 output fluctuations of the firm.                                                                                                                                The theoretical part of this project will extend the results of                 the inventory model to a general equilibrium setting  that would                allow for varying cost structures, intertemporal substitution on the            part of consumers, different source and types of shocks to the economy,         and the transmission of shocks across sectors of the economy.  The              empirical work involves testing different versions of the model on              inventory, production, and sales data from the U.S. automobile                  industry, under the assumption of rational expectations.  The work will         test the implications of the motive to avoid running out of inventories         including the basic prediction that beginning inventory stocks are              based on efficient forecasts of demand.  The model is also useful for           identifying the effects of interest rates and other factor prices on            inventory investment.",
