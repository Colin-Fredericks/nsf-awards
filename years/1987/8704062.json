 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student populations.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  Texas Southern                    University will use RIMI support to study coal catalysis and coal               derived products.  The work will involve the prepartion and                     characterization of transition metal complexes.  In addition,                   considerable work will focus on coal liquefaction and the nature,               structure, and composition of various catalytic species.  The                   proposers will correlate the molecular weight and molecular structure           of the metal complexes with catalytic activity and product                      selectivity.                                                                                                                                                    Texas Southern is an urban university that is located in an area where          many of its minority constitutents live.  The principal investigator            is a minority chemist who is an expert in polypyrasoyborate  ligand             systems.  He has published widely in refereed journals and has done             coal research in the academic and industrial sectors.  The Foundation           has supported this project because it will provide opportunities for            minorities to increase their participation in meritorious research.",
