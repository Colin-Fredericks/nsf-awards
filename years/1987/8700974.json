 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually all polymeric membranes are more permeable to                    oxygen than to nitrogen.  In current commercial membranes the                   ratio of oxygen-to-nitrogen permeabilities is between 2 and 5.                  With these low selectivities, the highest-purity oxygen-                        enriched air obtainable in a single membrane stage is about                     50%--and more typically, membrane processes make 30% to 35%                     oxygen.  This research addresses the development of a new type                  of membrane that should exhibit an oxygen-over-nitrogen                         selectivity of up to 200, leading to a membrane process that                    can produce oxygen at a purity as high as 98% in a single                       stage.  Furthermore, preliminary calculations show that for a                   10-ton-per-day plant, the membrane process should produce                       oxygen at a cost of $15 to $25/ton, compared with a cost of                     about $90/ton for merchant oxygen and $120/ton for oxygen                       produced via pressure-swing adsorption.  During Phase I                         research a novel polymer was synthesized that had a selectivity                 toward sorption of oxygen over nitrogen of about 100.  During                   this Phase II research, membranes will be developed that                        consist of extremely thin films of similar, highly selective                    polymers.  Efforts will be directed toward obtaining high rates                 of oxygen transfer through these selective polymer films.                            The need for an inexpensive method of producing high                       purity oxygen has been recognized for many years.  The standard                 method for producing pure oxygen is by distillation of air at                   very low temperatures.  However, this technology is old, and                    improvements in the economics or the efficiency of the process                  seem unlikely.  In contrast, a process based on membranes seem                  promising, particularly for small scale production of oxygen.                   This research seeks to develop a novel method to produce a                      specially coated membrane for the above purpose.",
