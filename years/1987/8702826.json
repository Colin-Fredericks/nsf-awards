 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, statistical data and inference have played                an important role in establishing the basic facts used for public               policymaking in a variety of areas, such as estimating the                      unemployment rate, determining the risk of cancer from                          occupational exposure to toxic chemicals, and the evaluation of                 the accuracy of screening tests for AIDS antibodies or for drug                 use.  In the legal area, statistical methods are used to examine                hiring and promotion data for evidence of discrimination, and                   also to appraise the fairness of tax assessments.                                    Indeed, methods originally developed for the analysis of                   medical data have been used to analyze hiring and promotion                     information -- and the principal investigators of the current                   project have been active in researching problems arising in this                area as well as some of those indicated in the paragraph above.                      In particular, motivated by the AIDS crisis, the                           investigators will use funds to be provided under the recommended               award to pursue further research into estimators of the                         prevalence of a disease and the predictive value of screening                   tests in populations with low prevalence (less than one in one                  hundred).  They plan to adapt confidentiality techniques                        originally designed for economic data to suggest procedures for                 obtaining a reliable estimate of AIDS prevalence while still                    preserving the anonymity of the individuals tested.                                  Under the recommended award the investigators also plan to                 adapt methods used to evaluate medical screening tests to                       evaluate an apparent response bias in the Census Bureau's major                 unemployment survey, and to study other measurement problems                    requiring the development of statistical procedures which produce               valid results even when all the usual assumptions are not                       satisfied by the data.  The research is expected to  make                       contributions to statistical theory in addition to its timeliness               in proferring applications to recently recognized problems that                 are certain to be with us for some years to come.",
