 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students bring many misconceptions to high school science               classes.  This project will focus on misconception within                       physics, specifically mechanics, and on how the use of computers                can help correct many of these faulty views.  In particular, the                project will develop a series of software modules using unique                  characteristics of computers, such as their interactive,                        adaptive, and graphic capabilites, to address previously                        documented misconceptions.                                                              The project's modules will be based on a generative model of            student learning and will contain computer activities, such as                  real-time data collection, simulations, and problem solving                     exercises, for both students and teachers.  The software for the                modules will be programmed to work with commercially available                  laboratory interfacing equipment.                                                       Activities are divided into five phases: (1) the design of              modules and development of prototypes; (2) the review and                       revision of the modules; (3) evaluation of materials in high                    school physics and university science education classes; (4)                    revisions based on evaluations; and (5) dissemination through                   regional and national workshops, teacher development programs,                  and COMDUIT's national channels.                                                        Attempts are being made to overcome student misconceptions              which have been identified through research in teaching and                     learning.  This project will continue this important work, using                the approach of instruction through the use of the microcomputer                and appropriate software.  It will increase the knowledge base on               effective ways for more successful learning of physics.",
