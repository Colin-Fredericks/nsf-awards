 "awd_abstract_narration": "On February 9-10, 1987, an advisory panel met at NSF to represent               the views of the scientific community on issues arising from                    graphics, image processing, and workstations.  The panel                        consisted of representative, prominent scientists who build or                  use sophisticated visualization tools in the conduct of their                   research.  As a result of that meeting, the panel now wants to                  generate a report defining the field of visualization and                       detailing its uses in the discipline sciences (e.g. biology,                    physics, economics).  The proposal seeks to support the                         generation of that report.  The report will consist of two                      pieces: a written report and a videotape.  The report will define               the field of Visualization in Scientific Computing, its domain,                 personnel, and key canonical problems.  The body of the report                  will be written by researchers from certain discipline sciences                 that need advances in the underlying sciences of visualization.                 The videotape will present exemplary computer-generated graphics                of scientific simulations.                                                                                                                                      The report brings together a sampling of hard scientific problems               that await advances in visualization in scientific computing,                   from NSF-supported researchers and other agencies of government;                and , it suggest some programs, policies, and technologies to                   meet those needs.  The investigators hope to change the way that                science gets done on advanced scientific computers, with                        implications for scientific productivity and national                           competitiveness",
