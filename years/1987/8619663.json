 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theme of this project at the University of Washington is parallel           computing.  The award will aid in providing equipment, maintenance and          support staff to enhance the existing experimental computer research            facility in order to coordinate and stimulate work in the area of               parallel computing.  The                                                        Department has groups with recognized strengths in six distinct areas           of computer science: computer architecture, performance analysis, image         analysis and graphics, programming environments, computer systems and           theory of computation.  In each of these groups, significant research           will be undertaken that would not be possible without the                       Infrastructure support.  The work will                                          utilize a shared-memory multiprocessor, a networked multiprocessor and          a number of workstations to be acquired under the grant as well as              other pieces of equipment acquired from both industrial sources and             from previous NSF grants.  In addition to providing facilities to allow         extensions of the previous contributions in each of the areas noted             above, it is expected that major steps forward will be made in the              overall understanding and effective use of parallel computing.",
