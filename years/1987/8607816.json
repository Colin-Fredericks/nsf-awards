 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on the synthesis of controllers for a class of         nonlinear systems subject to randomly varying disturbances of large             amplitude.  The particular class of problems to be considered is that           where the plant has a finite number of nominal operating points and             makes infrequent transitions between these points.  The goal of the             work is to generalize existing analytical procedures so that more               realistic constraints can be included in the system model without               creating computationally intractable design equations.  Of particular           interest is the inclusion of sensor noise and the weakening of the              Markov hypothesis on the primary exogenous disturbance by replacing it          with a renewal process structure.  It is expected that by extending the         class of permissible plant models, it will be possible to improve the           initial design thus avoiding ad hoc modifications in later stages of            the synthesis process.",
