 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the project is to design, implement, evaluate, and               disseminate a mathematics curriculum sequence for middle school                 students expressly designed to introduce them to the notions and arts           of mathematical thinking and to develop foundational skills of                  mathematical inquiry.  This will be accomplished partly through a               laboratory presentation centered on mathematical design activities              that span a rich variety of compelling projects, and partly through             the use of intelligent tools designed to support and guide                      constructive exploration and design tasks.  The sequence will comprise          modules in the areas of algebra, elementary functional analysis, and            mathematical modeling.  The mathematical content will be developed to           support the needs and goals of the inquiry activities.  Three major             types of tools will be developed, corresponding to qualitatively                different ways of embedding intelligent support for open-ended inquiry          activities.  This work builds on a pilot project which led to the               development of prototypes of these tools and their successful                   classroom trial in  an introductory algebra course.  The goal of the            present project is to extend and deepen the approach and to establish           it as a national model for future mathematical curricula.",
