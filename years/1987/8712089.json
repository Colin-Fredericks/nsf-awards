 "awd_abstract_narration": "The science of electrified fluids, known as Plasma Physics, has                 expanded its influence to many fields outside of controlled fusion, the         field for which the science was developed.  This proposal supports              experiments intended by the PI's to demonstrate the viability of a new          field of research and instruction in Electrical Engineering which they          have named Applied Electrodynamics.  Applied Electrodynamics concerns           the interaction of charged particles with electromagnetic fields and            thus includes, besides fusion, such topics as generation of coherent            radiation, particle acceleration, plasma diagnostics, industrial                plasmas, relativistic matter, and certain applications to space                 physics and condensed matter physics.  To demonstrate these                     applications, the PI's propose to carry out experiments to test the             feasibility of several new ideas: the Beat Wave Accelerator, which can          possibly shorten high-energy of existing accelerators by a factor 10;           and the Electric Wiggler FEL, which could produce tunable high-                 frequency radiation.  The development of high-density plasma sources            is common to all these and is a problem requiring NSF support.  Ideas           for applications to solid-state and short-pulse laser research areas            will also be explored.",
