These activities                    include a 2-hour workshop on \"Why Graduate School\" at their                     Spring Leadership Training Conference, a booth on the same                      subject to provide information to the students attending                        their national conference, and a graduate scholarship                           program.  This program will provide AISES/NSF Graduate                          Scholars Challenge awards of $2,000 each to 10 students                         selected by the AISES Scholarship Committee.  Each of the                       students will be assigned an AISES mentor who will provide                      guidance and encouragement.                                                             The drop-out rates of Native Americans are extremely high               at all points along the educational pipeline and very few                       secure graduate degrees.  This project, while modest in                         scale, will be highly visible in the Native American                            Communigy and will help to bring more students into the                         pipeline leading to careers in science and engineering.",
