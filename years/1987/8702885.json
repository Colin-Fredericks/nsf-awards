 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is a continuation of experiments on                       mechanisms of temperature acclimation in freshwater fishes. It                  has been previously established that fish compensate for shifts                 to cold or warm temperature by changes in metabolism. Recently                  the applicant discovered that cultured liver cells can show                     compensatory changes in activities of enzymes but that these                    isolated liver cells fail to show the changes in capacity for                   protein synthesis that we have observed in vivo. The applicant                  proposes to test a variety of hormones for their effects on                     tissue cultures of fish liver cells. Previously, results indicate               the region of the brain (preoptic hypothalamus) controlling                     behavioral temperature regulation in fish is the same region that               integrates regulation in mammals. He hypothesizes that this same                region of the brain senses temperature and triggers, probably via               hormones, the compensatory changes in tissue metabolism. Two                    approaches are to be used. Lesions to the preoptic hypothalamus                 will be made under anesthesia and the fish allowed to recover.                  Preliminary evidence indicates that lesioned fish do not show the               biochemical acclimation shown by the controls. He has previously                recorded electrical activity in the hypothalamus and found                      temperature sensitive neurons. He plans to continue such                        recordings over longer times in an effort to learn the changes                  that occur when a fish adapts to an altered temperature.                                                                                                        The proposed research has general significance with respect to                  adaptation of animals to environmental stress and concerning the                temperature center in the brain.",
