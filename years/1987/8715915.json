All                     necessary steps connected with collecting, processing, and                      analyzing data will be handled by the contractor with approval                  from the National Science Foundation (NSF).  This contract will                 use a panel designed to provide nationally representative data by               major industry groups.                                                               NSF is required by law to provide a central clearinghouse                  for the collection, interpretation, and analysis of data on                     scientific and engineering resources and to provide a source of                 information for policy formulation by other agencies of the                     Federal Government.  NSF sponsors the conduct of this survey to                 meet the needs of policymakers for understanding current labor                  market conditions (such as scientific and technical subfields in                short supply).",
