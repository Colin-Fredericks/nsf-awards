 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Wilson and coinvestigator Neilsen will analyze soil           and crop yield information to develop an improved version of the soil           productivity index developed by Larson and associates at the University         of Minnesota.  The index will also be modified so it can be applied to          cereal grain crops.  The investigators will use data on Montana's               climates, soils, and cropping systems to further modify the index so            that it can be used to compare productivity index values across                 geographic regions.  They will test the accuracy of the resulting model         in two small drainage basins for which they will obtain detailed erosion        and productivity measurements.                                                          Relationships between soil erosion and productivity are                 complicated. They are of worldwide concern because of the great losses          of productivity that can result from severe erosion.  Developing a              productivity index that could be applied across regions would be of             considerable theoretical interest.  Such an index would also be helpful         in developing policies and programs to reduce erosion associated with           cropping.",
