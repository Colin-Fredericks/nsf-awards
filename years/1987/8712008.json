 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal by Dr. Jonathan Roughgarden of Stanford University                is to conduct a workshop/seminar on theoretical aspects of field                ecology.  This section of ecological research brings the more                   exact but simpler science of mathematics to bear on ecological                  problems.  The ecological community has experienced for some                    years now the elegant, though sometimes incredible revelations of               this approach.  This approaches proponents, though                              highly enamored of their contributions, do not enjoy the                        credulity they feel is their due from the ecological community.                 Their clamant is recognized and there is much to be gained by                   conjoining mathematics with ecology, especially if the former                   provides succint formulations that clearly and truly embody the                 biological principles involved.  This requires clearer                          understandings between mathematical/theoretical ecologists and                  empericist/theoretical ecologists.  To this end, a workshop                     involving the two groups is necessary and long overdue.  The                    field of ecology will be served in many of its facets, including                computer simulation of ecology, population and ecosystem ecology.                                                                                               Dr. Roughgarden and his colleages at Stanford have reputations in               this area and Stanford is equipped to support this workshop.  The               Program recommends funding.",
