 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of a structure for earthquake resistance includes                    consideration of the interaction between gravity loads and lateral              displacements.  This interaction, known as the P-Delta effect, refers to        a tendency for unidirectional yielding of the structure, which can lead         to dynamic instability and collapse of the structure.  A methodology to         consider P-Delta effects in the design of seismic resistant structures          is lacking.                                                                                                                                                     The objective of this research is to develop such a methodology to              consider the P-Delta effect and dynamic instability.  The approach is           based on the definition of the inelastic spectrum.  The premise is that         P-Delta effects can be included through spectrum modification, in a way         that is similar to the methods used to incorporate the effects of               ductility and damping.",
