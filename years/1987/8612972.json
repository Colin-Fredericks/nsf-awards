 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a recommendation for an award to support research on the source         of compounds containing tin in the aquatic environment and their                transformations and fate when subjected to environmental forces.  The           use of compounds containing tin in formulations of anti-fouling paints          is increasing rapidly.  The objective of this research is to study the          accumulation and decomposition of tin compounds by bacteria that are            resistant to its toxic effects and to determine effects of processes            that involve tin compounds on algae, pore water/sediments and shellfish.                                                                                        This proposal has objectives consistent with those of the Environmental         Engineering Program.  The investigator's qualifications are consistent          with the nature of this work to be conducted.  This is a renewal of             research previously conducted under NSF Grant No. CEE-8116960 under             which the investigator developed analytical techniques and model systems        for the topic on which he now proposes to concentrate his effort, viz.          on the environmental \"compartments\" through which tin can move.                                                                                                 Award is recommended as a 36-month continuing Grant, the initial                increment of which is in the amount of $72,224 for 12 months starting on        December 15, 1986.",
