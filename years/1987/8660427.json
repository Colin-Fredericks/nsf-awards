 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will investigate an innovative approach to make the          arc  amperage less dependent on wire feed speed plus a unique dual              shield torch  design which has application to gas metal arc welding and         flux cored arc  welding.  The innovative approach is to use two power           sources on one weld  wire, one for preheating the wire and the other for        providing the welding  arc.  The significance of this approach is that          the weld deposition rate  will be less dependent on the arc current as a        result of the wire  preheating by the second power source.  The second          part of the innovative  approach is to use dual flow gas shielding of           the arc area, instead of the  conventional one shielding gas.  This             permits different gas types to be  directed to the appropriate region to        be most effective.  The research plan is to construct the experimental          equipment and investigate how much the  heat input, deposition rate and         travel speed can be varied while still  maintaining good weld                   characteristics.  Carbon steel solid and tubular wire will be studied.          This Phase I will confirm the feasibility of this  approach and                 determine the operational envelop of the process parameters  for carbon         steel welding.  A follow-on Phase II is planned to investigate  the             effect of this process on the material properties and expand the                studies to other material types, such as low alloy steel, stainless             steel  and aluminum.  If successful, plans are to pursue funds to               commercialize  this approach.                                                        This innovative research, if successful, has the potential to              increase productivity of carbon steel welding and improve welded                properties of heat  affected metals, such as low alloy steel and                stainless steel.",
