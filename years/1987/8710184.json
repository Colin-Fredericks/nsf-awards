 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oligodendrocytes play a supportive role for neurons within the                  central nervous system.  These cells appear to be sensitive to                  neurotoxic agents when challenged in vivo, showing abnormal                     changes in intracellular organelles-mitochondria, Golgi and                     endoplasmic reticulum-that play a significant role in normal                    metabolic functions of these cells.                                                                                                                             The substances of interest here are L-pyroglutamic acid, the                    internal amide of L-glutamic acid; and the the tripeptide                       thyrotrop in releasing hormone \u0131pGlu-His-Pro-NH2! (Rieke, et al.,               1984).  Although these agents appear to induce pathology in                     oligodendrocytes, it remains uncertain whether oligodendrocytes                 are destroyed by such agents.  Oligodendrocytes can be raised in                vitro in cultures where they are the principal cell present.                    Cultures will be exposed to the test substances for periods up to               20 days.  After exposure to the test substance the tissue will be               fixed and processed for electron microscopy.  It will be examined               to determine the test substance-induced pathology and whether                   oligodendrocytes can recover following exposure to these                        substances.                                                                                                                                                     These experiments will provide the preliminary data needed to                   pinpoint the intracellular site of activity of these agents and                 establish their use as probes for nerve cell activity in culture.",
