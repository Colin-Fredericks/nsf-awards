 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogenation, the addition of hydrogen to other atoms or                       molecules, is an extremely important chemical process. For                      example, hydrogenation is involved in the conversion of corn                    oil to margarine and in the utilization of coal for chemical                    synthesis, and will undoubtedly be involved also in future                      practical schemes for the utilization of solar energy. The                      focus of this research project is the synthesis of                              metal-hydrogen compounds of metals which can hydrogenate other                  compounds or catalyze hydrogenation reactions.                                                                                                                  This project involves the synthesis and investigation of the                    reactivity of compounds optimized for hydrogen transfer to                      reducible substrates such as CO, carbon dioxide and olefins.                    Such compounds contain two different metals, either two                         transition metals or a transition metal and a highly                            electropositive metal (Zn, Y, Sm ....), as well as numerous                     hydride ligands. Three different classes of synthetic                           procedures will be used for these heterometallic hydrides. In                   preliminary work the reduction of carbon dioxide by one                         heterobimetallic polyhydride has been observed. Since it can be                 argued that unpaired electron density should promote such                       hydrogenations from both a kinetic and a thermodynamic point of                 view, monomeric metallic polyhydrides with unpaired electrons                   will also be synthesized. Both monomeric and heterobimetallic                   polyhydrides will be characterized in terms of their dynamic                    processes ( e.g. by EPR spectroscopy ) and their chemical                       reactivity.",
