 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help establish a joint microbial engineering research           program between the Institute for Biological and Chemical Process               Analysis (IPA), at Montana State University, and the Research Institute         of Theoretical and Applied Physical Chemistry (INIFTA), La Plata,               Argentina.  Dr. William G. Characklis, Director of the IPA, will work           primarily with Dr. Hector A. Videla of the INIFTA to study microbial            corrosion although other scientists at both institutes will be involved         in the research as well.  Their objectives will be to develop methods           to characterize the biofilm-metal interface (microelectrodes), to               electrochemically monitor corrosion, and to observe biofilm population          dynamics.  Additionally, they will determine the significance of                biofilm patchiness, microbial product formation, surface roughness, and         surface welds and crevices on microbial corrosion processes.                                                                                                    Microbial corrosion poses a significant and costly challenge to U.S.            industry.  A number of industries support research at the IPA.  Thus            far, not enough is known about the topic and of how to ameliorate its           effects.  The cooperation between the IPA and the INIFTA is important           because it integrates their two areas of expertise and distinct                 methodologies for uncovering the mechanisms of microbial corrosion.             The IPA group is expert in biofilm process engineering and the INIFTA           has a long, successful history of working on electrochemical techniques         for determining microbial corrosion rates.  The cooperation will permit         the exchange of these methodologies to the benefit of both groups.",
