 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon State University is undertaking a 30-month project that                  addresses a need and requirement within biological and chemical                 oceanography to improve sea-going data gathering technologies that              describe the distribution of nutrients and organisms on space and time          scales that are better focused than presently available technology              permits.  Water sampling bottles, towed devices, and pumping systems            that are presently used to measure fine-scale distributions of                  nutrients and chlorophyll are too coarse to describe plankton                   distribution in terms of fine scale physical parameters.  The overall           plan is to develop a fiber-optic system to sense and measure                    chlorophyll fluorescence and mate it to the existing physical                   oceanographic instrumentation that measures microstructure and                  turbulence.                                                                                                                                                     The multidisciplinary project will develop a sea-going laser/fiber              optic system for making high-frequency, high spatial resolution                 (vertical and horizontal), in-situ biological and chemical                      measurements.  The following specific objectives have been identified:          1) develop an oceanographic application for remote fiber optic                  fluorescent technology; 2) obtain scientific data that demonstrates             the importance and applicability of this technology; 3) obtain                  coherence between biological and physical measurement scales in the             upper ocean; and 4) investigate potential methods for making in-situ            measurements of nutrient concentrations.                                                                                                                        Part of the development work is to be done by the Lawrence Livermore            National Laboratory on a sub-contract.  The Office of Naval Research            and the Biological Oceanography Program are also providing support.",
