 "awd_abstract_narration": "The antibiotics represent an extremely important class of                       biologically active molecules, some of which bear strong                        chemical and structural similarities to certain carbohydrates.                  This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  is directed toward utilizing them as cheap and efficient                        starting materials for certain classes of antibiotics such as                   the streptovaricins.                                                                                                                                            The general objective of this research program is to develop                    the efficient use of readily available carbohydrate derivatives                 in organic synthesis.  The testing ground is the ansa chain of                  streptovaricin A.  Two different approaches are described.  The                 first, in progress, involves a process known as pyranosidic                     homologation in which the sugar is elaborated into a bi- and                    thence a tri-pyranose, whose continuous carbon backbone                         /provides the required number of stereogenic centers.  The                      second approach is a convergent process, which plans to make                    use of a remarkable aldol condensation that has been uncovered                  in earlier work.  The substrate, a 3-keto pyranoside, is itself                 remarkable in that it shows no inclination toward beta                          elimination.  This unexpected stability is merely one of                        several idiosyncracies encountered in the course of these                       investigations, which reveal striking differences between                       carbohydrates and carbo-cycles that are not satisfactorily                      \"explained\" by current theories.  A substantial effort is                       therefore directed toward a systematic investigation of these                   idiosyncracies, employing a combination of theoretical and                      experimental methods, buttressed by appropriate                                 computer-assisted modelling techniques.",
