 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Associated Colleges of the Midwest, in conjunction with the                 Great Lakes Colleges Association, will sponsor a regional                       conference for mathematicians involved in the undergraduate                     mathematics curriculum from non-PhD granting institutions in the                upper Middle West, to be held on June 3 and 4, 1987.  The                       conference will have two primary goals:  (1) to provide a series                of presentations analyzing the ways in which undergraduate                      mathematics courses can more fully integrate instrumentation; and               (2) to inform participants who will develop laboratory-based                    mathematics courses about opportunities for assistance from the                 National Science Foundation's College Science Instrumentation                   Program.  A paper on curricular changes integrating                             instrumentation into undergraduate mathematics courses will come                out of the conference and will be distributed to participants and               more widely around the country. The model of this regional                      meeting may be used by NSF for other regional meetings with                     similar goals.",
