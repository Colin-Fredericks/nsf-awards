 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vast regions of the prehistoric American Southwest were                 characterized by complex village societies which produced                       predominantly plainware ceramics.  Archaeologists to date have                  considered these ceramics without decoration to be of little use                in dating sites or in testing models of prehistoric social                      organization.  The proposed research project will begin to remedy               this situation by developing a new method, Integrated Ceramic                   Analysis, which will be used to systematically test relationships               between sites using plainware ceramics.  This method will combine               typological atributes such as vessel form and decoration with                   compositional attributes such as the type of clay and temper.                           This research is experimental.  It will use ceramics from               four sites in the Payson area of central Arizona from the period                A.D. 1000.1200 to test the applicability of the method. Since                   plainwares are very common, an integrative approach has much                    potential.  If successful, it will be applicable to other sites                 in the Southwest and by extension to areas around the world.  It                could provide archaeology with a new research tool.",
