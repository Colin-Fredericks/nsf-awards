 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of language, perhaps two hundred thousand years ago, led          to our ability to think abstractly, invent logic, store and exchange            ideas and to create culture.  What language is, how it works and how it         distinguishes us from others is the subject of a four part public               television series produced by Equinox Films, Inc., New York, N.Y.                                                                                               To examine language, the series will be filmed in laboratories and              universities throughout the United States and on the streetcorners to           capture the everyday life and language of Americans.  Additionally,             parts of the film will be shot in Japan, a sophisticated culture with a         completely different language type from ours and in North Central               Australia and Papua, New Guinea, where two exotic languages of special          interest are spoken.                                                                                                                                            Language is so taken for granted that most of us do not question its            nature.  Most educated people are unaware even of the revolution that           took place in the study of language about 30 years ago.  The intriguing         interplay between language as a grammatical system and, conversely, as a        living changing part of human expression is a complicated and                   fascinating journey.                                                                                                                                            Exploring the development of language is a challenging project and one          that has been imaginatively conceived and developed.  The P.I. is highly        respected with a number of credits and awards in television production.         The co-P.I. is a noted linguist and scholar.   The list of linguistic           experts who are advisors to the project  represents some of the top             scholars in the field.  All reviewers were  extremely enthusiastic about        the series and recommended funding.  An award of $400,000 with $200,000         in FY'87 and $200,000 in FY'88 is recommended.",
