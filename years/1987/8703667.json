 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the SBIR Phase I research was to demonstrate and         validate time-domain numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations for             problems involving optical (laser) scattering and diffraction from              submicron objects and features on silicon substrates.  The intended             applications of this computational optics capability is to contaminant          monitoring, process monitoring, microlithography, and imaging problems,         as encountered in the integrated circuit (ILC) manufacturing process.                 These results indicate that there is no inherent limitation to            simulating rigorously, many, of the optical problems associated with IC         fabrication, inspection, and design.  This is particularly true with the        availability of supercomputers and modern numerical algorithms applied          to Maxwell's equations.  Certain limitations do exist, however,                 associated with size of the computational grid, very short or long              wavelengths, and fully three-dimensional problems.  These limitations           will be addressed in Phase II in the context of enhanced radiation              conditions and semi-analytic algorithms.                                                The PI has achieved a high level of success in the Phase I              effort, and there is every expection for further success in Phase II.           The Phase III letters of commitment are impressive.",
