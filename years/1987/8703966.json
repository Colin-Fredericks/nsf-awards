 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the evaluation of                         evaportranspiration over a region of the Amazon, the recent site of a           joint field experiment to measure sources, sinks, and transport of              several trace gases.  Special geostationary satellite observations of           the moisture distribution are available in addition to various                  meteorological observations (radiation, turbulent fluxes in the                 boundary layer) made at or near the earth's surface and in the forest           canopy.                                                                             The water budget - the source, sink, and transport of aggregate             water substance - has never been adequately measured in the wet                 tropics; a knowledge of the water budget - the most variable                    meteorological quantity after radiation and cloudiness - will                   contribute to a better description of atmospheric circulation,                  including the release of latent heat, the hydrological balance of the           Amazon River and the ecology of the vegetation.                                     The forest cover is itself a major source of water vapor and,               thus, if these trees are cut down and the land cleared, as in fact is           taking place in several tropical regions, the proposed research could           provide an informed analysis of some of the consequences,                       meteorological and otherwise.",
