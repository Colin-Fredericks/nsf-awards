The project will develop the mathematical bases where three                     concepts/issues will be integrated: a) the return period of the maximum         probable flood (PMF); b) the statistics of the extreme and the choice of        probability distribution function; and c) the conditional expected              damage as derived from the partitioned multiobjective risk method (PMRM)        that corresponds to low frequency/high impact events.                                                                                                           This work will increase and improve our understanding of the stochastic         processes associated with extreme natural events.  Five tasks will be           carried out, and they are: 1) develop a cogent and definite mathematical        relationship between the a-priori assumptions on the return period of           the PMF and their effects on dam safety problems; 2) expand findings to         the dynamics of the return period of PMF in general; 3) broaden the             relationship between PMRM and the statistics of extremes from certain           densities to a larger class of distributions; 4) link the concept of            conditional expectation of extreme events to the concept of return              period; and 5) integrate tasks 3 and 4, so as to create the envisioned          mathematical model.                                                                                                                                             An Expedited Award for Novel research is here recommended.",
