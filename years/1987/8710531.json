 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this Engineering Initiation Award research               project are to evaluate the performance of grinding of superalloys              and aerospace alloys with superabrasives, to quantify the surface               integrity of the ground components, to obtain limit charts for work-            burn, power and surface finish, and to obtain an off-line                       optimization strategy which would meet the surface integrity                    requirements dictated by work-burn, surface finish and machine tool             limitation in terms of power.  The plan is to conduct grinding                  experiments while measuring the grinding forces, spindle power,                 grinding wheel wear, surface roughness and depth of the heat                    affected zone, and to analyze and model the results.  Limit charts              will be developed for workpiece speed, wheel speed and feed rate by             keeping work-burn, power and surface finish as constraints.  Such               limit charts will be used in developing simple off-line optimization            strategies for maximizing the material removal rate by avoiding                 thermal damage and maintaining necessary surface finish.",
