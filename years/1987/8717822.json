TSU, part of the Historically Black Colleges and                  Universities community, considers that this must be done if it is               to enter the mainstream in terms of the educational and research                services it intends to deliver.                                                      TSU's Department of Computing and Applied Sciences plans to                install an advanced architecture parallel super-minicomputer to                 support its research and graduate program initiatives in three                  areas: 1) software engineering, 2) computational sciences, and 3)               the joint area of the application of software engineering                       techniques and principles to computational sciences.                                 This grant provides partial support for TSU's thrust.  The                 funding will be used for installation and administration of the                 new machine, and to begin investigation of the effort required to               transport existing sequential algorithms to the new parallel                    architecture.  Further effort funded by other sources will                      follow.",
