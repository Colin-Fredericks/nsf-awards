Research documents are duplicated, then shipped directly to            KACST.  This proposal requests additional funding to continue the use           of the service without interruption.                                                                                                                            JUSTIFICATION:  The Photocopy Service of the British Library will               locate, then appropriately copy, research documents and forward them to         KACST upon request.  KACST is using this service for researchers who            request certain citations from the KACST Library or by way of their             Online Search Service in the Kingdom.  Investigators at the                     Universities in Riyah, Jidda, and other locations then have access to           articles, treatises, monographs, etc. just as researchers do in more            populous areas, an obvious benefit to scientific research in the                Kingdom.  Participation of NSF in U. S. Commission activities is                grounded in the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. 2357).  All KACST             activities are funded by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through the                U.S./Saudi Arabian Joint Commission.  No. U.S. appropriated funds are           used.",
