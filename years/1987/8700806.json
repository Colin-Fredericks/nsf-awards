 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the construction of a new seismic               sound source that, for the first time, will allow precise                       measurements to be made of the structure of the uppermost                       igneous crust in the deep ocean at scales of 10-100 meters.                     The optimal way to carry out such an experiment is to place all                 of the equipment on the seafloor.  Although ocean-bottom                        seismometers have existed for a number of years, there has been                 no ability to generate acoustic energy in deep-sea environment.                         The towed, high-power, low frequency seismic source to be               developed will allow researchers to tackle problems on a scale,                 and with a precision, that has previously been unapproachable.                  As many as 35 explosive charges can be detonated in one                         lowering of the instrument package, allowing long profiles of                   sea-flow features such as hydrothermal vent fields, axial                       volcanoes and basalt flows.  A prototype system has been                        developed and used previously.  The present award will allow                    construction of a final system.",
