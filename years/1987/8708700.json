 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project constitutive equations and processing maps using a              dynamic modeling approach will be developed for metal forming                   processes.  Inconel Alloy 718 will be used as the work material.                This alloy is selected because of its extensive application in areas            requiring high strength, corrosion resistance and weldability in aged           condition.  A computer program will be used to calculate an array of            values, giving the desired ram position as a function of time for               particular combinations of strain rate and specimen height.                     Effective stress and effective strain-rate values will be extracted             at various strain levels and test temperatures from flow curves;                constitutive equations will be derived therefrom.  Processing maps              will be developed to describe the intrinsic workability of each                 material and to evaluate the dissipative/metallurgical processes                occurring during hot deformation in the stable and unstable regions,            and to identify in the stable region the optimum temperature and                strain-rate range for processing the materials.  This research is               important in the area of metal forming and has immediate potential              applications.",
