 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the area of Animal Physiology, fundamental research tools are a              computer-recorder system and a storage oscilloscope for monitoring              physiological functions and changes.  In Animal Behavior and Ornithology        a storage oscilloscope has become the standard tool for displaying and          analyzing an array of animal vocalizations.  In both areas there are            many experiments that help to elucidate important concepts that cannot          be done without these instruments.  The purchases made possible through         this grant are enlarging this Department's capacity to train                    undergraduates in these areas.                                                                                                                                  The importance of these additions stems from the fact that, over recent         years, research in Physiology and Animal Behavior has become                    increasingly dependent on high-technology equipment.  As usage of this          type of equipment has become a matter of course in research                     laboratories, it has become essential for instructional purposes as             well.  Students must be introduced to equipment that is used routinely          to gather data if they are to become familiar with and eventually to            evaluate concepts developed as a result of that experimentation.                Likewise, their potential as research scientists is enhanced by a               working familiarity with the methodologies that are used widely in              current research.",
