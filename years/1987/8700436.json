 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is concerned with the effects of the              vibrational excitation of molecules on the chemical reactions                   taking place in the thermosphere and ionosphere of the earth.                   The energy retained in vibrational excitation from previous                     reactions affects the subsequent chemical reaction rates of the                 molecules; the spectrum of airglow and auroral emissions; and the               kinetic energy of the reaction products.  Sufficient energy in                  reaction products will produce hot atom coronas around the earth                and enhanced rates of escape from the top of the atmosphere.  The               numerical modelling of model atmospheres is to include basic data               on the vibration of molecules, together with data from ground                   based instruments, rockets, satellites and spacecraft.  The                     result of this research will advance our understanding of                       physical processes in the upper atmosphere, and our ability to                  use airglow and auroral measurements as a diagnostic on them.                   The PI is a young woman with considerable promise who has already               demonstrated competence and productivity in this field.",
