The purpose of bringing the PYI's to the meeting                 is three-fold.  The first and foremost objective will be to                     allow the PYI's for 1987 in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering                  to meet with the upper research management of the 38 member                     companies of the CCR.  Hopefully this will give the PYI's an                    opportunity to interact with and to develop working                             arrangements with the individuals from industry who have the                    ability to fund the matching portion of the PYI funding                         program.  The second goal will be to have a one-hour workshop,                  conducted by Dr. Theodore Tabor of the Dow Chemical Company,                    devoted specifically to the PYI's with a discussion on \"How to                  obtain matching funds\".  A third aspect is to provide the PYI's                 with an opportunity to meet each other and, hopefully, to                       develop interactions with one another which will last                           throughout their lives.",
