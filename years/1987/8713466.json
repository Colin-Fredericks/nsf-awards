 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to a Project Solicitation, MPC Corporation,                         representing the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC),                        submitted a proposal to conduct a Supercomputer Summer Institute                in 1987.  This proposal and eight others were evaluated by a                    review panel.                                                                                                                                                   MPC proposes a two week Institute for 20 young researchers from                 July 20 to 31.  Students will be reimbursed for travel and living               expenses during their stay.  In addition to training on the use                 of the PSC facilities (Cray XMP-48 supercomputer and supporting                 equipment), students will be exposed to presentations on advanced               graphics, parallel programing, networking and a special emphasis                on the use of a particular numerical technique, partial                         differential equations, used in the solution of fluid transport                 problems common to a variety of scientific disciplines.                                                                                                         The review panel found this to be a reasonable, but not exciting,               proposal with a high probability of success.  The lecturers are                 for the most part drawn from local institutions and from within                 the PSC itself.  The course has been taught in an abbreviated                   form before; most of the difficulties will have been worked out.                Because of the modest goals, the cost of this Institute is very                 reasonable, with most costs centered around support for                         participants.  MPC has asked for supplement of $4,919 beyond the                initial proposal, to partially support the acquisition of                       additional workstations to be used during the Institute and to                  remain in use at the PSC for future training and visitor                        programs.  This request seems modest and sensible.  In addition,                an undergraduate component of $2912 has been identified.                                                                                                        The Centers Program recommends support of a Summer Institute at                 the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in the amount of $43,976.",
