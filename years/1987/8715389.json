 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of parallel computers for solving partial differential          equations is important in areas such as fluid dynamics, transonic               flow, reservoir simulation, weather prediction and structural                   analysis, where many of the problems of interest can not be solved              without the use of supercomputers.  One technique for applying                  parallel computers to the solution of these problems is known as                domain decomposition where the domain of interest is subdivided into            several smaller subdomains and the task of solving the partial                  differential equation on each subdomain problem is assigned to a                different processor.  The global solution is then pieced together from          the solutions computed on the individual subdomains.  Much of the               current work in the application of domain decomposition techniques has          been in the area of elliptic partial differential equations with very           little attention being given to hyperbolic equations.  The                      investigator proposes to use the methods of domain decomposition for            the solution of linear hyperbolic equations.  The idea of using                 overlapping domains is introduced in the context of linear hyperbolic           equations to develop a domain decomposition algorithm which is shown            to be well suited for parallel processors.  The questions of                    communication costs and load balancing is presented.  The investigator          also propose to implement parallel algorithms usong domain                      decomposition techniques in an existing distributed computing                   environment.                                                                            Domain decomposition algorithm are important for the areas of           applications mentioned above.",
