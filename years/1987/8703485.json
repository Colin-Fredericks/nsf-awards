 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research by Prof. W. Bentrude, which aims at elucidating               mechanisms in chemical reactions of organophosphorus systems with               free radicals as reaction intermediates.  This work is important                for two reasons:  (1) It will provide understanding of the step-                by-step processes by which certain phosphorus-containing organic                molecules react to generate unpaired-electron-intermediates (free               radicals) when excited by light absorption and other energizing                 events; and (2) many of these reactions may be used as synthetic                methods for preparation of sensitive compounds.                                                                                                                 Studies of both free radical and photochemical reactions of                     organophosphorus molecules are planned.  Both new investigations                and new aspects of reactions discovered in the previous grant                   period will be pursued.  A major theme is the design and                        investigation of reaction systems in which true biradicals or                   biradical-like electronic excited states react with tricovalent                 phosphorus in intra- or intermolecular processes.  Mechanistic,                 exploratory new-reaction, and synthetic aspects of these systems                are to be examined.  Reactants included in this work are                        photoexcited alkenes, alkynes, allenes, carbonyls, and                          thiocarbonyls, along with biradicals from Norrish Type I                        photocleavage reactions and the photolyses of azo compounds.                    In addition, new reactions in which intact phosphoranyl radicals                are trapped will be studied.  The mechanistic aspects and                       synthetic applications of the intramolecular photo-Arbuzov                      reaction of benzyl phosphites, newly discovered in Bentrude's                   laboratory, will be explored.  Also to be thoroughly studied is                 the photosolvolysis of benzyl phosphites in the presence of                     alcohols.  Its mechanism and generality using other chromophores                and leaving groups will be assessed.",
