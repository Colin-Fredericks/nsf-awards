 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous participants in this research project at a primarily                   undergraduate institution have included a number of students                    currently enrolled in PhD programs in major chemistry                           departments.  The project is expected to provide much-needed                    information about the mechanisms of structural transformations                  of metal cluster compounds.  Such compounds are an important                    class of catalysts and are also important as precursors for the                 preparation of new solid materials.                                                                                                                             The photochemical synthesis of mixed transition metal clusters                  from mercury bridged mixed transition metal clusters                            (containing M = Ru, Os and M'= group VI thru group VIII, first,                 second or third row transition metal moiety) will be                            investigated.  Crossover experiments using suitably labelled                    complexes will be conducted in order to evaluate the                            molecularity of the photo-induced reductive elimination of                      mercury which leads to formation of M2M'clusters and also to                    investigate the thermal exchange reactions between the starting                 clusters.  The electron transfer chemistry of these mercury                     bridged metal clusters will be examined with a view                             towards promoting reductive elimination of mercury electro-                     chemically.  The mechanisms of hydrogen transfer between                        coordinated ligands and the metal core (and the reverse                         reaction), in polynuclear metal clusters will be studied                        utilizing the observed kinetic deuterium isotope effects                        on these processes.  The mechanisms of hydrogen transfer                        between metal atoms in polynuclear transition metal clusters                    and the relationship of this process to other ligand migrations                 will be studied utilizing the kinetic deuterium isotope effects                 previously documented for hydrogen migrations in several                        hydrido-metal clusters.",
