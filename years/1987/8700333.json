 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research on the mechanisms of light-induced chemical                   reactions.  Dr. Morrison's focus in photochemical reactions is                  the interaction of close, but formally non-conjugated functional                groups which interact in the excited states generated by light                  absorption.  Such systems are important as models for many of the               light-induced chemical sequences of life processes.  In                         photosynthesis, for example, one \"antenna\" group in chlorophyll                 harvests light energy and then transfers it to a nearby                         \"receptor\" for initiating chemical changes.                                                                                                                     Photochemical reactions of bifunctional molecules can be broadly                subclassified into those (a) involving bond formation between the               two functionalities, and (b) those primarily involving only one                 of the two groups, the non-reacting moiety then serving as an                   \"antenna\" to harvest photons.  In the latter case, a variety of                 mechanisms are now recognized which can lead to activation of the               distal, reacting group.  The reacting group may either be                       relatively transparent in the ultraviolet spectrum (examples are                chlorine, carbethoxy, and alkene substituents), or be itself                    capable of asborption (a ketone, for example), but still                        potentially selectively activated by the atenna.  This research                 is primarily addressed to \"Class b\" systems.  The basic questions               for which answers are sought include:  (1) How general, and with                what stereoelectronic limitations, are the various mechanisms for               activiting distal functionalities; (2) How may these phenomena be               utilized synthetically; and (3) How are they reflected in the                   photostability of complex molecules?                                                                                                                            As an out growth of research previously supported by Foundation                 Grant CHE-8318825, Dr. Morrison has also initiated studies                      involving metal ion catalysis in photochemistry and                             photochemistry in the gas phase.  Both projects have uncovered                  new and intriguing chemistry, the extensions of which are                       included in the present program.",
