 "awd_abstract_narration": "In August of 1987, the International Congress on Planning and              Design  Theory (ICPDT) will meet in Boston Massachusetts.  The ICPDT            meeting will  bring together a multinational, multidisciplinary                 community in planning and design.  The workshops funded by this grant           will be separate from the ICPDT meeting and will not conflict with it.          The first workshop will be held on  August 17 on the topic of                   \"Interaction Between Planning and Design Theory and Practice.\"  The             second workshop will be held on August 20 and will cover \"Research              Issues in Design Theory and Methodology.\"  Both workshops will be one-          day long and will feature presentations by leaders in the field, group          interactions, and discussion periods.                                                These workshops will take advantage of the international community         gathered in Boston for ICPDT so that their expertise and advice are             available to the Design Theory program.  In addition, funding the               workshop will enable a broader section of the U.S. design community to          attend the ICPDT meeting.",
