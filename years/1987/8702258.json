 "awd_abstract_narration": "Queueing networks with blocking frequently arise in performance studies         of computer systems, distributed systems, and communication systems.            Despite their potential applicability, their use is not widespread.             This is mainly due to the absence of comprehensive tools for analyzing          such systems.  This research aims at rectifying this situation by               developing algorithms for the analysis of multi-class queueing networks         with blocking.  So far, such multi-class queueing networks have not             been studied in the open literature.                                                                                                                            In order to achieve this objective, small configurations will be                analyzed first.  These configurations will be in the form of merge,             split, and tandem multi-class queueing networks with blocking.  The             results and experience obtained from the analysis of these                      configurations will then be consolidated in order to obtain solution            techniques for arbitrary configurations.  Finally, these solution               techniques will be incorporated into existing algorithms for general            queueing networks, in order to further increase their usefulness.",
