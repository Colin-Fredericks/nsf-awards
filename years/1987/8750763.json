 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychologists study human beings to understand the causes of               behavior and the circumstances under which specific behaviors maybe             predicted.  For their studies psychologists use a variety of assessment         techniques, including interviews, observations, and objective and               projective testing.  The project would establish a research laboratory          to enable introductory-level and advanced students to learn about some          of the techniques used by psychologists to understand behavior and              assess personality.  With the establishment of the laboratory, students         would be able to participate in research as subjects and to conduct             research themselves.  This \"hands-on\" learning experience is expected to        enhance student knowledge of personality assessment and correlational           and experimental research methodology, as well as to increase their             statistical and computer programming skills.",
