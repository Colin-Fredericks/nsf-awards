 "awd_abstract_narration": "Progress in the development of software testing and debugging tools has         lagged behind advances in other software technologies, yet program              testing and debugging remain a bottleneck in the software production            process, and they continue to dominate the software production calendar         and ledger.  This research is devoted to the study, design, and                 implementation of a new approach in software testing and debugging.  The        principal objective is to develop a \"non-interference\" software testing         and debugging system to ensure minimum intervention with the execution          of the target system, at the same time, providing the software                  practitioner with maximum control over program execution.  The non-             interference testing system addresses the critical problem of specific          timing constraints in real-time systems which presents far more                 difficulties than software testing on conventional computer                     applications.  Although the proposed system is oriented toward real-time        system testing, it is potentially applicable to a wide range of                 applications, especially for on-site support testing of systems in              operation mode.                                                                                                                                                 Justification and Recommendation                                                                                                                                This research could lead to an improved understanding of the software           testing process.  If successful it could be of real significance.",
