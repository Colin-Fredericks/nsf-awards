 "awd_abstract_narration": "Banach space theory is a basic tool of mathematical analysis            that has been of importance since its inception at the turn of                  the century.  In recent years, there has been a rebirth of                      interaction with other aspects of mathematical analysis -- such                 as harmonic analysis and operator theory -- and probability                     theory.  In particular, Banach space methods, in the hands of                   highly creative and powerful researchers, have led to fundamental               breakthroughs in these other fields, and in turn probabilistic                  methods have enriched the structure theory of Banach spaces                     themselves.  World centers of excellence in this area are in                    Israel, Paris, Warsaw, Ohio, and Texas. Professor Johnson is one                of the leading figures in the United States and internationally                 in this area, and he heads a strong and productive team of                      researchers at Texas A & M.  Professor Pisier, from Paris, joined               this group last year.  He is one of the truly outstanding                       mathematical analysts in the world with innumerable major results               to his credit, and he is a world class probababilist as well.                   Pisier's work sets major directions for research in Banach space                theory, harmonic analysis, and probability.  The year long                      workshop at Texas A & M, held cooperatively with other strong                   researchers at Texas, brings together singly and collectively the               most significant researchers in the field, all of whom have done                fundamental work, to interact on problems of current concern, and               to interact with young researchers in the field.                                        Professors Johnson and Pisier will continue their deep and              important investigations on a variety of aspects of Banach space                theory; for example, local theory of function spaces, weak                      Hilbert spaces, Lipschitz theory, Banach lattices, probability                  theory, and spaces of operators.  These researchers always obtain               deep and fundamental results, and it is anticipated that this                   project will be no exception.",
