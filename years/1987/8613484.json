 "awd_abstract_narration": "In most chemical process designs, the designer begins by analyzing         simple structures using approximate models.  Gradually as the design            evolves, more detailed models are used to explain more complex                  interactions which can make the difference in the success of a design.          These complex phenomena are often the reason that a new design has the          potential to be more effective; for example, more energy or more cost           efficient.  However, models of more complex interactions usually have a         richer solution space; that is, they exhibit more solutions for a given         set of specifications.  The number and stability of the solutions varies        with the specifications and with the parameters of the model.  In               process design, problems can arise when algorithms converge on a                solution that is not physically correct.  In the design stage,                  experimental data often are not available and the designer may continue         to work based on a wrong solution.                                                   The Principal Investigator proposes to create a prototype software         environment to permit experimentation with the design of control                structures for complex systems.  The PI will develop new techniques for         solving both steady state and dynamic simulation problems to demonstrate        the utility of these techniques in the design of chemical processes.            Emphasis will be placed on the analytical and algorithmic methods that          rationalize the design process.",
