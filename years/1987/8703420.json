 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is provided for a number of U.S. scientists to                          participate in the International Meetings of the Versailles                     Project on Advanced Materials and Standards (VAMAS).                                                                                                            VAMAS was initiated at the Economic Summit of Heads of State in                 1982 in Versailles.  At the meeting, VAMAS was one of eighteen                  technical activities established to provide the framework for the               stimulation of the world economy.  The main thrust of VAMAS is to               establish a valid scientific basis for reliable and                             internationally acceptable measurement of the characteristics and               performance of such material.                                                                                                                                   Such activity is required because new materials typically                       respond to conventional characterization measurements in                        unanticipated ways.  This response is traceable to the novel                    structures and resulting superior performance of these materials.               The scientific basis for satisfactory prediction of the response                of these materials frequently does not exist.  Development of the               scientific background necessary for such prediction is important                to the development of materials science as well as to the                       incorporation of such materials in articles of international                    trade.  Thus, the involvement of academic and industrial                        participants is increasingly important.                                                                                                                         In response to these general needs, VAMAS has established                       scientific and technical activity in the following areas:  Wear,                Surface Chemical Analysis, Ceramics, Polymer Blends, Polymer                    Composites, Superconducting and Cryogenic Structural Materials                  Databanks, Creep Crack Growth, Efficient Test Procedures for                    Polymer Properties, and Low Cycle Fatigue.                                                                                                                      Support for this international activity is jointly recommended by               the Division of Materials Research and the Division of                          International Programs.",
