The goal                 of this innovative program is to characterize the electrochemical               behavior of transition metal complexes that experience a large                  change in molecular structure during electron transfer.                         Experimental results from this research will be used to test                    current theories of electron transfer reactions and to understand               examples of unusual redox behavior associated with structural                   change.  Rates and mechanisms of electrode reactions will be                    investigated using dynamic voltammetric techniques, low                         temperature electrochemistry, and microelectrodes.  X-ray                       absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroelectrochemistry will be               used to determine changes in metal-ligand bond distances that                   occur as a result of electron transfer.  Compounds to be                        investigated include oxomolybdenum (VI) complexes, axially                      substituted iron porphyrins and cobalt macrocycles, metal-metal                 bonded dimers of molybdenum and tungsten, and the iron-molybdenum               cofactor extracted from nitrogenase enzyme.  The results of these               investigations should contribute significantly to our                           understanding of metalloenzyme-catalyzed electron transfer                      reactions and have relevance to both biotechnological and in vivo               processes.",
