 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to develop a detailed model of the                   planning and control of voluntary movements in humans.                          Fundamental knowledge in this area can inform robotics, physical                education and rehabilitation, and the design of human-machine                   systems.                                                                                                                                                        Three lines of experiments will be pursued.  One will focus on a                phenomenon recently discovered in Rosenbaum's laboratory under                  his current NSF support.  This parameter remapping effect is a                  tendency for people's performance of repeated movement sequences                to suffer when characteristics of individual movements change                   from one performance cycle to the next.  Experiments will explore               the underlying causes, generality, and susceptibility to training               of this phenomenon.  In addition, the effect will be used to shed               light on the building blocks for movements and the rules                        governing their combination.                                                                                                                                    Another line of experiments will be concerned with another                      phenomenon that was also recently discovered in Rosenbaum's                     laboratory.  Tentatively called the response switching effect, it               is a dramatic reduction in the rate at which people can alternate               between vocal and manual responses, compared to the rate at which               they can produce manual or vocal responses alone.  The phenomenon               is surprising, since current theories suggest that it should be                 possible to produce vocal and manual responses in parallel and                  therefore very quickly.  Several experiments will attempt to                    identify the source of this effect.                                                                                                                             A final part of the project will focus on the planning of skilled               actions.  Experiments will address the question of how people                   formulate plans for the manipulation of objects.  The method will               be to record the amount of time that people take, and the sorts                 of movements they choose to perform, jsut after seeing an array                 of objects for which an abstractly defined task was given                       beforehand (e.g., place the object in the container).  The model                of planning to be derived from the research should be of interest               to roboticists and to clinicians who deal with motor disorders.",
