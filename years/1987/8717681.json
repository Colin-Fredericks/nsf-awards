 "awd_abstract_narration": "NASA's Information Systems Office has recently established a            NASA Science Internet program to coordinate and consolidate                     several discipline - oriented networks in order to promote                      better access to space - acquired data.  NSF's Division of                      Networking and Communications Research and Infrastructure                       (DNCRI) is responsible for NSFNET for the purpose of improving                  access to supercomputers and encouraging greater and more                       effective communication and collaboration within the scientific                 and engineering research community.  Since the network user                     communities of NASA and NSF largely overlap, it is advantageous                 for the two networking implementations to be coordinated in                     order to minimize duplication of facilities, reduce duplicate                   and wasteful effort, and control overall costs.                                         Accordingly, the NASA Information Systems Offices has agreed            to host several planning conference for their network programs                  which would be highly interdependent on coordination and                        cooperation of NSFnet implementors.  NASA will plan the                         logistics of these meetings and assist in the preparation of                    the agenda and advance materials.  It is expected that these                    planning conferences will include other federal agencies in                     addition to NASA and NSF, specifically, the Defense Advanced                    Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Department of Energy                   (DOE).",
