 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this two-year U.S.-China research project on                   optimization of real-time hydrothermal system operation between                 William Yeh, University of California at Los Angeles and Shiquan Hua,           Nanjing Institute of Hydrology and Water Resources, Chinese Ministry of         Water Resources and Electric Power is to develop and test an                    optimization model for efficient power generation in both thermal and           hydropower plants.  The UCLA group has developed a mathematical model           and computer program to study factors and characteristics of the                efficient operation of individual power systems.  In cooperation with           the Nanjing Research Institute group, the model would be studied at a           small hydrothermal power system in Guizhou and Sichuan Provinces in             Southwest China.  U.S. and Chinese investigators will determine jointly         the characteristics, relationships and constraints for the hydrothermal         system.  The Chinese researchers will collect and form the data from            the power plant's operating experience; a computer program will be              developed and tested at UCLA and at Nanjing; and the optimization model         will be tested at field power plants in China.                                                                                                                  This project is related to the U.S.-China Program's objectives of               promoting mutually benefical research to advance scientific knowledge           through the combined efforts and abilities of Chinese and American              scientists.  The joint project will result in a new computerized                optimization model which could assist with more efficient operation of          hydro and thermal systems in the U.S. and China.  Significant benefits          such as reduction in fossil fuel consumption and investment required            for power plant expansion can be accrued through utilization of this            model.  The field test site in China is also significant.                       Opportunities for operations research in the U.S. have been limited.            U.S. utilities have made private efforts, but these have been                   incomplete due to lack of interest and time.  Thus, this project offers         a unique opportunity to fully test and develop a model at a comparable          field site in China.",
