 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular Aspects of Ethylene-Regulated Gene Expression in              Phaseolus:  The objectives of this project are two-fold:  1)                    to characterize the hormonal regulation of the genomic clones                   of chitinase from bean (Phaseolus vulgaris); and 2)  to map and                 define the ethylene sensitive elements (i.e., promoter) of                      these clones.                                                                                                                                                           The phytohormone ethylene has long been known to exert                  powerful effects on physiological and developmental processes                   in higher plants.  The chitinase gene family from Phaseolus is                  used as a paradigm for ethylene regulated gene expression in                    higher plants.  Under normal growth conditions, when ethylene                   levels are low, chitinase expression is minimal; when ethylene                  levels are high, however, such as when plants are subjected to                  physical or biological stresses, or by normal developmental                     processes connected with aging or senescence, the level of                      chitinase expression can increase as much as 75- to 100-fold                    over controls. The exact role of chitinase in the physiology                    and biochemistry of the plant is unknown.  Chitin is, however,                  a major component of fungal cell walls and insect exoskeletons                  and, thus, it has been postulated to have a protective                          function.  Using cDNA clones of chitinase isolated from                         Phaseolus vulgaris, this agronomically important gene family                    will be characterized.  Since ethylene is intimately involved                   in numerous processes in the normal growth and development of                   higher plants, knowledge of how vanishingly small amounts of                    ethylene affect gene transcription may yield insights into the                  molecular aspects of senescence, fruit ripening, wound                          response, as well as the mechanism(s) of response to stress and                 pathogen attack.  Considering the magnitude of crop losses each                 year by pathogenic fungi and insect pests, chitinase stands out                 as an excellent candidate for genetic transfer to plants with                   the possible aim of incresing resistance to chitinous                           pathogens.  Likewise, further characterization of the putative                  ethylene promoter could be of immeasurable practical use for                    regulating the expression of foreign genes at times of high                     stress.",
