The timing is particularly appropriate since three of                  the researchers have sabbatical years and will be able to                       participate, as will Ellis Kolchin, one of the foremost scholars                in the subject, who has retired from Columbia University and will               continue his activity and leadership at Rutgers.  The Rutgers New               Brunswick campus is appropriate since Richard Cohn and Joseph                   Johnson, who have devoted most of their research to this topic,                 are members of the faculty, and William Keigher, a category                     theorist who has worked extensively in differential algebra, is                 nearby at Rutgers Newark Campus.",
