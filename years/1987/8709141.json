 "awd_abstract_narration": "A detailed halogen-lamp rapid thermal annealing study will be           performed on Si- and Be- implanted InP and InGaAs to obtain high quality        n- and p-type layers in these materials.  In addition to single                 implants, some multiple implant schedules will be used to suit                  particular device requirements.  One-and two-step annealing cycles will         be used on the implanted material.  The surface morphology, dopant              activation, carrier mobility, doping profiles, defect density, and              energy levels of the implanted layers will be evaluated by performing           scanning electron microscopy, Hall, transmission electron microscopy,           Rutherford back scattering, photoluminescence, and deep level transient         spectroscopy measurements.  The results of the halogen-lamp rapid               thermal annealing will be compared with those obtained from conventional        furnace annealing. Light-ion bombardment using H, N, B, and Be ions into        p-type InGaAs will be studied to obtain near-intrinsic, high-resistance         layers and high-speed photoconductive detectors.  The variation of the          sheet resistance of the high-resistance layers with different 20 s              halogen-lamp annealing temperatures will be studied to find the critical        halogen-lamp processing temperature above which high resistance                 disappears.  Also current -voltage, spectral response, optical impulse          response, and noise power measurements will be performed on the                 photoconductive detectors.  The results of this study will be useful to         make high-performance devices using ion-implantation technology.",
