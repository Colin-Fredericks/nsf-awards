 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research proposal is to conduct an extensive                theoretical study of load balancing for distributed systems.  The goal of       load balancing is to utilize the computation resource in a distributed          system efficiently.  Typically this is done by transferring jobs that are       submitted at a heavily loaded node for remote execution to a more highly        doubled node.  The overall purpose is to help transform the \"art\" of load       balancing into a more precise and scientific endeavor and to increase the       understanding of the general resource-sharing problem.                                                                                                          Distributed systems of computing are being increasingly impartial, and          therefore efficient methods for balancing the work among the processor          need to be developed.  Numerous heuristic approaches to this problem            exist, and more continue to be developed.  The work in this proposal is         an attempt to establish a theoretical basis for load balancing.                                                                                                 All of the investigators in this research project have published in the         general area; they are highly competent to conduct the research.  The           research project is being sponsored primarily by the Naval Research             Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Phillip Hwang.",
