With           the addition of a 159 megabyte disc, port selector, and upgrades to             existing Rainbow terminals, sixteen students will be accommodated. Three        upper division courses, Operating Systems; Assemblers, Compilers and            Translators; and Computer Graphics will be served by the upgraded               laboratory. In addition to the formal courses, the laboratory will              provide a base for experimentation by an undergraduate student research         group doing research on modeling and cognitive science. Among the               experiments planned for research are neural network simulation, pattern         recognition of video frames, and Sejnowski's Nettalk experiment. The            intent will be to create hypothetical neural structures and then examine        their performance.",
