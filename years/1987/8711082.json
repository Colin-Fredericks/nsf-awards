 "awd_abstract_narration": "Education in science and engineering fosters personal and professional          values as well as technical knowledge and skills.  Traditionally, the           former kind of educational experience has been more implicit than               explicit.  Recently, questions have arisen about the moral content of           professional training and conduct, and about how value conflicts                affecting professional training ought to be resolved.  Co-sponsored by          the Committee on Scientific Freedom and Responsibility of the American          Association for the Advancement of Science, the Council of Graduate             Schools in the U.S., and Sigma Xi's Committee on Science and Society,           this project will compile and provide an assessment of current                  knowledge about policies and practices that affect professional values          in graduate education in science and undergraduate and professional             education in engineering.  Working papers on the topics of academic             guidelines, research sponsorship, misconduct, and ethics in engineering         education will be prepared.  Plans and pretests for a survey of                 students and faculty, to identify how socialization occurs and                  knowledge of institutional policies and procedures on these matters,            will be developed.  In addition project staff will solicit, devise, and         pretest scenarios of cases in which ethical or value issues for                 students and faculty have arisen.  Besides identifying the issues and           developing a plan for further study of them, the project will establish         contacts with investigators and organizations with related interests.           Results from the project will include an initial \"state of the art\"             assessment of relevant literature and practice and the identification           of related programs. Several from the series of working papers should           merit publication.  Finally, the co-sponsors will develop a                     comprehensive plan for further work.                                                                                                                            This project will define the substantive issues and appropriate                 methodologies to investigate normative components in science and                engineering education.  The investigative team and consultants are very         well qualified to undertake the project, and the institutional co-              sponsors are most appropriate.  Results are likely to be revealing,             useful, and widely disseminated.  The research design is very                   appropriate for this exploratory phase, and costs are reasonable.               Total support is recommended in the amount of $47,572.",
