 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for renewed support of a project in                     linguistic theory which has proven exceedingly productive, with                 results of both theoretical and practical importance.  The                      researcher is continuing to investigate the possibilities and                   problems of an explicit theory of linguistic syntax and semantics               which operates on a single level of representation, with rules                  with strictly defined and restricted formal properties.  Most                   theoreticians have found it necessary to postulate two or more                  levels of representation, and rules of a variety of formal types,               in order to account for the data observed in natural language.                  The theory proposed here, by being more restricted in its scope                 and power, makes much stronger and more interesting claims about                the underlying nature of language, and to the extent that it can                be shown to be valid empirically, it thus constitutes a                         significant advance in linguistic theory.  In order to validate                 the theory empirically, the investigator must deal satisfactorily               with the numerous empirical problems which have led other                       researchers to postulate more complex theories, and that is the                 burden of the project proposed here.                                                                                                                                 The project has, as mentioned above, practical import in                   addition to its empirical interest.  The restricted theory being                explored permits much faster and more efficient computer                        processing than more diverse theories do, and to the extent it                  can handle the data of natural language and produce useful                      output, it offers the prospect of a major advance in computer                   systems for natural language processing.",
