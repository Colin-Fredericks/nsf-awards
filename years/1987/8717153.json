In              addition, the trip will provide the opportunity to interact with                researchers in the Pacific region who would usually not attend meetings         in this country.  Visits are planned to universities which have produced        high quality research work in the field.  These are the University of           Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand and the University of New South         Wales in Australia.  Visits will be made to Professors R Park and T.            Paulay in Christchurch and Professor V. Rangan in Australia.",
