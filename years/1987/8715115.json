 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Engineering Foundation Conference \"Chemical Engineering                     Education in a Changing Environment\" is a unique attempt at                     rapidly introducing high technology applications, such as the                   processing of electronic and photic materials, biochemical                      processing, the handling of hazardous materials and wastes,                     biocontainment, and electrochemical processing into the standard                chemical engineering curriculum.  This will be done by having                   invited speakers briefly introduce their technology areas, and                  then discuss one or two detailed examples of the use of chemical                engineering fundamentals to solve problems in these new                         technology areas. These examples and their solutions will be in a               form that chemical engineering faculty unfamiliar with these                    technology areas could nonetheless use directly in standard                     courses such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, mass transfer,                 kinetic and reactor design.                                                                                                                                     Recommendation.  This project provides financial support to allow               chemical engineering faculty to attend the Conference \"Chemical                 Engineering Education in a Changing Environment\", and to prepare                and distribute the Proceedings of this Conference.  Support                     totalling $31,400 is provided by the Engineering Directorate and                the Science and Engineering Directorate in FY 1987.",
