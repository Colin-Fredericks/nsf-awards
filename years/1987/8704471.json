 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Dworzecka is a major contributor to the field of heavy-             ion collisions at low energy.  She and her collaborators at the                 University of Maryland have developed a number of models for                    explaining the experimental data in this field.  She is now                     proposing to extend her work to the following three areas of                    investigation:  (1) the understanding of the nuclear exchange                   process and its relation to energy dissipation in damped heavy-                 ion collisions, (2) the microscopic study of nuclear dissipation                and its relation to phenomenological models and (3) the study of                collective motion within mean field dynamics.                                           The purpose of the proposed research is to study the                    dynamical properties of nuclear processes as observed in heavy-                 ion collisions (i.e., nucleus-nucleus collisions) at low energy.                This work will help us gain an insight into the mechanisms of                   reactions between complex nuclei and of the associated modes of                 excitation produced in damped nuclear collisions.  This will be                 accomplished by concentrating on an understanding of the physical               processes and on studying the physical observables in these                     processes and how they are related to the assumptions made in the               models used for describing these processes.  Dr. Dworzecka has                  worked on these problems for a number of years and has produced                 useful and internationally recognized results.  She can be                      expected to make new advances in her proposed research, which                   will also involve undergraduates at George Mason University.",
