 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research Equipment Grant for an excimer pumped dye               laser tomographic 3-D imaging system capable of making time-resolved            3-D images of a fluid flow at a rate of 1000 frames per second.  This           equipment will continue the development of an imaging system for the            examination of a coflowing gaseous jet using holographic                        interferometry.  Image information is recorded on photographic film,            representing the optical pathlength, which is related to the index of           refraction of the medium.  The tomographic imager coupled to an                 excimer pumped dye laser opens exciting new applications.  By tuning            the UV radiation to a resonance line of a species of interest, only             that gas will be measured.  Thus it should be possible to selectively           measure such species as O2 or OH in a combusting flow.  In addition,            by making a measurement of absorption along the path length of the              probe beams, the cumbersome process of fringe readout can be avoided.           This equipment should prove very useful in fluid mechanics and                  combustion research.",
