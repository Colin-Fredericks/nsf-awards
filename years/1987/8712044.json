 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a key                     technique for the study of molecules that contain an unpaired                   electron.  EPR measurements on inorganic, organometallic and                    organic materials under photochemical, electrochemical and                      thermal stimulation lead to an understanding of chemical                        structure that is unattainable by any other technique.  The                     acquisition of EPR instrumentation enhances the ability of                      chemists to carry out frontier research.                                                                                                                        The Department of Chemistry of the University of Oregon will                    use an award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                  to help purchase a state-of the-art EPR spectrometer.  The                      areas of study in chemistry that will be enhanced include:                                                                                                         1) Radical clocks, a new type of radical probe                                  2) Novel stable nitroxide free radicals for applications                           as spin labels for biophysical studies                                       3) EPR of cyclic dihydropyrene aromatics                                        4) New inorganic multicomponent oxides via sol-gel synthetic                       routes                                                                       5) EPR as a probe of surface defects                                            6) 19-electron complexes                                                                                                                                     A unique feature of the proposal is the way the EPR facility is                 managed, providing access to the entire science community                       within the University including Chemistry, Physics, Biology and                 Geology Departments.",
