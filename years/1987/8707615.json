 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is funded as an Engineering Initiation Award (EIA).              Optical wave scattering phenomena for scatters embedded in a multilayer         background will be studied using a new technique which employs boundary         integral equation to formulate the interaction processes and hybrid ray-        mode method to provide the Green's function of the background.  This            method is numerically efficient in a broad range of parameter regimes           and also provides cogent physical interpretations for the computed              result. Structures of interest in the optical microscopy of integrated          circuits and integrated optics will serve as test cases.  The dependance        of the scattering properties on the shapes, sizes and dielectric                constants of the scatters and the response of the scanning microscope to        the scattering fields are to be investigated.  The results gained from          this research may enable the scanning microscopy to assess                      quantitatively objects whose dimensions are on the order of, or less            than, the wavelength.  Potential application is to the use of a scanning        optical microscope for automated nondestructive evaluation and                  inspection of sub-micron structures in integrated circuits and                  integrated optics devices. This study will be also beneficial to other          engineering disciplines such as nondestructive testing, exploration,            geophysics and underwater acoustics, etc., where similar structures are         investigated using elastic and acoustic waves.                                          A new theoretical technique will be employed to study wave              scattering phenomena of those structures that are of interest in scanned        optical microscopy of integrated circuits and integrated optics.  Such          structures are composed of material formed in layers which often have           embedded inhomogeneities, different from the background layered                 structure.  One of the most versatile methods to identify and evaluate          them is based on the use of the transmission and scattering bounded             beams incident on the multilayered structure that are scanned over the          region containing the scatter.  In order to use the scattered fields to         identify the properties of the scatter, it is essential to solve the            direct problem of wave scattering by an object in a multilayer                  structure.  This proposal addresses a use of the combination of boundary        integral equation and the newly developed hybrid ray-mode method to             solve the wave scattering problem.",
