 "awd_abstract_narration": "The combination of single- and double-cross polarization with                   magic-angle spinning has resulted in high-resolution 13C and 15N                NMR spectra of a variety of biological solids.  Recently                        developed versions of these experiments will be used to identify                cross-links in insect exoskeleton and plant cell walls, to                      establish the mechanism of drug action on bacterial cell-wall                   metabolism, to identify binding sites in immobilized enzymes, to                measure the dynamics and conformational flexibility within the                  active sites of enzymes, to measure the mobility of multiple                    sites in lipid chains in the gel state without specific labeling                of the lipids, and to monitor the catabolism of drugs,                          herbicides, and pesticides in mammalian tissue nondestructively.                Many of these new applications will involve NMR techniques that                 have been developed in this laboratory.  The capabilities of this               laboratory will be expanded by building a new double-cross                      polarization 1H-13C-l5N solids spectrometer with operating                      characteristics specifically tailored to the needs of the planned               new applications.  This spectrometer, along with three existing                 solids spectrometers, will comprise a new NSF Biological                        Facilities Center for the NMR analysis of biological solids.  The               combined expertise represented in this Center is unique and                     multidisciplinary.  Previously the Principal Investigator has had               good collaborative efforts, which are likely to continue; and his               laboratory is at the forefront of the develoment of this                        sophisticated technology.  He is firmly committed to wider                      applications among the biological community.  Potential                         applications range from instrument development, to chemical                     physics, biology/medicine, and to biotechnology.",
