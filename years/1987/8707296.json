 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of the origin of granulites is of interest to               a wide cross-section of Earth Scientists because present-day                    surface outcrops are believed to give clues to processes                        operating, past and present, in the lower crust.  It is proposed                to study the causes of granulite metamorphism and to identify                   the geochemical effects of hornblende breakdown.  The breakdown                 will be studied in two places in the contact aureole of the                     Laramie Anorthosite.  In one locality hornblende breakdown due                  to simple dehydration, while in other breakdown is in response                  to CO2-fluxing from adjacent marble.  Both of these mechanisms                  of hornblende decomposition have been proposed as causes of                     granulite metamorphism.  The results of the Laramie Anorthosite                 investigation will be applied to interpreting the origins of                    charnockites in the Wind River Mtns.  An attempt will be made                   to determine the origin of granulite selvages in the country                    rock of charnockite dikes.  Criteria will be established for                    distinguishing igneous charnockites from granulite gneisses                     metamorphosed in the granulite facies.                                                  The research will use field mapping, petrology, electron                microprobe analyses, stable and radiogenic isotope analyses to                  deduce the processes of granulite formation and their                           geochemical signatures.",
