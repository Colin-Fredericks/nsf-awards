 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rydberg states of H2+ will be studied by optical excitation             of H2+, using a highly sensitive detection scheme that is based                 on the detection of slow protons from the dissociating molecule.                Contrary to conventional Rydberg molecules, the H2+ Rydberg                     states are characterized by a core configuration (2 protons) that               is strongly correlated with the quantum numbers of the Rydberg                  electron n and l, the sole electron in the molecule.  The                       theoretical formulation of this three-particle system is in its                 foundations equivalent to that of the negative hydrogen atom.                   Experimental information on these states of H2+ is completely                   lacking at this point.  These states will be explored for the                   first time with a unique experimental tool.  A similar                          experimental approach will also be used to investigate                          rotationally quasi-bound states in the ground 1s sigmag state of                H2+ and its isotopes by stimulated Raman scattering from the                    repulsive 2p sigmau state.  Finally, the fast-neutral beam                      photodissociation technique will be utilized to study isotopes                  and configuration-interaction effects in the dissociation of                    neutral hydrogen to the H(1s) + H(2p) limit.                                            The results of this work will aid the understanding of the              structure and interactions of simple molecules.",
