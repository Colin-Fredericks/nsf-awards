Companies are now recognizing that they must improve their               productivity if they are to maintain a market share in world                    markets.  Research addressing manufacturing systems that are cost               effective is necessary to maintain our productivity and position                in world trade.  Companies are now recognizing and supporting                   research on manufacturing.  Because of this increasing interest by              companies, an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on                Manufacturing and Automation now appears to be both feasible and                viable.                                                                                 This five.year continuing grant is initiating an                        Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Manufacturing               and Automation at the University of Southern California and the                 University of California.Los Angeles in collaboration with the                  California Institute of Technology, the Universities of California              Irvine and Santa Barbara, and Arizona State University.  The                    initial research program is addressing:  1)  An Intelligent System              for Automatic Generation of Manufacturing Process Plans; 2)                     Geometric Modeling and its Applications in Design and                           Manufacturing Automation; 3)  Automatic Generation of Optimal                   Cutting Conditions for NC Machines in CAD/CAM; 4)  Multi.Robot                  Assembly Process Planning and Scheduling; 5)  Design for Automatic              Assembly and Maintenance; 6)  Intelligent Simulation Systems for                Automated Factories; 7)  Sensor Based Robot Systems for Automated               Manufacturing in a Vacuum Environment; 8)  Dynamic Scheduling for               Automated Manufacturing.                                                                Four companies have joined the Center and another four have             said they will join at the beginning of the year when new budgets               are available.  Industrial support will provide 40% of the                      Center's $1,000,000 initial budget and should increase to 60%                   during the first year.  The State of California has budgeted                    $200,000/year to augment the Center's research.                                         The Co.Principal Investigators and all his colleagues                   involved in the Center are noted experts in there fields and have               the expertise and industrial relationships to operate this Center.                      This Center is being cost shared with the Division of Design,           Manufacturing, and Computer.Integrated Engineering.                                     The Program Manager recommends the University of Southern               California (and five associated universities) be awarded a five.year continuing grant to be funded at $400,000 per year.  This                                  includes $100,000 per year from the Division of Design,                         Manufacturing, and Computer.Integrated Engineering.                             .\u0005F\u0005F.  Near the end of each 12.month period, the Program Manager               and/or the Head of The Division of Cross.Disciplinary Research                  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal                   criteria, including the following: (1) extent to which                          university/industry interaction and collaboration is developing;                (2) extent to which the support base for the center is expanding;               (3) extent to which a robust research program is developing;                    (4) As industrial support increases, all participating                          universities are to achieve a fair share as determined by the.j\u0002.\u000bindustrial advw is satisfactory, the Program                                                  ll recommend support of the next period of this                                 tinuing grant.",
