 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to investigate the waveforms, amplitudes, and traveltimes            of body waves from earthquakes and explosions to examine the detailed           velocity structure of subducting slabs in the depth range 0 to 1500.                                                                                            Creager and Jordon (1986) propose that penetration of subducting                slabs under the Kurile Islands and other subduction zones to depths             of at least 1000 km is necessary to explain travel time anomalies of            deep earthquakes.  Such penetration would also affect the amplitudes            and waveforms of the body waves from earthquakes.                                                                                                               Methods we have recently developed allow the calculation of the                 waveform and amplitude effects of high-velocity, subducting slabs.              A preliminary review of available data show that we can test and                refine seismic models of slabs with these new methods.  We propose,             as well, to refine models of slabs in the upper mantle, which                   empirically cause even greater waveform, amplitude and timing                   anomalies than the deep slabs.  Our method may also help to locate              where the earthquakes occur relative to the high-velocity slab                  (e.g., toward the top or in the middle).  Reconciliation of the                 amplitude, waveform distortion, and timing of body waves from deep              events is necessary to understand the geometry of slabs near and                below the 650 km discontinuity.",
