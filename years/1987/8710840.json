The researchers will study three               avenues to determine the rate of occurrence of such events, all                 of which are based on very recent ideas and appear very                         promising.  Two of these are simulation based methodologies and                 one is analytical.                                                                   The first approach is a simulation based methodology                       combining ideas from the large deviations theory with the                       \"importance sampling technique\" of simulating rare events.  The                 second approach is a simulation based methodology called                        perturbation analysis which is a recently proposed scheme to                    speed up the estimation of the derivatives of performance                       measures with respect to parameters.  The third approach is based               on a heuristic idea for giving good analytical approximations for               the time to occurrence of rare events in Markov chains which is                 currently being actively developed by researchers in probability                theory, the so called \"Poisson clumping heuristic\".",
