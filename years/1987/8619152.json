 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Svaldbard Archipelago is sensitive to changes                          ocean/atmosphere circulation in the Norwegian Sea because it lies               at the northern limit of the North Atlantic Drift referred to as                (the Gulf Stream off eastern North America).  Rapid deglaciation                of this archipelago occurred during the Pleistocene/Holocene                    transition.  Local glaciers were absent or contracted throughout                most of the early Holocene, but more recently these glaciers have               expanded.  It is known that they were more advanced during the                  Little Ice Age (ca 600 to 50 years before present) than now, but                the timing of the onset of Neoglaciation and its relationship to                climate change remains largely unknown.                                              This study addresses the timing of Neoglaciation and                       Holocene climate change through laboratory analysis of a series                 of sediment cores recovered from Lake Linne, a low-elevation lake               on western Spitsbergen that was an arm of the sea until about                   8,000 years ago.  These cores are the longest and most extensive                ever recovered from a high-latitude lake; as such, they offer a                 high-resolution proxy record environmental change during the past               8,000 years.  The history of local cirque glacier activity will                 be interpreted from the record of exotic pollen influx.  These                  two independent proxy records of Holocene climate change will                   lead to improved understanding of the timing and climatic                       controls on high-latitude glaciation.",
