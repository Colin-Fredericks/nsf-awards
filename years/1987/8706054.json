 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal by Dr. G. Omenn of University of Seattle,                         Washington is for a workshop to examine the use of genetically                  engineered microorganisms in degradation of toxic wastes in the                 environment.                                                                                                                                                    Biotechnology, including genetic engineering of organisms, offers               much promise for important applications in the modification and                 control of toxic pollutants.  Advances in engineering, molecular                biology, and microbial ecology must be brought together to                      achieve significant biodegradation and in situ management of                    chemical wastes.  At the same time protection of local and                      possibly distant ecosystems must be assured.  As landfills are                  overwhelmed, complete in situ biodegradation or reduction of                    toxicity to levels suitable for incineration must be emphasized.                                                                                                Increasing knowledge of the diverse capabilities of                             microorganisms, of genetic means to manipulate those                            capabilities, and of the factors influencing persistence and                    action of these organisms in various environments offers new                    avenues to attack major problems in pollution control and clean-                up.  It is essential to bridge engineering, microbiology, and                   ecology in devising effective strategies for such applications.                 It is timely to review feasibilities studies and field                          applications that have been carried out.  Federal and state                     agencies are grappling with policy questions and permit                         requests for use of genetically-modified organisms; knowledge                   from desirable environmental applications can inform those                      decisions.  NSF has a significant leadership role in these                      matters at the federal level.                                                                                                                                   Dr. Omenn has contributed significantly to this area of study and               concern for many years and is highly respected in the field.  The               University of Washington is well equipped and suited to host this               workshop to a productive conclusion.  The Program recommends                    funding.",
