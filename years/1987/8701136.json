 "awd_abstract_narration": "Convincing field demonstrations of interspecific competition               are rare, despite frequent appeals by theorists for well-designed               field experiments.  Even when interspecific competition is clear,               the relative importance of behavioral interference and                          competitive exploitation of resources remain in dispute.  The                   recent colonization of southern Florida by the brown anole Anolis               sagrei and the simultaneous decline of populations of the native                green anole Anolis carolinensis suggest severe competition                      between these forms.  This will be tested as follows:  Large                    enclosures will be constructed in the field and stocked with                    populations of one or both of these species.  Populations will be               censused monthly over a period of two years in order to collect                 data on growth and reproduction.  Competition will be                           unequivocally demonstrated if the equilibrium populations of one                or both species are significantly lower in two-species enclosures               than they are in one-species enclosures.                                             If competition is found, it will be possible by examination                of the demographic, reproductive, and growth data to identify the               age/sex classes upon which competition most heavily falls, and                  thus deduce its mechanism.",
