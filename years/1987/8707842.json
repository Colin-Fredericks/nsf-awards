 "awd_abstract_narration": "The analytical formulation of accurate and efficient techniques for             obtaining structural design sensitivities of three-dimensional solid            objects using the boundary element approach will be developed.  A new           design sensitivity analysis (DSA) will be formulated by performing              implicit differentiation of the three-dimensional boundary integral             system equations.  This efficient DSA will be developed to allow the            use of the same triangular factors of the system matrix that are formed         in a previous stress analysis step.  The right-hand side vectors                required in this approach will be derived by two different strategies           and their respective performances will be investigated.  A semi-                analytical univariate perturbation/finite difference algorithm and a            formulation involving differentiating boundary integrals will be                developed.  Algorithms for recognition and exploitation of significant          matrix sparsity that occurs in DSA of objects with geometrically                insensitive regions will be developed.  Accurate numerical integration          algorithms using appropriate orders for efficient evaluation will be            developed for the new matrices associated with three-dimensional DSA.           A formulation for the efficient calculation of sensitivities of all             components of the stress tensor on the surface of an object will also           be developed.  This approach will use boundary displacement and                 traction solutions and avoid the need for any additional numerical              integrations.  The above developments will be integrated in a unified           systems for DSA research for complex three-dimensional components.",
