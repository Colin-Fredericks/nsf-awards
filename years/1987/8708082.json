 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grid generation, redistribution and adaptive refinement have                    emerged as important current aspects of computational                           engineering.  With the rapid evolution of advanced                              supercomputers, large-scale 2-D and 3-D problems can now be                     addressed with appropriate grid resolution.  To use the                         associated finite element or finite difference methods reliably                 and efficiently, we need improved grid-generation schemes and                   algorithms for grid redistribution and refinement.  This research               project is directed towards this problem of grid optimization                   using both redistribution and refinement strategies.  The problem               is approached from the viewpoint of nonlinear programming                       problems in optimization theory.  The focus of the research will                be the development of approximate methods and algorithms as well                as techniques for acceleration of the grid optimization                         procedures including parallel processing on subdomains.  The key                technical issues are:  grid redistribution and optimization,                    local adaptive grid refinement and remeshing schemes for moving                 grids.                                                                                                                                                          The institutional support is adequate and the investigation is a                senior researcher with significant contributions in computational               engineering.",
