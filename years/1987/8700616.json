 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator's new interpretation for charge-transfer                       polymerization involves tetramethylene zwitterions and diradicals               as the key intermediates.  To support this concept, he will                     generate the respective tetramethylenes in novel ways, and will                 examine their behavior as initiators.  Potential sources include                thermolysis of cyclobutanes, cyclic sulfones, and cyclic azo                    precursors.  Cyclobutanes containing leaving groups will be used                to generate cationic initiating species.  Lewis acids will be                   used to catalyze the formation of tetramethylenes both diradical                and zitterionic, depending on the Lewis acid.  This will be a                   powerful new tool for control of initiation.  Appropriate                       gegenionic leaving groups in electrophilic or nucleophilic olefin               initiators will control the propagation reaction as well as the                 initiation.  This concept will be used in both coordinated                      cationic and anionic polymerizations.  The concept will be                      broadened to the study of other polymethylenes, in particular                   trimethylenes, pentamethylenes, and hexamethylenes.                                                                                                             This research is part of the Polymers Program's effort to                       understand the fundamentals of polymer synthesis so as to be                    able to control the structure of polymers.",
