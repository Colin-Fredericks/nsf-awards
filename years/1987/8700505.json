 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much study has been devoted to land-based records of                    climatic change in tropical Africa through the last several tens                of millenia.  Paleoceanographers are also unravelling the                       climatic history of oceans on all sides of tropical Africa during               the late Pleistocene.  These studies have shed important light on               such factors as the history of monsoonal circulation and the                    impact of fluctuations in the earth's orbit on tropical climate.                In addition, the growing sophistication of climate models has                   opened up the possibility of integrating the continental and                    marine records of past climates with numerical simulations.  The                combination of these diverse lines of research has led, in turn,                to substantial improvements in our understanding of the earth's                 climate system, and our ability to predict climatic changes in                  the future.                                                                             The equatorial Atlantic is a dynamic hydrographic                       environment, with a number of different surface currents                        interacting in a relatively small area.  This results in sharp                  gradients in sea-surface temperature and primary productivity,                  both of which affect the diatom assemblages in equatorial                       sediments making them sensitive monitors to climatic changes.                           The goal of this study is to determine the interconnections             between conditions in the equatorial Atlantic and in tropical                   Africa and other parts of the tropics, and the influence of                     higher-latitude climates on the climates of tropical regions.  To               achieve this, the PIs will reconstruct temporal and spatial                     variations in surface oceanography as well as changes in the                    intensity of runoff from equatorial African rivers, as revealed                 by changes in the diatom assemblage.  They will also search for                 significant periodicities in the data, as an aid to understanding               the mechanisms which control climatic change in the tropics.  The               ultimate purpose is to improve the understanding of tropical                    climates and our ability to model the response of the climate                   system to orbital or other forcing mechanisms.",
