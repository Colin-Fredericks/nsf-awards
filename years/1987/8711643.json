 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops and applies laboratory methods in political               economy.  A broad research agenda that has been guiding the project             continues to dictate its long-range focus.  The research agenda can be          broken down into the study of markets and work on voting, committees            and political processes.  The investigator is one of two scholars who           dominates laboratory experiments in economics.  His work opens new              lines of study, sets high standards for scientific rigor, and makes             substantively significant contributions.  His past success shows that           he can continue this productive project.                                                                                                                        The part of the project dealing with markets emphasizes asymmetric              information among buyers and sellers, market stability, computerized            markets and special market organizations such as the multidimensional           auctions.  The part concerned with voting focuses on information                transfer within committees, committee design, and the effect of the             ethics and norms of committee members on committee decisions.",
