 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intersection of the legal system and the child welfare                 system is a ripe area for scientific inquiry.  To date, however,                studies of the juvenile court have largely focused on delinquency               issues, and child welfare studies of substitute care (for abuse,                neglect, or dependency) have primarily focused on the children                  and on the foster or primary families.  Ms. Harnett, under the                  supervision of Dr. Schuerman, seeks to combine these two                        traditions in her doctoral dissertation research.  Her study                    examines court delay by comparing the frequency of hearing                      continuances and the reasons underlying continuances in two                     juvenile courts, Cook County (Chicago) and St. Clair County (East               St. Louis).  Both of these courts review similar cases but have                 significantly different placement durations for children in                     substitute care.  It is hypothesized that competing court                       policies and the broader use of discretion account for more                     continuances and greater delay.  The use of three data sources                  enables rigorous analyses and complex controls: juvenile court                  case records, an independent data base on child and familial                    characteristics (of the same cases), and systematic observation                 of actual hearings.  This research shows considerable promise of                illuminating the interaction between legal processes and social                 service practices.  Also, it should add to our knowledge of                     juvenile courts on issues other than delinquency that are                       important.  Finally, it should contribute to our understanding of               delay and the dynamics of court process in a context outside of                 the criminal courts.",
