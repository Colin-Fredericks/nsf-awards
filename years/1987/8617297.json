The                  use of these two dimensional detectors with their high quantum                  efficiency, large wavelength coverage, linearity, large dynamic                 range, and low noise has significantly improved the research                    effectiveness of large telescopes.  However, high quality CCDs                  with performance well matched to astronomical research needs are                still not commercially available.  This project seeks to help                   alleviate that problem.  In a cooperative venture between                       industry and a university, Lick Observatory and the Reticon                     Corporation plan to carry out a program leading ultimately to the               production of high quality CCDs optimized for astronomical                      research.  Reticon has had extensive experience in the production               of silicon sensors, many tailored to astronomical research needs,               and Lick Observatory has had considerable experience in the                     testing, evaluation, and use of CCDs at the telescope.  The goal                is to produce CCDs with a 1200x400 pixel format, with pixels                    approximately 20 microns in size.  The devices will have the high               quantum efficiency, linearity, high charge transfer efficiency,                 low readout noise, and other characteristics that are important                 for astronomical sensors.  In consultation with Lick astronomers,               Reticon will be responsible for the design and construction of                  the CCDs, and Lick Observatory will carry out a detailed testing                and evaluation of the resulting devices both in the laboratory                  and at the telescope.  At the completion of the project, Reticon                is committed to having these CCDs readily available to the                      astronomical community.  In addition to the value of the                        detectors for astronomical research, significant advances in the                understanding of the basic physics and materials characteristics                are expected.  These will be of value to Reticon in bringing this               and other products to the marketplace.",
