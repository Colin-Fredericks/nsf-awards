 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award would allow 12 young American polymer scientists and 18              young German polymer scientists to attend a U.S.-Federal Republic of            Germany Joint Seminar on \"Current Developments and Trends in Polymer            Science,\" to be held in Yountsville, California on September 7-11,              1987.  The seminar will address critical areas in advanced materials            science through a well-balanced program that includes both the physics          and chemistry of macromolecules.                                                                                                                                The proposed seminar is being planned by two Americans, Professors              Samuel I. Stupp, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and David A.         Tirrell, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and four professors from         the Federal Republic of Germany, Claus D. Eisenbach and Oskar Nuyken,           University of Bayreuth, Hans W. Spiess, Max Planck Institute for                Polymer Science, Mainz, and Joachim Wendorff, Deutsches                         Kunststoff-Institut, Darmstadt.  The seminar will have 16 Americans (4          not funded by NSF) meet with 18 Germans for five days to hear                   presentations and to have discussions on current topics in polymer              science.  A purpose of the seminar is to expand the scope of the                personal and technical interactions between the American and German             scientists and to initiate joint research projects.  The relatively             isolated location of the seminar and the small number of participants           will facilitate informal discussion.  The proposed seminar should allow         the American and Germans to explore scientific and methodological               issues in modern polymer science.  The seminar will provide a setting           for presenting and testing new ideas about an important and rapidly             changing area and it should have a positive effect on research in this          field.",
