 "awd_abstract_narration": "To dissipate vibratory energy in structures the coulomb damping or dry          friction can be very effectively used.  The friction can also be                effectively used to control sliding in the base isolation devices of a          structure during earthquakes.  To extend the earlier studies, the bi-           axial sliding and the effect of vertical acceleration under                     multicomponent excitations of more realistic multi-degree-of-freedom            structures are necessary.  Besides the study of the base isolation              effects of a sliding foundation with Coulomb damping, it is also of             interest to study the possibility of permitting the floor slabs to slide        relative to the supporting frame with the purpose of dissipating energy         as well as isolating the supported secondary systems.                           The idea of friction isolation and energy dissipation by using sliding          floors is new and innovative.  If successful, the concept could provide         a viable alternative design procedure to reduce the vibratory effects of        earthquakes on structures.                                                      This project covers only the essential analytical studies necessary             towards gaining a sufficient understanding to the seismic response              characteristics of structures having sliding floor slabs.",
