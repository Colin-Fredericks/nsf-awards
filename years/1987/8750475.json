 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent acquisition, at Edgewood College, of an atomic absorption        spectrometer  allows students to perform experiments and undertake              projects involving trace metals in biological and environmental samples.        In an integrated, interdisciplinary course for non-science and teacher          education majors, students carry out projects involving the analysis of         trace amounts of heavy metal pollutants (lead uptake in plants and              mercury in human hair). In chemistry courses, students determine metal          ions in biological fluids, and pursue student-originated projects to            investigate mercury contamination of water supplies and fish in                 Wisconsin waterways. Non-science majors studying geoscience gain an             appreciation for atomic absorption spectroscopy as a powerful tool in           geochemistry and chemical oceanography by investigating trace inorganic         nutrients in natural waters and determining the trace metal chemistry of        rock and ore samples.                                                                This project helps to meet a need for instrumentation-based                laboratory experiences which excite the imagination of non-science              majors and improve the science education of our future teachers. About          75% of the students directly impacted are women. Publication of                 experiments developed will extend the impact of the project.",
