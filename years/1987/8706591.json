 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, the time interval between successive generations of            high-technology electronic products has been demonstrated to be                 relatively brief in comparison with the time interval between replacing         technologies using historical norms.  As the time interval between              technologies decreases the importance of understanding the impact of            recent technologies on earlier ones increases.  No matter what their            advantages, newer technologies are not adopted by all potential buyers          immediately.  Rather, a diffusion process is set into motion.  The              newer technology may widen the market by allowing applications which            were not feasible before.  It will also provide an opportunity for              buyers of earlier technologies to substitute the more recent technology         for earlier ones.  These substitution effects will ultimately diminish          the potential, if not the actual sales, of earlier technologies.                This research develops a diffusion of innovation model which captures           both adoption and substitution effects.  In addition the models will            have applications in forecasting overall industry demand as well as             market share for various devices.                                                                                                                               The unique contribution of this research is the development of a                parsimonious explanatory model of the innovation diffusion process              which considers substitution decisions as well as the increasing rate           by which newer technologies are replacing earlier ones.  Since the              time interval between generations of technologies is diminishing it is          important to gain an understanding of the impact of later technologies          on the earlier ones.",
