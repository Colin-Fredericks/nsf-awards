 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mental computation and computational estimation are receiving                   considerable attention as curricular topics for elementary and                  middle school mathematics, mainly because they serve important                  functions in a calculator literate society. A careful study of                  the role of these topics in the curriculum is warranted based on                recent research which shows that the development of computational               estimation is closely related to the development of mental                      computation skills and number magnitude concepts.                                                                                                               To explore the interrelationships of mental computation,                        computational estimation, and number sense, a longitudinal                      research project involving students in grades four, five, six,                  and seven is planned.  Long-term instruction on mental                          computation and number magnitude will be given in grades four and               five. The effects of this instruction on number sense development               will be evaluated both during the instructional period and the                  following year.  Instruction on mental computational and number                 magnitude will be provided in grade six, and instruction on                     computational estimation in grade seven.  The influence of the                  grade six instruction on the acquisition of computational                       estimation skills will be studied by comparing performances of                  seventh grade students with and without the sixth grade                         instruction. Transfer effects to related topics such as rational                numbers will also be studied.                                                                                                                                   The proposed research is challenging and has potential value for                both researchers and practitioners.  It has been carefully                      designed with a reasonable development and implementation                       schedule.  The P.I. is highly respected and the list of                         associated staff and consultants represents some of the top                     scholars in the field. All reviewers were enthusiastic about the                project and recommended funding.  The project is planned for a                  period of thirty-three (33) months. An award of $254,559 is                     recommended as follows: $109,467 from FY87, $98,862 from FY88,                  and $46,230 from FY89.",
