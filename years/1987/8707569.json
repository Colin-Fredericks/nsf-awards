 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal represents a collaborative effort between                 F.S. Spear of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and T.M. Harrison                of SUNY-Albany.  The objective of the proposed research is the                  determination of pressure-temperature-time paths for metamorphic                rocks from central New England during the Acadian orogeny.                              The areas chosen for study comprise four transects across               central Massachusetts, southern New Hampshire and Vermont, and                  northern new Hampshire.  Pressure-temperature paths of metamor-                 phism will be determined for rocks of different structural                      levels utilizing a combination of petrologic techniques                         including geothermobarometry, zoned metamorphic prophyroblasts,                 petrogenetic grids, and textural analysis.  P-T paths will be                   correlated with structural evolution through analysis of                        mineral growth in relation to fabric development.  Age                          constraints on the cooling histories of the rocks will be                       obtained from analysis of 40 Ar/39 Ar release spectra in                        hornblende, muscovite, biotite and K-feldspar.  Zircon                          chronology on  the ANU SHRIMP ion microprobe will be used to                    obtain absolute ages on pluton emplacement and to constrain the                 timing of structural development.                                                       The ultimate goal of this research is to obtain 4-                      dimensional (x-y-z-time) control on the thermo-tectonic behavior                of the crust during the Acadian orogeny.  It is anticipated                     that these results will lead to an improved understanding of                    the evolution of the continental lithosphere during collisional                 orogenesis in general.",
