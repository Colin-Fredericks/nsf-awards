 "awd_abstract_narration": "The gliadins, the prolamines of wheat, are the predominant proteins         of endosperm tissue.  Two gliadin genomic clones from common and diploid        wheat have been isolated and their structures determined. Present               studies now show that there are endosperm-specific nuclear factors that         bind specifically to a gliadin promoter element conserved in several            endosperm genes which Dr. Okita has termed the \"CACA\" box.  In this             grant he proposes to study the exact DNA sequence binding domain of the         \"CACA\" and other gliadin-promoter binding activities by gel retardation,        Southwestrn blotting, and DNase I footprinting assays.  The effect of           these DNA binding activities on transcription will be evaluated in vivo         by electroporation of gliadin gene constructs complexed with the DNA            binding activities into protoplasts of monocot suspension cultures or           endosperm cells and/or by employing a heterologous in vitro                     transcription assay. The \"CACA\" binding factor will be extensively              purified utilizing FPLC and DNA affinity chromatography.  With the              purified binding factor, antibody probes can be obtained to evaluate the        tissue-specificity and developmental pattern of accumulation of the             factor and eventually to mediated the isolation and molecular                   characterization of its gene. These studies will contribute to an               understanding of how specific plant genes are controlled during plant           development, and a determination of the molecular events which are              responsible for this control.  The gliadin genes are a highly                   polymorphic family of proteins, which as the major endosperm storage            protein of wheat, are largely responsible for the nutritional quality of        this crop.",
