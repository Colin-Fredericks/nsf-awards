 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this proposal is the development of                    computer aided design and control methodology for the metal casting             process.  This proposal continues previous research which made                  successful progress towards this overall goal.  The specific                    objectives of the research in this proposal are to complete the                 development of a computer software package to simulate                          solidification of metal castings and to improve the utility of the              package for control of the process.  The computer simulation package            will aid in the design of the casting and of the casting                        manufacturing process.  New research will investigate the use of                acoustic emission sensing for monitoring and control of the casting             process and casting quality.  In addition, experimental data will be            developed for use in the software package, investigation will be                made of metal-mold wall dilation for predicting the relationship                between mold pattern geometry and the resulting casting geometry,               and high efficiency computational techniques will be investigated.              The results of the proposed research should provide useful                      methodology and software for an important U.S. industry, i.e., the              foundry industry, and should contribute to improve efficiency and               quality in castings manufacturing.  The work complements joint                  research to be conducted at another university (University of                   Alabama).",
