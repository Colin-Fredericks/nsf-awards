 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work will be done on problems in three areas of complex                 function theory.  In the first, the principal investigator plans                to expand his work on zeros of entire functions of bounded order.               This work will follow up on his recent solution of the Polya-                   Wiman conjecture concerning real entire functions with real                     zeros.  There is one remaining case where the order of the                      function is exactly two, and this will be treated through the                   analysis of functions in the Laguerre-Polya class.                                      Work is also planned on analytic functions whose derivatives            are square integrable with respect to area.  This is the so-                    called Dirichlet space.  The question of interest here is whether               a univalent function is a multiplier for his space if the area                  derivative of its derivative (squared) is bounded by the                        lograrithmic capacity of the underlying set.                                            A third research area deals with conformal or Rieman                    n maps of discs.  The goal here is to find geometric properties                 of the target region to ensure that the mapping function                        satisfied Bloch or Lipschitz growth conditions.  Previous work on               Holder domains should be applicable to this effort.                                     Applications of this research can be found in potential                 theory, fluid flow and grid transformations for two dimensional                 numerical approximations.",
