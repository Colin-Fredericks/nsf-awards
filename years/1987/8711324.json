 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is growing awareness that atmospheric transport delivers              geochemically significant quantities of trace substances to the remote          atmosphere and to inland waters, coastal waters of various regions and the      open ocean.  Interest in the atmospheric transport and deposition of trace      substances has increased significantly in the past 10 to 20 years in part       because this pathway is now recognized as an important means for                dispersing chemical contaminants throughout the environment.  The natural       biogeochemical cycles of a variety of trace substances have, in fact, been      altered by air pollutants in various regions, but the composition of gases      and particles in the atmosphere of the People's Republic of China is            unique.  This uniqueness is a result of material derived from                   anthropogenic sources as well as those from naturally occurring sources.        The major source of air pollutants in China is the combustion of coal and       intense agricultural development in China.  Naturally occurring trace           substances, including mineral dust particles, are important components of       the atmosphere, and chemical reactions between naturally occurring and          anthropogenic materials are now known to be important.  High                    concentrations of atmospheric dust occur in China during the spring and         early summer due to the eolian transport of mineral particles from arid         regions in central and western China.  Understanding the chemistry,             atmospheric transport, and air/sea exchange of Asia dust is an important        biogeochemical research issue.                                                      The objectives for the cooperative atmospheric and ocean science            studies between the U.S. and China are: (1) to characterize the chemical        composition of aerosol particles and rainwater from Asian and determine         the areal and temporal variability in the concentrations of mineral             aerosol, trace elements, nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate; (2) to determine      the integrated atmospheric deposition rates of these substances to coastal      waters; (3) to evaluate the extent to which anthropogenic emissions from        China, particularly those that result from the combustion of coal, affect       the chemistry of the atmosphere and waters of the western North Pacific;        and (4) to identify probable source areas for mineral dust through              meteorological analyses.  The concentrations of selected trace elements         (Al, As, Br, Ca, Cd, Cl, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, I, Mn, Na, Pb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sn,         Th, V, and Zn) will be determined in aerosol particle samples and               atmospheric deposition samples from the near surface troposphere at three       sites along the coast of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and at one        site in the Central Loess Plateau in China.  The concentrations of              sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate also will be determined in aliquots of the      samples by scientists from China and verified by analyses in the U.S.",
