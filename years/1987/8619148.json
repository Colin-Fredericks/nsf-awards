 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nociceptive reflexes are commonly used as indices of                       nociception in human subjects and in experimental animals.                      Justification for such an interpretation of segmental reflex                    responses is provided by evidence that many spinal cord dorsal                  horn neurons have response characteristics related to both                      nociception and reflex mechanisms.                                                                                                                                   Much evidence suggest that our understanding of organization               of some of the most basic segmental spinal reflexes is far from                 complete.  If such reflexes are to provide insights into                        organization of more complex sensorimotor functions of the                      mammalian central nervous system, it is important to focus                      attention back at the segmental level of the spinal cord.                                                                                                            The work of Dr. James McMillan has two goals.  The first is                to examine some basic aspects of the organization of segmental                  nociceptive spinal cord reflexes.  Such \"simple\" reflexes are                   considered as models of more complex sensorimotor integration in                the central nervous system.  The primary focus of this part of                  the study is the differential contribution of synergistic muscles               to the reflex movement around a single joint.  The flexion and                  crossed extension reflexes will be monitored by recording                       isometric tension from appropriate muscles in decerebrate cats.                 effects of body position and other physiological stimuli on                     excitability of the reflex responses of fast and slow knee and                  ankle extensors will be examined in detail.                                                                                                                          The second goal is to evaluate segmental nociceptive                       reflexes as animal models of pain perception in humans.  Such                   reflexes are commonly used as experimental indices of pain                      perception, but there is evidence that some procedures known to                 affect pain perception do not affect these reflexes in the same                 way.  The studies proposed here are part of a long-term effort to               examine similarities and differences between these reflexes and                 pain perception.",
