 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research program for experimental verification of new advanced                computer analysis codes for turbomachinery seals has been initiated at          VPI.  Problem areas for design evaluation have been identified and              current research is concentrating on the prediction and experimental            verification of the performance of liquid and gas seals.  Equipment             provided by this grant will enable data reduction for response and              phase versus speed, orbit display, and frequency spectrum analysis for          up to 48 channels of simultaneous vibration sensor input required for           this research.  The evaluation of liquid seal designs will be made by           monitoring the leakage flow, thermal distortions, pressure pulsations,          and the vibratory response of the rotating shaft and the seal                   element(s).  The equipment provides state-of-the-art capabilities for           monitoring and reducing the vast amount of vibratory data essential to          the total understanding of the various seal designs and the proper              correlation to predicted system response.  The results of this research         work will give valuable information on the accuracy of analytical               prediction programs and the data necessary to develop new advanced              computer programs which can assist in the analytical design evaluation          of machinery components and will enhance the sale of U.S.                       turbomachinery equipment in the international marketplace.",
