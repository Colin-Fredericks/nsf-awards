The conference will bring together                 leading game theorists from throughout the world to discuss                     recent developments and directions for future research in the                   field.  In addition, representatives from the social, behavioral                and economic sciences and from evolutionary biology and computer                science, will be invited to address current applications of game                theory in their respective areas.  The conference will deal with                issues like repeated games with or without discounting, games                   with incomplete information, value of information, bounded                      rationality, refinements of the Nash equilibrium concept, and                   application of the above to imperfect competition and to                        industrial organization.  The conference will also deal with                    cooperative games and will mainly focus on axiomatizations of                   several central solution concepts, such as Aumann's recent                      axiomatization of the Shapley value to the non-side-payment games               and Peleg's recent axiomatization of the core corresponding for                 the non-side-payment games",
