 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to conduct research on high speed high power              milling (HSHP Milling) in the following three interrelated parts:               Sensing of Milling Cutter Breakage, Dynamics of HSHP Milling, and Design        of HSHP Spindles.  This proposal is based on recommendations resulting          from a prior NSF grant.  In the part on Sensing of Milling Cutter               Breakage the algorithm developed and tested in the prior grant will be          used which is based on sampling of the cutting force, synchronized with         the cutter teeth and generating first differences of averages per tooth.        Breakage is clearly recognized by this method and the breakage is               distinguished from changes due to milling transients like entry into a          cut.  In the current proposal an accelerometer signal will be used to           reconstruct the force through simulation and reverse transfer across the        spindle dynamics.  This indirect force measurement approach is necessary        because the cutter tooth frequency in high speed milling is beyond the          dynamic response capability of direct force measuring dynamometers.  In         the part on Dynamics of HSHP Milling the procedures developed in the            prior grant and aimed at determining the most dynamically stable spindle        speed will be automated in the current proposal by means of sensors and         calibration cuts so that the optimum speed for various operations and           tools will be automatically adjusted.  In the part on Design of HSHP            Spindles research on damping in pairs of angular contact bearings will          be conducted in order to include this important aspect in the                   optimization of spindle dynamics.                                                    The proposed research is necessary for the development of HSHP             milling into a practical process.  Solutions to the three problems being        addressed are not available, these being cutter breakage detection,             automatic adjustment to the most stable speed, and design of dynamically        rigid high speed high power spindles.  HSHP milling has application to          milling of industrial components where large amounts of metal has to be         removed, for example pocketing operations on aircraft structural panels,        face milling of steel parts in Army arsenals, and milling of cast iron          stamping dies for automotive parts.",
