 "awd_abstract_narration": "The properties of atoms confined to a small space by                    metallic boundaries will be studied experimentally.  This work                  concerns the modification of the spontaneous emission from                      excited atoms in such a space and the Van der Waals force                       experienced by atoms near surfaces.  An optical standing wave                   will be introduced into the space to exert an additional optical                force on the atoms.  This will allow the control of the position                of the atoms to much less than a micron and to perform precise                  atom - surface studies.  This research is closely related to                    several fields of current interest in atomic and laser physics.                 First, this work my be viewed in the context of quantum                         electrodynamics as a test of the understanding of the                           electromagnetic vacuum state and of the atomic self-energy                      (cavity QED).  Spontaneous optical emission has been suppressed                 and such control over the quantum noise of a optical resonator is               bound to have interesting applications.  Second, this project                   relates to the active field of trapping and cooling of atoms                    using light.  It may be possible to achieve quantum limited                     confinement in one dimension which will give spectacular control                over the atoms as well as permitting some interesting                           demonstrations of quantum mechanics.",
