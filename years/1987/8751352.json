 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Leadership Institute for Teachers of Physics will enable twenty-four        high school teachers of physics to have background lectures, discussions        of teaching strategies, and on site visits to research laboratories             during a four week summer program before they introduce four physics            modules of material of current scientific interest into their own               courses.  High school science teachers have worked with Rutgers                 University faculty, industrial scientists at AT&T Bell Laboratories and         Bell Communications Research to develop the modules: Lasers and the             Nature of Light, Lightwave Communication, Magnetism and Magnetic                Recording, Semi-conductors and Transistors. After the summer institute,         the Lead Teachers will receive continuing logistic and scientific               support through the Center for Mathematics, Science, and Computer               Education in their efforts to introduce the modules into their own              courses and to hold workshops for other science teachers.                                                                                                       High school science teachers have worked directly with scientists as a          five member team to develop science modules, bridging the gap between           institutions that are rich and science and technology and the schools.          The project was funded by the New Jersey Department of Higher Education         jointly with AT&T Bell Laboratories, Bell Communications Research, Merck        and Co., and Rutgers University.  The Leadership Institute will                 disseminate this material by providing high school science teachers with        teaching units of current scientific and technological interest, provide        the teachers with background scientific knowledge related to the units,         help teachers develop  strategies and techniques for better                     communication with illustration of scientific principles as well as new         developments in science and technology to students, establish continuing        relationships among teachers, university personnel, and industrial              scientists.                                                                                                                                                     Teachers, science supervisors, and other school administrators have been        involved in all phases of the planning from the beginning.  A feature           which is particularly successful is the acceptance of teachers as               colleagues and collaborators by the industrial and university                   scientists.  The teachers found the work with the scientists to be              professionally rewarding. The teachers are themselves involved in the           creation of the materials which they will use in their classrooms.",
