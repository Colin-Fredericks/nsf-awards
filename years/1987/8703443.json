 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique                   that uses absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular                      structure.  The acquisition of an FTIR spectrophotometer is                     crucial for enhancing the research and teaching environment of                  the modern chemistry department.                                                                                                                                In the Chemistry Department of the University of South Dakota,                  the instrument will serve as the focal point for three projects                 and three additional projects will make use of the                              spectrophotometer.  The main projects include:                                                                                                                     1) Spectroscopic examination of structure-function                           relationships at solid electrodes used in                                       electroanalytical chemistry                                                        2) Infrared determination of kinetic acidity through                         measurement of hydrogen-deuterium exchange                                         3) Infrared examination of chemical species incorporated                           into alkali halide crystals                                                                                                                               Auxiliary projects that will make use of the instrument are:                                                                                                       1) Synthesis of boron hydride derivatives                                       2) Study of photochemical reactions of unsaturated acids and                       esters                                                                       3) Kinetic studies of gaseous reactions of SOx                                                                                                               The FTIR spectophotometer will represent a significant addition                 to the research instrumentation available to faculty and                        students at this RUI institution.",
