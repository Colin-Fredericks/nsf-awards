 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an Expedited award.  The purpose of this research is to                 produce an Anatomical Atlas for the Blind.  This research will,                 primarily, produce tactile anatomical diagrams of sufficient                    clarity that a blind student will achieve a vivid understanding                 of intricate structural details.  In addition it will address the               issue of computer and automated technology to be used in the                    production of graphic illustrations to produce detailed tactile                 diagrams that would permit the blind to study anatomy.                                                                                                          This research will give to the blind a new and important avenue                 for intellectual development by opening up the field of anatomy;                however, it has much broader implications.  It is very possible                 that this research will initiate the development of computer                    means to produce tactile graphs from two dimensional pictures.                  Thus, this research could initiate a whole new field of                         technology which could permit three dimensional figures, which                  the blind and non-blind could perceive, to be constructed from                  flat pictures, which are completely unaccessible to the blind                   persons senses.",
