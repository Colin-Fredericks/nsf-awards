 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Johnson will continue his research into a                        selection of subfields of matrix analysis.  These include                       combinatorial issues in matrix analysis, the permanent-on-top                   conjecture and related inequalities, Hadamard products of                       matrices, nonnegative and M-matrices and other topics in matrix                 analysis.                                                                            This research covers a very broad range of topics from the                 theory of matrices (linear algebra).  Dr. Johnson has had                       remarkable success in all of these areas before, and will                       undoubtedly continue his prolific contributions to the subject.                 He is very influential with both students and peers.  He                        generates many joint papers with co-authors from around the                     world.  He also has joint work with his students.  The work in                  this proposal also has many applications in the broad range of                  mathematics which today uses linear algebra.",
