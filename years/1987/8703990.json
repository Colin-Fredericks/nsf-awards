 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has become apparant that the key to understanding the                        mechanism and control of genetic information transfer resides                   on the interactions of DNA with various proteins, both                          enzymatic and non-enzymatic.  Specific recognitions of DNA                      structure by proteins are involved at every step of DNA                         replication, transcription and recombination.  Although a                       tremendous amount of information on DNA-protein interactions                    has accumulated over the past several years, the molecular                      mechanisms of the sequence recognition by these DNA-binding                     proteins still remain to be elucidated.                                                                                                                         Dr. Wu will continue to investigate the molecular mechansims                    and functional roles of DNA binding proteins in gene                            expression.  Specific emphasis will be placed on (1) both                       structural and dynamic aspects of the recognition of specific                   sites on native DNA by RNA polymerase and other regulatory                      proteins and (2) the factors that affect the operation and                      regulation of gene expression.",
