 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the performance of parallel systems, and in              particular of homogeneous shared-memory multiprocessors.  These systems         are just now becoming available, show promise of proividing cost-               effective high-performance computing for the near-term future, and              present a wide range of unsolved problems, many of which apply to other         system architectures as well.                                                                                                                                   They will study three specific areas.  The first is the influence of            software structure on system performance; we will explore the sources           of degradation in parallel systems and the relationships among these            sources of degradation, providing guidelines for the construction of            parallel software that performs well.  The second is software control           policies for parallel systems; they will develop and evaluate                   techniques that yield both good program speedup and good system                 efficiency.  The third is performance tools on and for parallel                 systems;  They will build performance debugging tools for parallel              programs, and performance modelling tools that address the problems of          parallel systems and that exploit parallelism themselves.",
