 "awd_abstract_narration": "A vertical seismic reflection profile (VSP) experiment was              conducted aboard the JOIDES RESOLUTION at DSDP Site 504B (Costa                 Rica Rift) during the ODP Leg 111.  The data acquisition phase of               the VSP experiment was supported by the U.S. Shipboard Science                  Support Program.                                                                        The specific scientific objectives of the VSP experiment                were:  a) to determine the downgoing, direct wave seismic travel                time curve for the interval of oceanic crust penetrated by the                  borehole in order to derive a detailed velocity depth profile; b)               to compute a high resolution, upgoing wave vertical reflection                  seismogram for the oceanic crust Layers 2 and 3, as well as the                 Moho and upper mantle; c) to precisely calibrate the VSP-derived                reflection seismogram and velocity-depth profile with the                       borehole lithology and other well-logging information; and d) to                correlate the VSP reflection seismogram and well-logging                        information with the regional surface ship multichannel seismic                 (MCS) reflection profiles.                                                              Initial processing of the field data shows that the quality             of the data is very high.  In this award, Dr. Phillips will                     complete processing and interpretation of this high quality data-               set.  Dr. Phillips is an experienced scientist and the objectives               of the experiment will be completed at the end of this project.",
