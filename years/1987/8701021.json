 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past, botanists have reasoned that the separation of                the male and female flowers on different plants (dioecy) may have               prevented self-fertilization and the inherent problems associated               with continuous inbreeding.  Recently, however, other suggestions               concerning the evolution and maintenance of dioecy have been                    proposed.  Several of these hypotheses are based on the                         differential costs of reproduction in males and females.                        Females are hypothesized to have higher reproductive costs                      because they supply the energy, and water, and nutrients for seed               and fruit development.  Males, in contrast, only experience the                 costs of producing pollen for fertilization.  Because of this                   difference in reproductive costs, it has been assumed that                      females would experience greater stress under low resource                      conditions such as shading, low nutrient availability and low                   water situations and would therefore be found with less frequency               in unfavorable ecological sites.  This prediction has been borne                out qualitatively in many descriptive studies which have                        indicated that in some species males and females are spatially                  segregated along ecological stress gradients.  However,                         differences between male and female plants in degree of stress                  tolerance has been experimentally studied in only three species                 and results have been inconclusive.                                                  This project will focus on differences in stress tolerance                 between male and female plants of several dioecious species under               conditions of low availability of light, water and nitrogen.  In                order to gauge the level of stress tolerance the response of                    plant growth and photosynthesis rate to the stress treatments                   will be measured.  Individuals of three dioecious species,                      Thalictrum dasycarpum, Silene alba, and Spinacia oleracea, will                 be used.  Individuals will be monitored for differences in                      photosynthetic rates and growth patterns within each species.                   Water and nitrogen contents of leaves will also be measured.",
