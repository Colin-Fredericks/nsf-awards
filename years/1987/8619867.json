 "awd_abstract_narration": "Population for small mammals are often characterized by wide                    temporal variations in the number of individuals.  Variations in                physiological responses to stress during reproductive periods                   often limit population distributions within species.  For                       instance, lactation, the period during which the dam supports                   offspring through the production of milk, places particularly                   high water and energy metabolism requirements on small mammals                  that have large litters.  The ability of the dam to make                        physiological adjustments to these requirements determines the                  success or failure in rearing the litter.  Ultimately then, the                 size of the population is partly dependent on the response of the               dam to the metabolically demanding period of lactation.  The                    purpose of this project is to study the components of water                     metabolism during lactation and during non-reproductive periods                 to  determine which and to what extent components are adjusted to               the combination of water and lactation stress.  The species to be               studied are redback voles and white-footed mice.  The voles are                 poorly adapted to dry environments and are often found in desert-               like regions.                                                                                                                                                   The extent to which these two species adjust components of their                water metabolism will thus help elucidate the role of the                       environment in shaping physiological responses of animals during                lactation.  Measuring the components of water metabolism                        represent the first complete quantitative analysis of water                     metabolism during lactation in a wild species.  They are thus                   critical to eventual understanding of the population dynamics of                small mammals.",
