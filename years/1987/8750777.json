 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project entails the coordinated introduction of modern                 spectroscopy laboratories into the Wellesley physics curriculum.  The           instrumentation will be used in the sequence of student work that               includes the modern physics course, a new advanced laboratory course and        student research projects.  The requested system includes a nitrogen            laser and high resolution dye laser, a boxcar integrator a broadband            light source, a spectrometer and lock-in amplifier, detectors and data          handling electronics.  It is designed to be flexible enough to handle           the range of spectroscopic topics that will be covered in the associated        courses.  The pulsed dye laser will be used to study atomic structure,          and the broadband light source will enable students to look at simple           quantum structure in solids.  In the subsequent advanced course, the            lasers, spectrometer and boxcar will be employed for more sophisticated         studies of structure and decay in atomic and condensed matter systems           and of non-linear effects.  Detailed investigations of excitons and the         band structure of solids will be made with the spectrometer and lock-in         amplifier.  This work will correspond closely to the material covered in        the Applications of Quantum Mechanics course.  Students will then be            able to use the same system and the skills they have acquired in their          research and honors projects while working with professors who taught           them earlier courses.  This instrumentation represents a major step in          the upgrading of the physics major at Wellesley.  The overlap of skills         and interest on the part of the participating faculty make it                   particularly appropriate and assure continuity in its implementation.",
