 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since its founding in the mid-nineteenth century, Mt. Holyoke                   College strongly supported science and contributed to the                       development of a place for women in science and of a scientific                 community that reached far beyond the walls of the college.  In                 their study, Drs. Mack and Levin take a broad view of the                       development of science education in America and the contributions               women have made to it.  Their work sheds light on the way in                    which science at Mt. Holyoke was affected by the                                professionalization of science, changing attitudes in the larger                society towards the role of women, and shifting economic and                    social circumstances in which liberal arts colleges operated.                                                                                                   Specifically, Drs. Mack and Levin are pursuing three lines of                   inquiry.  The first is concerned with the ideology and policies                 of the school's administrators, trustees, and faculty, the social               and economic circumstances within which these ideologies and                    policies were formulated, and the manner in which they changed                  over time; the second, with the actual programs, activities,                    expansions, and reforms that were enacted; and the third with                   exploring the results of these policies and programs and                        assessing their possible influence on the scientific community                  and the interested public for science.  Not only will the study                 contribute to our understanding the historical processes that                   account for the participation as well as the lack of                            participation of women in American science in the nineteenth and                twentieth centuries, but in doing so, it will also add to our                   comprehension of the circumstances under which we can expect                    women to respond to opportunities in science.                                                                                                                   This funding of this project is being shared with the Science                   Engineering Education Directorate.",
