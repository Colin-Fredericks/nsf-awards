Given known                              demographic trends and the dramatic increase expected in the                    number of job openings in the academic sector in the late                       1990s it may be necessary for federal policy makers to find                     ways to generate an increase in the supply of new doctorates.                   One possible way to do this is by reversing the trend toward                    longer completion times.  Historically, length of time has                      differed across doctoral fields and within these fields time-                   to-degree has been rising.  Yet, little is known about why                      these differences arise, how important the trends may be as                     determinants of doctorate production, and whether these                         trends can be altered.  A major output of the proposed study                    is a time series data base for the period 1967-1986 for each                    of eleven science and engineering fields.  This data base                       will be used to test a model to determine the effects of                        market forces, demographic and institutional factors, and                       federal and other sources of financial aid.  They will also                     provide some insight into the question of whether the quality                   of the baccalaureate and doctorate granting departments of                      students affects their length of time to completion.",
