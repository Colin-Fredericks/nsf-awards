 "awd_abstract_narration": "The modern methods of Molecular Biology have transformed the knowledge          and skills expected of Biology majors.  Unfortunately, the illustrative         experiments required for effective transmission of the knowledge and            acquisition of the skills are equipment-intensive and expensive.                                                                                                The laboratory experiences of majors in Cellular and Molecular Biology          are being modernized through the use of an ultracentrifuge and                  accessories purchased through thisd award.  The ultracentrifuge is being        used in laboratories in General Genetics, Molecular Genetics,                   Experimental Cell Biology, Immunology and Virology.  Students are               gaining hands-on experience with the instrument in a variety of                 laboratory situations including organelle and macromolecule isolation,          plasmid isolation, and bacterial transformation by recombinant DNA              methods.  In addition, the instrument is being used to support                  independent studies by undergraduate students.",
