The primary goal of this workshop is to delineate the role of graduate          university faculty in increasing the number of minority scholars.  The          impetus is the statis in minority enrollment in graduate school.                Faculty members play a pivotal role in producing scholars through               recruitment, financial aid, mentoring and guidance, all essential to            academic success.                                                                                                                                               The vehicle is a national invitational workshop where specific courses          of action will be identified by 75-100 participants representing                academia, industry and government.  Proceeding will be widely publicized        and outcomes will be assessed.  A national advisory committee will aid          in the implementation of workshop recommendations.                                                                                                              The focus on faculty roles is timely and the planned follow-up                  activities are unique and should aid in the distribution and                    implementation of findings.",
