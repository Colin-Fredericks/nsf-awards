 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project two researchers will study ritual                               performances among a traditional island people of Indonesia.                    Using the technology of video recording, the research will                      document the differences between visual and verbal                              communication during these ceremonies, and analyze the                          differences by showing the videotapes to the participants and                   other members of the culture to have them comment on and                        analyze the ceremony.  The PIs will then return to the US to                    edit their film into a briefer, more coherent vision of the                     ceremonies, and then return to the field to show their visual                   \"model\" of the ceremonies to the participants and other members                 of the culture for comment, analysis, and discussion.  This                     \"recursive\" method of analyzing the communication content of the                ceremonies is innovative and should produce significant results.                                                                                                This research is important because the meaning of rituals to                    participants is a complex, difficult thing to study; yet                        rituals define people's identity, and are key items of cultural                 analysis.  This research will develop an interactive,                           videotape-based methodology which may advance our understanding                 of ritual in general through the analysis of ritual in one                      Indonesian society.",
