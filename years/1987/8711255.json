 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of reliable, high intensity lasers operating at                 wavelengths readily absorbed by most materials has led to their                 use as directed heat sources for manufacturing.  The focus of the               present investigation is the application of carbon dioxide lasers               to three-dimensional cutting and shaping of ultrahard ceramic                   materials such as silicon carbide and silicon nitride.                                                                                                          An important drawback to silicon compound ceramics is their                     extreme hardness, which makes their processing and shaping an                   extremely difficult, tedious, and expensive procedure.                          Preliminary work has shown that vastly higher removal rates are                 possible with a carbon dioxide laser than with conventional                     diamond grinding.  The research to be performed will provide                    understanding of laser machining process, which is essential in                 order to make it technically and economically viable.                                                                                                           The proposed work is interdisciplinary in nature.  It falls in                  the area of thermal processing, bridging across the interface                   between heat transfer and materials.",
