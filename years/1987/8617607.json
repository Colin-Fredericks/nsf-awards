 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central question which motivates Professor Goodman's study is               what is the nature of mathematical reality.  Professor Goodman is               seeking in his research to develop a philosophy of mathematics which            embodies the central insights of both the classical and the                     constructive traditions.  Such a philosophy would be \"Platonistic\" in           its ontology but constructivist in its epistemology.   He found a way           to accomplish this goal by using Lewis' \"S4\" semantics as the                   underlying logic which allowed for a reconciliation of the classical            and intuitionistic positions.  Under this grant, Professor Goodman              will fill in his argument for the classical mathematical realism from           the \"hardness\" and objectivity of mathematical statements and the               empirical verifiability of their consequences.  He will argue that              experience with these features of mathematics allows us to move from            assertability conditions to truth conditions, but that assertability            conditions still play an indispensable role in the semantics of                 irreducibly intentional parts of mathematics.  Using epistemic                  theories which Professor Goodman interprets as combining truth and              assertability conditions, he will attempt a systematic account of               actual mathematical discourse.  This research project combines                  Professor Goodman's deep understanding of mathematics with subtle               philosophical analysis.  His prior work clearly demonstrates his                ability to present clear, well-organized and provocative arguments              for his positions.  His study promises to make a significant                    contribution to our understanding of the nature of mathematical                 realism and its implication in ordinary mathematical language as it             is found in textbooks, monographs and journals.",
