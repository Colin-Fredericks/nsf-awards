 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computerized Data Acquisition is being developed as a part of the               laboratory for  an upper-level course in Animal Physiology.  The course         consists of a lecture series based on the textbook Animal Physiology:           Mechanisms and Adaptations by R. Eckert and D. Randall, and a                   laboratory.  A series of experiments give students an opportunity to            collect physiological data using a computerized system.  Students use           transducers interfaced with an IBM-XT microcomputer to monitor processes        in an experiment through the Lab Linc system.  Using the data handling          software, Videograph, the students simultaneously store the data on a           floppy disk.                                                                                                                                                    Undergraduates completing these experiments have a better understanding         of concepts and of state-of-the-art methods in Animal Physiology, and           thus are better prepared to do further work in this area.  In addition          to its utilization in course work, the equipment is being used                  extensively by both Health Science and Biology majors, all of whom are          required to complete independent study projects.",
