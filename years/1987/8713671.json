 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was                  established in FY 1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the          research capabilities of the strongest and most productive                      predominantly minority institutions.  This planning grant project lays          the foundation for a plan that will increase the institution's quality          of research and research-related training.  Specifically, support for           this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory                  committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial            representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its               current and future potential for performing meritorious research                during the next five years.  Chicago State University will develop              strategies to identify those programs and individuals within the                university that have the potential for increasing minority                      participation in the sciences.                                                                                                                                  The need for this institution to assess its research capabilities and           to increase the participation of minorities in research was well                documented.  The Foundation has supported this project since the                proposed work will lead to increased research performance in an urban           university.",
