 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is being awarded under the Materials Chemistry                    Initiative.  Detection of chemical species using solid state                    devices is an emerging field of both fundamental and applied                    interest.  Chemical sensors based on several different                          physicochemical principles have been developed.  One major                      challenge is to design these devices such that they respond                     selectively to only very few chemical species.  The proposed                    research program comprises a collaborative effort between Sandia                National Laboratories and the University of New Mexico.  It is                  aimed at the development and exploration of a new generation of                 well-defined, inorganic membranes that will allow us to fine-tune               interactions of molecules with surfaces.  Applied to sensor                     surfaces, these structures with channel diameters in the one-                   nanometer range can be used to first selectively admit certain                  molecules into the membrane, and if so desired catalytically                    convert the adsorbed target molecules within the channel system.                The experimental approach includes the hydrothermal formation of                oriented molecular sieve channels on single crystal planes,                     exploration of zeolite-amorphous microcomposites, and the use of                organic templates in the sol-gel formation of thin porous metal                 oxide films.                                                                    This research is a novel application and combination of chemistry               that has been explored in other systems.  The collaboration                     allows them to employ a unique combination of analytical                        techniques for the characterization of these systems, including                 thermodesorption, EXAFS, x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy,                small-angle scattering as well as various spectroscopies.",
