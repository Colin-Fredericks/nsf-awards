 "awd_abstract_narration": "The limitations of standard algorithmic design aspects are being                investigated.  Assertions that certain classes of algorithms are too            weak to solve certain computational problems are being established.  It         is an important aspect of this research that the classes of algorithms          being investigated are not defined in the usual way by resource                 limitations (such as running time being bounded by a polynomial                 function of input length) but by combinational properties aimed at              capturing intuitive notions of different algorithm design techniques            (such as divide-and-conquer, local optimization, and others).                                                                                                   The P.I. is a leader in the proposed approach to dealing with problems          that lie near the boundary between the tractable and intractable                computational problems.  Work of this sort has the potential for                effecting the practice with which important practical problems are              dealt with.",
