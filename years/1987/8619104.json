 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will identify and analyze ethical and conceptual issues            involved in the regulation of recombinant DNA organisms in aquatic              systems.  Statues governing aquatic ecosystems reflect aesthetic,               cultural, and moral values, which provide a context for analyzing               public concerns for the natural environment.  In this project, the              principal investigator will examine concepts of pollution, water                quality, and biological integrity, which are central to the regulatory          framework, in relation to the sorts of changes that recombinant DNA             organisms may cause to occur in marine environments.  The ways in which         such changes are described and classified, and the choice of                    environmental and ecological indices with which to assess risks or              harms, will be crucial to how recombinant DNA organisms are regulated.          The project involves philosophical analysis of the relevant scientific,         regulatory, and philosophical literatures and on-going, on-site                 interaction with marine and estuarine scientists at several University          of Maryland laboratories and centers.  In addition, the principal               investigator will participate in a working group of biologists,                 ecologists, social scientists, regulators and scholars.  Group members          will prepare and critique each others' papers on scientific,                    regulatory, and ethical issues associated with application of                   recombinant DNA organisms in aquatic environments.  Products will               include a book containing the papers  by the interdisciplinary working          group and a series of essays by the principal investigator, for                 publication in scholarly and professional journals.                                                                                                             This project will make a valuable contribution to the understanding of          scientists and the public and its officials about ethical and value             issues associated with environmental applications of recombinant DNA            organisms, particularly in marine and estuarine environments.  Because          of their track record and resources, the principal investigator and             institutional environment are uniquely suited for this project; the             working group members provide the right mix of expertise and                    affiliations to complement the skills available from the institutional          sponsor.  The research design is appropriate; costs are reasonable; and         results are likely to be useful and widely distributed.  Total support          in the amount of $61,668 is recommended.",
