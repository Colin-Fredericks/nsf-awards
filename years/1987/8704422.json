 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this grant in Experimental Physical Chemistry, Dr. Butler will             initiate a series of studies which focus on investigating the                   nonadiabatic interactions which dominate the evolution of chemical              reactions on excited electronic potential energy surfaces.  The work            will utilize polarized emission spectroscopy, which measures the                wavelength and polarization of photons emitted during molecular                 dissociation, in conjunction with state-selective laser excitation and          product detection techniques.  The studies are designed to elucidate            how the branching between energetically allowed decomposition channels          can be critically sensitive to the nature of the electronic surface             accessed, and the subsequent intramolecular energy transfer processes           and nonadiabatic interactions with other electroinc surfaces during             dissociation.                                                                                                                                                   The significance of the work lies in the potential for controlling the          products of chemical reactions via photoexcitation to particular                electronic states.  Numerous examples include photoinduced reactions of         molecules adsorbed on surfaces, energy transfer in collisions of                electronically excited or open shell atoms or molecules, and                    bimolecular or unimolecular reaction in the gas phase or in solution.           As the work explores what molecular structural and dynamical factors            allow one to photoinduce a selective chemical reaction which would not          occur upon thermal excitation, the results could advance the                    development of new methods of synthetic chemistry.",
