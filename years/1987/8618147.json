 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal builds upon prior support, which applied the              theory of convex projections to reconstruct or recover information from         incomplete image data, to develop new and robust image                          reconstruction/restoration algorithms of a class useful in computerized         tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound tomography.              Three specific problem areas will be addressed:  how to extend earlier          research on direct Fourier reconstruction in parallel-beam tomography to        the fan-beam case; how to develop optimum sampling strategies in                magnetic resonance imaging, especially when time constraints on data            acquisition impose a limited-view geometry; and how to develop robust           computerized tomography reconstruction algorithms that do not require a         fixed projection geometry like the parallel-beam or fan-beam                    configurations, yet allow reconstruction in a reasonable amount of time.        This work should yield significant advances in both computerized                tomography and magnetic resonance imaging that will prove useful in             medical applications and in industrial applications of nondestructive           evaluation and quality control.",
