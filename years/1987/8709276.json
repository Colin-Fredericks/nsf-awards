 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to experimentally investigate                  the reactivation of coked catalysts using supercritical fluid                   (SCF) solvents.  Specifically, the following points are                         addressed:  (a) How effective is an SCF solvent in the extraction               of coke forming compounds from a porous catalyst?  (b) Is it                    possible to maintain catalyst activity in situ by periodically                  extracting the coke-forming compounds with an SCF solvent, thus                 preventing any accumulation of coke in the catalyst?  These                     questions are addressed through systematic experimental                         investigations of the platinum/gamma-alumina-catalyzed                          isomerization of 1-hexene -- a reaction system that undergoes                   simultaneous deactivation by coking.  The reaction is carried out               in an autoclave reactor, while catalyst reactivation is performed               in a high-pressure equilibrium cell.  The SCF solvent employed is               supercritical carbon dioxide.                                                                                                                                   Besides the possibility of performing catalyst reactivation in                  situ, the proposed reactivation scheme also operates at                         relatively mild temperatures as compared to conventional                        processing.  Hence any thermal deactivation of the catalyst and                 support is minimized.  Successful completion of this project                    should bring out the potential for devising novel, energy-                      efficient catalyst reactivation schemes.  Besides, information                  from this research also has application in the understanding of                 SCF extraction of lower molecular-weight constituents from solid                coal or any porous matrix in general.",
