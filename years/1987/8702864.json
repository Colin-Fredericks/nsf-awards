 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will continue his research program on partial                    differential equations of fluid dynamics in several directions                  involving both compressible and incompressible flows.  As                       primary goals, he will focus on the following four topics:                              1.  Classical weak solutions and measure-valued                                  solutions of the incompressible Euler equations                                 in 2 and 3 dimensions.                                                         2.  Breakdown of smooth solutions for the 3-D Euler                              equations.                                                                     3.  Multi-dimensional conservation laws and geometric                            shock dynamics.                                                                4.  Nonlinear development of instabilities in supersonic                            shear layers.                                                       The research is in the general area of applied nonlinear                        analysis which is currently an important and active research                    area of applied mathematics.  The mixture of analytical and                     numerical approaches to the solutions of research problems                      enhances the success potential of the research program.  One                    can expect research results from the program with significant                   impact on both the mathematical science community and the                       general science and engineering community.",
