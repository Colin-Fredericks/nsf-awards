 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides $210,000 in support of core projects of the                 Mathematical Sciences Education Board of the National Academy of                Sciences (MSEB).  MSEB was established in October, 1985, with the               mandate of effecting comprehensive and far-reaching changes in                  mathematics education at all levels within the United States.  The              complex undertaking of systematically analyzing and addressing the              nation's needs was launched with the assistance of a $300,000 grant from        Science and Engineering Education and Division of Teacher Preparation           and Enhancement, most of which was applied to a curriculum study.  The          Board now seeks support for the following core activities: analysis of          the mathematics education system across the nation; identification of           critical intellectual and policy issues and planning and stimulation of         coordinated work on these issues; synthesis of the best ideas available;        and communication of these results to state, local and federal education        and science agencies, to parent groups, and to the general public.  The         products of this multi-year enterprise will be periodic reports and             position papers, meetings and conferences, and several Reports to the           Nation.  Funds will be used for salaries and wages of professional and          support staff, honoraria for consultants and stipends for borrowed              personnel, and travel expenses for staff and Board members.                                                                                                     It should be noted that core expenses are estimated at $750,000 per             year, and that financial commitments for this purpose (some of them in          multi-year continuing grants) have been or are being obtained from nine         other federal agencies.  Because of the fundamental importance of               mathematics to science and engineering and to all aspects of NSF                initiatives, this grant is being jointly funded by the Directorates for         Biological, Behavioral and Social Sciences, Computer and Information            Science and Engineering, Engineering, Geosciences, Mathematical and             Physical Sciences, and Science and Engineering Education.",
