 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a fundamental study of the kinetics and mechanism of                    heterogeneous oxidation by metals.  The work includes determining               the identity and reactivity of intermediates formed in the                      oxidation over group IB and group VIII metals with particular                   emphasis on the role of oxygen adatoms on the activation of small               organic molecules and the further reaction of the intermediates                 formed.  These processes will be studied using a combination of                 ultrahigh-vacuum techniques and a compatible high-pressure cell.                Low-pressure studies of the oxidation of hydrocarbons, amines,                  nitriles, thiols, and heterocyclic species will provide a broad                 and general basis for the prediction of reactions encountered in                oxidation processes.  The overall approach is to activate                       molecules selectively using oxygen activation and to determine                  the nature and reactivity of the intermediates formed using                     temperature-programmed spectroscopy and vibrational spectroscopy.                                                                                               These data are valuable in design of catalytic processes in the                 chemicals, drug, and petrochemicals industries and also in                      designing new microelectronic devices electrode surfaces for                    chemical processing or pollution control.",
