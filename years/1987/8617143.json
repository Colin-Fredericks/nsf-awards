The general                topic of the symposium will be the cellular physiology of blood                 cells:  erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets.  Five broad                    areas will be covered:  (1) hematopoesis, the regulation of                     differentiation and development of the three main cell types from               stem cells; (2) membrane skeleton and contraction, including the                structure and functions of contractile proteins in red cells and                leukocytes and the relationships between surface antigens and                   proteins of the cytoskeleton in platelets; (3) anion transport in               red cells and neutrophils; (4) ion channels and activation of                   blood cells, including patch.clamp measurements of K and Ca                     channels in lymphocytes, macrophages, and platelets, and (5) the                phosphoinositide cycle and protein kinase C activation in the                   mediation of receptor signals from extracellular factors.  Poster               sessions, a major keynote address, and a symposium summary are                  also planned.                                                                        This symposium will offer a unique opportunity for                         physiologists, cell biologists, biochemists, and hematologists to               meet together at a single series of presentations and will allow                cross.fertilization of ideas and critical comparisons of results                from a variety of experimental approaches in a variety of cell                  systems.  The published proceedings from this symposium are                     expected to make a timely and important contribution to this                    rapidly growing interdisciplinary area.",
