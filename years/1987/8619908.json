 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three research tasks are proposed to investigate issues of concern in           the earthquake behavior of concrete dams:  opening and closing of               contraction joints in arch dams, nonuniform seismic input, and cracking         in gravity dams.  The first two tasks are computer studies and will             result in significant enhancement of the computational capabilities             available to practicing engineers.  The shaking table tests on model            gravity dam monoliths will provide insight into the crack propagation           mechanism as well as the dynamic stability in the presence of cracks.           These tests will be conducted on a small, high-frequency shaking table          which was recently donated to Caltech.  An additional research task for         the future, the reservoir sediment experiments will be conducted in             actual reservoirs and are designed to provide information on dynamic            water-sediment interaction about which little is presently known.",
