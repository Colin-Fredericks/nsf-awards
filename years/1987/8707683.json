 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effect of halogens on the soot creation in flames will be                   studied in the context of the incineration of modern industrial                 products.  Equivalence ratios, temperature and hydroxyl                         concentrations will be measured experimentally for a significant                range of halogen loadings (halogen to fuel hydrogen ratio).  In                 this manner, the mechanisms leading to soot creation will be                    identified in typical flame conditions.                                                                                                                         The impact of such knowledge would be critical to the design of                 better fireproof materials, where halogens are used since they                  tend to delay ignition (conversely, if a fire starts, they                      amplify the release of soot:  a delicate tradeoff|)  Also, up to                one-third of the pollutants expected from incineration come from                halogenated hydrocarbons (paints, degreasers, etc...), hence a                  serious soot control problem for incinerators or city fires.  In                addition, soot may play in a role in the release of products of                 incomplete combustion (dioxin, furans, ...).  There is a pressing               need for a better understanding of this complex field.",
