 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue the development of computerized                      analysis of bioacoustic signals.  Many animals use sound for                    communicating, and research on vocal learning in some non-human                 species provides models for understanding speech development in                 humans.  Despite this importance, there are few rigorous,                       standardized methods for describing bioacoustic signals, or for                 quantitatively assessing and comparing animal vocalizations.  A                 wide variety of techniques are used now, and many are very                      laborious, difficult to repeat, and often depend                                on subjective interpretation.                                                                                                                                   This work will further develop computer-aided methods for                       quantitatively analyzing animal vocalizations.  The research is                 designed on two related fronts.  1) Advanced, standardized signal               processing techniques will be constructed, to serve as tools for                the description, storage and comparison of such sounds.  These                  techniques will provide a quantitative base for laboratory                      analysis of auditory perception of communication sounds, or for                 field data on vocal communication in a wide range of animals. 2)                These techniques will be used to examine vocal development in a                 well-studied songbird that learns its specific song.  Vocal                     learning in songbirds has become better understood recently                     because of new anatomical and neurochemical information.  The                   specific pathways have been outlined between parts of the brain                 involved in song production and hearing, and specific hormones                  and neurochemicals have been found to affect the production and                 perceptions of the song.  These techniques will allow the complex               vocal sounds of the song to be analyzed as the individual                       components of the song develop during learning.                                                                                                                 This approach promises to provide a novel productive way of                     investigating complex vocal behavior during learning, and will                  have impact on the fields of speech and communication as well as                auditory perception and bioacoustics.",
