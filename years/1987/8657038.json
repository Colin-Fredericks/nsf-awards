 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the interrelationships among fabrication,               microstructure, and properties in two phase alloys.  Within this broad          category, several areas of interest include: 1) The effects of alloy            deformation on second phase particles:  specifically, how factors such          as particle size, shape and volume fraction effect the rotation,                fracture, and plastic deformation of particles.  Practical applications         of this research would include improved modeling of fracture toughness          in dispersoid or inclusion containing alloys, fabrication of ultra-fine         heavily deformed in situ composites, and enhancement of fiber alignment         in discontinuous fiber composites by deformation processing. 2) Gradient        layers:  Sharp interfaces in coated or composite materials may be               eliminated and thermal/mechanical stability enhanced by inserting               gradient layers whose composition gradually varies between that of the          two components.  However, at present neither the theoretical nor                practical effects of such gradients is well understood, nor has the             effect of the gradient's thickness, average composition, or                     \"compositional slope\" has been characterized.  3) Microstructural               effects on crack closure:  In the near threshold region, crack growth           may be retarded by microstructurally dependent effects.  The role of            second phase particles in promoting roughness of the crack surface              and/or mode II cracking.  4) Amorphous metals:  Effects of second phase         interfaces on the behavior of metallic glasses.",
