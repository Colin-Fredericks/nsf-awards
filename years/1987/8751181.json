 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of two interrelated parts.  Four teleconferences          on problem solving in mathematics appropriate for secondary teachers            will be produced.  These will be coordinated with a set of four problem         solving modules.  The effect of this technological mode of delivery on          the mathematics problem solving ability and awareness of preservice             mathematics teachers in Oklahoma will be evaluated.  Comparisons will be        made among teachers who participate in the teleconferences and use the          modules, teachers who use the modules only, and teachers have access to         neither the teleconferences nor the modules.  Because the preservice            teachers in Oklahoma spend one full year as first year teachers in              schools before they are certified, results of the research study can be         generalized to novice teachers in other geographic areas.                                                                                                       This project focuses on two very important facets of teacher education.         An area of great concern in mathematics education is the teaching of            problem solving at every level in the curriculum.  The products from            this project will be four video cassettes from the teleconferences that         can be used for both preservice and inservice instruction on problem            solving.  These video cassettes will capture on film, techniques for            teaching problem solving, as well as making available to a large                audience of prospective teachers and teachers, experts' views on this           subject.  This in itself might have been a sufficient reason for funding        in the Teacher Preparation Program.  However, in addition, this project         will provide information about the use of teleconferencing as a delivery        system for preservice and inservice instruction on a complex topic for          which there is great need.  Because it is impossible to provide quality         inservice instruction for all teachers in the country in workshop               settings, especially in geographic areas where the population is                sparce, the teleconference may be an appropriate manner of updating             teachers' backgrounds.  This project will provide evidence for the              desirability of the use of teleconferences in working with teachers.  If        it is found to be appropriate, it could reform the mode of delivery of          mathematics education inservice instruction throughout the country.",
