 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antibody to the 11S seed storage protein of alfalfa and to the 14.5S        seed storage protein of lettuce were prepared during Phase I.  In Phase         II, the PIs propose to use these antibodies to determine the                    developmental stage of somatic embryos of both crops.  In alfalfa, 11S          storage protein will be measured during zygotic seed maturation and             during germination.  This will determine a timetable against which the          development of somatic embryos can be compared.  Conditions of alfalfa          somatic embryo culture are presented which result in very high rates of         embryo germination.  Somatic embryos from these treatments will be tested       and a correlation determined between embryo germination and 11S seed            protein accumulation.  Conditions which control precocious germination of       somatic embryos will be tested for the loss of 11S storage protein in           alfalfa.  In lettuce, a similar developmental timetable for zygotic             embryos will be established.  Lettuce cell cultures will be initiated in        which conditions for embryo propagation will be established.  Conditions        for embryo maturation will be studied with respect to 14.5S protein.                The overall objective of the proposal is to improve commercial plant        propagation using somatic embryogenesis.  The specific objective is to          determine whether storage protein levels in somatic embryos correlate           with embryo development and vigor.  On this assumption, the PIs                 anticipate improving somatic embryo development by increasing internal          protein storage reserves.",
