 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the processes that create new seafloor at mid-            ocean ridges is a critical aspect of marine geological and                      geophysical research.  Although it is now well accepted that                    seafloor spreading has created the present ocean crust during                   approximately the last 200 million years, the details by which                  new volcanic material is generated and emplaced at the ridges                   remains unresolved.  An important unknown is the distribution and               longevity of subsurface magma chambers in which partially melted                mantle material is stored before being erupted to the seafloor.                 Recently acquired deep penetration seismic reflection data from                 the East Pacific Rise has revealed what appears to be the top of                a fairly continuous magma chamber along the Rise crest.                                 The objective of the present project is to use seismic                  refraction techniques to examine the magma chamber in more detail               than can be obtained from the seismic reflection data.                          Specifically, the project will deploy a series of ocean bottom                  seismometer/hydrophones across the Rise crest and then use                      explosive and acoustic energy sources to record the horizontal                  transmission of energy through the crust.  These data will be                   analyzed by recently developed tomographic techniques which allow               three dimensional imaging using the entire data set.  Specific                  questions to be addressed include the width, depth, and velocity                structure of the subsurface magma chamber.                                              This is a cooperative project between scientists at Woods               Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Massachusetts Institute of               Technology.  The project will be funded at the following levels:                Woods Hole      -FY87=$30000, FY88=$297000, FY89=$87000                         MIT                     -FY87=$30000, FY88=$163000, FY89=$133000",
