 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this continuing research program is to add to          the basic understanding of time-dependent separated flow about bluff            bodies.  Using an existing U-shaped oscillating flow tunnel and                 extensive data acquisition system, accurate separation point data will          be obtained through the use of smooth and rough cylinders immersed in a         sinusoidally oscillating flow.  Four methods will be used to determine          the separation points as a function of time and flow mode: Differential         Pressure Method, Surface Pressure Distribution Method, Flush Hot Film           Surface Sensors, and the Dye Injection Method.  The data will be                compared with those predicted numerically during the course of the prior        investigation through the use of the discrete vortex model.  The                proposed investigation will not only provide the much needed critical           comparison but will also help to generalize the vortex methods by               removing or reducing some of the assumptions.  The interplay between the        experimental data and the numerical analysis will enhance our                   fundamental understanding of time-dependent flow about bluff bodies at          Reynolds numbers of practical concern.",
