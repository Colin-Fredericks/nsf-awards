 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Schmidt is one of the few researchers in the area of                        organelle biosynthesis that is addressed the role of past -                     transcriptional processes in the establishment of the                           phenotypes of chloroplasts.  A complete overview on                             regulation of chloroplast gene expression cannot be achieved                    without a thorough understanding of these events.  He has, in                   the last grant period, made some significant findings.  The                     processes involved in maturations of proteins into                              chloroplasts have been characterized.  The extent to which                      photosynthetic protein accumulation is regulated at the                         posttranscriptional level by selective chloroplasts proteases                   has been investigated.  Additionally, analyses of                               translational versus post-translational regulatory processes                    that mediate the stoichiometric accumulation of RuBPcase,                       photosystems I and II, and the light harvesting complexes of                    thylakoid membranes have been carried out.  Future plans are                    logical extensions of this work.  Five publications have                        resulted from these investigations.                                                                                                                             Dr. Coggin will join Dr. Schmidt this summer.  He will focus                    on isolating and characterizing mutant Chlamydomonas strains                    with photosynthetic systems deficient xanthophylls.  He will                    chemically mutagenize the cells and then screen them by their                   larger chromolography.  The cells would then be characterized.",
