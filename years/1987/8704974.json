 "awd_abstract_narration": "A knowledge of various chemical species formed in solution and on solid         surfaces is important in understanding the fundamentals involved in             various techniques used in chemical, mineral and ceramic processing             industries.  In flotation and selective flocculation, used in mineral           processing industry for beneficiating low grade ores, an understanding          of the interaction between mineral and surfactant or polymeric reagents         in terms of surface species formed is essential for successful                  application of these processes.  An understanding of mechanism of               adsorption is also essential in the adsorption of polymer on cornea and         contact lens surfaces for selection of appropriate polymers in the              preparation of ophthalmic solutions, used as artificial tears and eye           lubricants.  In sol-gel technique, analysis of various species formed           during hydrolysis of metal alkoxide is necessary to understand the              gelling process.  A Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrophotometer,        provided with a sample cell which would permit the identification of            species on solids in suspension and in liquids in situ, will enhance the        capabilities and quality of the on-going and proposed research program          in the above mentioned areas of study.",
