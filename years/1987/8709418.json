 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation tests, cross-nationally, alternative specifications          of a rational choice theory of participation in both legal and illegal          forms of collective political action, using a maximum-difference                research design that entails two-wave panel surveys in the Federal              Republic of Germany, Israel, and Peru.  The portion of the study                supported by the Foundation is the research in Peru.  In the research           the concept of collective political action is defined broadly to                include a variety of behaviors by which groups exert influence on               public policy, including actions that are more or less conventional in          democracies, such as communal activity and legal protest, as well as            illegal acts of civil disobedience and political violence.  The                 generalizability of the hypotheses about determinants of collective             political action will be assessed by subjecting them to multiple tests          within and across countries, and dynamic relationships will be                  investigated by means of a panel design.  The project will advance the          study of political participation in three ways.                                                                                                                 First, from a theoretical perspective previous research has tended to           be somewhat ad hoc.  The rational choice models to be tested in                 this project differ in the extent to which they modify important                assumptions of the \"economic\" approach to rationality.  Moreover, the           project will determine the extent to which other hypotheses - -                 especially those of relative deprivation theory and the socioeconomic           and resource mobilization approaches - - can be integrated into a               rational choice explanation of collective political action.                                                                                                     Second, prior research has tended to focus exclusively on the                   industrial/post-industrial societies of North America and Western               Europe, all of which have very high levels of economic development,             non-repressive democratic regimes, and relatively homogeneous, \"modern\"         cultures.  A major step forward in the field of political participation         research will be to determine the extent to which relationships found           to hold in advanced industrialized societies can be generalized to less         developed countries.  Thus, in addition to an instance of an advanced           European country, West Germany, the research design includes Israel, a          semi-developed country in the Middle East, and Peru, a relatively poor          developing country in Latin America.  These countries differ in regard          to many important political, social, and economic characteristics.              They are appropriate sites, therefore, not only for a strong test of            the generality of the rational choice model but also for investigation          of a variety of contextual interaction effects between macro and micro          determinants of collective politcal action.                                                                                                                     Third, previous studies usually have been cross-sectional and                   correlational, permitting only weak inferences about causality.  The            research design in this investigation includes a two-wave panel                 survey, which allows a test of hypotheses concerning the flow of                causality directly and an opportunity to model reciprocal relationships         between attitudes and behavior.                                                                                                                                 In summary, the rational choice models tested in this project are more          comprehensive, more carefully specified, and more rigorously                    operationalized than in prior studies.  They integrate and subsume a            variety of social-psychological variables that have been included in            previous investigations of the determinants of political participation.",
