 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Chaikin proposes investigations in several areas.             (a) Extensions of earlier work on measurements of the transition                temperature for various periodic, quasi-periodic, and random                    artificially produced superconducting two dimensional arrays are                planned.  The arrays are produced using microlithography                        techniques and the superconducting order parameter is used to                   probe solutions to the wave equation in these systems. (b) Very                 fine scale periodic structures will be used to impose a periodic                potential in a gallium-arsenide heterostructure.  Hall and                      magnetoresistance measurements at low temperature will be used to               investigate a predicted \"chaotic\" behavior associated with the                  Landau band being split into sub-bands by the periodic potential.               (c) Further experiments on the transport properties of                          icosahedrally packed alloys are planned.  (d) Ultra-thin metallic               films epitaxially grown on a semiconductor substrate will be                    produced.  Transport and thermoelectric power measurements will                 be made on these systems.  (e) Thermoelectric power and other                   properties will be studied in the new high Tc superconducting                   materials.                                                                              The thrust of the proposed work is an investigation of                  electrical conduction in a variety of exotic systems.  This will                lead to a better fundamental understanding of electrical                        conduction and may be of particular relevance for                               microelectronics development.",
