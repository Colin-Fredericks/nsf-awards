 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor John Imbrie is an outstanding, young mathematical             physicist who has made significant contributions to our                         understanding of constructive quantum field theory and of                       disordered systems.  His proof of the existence of a long range                 order for the three dimensional random-field Ising model was a                  major advancement for the field.  He now proposes to investigate                the behavior of directed polymers in a random environment and to                develop rigorous renormalization group methods for gauge                        theories.  He also plans to study interacting walks, such as the                self-avoiding walk in four dimensions.                                                  Two of the most interesting problems in condensed matter                physics and high energy physics have to do with disordered                      systems and quantum field theory, respectively.  Professor                      Imbrie's research on these problems has been excellent, advancing               our knowledge significantly.  He proposes to continue and to                    expand his research in these areas.  These are difficult                        problems, but if Professor Imbrie can solve them, their impact on               the scientific community will be important.  For example, applied               physics and chemistry are concerned about his work on the                       behavior of directed polymers.  Funding for this exciting and                   fundamental research is strongly recommended.",
