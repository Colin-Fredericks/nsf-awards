 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for a number of investigations.                     A study will be made, based on a suitable generalized                   version of the Rayleigh-Ritz method, of relativistic effects,                   including the virtual creation of electron-positron pairs, on the               structure of multielectron atoms.  An attempt will be made to                   develop a practical procedure for calculating ground-state                      energies with the aid of rigorous minimum principles.                                   A search will be made for an approximation for the                      spontaneous emission of two soft photons during a scattering                    process involving two charged particles.  Such an amplitude could               be used, in conjunction with a modified perturbation procedure                  derived previously, to obtain an improved low frequency                         approximation for scattering in a laser field.  This possibility                will be examined, and the modified perturbation theory will be                  applied to the problem of multiphoton ionization.                                       The finiteness of the speed of light c can greatly affect               the interaction V(r) of two systems at a large separation r.  A                 study will be made to obtain one form V(r) valid for many pairs                 of systems, and to study the effect of the presence of walls of                 different materials on the lifetimes of excited atoms.                                  The beta decay 187Re to 187Os abundance ratio and half life             T of the beta decay of Re help to fix the age of our galaxy.  The               continuum and bound state decay rates determine T.  The bound                   state decay rate in interstellar space differs from the decay                   rate in the interior of a star.  An attempt will be made to                     calculate the latter rate.",
