 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanism of Disease Resistance in Transgenic Plants:                   Dr. Beachy recently reported the production of transgenic                       tobacco plants (plants regenerated from cells into which                        foreign DNA was introduced by transformation) that expressed                    the coat protein (CP) gene of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as a                   chimeric nuclear gene.  These plants and their progeny were                     less susceptible to infection by TMV, and the appearance of                     symptoms caused by infection were significantly delayed in the                  transgenic plants compared to control plants.  In addition,                     some of the transgenic plants escaped infection.  Studies are                   continuing to determine the mechanism(s) that confer resistance                 to these transgenic plants.  These experiments include site                     directed mutations to alter the amino acid sequence of the TMV-                 CP, as well as its subcellular localization in transgenic                       plants.  This action provides funds to purchase two pieces of                   equipment necessary for the successful completion of the work,                  specifically, a controlled enviornment incubator/shaker for                     bacterial cultures, and a controlled environment chamber for                    holding plants that are infected with virus.",
