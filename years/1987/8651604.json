 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Fast Plant\" kits will be developed around the rapid-flowering Brassica         campestris, a \"new plant technology\", for use in K-12 science and               biology classes.  Approximately 20 hands-on exercises illustrating the          basic concepts and principles of biology and genetics will be developed         through the cooperation of teachers, scientists and curriculum experts.         Inquiry and problem solving through hypothesis testing will be an               important focus of each exercise.  Carefully designed to supplement the         existing curriculum, the final product will be packaged into easy-to-use        kits including seeds, watering system, teacher manuals and student              workbooks.                                                                                                                                                      The rapid-cycling brassicas, members of the cabbage family, have unique         properties which make them ideal classroom subject:  hardiness, petite          size (eight fit into a coffee mug), rapid growth (complete seed-to-seed         cycle in 35 days) and a wide variety of genes expressed as identifiable         phenotypic characteristics.                                                                                                                                     Objectives of the Instructional Materials Development Program include           the introduction of new materials and methods into the precollege               classroom.  This project aptly meets Program objectives in that it is           providing an exciting opportunity for more indepth studies in areas such        as reproductive biology, genetics, physiology and ecology.  The project         director, both by training and experience, is highly qualified to               conduct activities.",
