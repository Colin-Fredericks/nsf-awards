 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at obtaining a better understanding of                   mathematical models for networks of concurrent processes, and the               relationships between such models.  Of particular interest is the               relationship between \"CCS/CSP-style\" models and \"dataflow-style\"                models.  The primary tool to be used in this investigation is a                 collection of mathematical structures called concurrent transition              systems.  Concurrent transition systems, are a generalization of                ordinary nondeterministic transition systems into which concurrency             information has been incorporated in a convenient fashion.                                                                                                      The basic approach consists of three steps: (1) use concurrent                  transition systems to define a general operational model of concurrent          processes, called labeled processes, in which network-building                  operations on processes have simple algebraic definitions; (2) define           various ways of mapping the labeled process model to more abstract              models; and (3) investigate how the network-building operations                 translate under these abstraction mappings.  Preliminary work has               resulted in a simple characterization of a subclass of labeled                  processes, called Kahn processes, which are \"dataflow-like\" processes           with timing-independent, functional behavior.  From this                        characterization, a simple and direct proof is obtained, of the fact            that network interconnection of Kahn processes obeys Kahn's fixed point         principle.",
