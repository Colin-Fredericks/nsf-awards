 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an equipment grant under the activity Grants            For Scientific Computing Research Equipment For The Mathematical                Sciences program.  The project involves the purchase of special                 purpose equipment dedicated to the support of research in the                   mathematical sciences.  In general, this equipment is required                  jointly by several research projects and would be difficult to                  justify on one project alone.                                                           This research equipment support from the National Science               Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions of                       equipment from manufacturers and significant cost-sharing from                  the submitting institution.  This project provides a good example               of university, industrial, and government cooperation in the                    support of basic research in the mathematical sciences.                                 The equipment on this project will be used for research in              parallelism, including:                                                         (1) Multilevel methods for PDE's and optimization.                              (2) Load balancing for distributed processors.                                  (3) Locally implicit methods for hyperbolic PDE's.                              (4) Parallel fast Poisson solvers, and                                          (5) Preconditioners for parallel iterative methods.",
