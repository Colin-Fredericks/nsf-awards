Peter Hartel and colleagues at the University of Georgia,                  Athens propose to conduct research on several critical,                         ecological questions concerning genetically engineered                          microorganisms.  The ability of a microorganism to survive, grow,               and interact in a ever changing soil environment persists because               microorganisms actively exchange genes horizontally for these                   traits.  By asking a series of questions, the investigators will                assess the ecological worth of specific genes to a microorganism                in a root/soil system.  They have used genetic engineering to                   clone and manipulate the genes which encode for endoglucanase and               polygalacturonase in the bacterium Pseudomonas solanacearum.                    They will use the same techniques for the genes encoding for                    extracellular polysaccharide, protease, and lipase.  The loss of                expression of these specific genes will be tested singly and in                 combination for their effect on the ability of P. solanacearum to               survive, grow, and transfer these cloned genes in soil and in the               rhizosphere to tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum).  The cloned                    genes will also be placed in Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas                    aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.  Rhizosphere interactions will                be assessed by use of a rhizosphere cell employing membranes of                 varying porosities.  In this manner, the microbial                              competitiveness of the genetically-engineered bacteria will be                  assessed.  The research is expected to yield fundamental                        knowledge on the ecological value of a specific gene to a                       microorganism in the environment.  Preliminary work on the genes                for endoglucanase and polygalacturonase in P. solanacearum has                  shown that genetic engineering has a profound influence on the                  performance of this organism in a plant.                                                                                                                        These data will be of immediate value to microbial ecologists and               to regulatory agencies concerned about accidental release of                    genetically engineered microorganisms.",
