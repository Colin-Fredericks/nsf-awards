How and                 when galaxies and other large bound systems in the Universe form                is not well understood.  The detection of primeval galaxies,                    galaxies forming their first generation of stars early in the                   history of the Universe and hence at high redshift, would be a                  major step forward.  No such objects have yet been found despite                more than a decade of effort.                                                                                                                                   Two new techniques will be used to investigate primeval galaxies.               The first is to look for the summed light from many primeval                    galaxies rather than for individual objects.  The Principal                     Investigators (PIs) will do so by measuring the brightness of the               night sky at near infrared wavelengths using a balloon-borne,                   cooled telescope.  The second is to make careful studies of                     possible local analogs of primeval galaxies, nearby systems which               are currently undergoing massive bursts of star formation.  The                 PIs will look for a characteristic feature or \"tag\" of star                     formation which could then be used to identify primeval galaxies                at much greater distances.  Radio frequency observations will be                made of a range of star-forming systems at low redshifts, and                   also of the \"blue galaxies\" at redshifts 0.1-1.0, which may be at               an intermediate stage of evolution between local starburst                      galaxies and true primeval galaxies.                                                                                                                            Drs. Partridge and Boughn will carry out collaborative research                 with Italian scientists from the University of Bologna as part of               their research.  The research will involve undergraduate students               at Haverford College.",
