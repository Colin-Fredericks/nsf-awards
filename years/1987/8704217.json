 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:  In most technical applications wherein solids undergo large         deformations, the deformation is primarily non-homogeneous, accompanied         by changes in material symmetry and the development of residual stresses        and permanent deformations.  An understanding of the nature of the              changes in material symmetry and the extent of the residual stresses can        play a great role in the design and performance of manufactured                 products.  To date the changes in material symmetry and the induced             anisotropies due to non-homogeneous deformations, as well as the basic          mechanics of non-homogeneous deformations of non-linearly elastic               materials, are not well understood.                                                                                                                             In this proposal the principal investigator Dr. K.R. Rajagopol outlines         a detailed study of non-homogeneous deformations of non-linearly elastic        materials.  He plans to determine the class of constitutive equations           for which certain deformations are maintainable.  He will also                  investigate the possible universal solutions for specific constitutive          equations.  A related question which will be studied is the stability of        such solutions.  In addition a study of the changes in material symmetry        due to the application of non-homogeneous deformations will be made.                                                                                            Dr. Rajagopal will collaborate in this research with Professor M. Hayes,        Department of Mathematical Physics, University College, Dublin.                 Dr. Hayes expertise in the field of non-linear elasticity will                  contribute greatly to the success of this joint project.                                                                                                        Relevance:  It is the objective of the U.S.-Ireland Cooperative Science         Program to promote mutually beneficial research cooperation and to              enable U.S. scientists to take advantage of special research                    opportunities. This award fulfills that objective by enabling Dr. K.R.          Rajagopal to spend two years in collaboration with Irish scientists with        complementary expertise.                                                                                                                                        Merit:  There is an excellent prospect that the proposed research will          result in a significant contribution to scientific knowledge.  The              principal investigator is a respected, productive scientist, who will be        working with another international expert in this field.  The work plan         is sound and the budget is reasonable.                                                                                                                          Funding:  This award will not duplicate other funding.",
