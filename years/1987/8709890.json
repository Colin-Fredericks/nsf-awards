 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scorpions have appendages on their ventral surfaces, called pectines.           Dr. Brownell has discovered that these serve as detectors of chemicals          in or on the sand over which the animals walk.  In particular, they are         able to detect pheromones and therefore to locate prospective mates and         to navigate to their home burrows.                                                                                                                              In this project Dr. Brownell will undertake what will eventually become         a major study of the structure, function and biochemical properties of          the pectines.  He has already found that the nerves from the pectines           travel to the animal's central nervous system with a high degree of             spatial organization and that this differs considerably for the two             sexes.  He will continue to analyze the anatomy of this sensory system          and to attempt to experimentally determine its role in the animal's             navigation.                                                                                                                                                     Dr. Brownell has also discovered a family of low molecular weight               proteins in the pectines.  These are in a very rapid state of turnover          and differ among scorpion species.  These facts suggest that they are           involved in the pheromone sensing system of the pectines.  Dr. Brownell         will continue his studies of proteins in the sensory part of the                pectines in an attempt to obtain further evidence of their functional           properties.  Finally, he will attempt to isolate and identify the               pheromones of various scorpion species.                                                                                                                         This is stpotentially a very important project that essentially explores        a novel chemical sensing system for the first time.",
