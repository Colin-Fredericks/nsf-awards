 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three high performance liquid chromatographs (HPLCs), a Biological              Oxygen Monitor (BOM), and a DNA filter elution system                           (spectrofluorometers and peristaltic pumps), recently acquired by the           Chemistry Department at Eastern Michigan University, provide                    undergraduate students with opportunities to utilize cellular and               biochemical technology to study the interactions between chemicals and          living systems. HPLC is being used to study the formation of metabolites        and identify molecular adducts resulting from exposure to toxic                 chemicals. The DNA filter elution system allows students to examine             changes in DNA integrity introduced by exposure to chemical carcinogens         and mutagens. The BOM is being used in the study of sub-cellular                reactions to toxic chemicals. In particular, activities are directed            toward the developing field of toxicology, with a focus on understanding        basic biochemical and cellular phenomena as well as determining the             hazards associated with exposure to toxic levels of chemicals.",
