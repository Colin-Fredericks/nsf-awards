 "awd_abstract_narration": "Instrumentation acquired through this project is being used to initiate         a two-semester Molecular Biology course in which undergraduates learn           recombinant DNA methodology in the laboratory.  Major instruments               include an ultracentrifuge with two rotors, UV spectrophotometer, power         supplies, DNA sequencing apparatus, constant temperature shakers for            bacterial growth, a scintillation counter, and two microcomputers with          hard disks.  The instruments will be used in a series of 10-week                laboratory exercises each semester for students in the Junior year.             These exercises will acquaint students with the growth of bacteria,             bacteriophages and plasmids, the subcloning of phage genes into plasmid         DNA, bacterial transformation with recombinant DNA, site-specific               mutagenesis, the construction of a genomic library, nucleic acid filter         hybridization, and an introduction to DNA base sequence analysis.                                                                                               The course prepares students for active involvement in undergraduate            research projects in Molecular Biology in their Senior year.  The               faculty anticipates that this course will create such enthusiasm that an        increased number of students will consider scientific research careers          in the fields of molecular and cellular biology.",
