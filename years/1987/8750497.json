The new spectrophotometers are being used in the General Microbiology           course to construct growth curves of bacteria, in the Parasitology              course to perform experiments on enzyme kinetics, and in Immunology to          carry out protein concentration determinations.  Laminar flows, the             inverted microscope, the CO2 incubator and the new centrifuge are being         used in Immunology courses to manage Myeloma cells.  The miniature and          horizontal electrophoresis systems, the transilluminator, shaking               incubator and microcentrifuge are used to construct physical maps of            plasmids in the Cellular/Molecular Biology course.  The Biostat                 fermenter is used in the Industrial Microbiology course for the                 continuous culture of various microorganisms of industrial interest.            With the equipment provided through this project, students are learning         to use electrophoresis, DNA recombination, enzyme kinetics, and ELISA           techniques, and are mastering principles of tissue culture and the              importance of Myeloma cells.",
