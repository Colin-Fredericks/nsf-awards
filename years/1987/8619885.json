 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Maria Mitchell Observatory on Nantucket Island has                          specialized in the observation of variable stars, specifically                  the careful measurements of the periods within which the stars                  become brighter and fainter.  The data are supplemented by the                  Harvard University's collection of photographs, many taken in the               last century.  The long data interval allows detection of changes               in the periods.  These inform astronomers of actual changes in                  the stars due to their aging.  The Observatory has attracted                    undergraduate students for many summers and some winters.  The                  students help make observations and work on chosen stars as their               projects.  This grant is to continue the students' program.  In                 the past, the student financial support has been only nominal, so               that many of the best students could not afford a summer on the                 island.                                                                                                                                                         This grant is to continue the program of students' observations                 of variable stars and to expand and optimize it through the                     Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program.  The Maria                     Mitchell Observatory commemorates America's first woman                         astronomer and has provided particular encouragement to women                   students.  The Observatory is maintained largely by private                     funds.  Emilia Belserene has been its director since 1978.  In                  part due to her personal experiences, she is committed to                       ensuring that the women at the observatory will have                            opportunities to gain confidence in traditionally masculine                     activities.",
