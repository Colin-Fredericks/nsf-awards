 "awd_abstract_narration": "Euglenoid organisms have fascinated biologists for                          generations, because of their peculiar amalgamation of plant-like               and animal-like features. About 800 species of euglenoids have                  been described, usually quite briefly, mostly from freshwater and               estuarine sources.  Because they are small cells, there are a                   limited number of morphological features that can be detected                   with the light microscope and used in the classification of these               organisms.  Capitalizing on the pioneering application of                       electron microscopy to unicellular organisms, Dr. Richard Triemer               is studying aspects of mitosis (cell division) and of the                       internal feeding apparatus, to acquire reliable new characters of               use in the taxonomy of these creatures.  Already, his work has                  strengthened the view that euglenoids evolved from colorless,                   flagellated protozoa and that they are closely related to such                  protozoan groups as the trypanosomes.                                               Dr. Triemer will survey several groups of euglenoids,                       examining them for the diversity of mitotic and feeding apparatus               likely to occur in the group.  These novel observations, combined               with existing morphological, molecular, and physiological data,                 will be used to establish a reliable system of taxonomy for the                 euglenoids and to construct an evolutionary tree showing                        relationships within the group and between the euglenoids and                   other groups of protists.",
