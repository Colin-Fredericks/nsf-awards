This laboratory based course, Quantitative Materials        Measurement and Assessment, will be taught in January, 1988.  It will           use the student's materials manufacturing and statistics background to          investigate state of the art materials measurement techniques and their         applications in manufacturing process control.  Students will test their        knowledge of fundamental material phenomena through projects, utilizing         computer aided measurement and analysis equipment to asses manufacturing        process parameters.  The equipment requested in this proposal is a state        of the art high resolution, computer driven image analysis system, a            dead weight loading micro hardness tester and precision diamond saw.            Using this equipment, the students will learn that the control of in-           process and final product quality begins with detailed knowledge of the         material.",
