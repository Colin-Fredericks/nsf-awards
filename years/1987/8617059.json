 "awd_abstract_narration": "This continuing grant for three years supports research on how                  visual information is used for human spatial orientation.  One of               the three main spatial dimensions basic to spatial location,                    direction, and orientation is \"elevation.\"  Cues about the                      direction of \"up\" and \"down\" are usually present in the visual                  world.  For the brain to evaluate these visual cues, there needs                to be \"extra.retinal\" information on the position of the eyes                   within the head.  In addition, information about head and body                  position comes from internal position receptors in the body,                    called proprioceptors, including the gravitational receptor                     system of the inner ear and joint and stretch receptors in the                  body.  The relative role of these different systems has not been                worked out, but there is some evidence that in humans vision                    makes a larger contribution than those non.visual cues.                                                                                                         A theoretical approach is developed for the principles by which                 visual field structure influences the perception of elevation.                  Quantitative predictions from the theory will be tested on                      subjects placed in a room which can be pitched forward or back,                 using visual stimuli that are erect or pitched relative to the                  observer who will be erect or pitched at one of several angles.                 Measurements will be made on how pitch of the visual field                      influences perceived eye level, or perceived elevations of visual               objects, or perceived slant of the visual field, or perceived                   pitch of the subject's body.  These influences will be tested                   under conditions that produce substantial distortions of                        perception.  The importance of central and peripheral vision, and               perception of size constancy also will be assessed.                                                                                                             This work will clarify how we establish the relative spatial                    orientation between objects and self, which is a fundamental                    issue of perception, and an issue of how input from several                     senses is integrated.  This research is likely to have                          application to the design and operational criteria for visual                   guidance of machines such as industrial cranes and piloted                      vehicles.",
