 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry                       Program.  In this study the influence of the addition of highly                 reactive lithium or alkali metal salts of organic hydrocarbon                   anions to a series of standard organomagnesium reagents will be                 investigated.  As these chemical species equilibrate, a new                     negatively charged carbanion is formed that exhibits greatly                    enhanced chemical reactivity.  This dynamic equilibrium can also                be favorably altered by the addition of crown ethers or                         complexing agents the sequester the positively charged metal ions               resulting in markedly different chemical bahavior.                                                                                                              Specifically, the proposed research is concerned with                           preparations, structures, and reactions of new organometallic                   species of main-group metals.  A major portion of the research                  will concern magnesiate ions.  These negative organomagnesium                   ions will be synthesized from ordinary organic compounds in a                   number of ways compounds, including addition of coordinating                    agents, such as crown ethers and cryptands, or simple salts, such               as alkali metal alkoxides and tetraalkylammonium halides.                       Structures and reactions of magnesiate species will be                          investigated.  Magnesiate ions generally are considerably more                  reactive than conventional organomagnesium compounds and with                   some substrates furnish different products.  Other                              organomagnesium species to be synthesized and studied                           structurally include organomagnesium cations (RMg+) and                         diorganomagnesium compounds (R2Mg) that are stabilized by                       coordinating groups such as crown ethers.  A portion of the                     proposed work also will involve preparation of new organometallic               species of other metals, particularly species formed from                       organoaluminum or organozinc compounds with crown ethers.",
