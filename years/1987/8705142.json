 "awd_abstract_narration": "Equipment funds are provided to purchase two Explorer Workstations,             two processors, mass storage, one Business Pro Personal Computer, and           one Laser Printer.  Research in the applications of artificial                  intelligence (AI) technologies--especially knowledge-based (expert)             systems--to engineering will be conducted.  These AI technologies               will be seen as providing ways to better engineering analysis and               design.  Three particular research projects will benefit.  The first            is the development of an expert system to assist architects and                 engineers as they check building designs to ensure that they meet               code requirements, in this case the Life Safety Code of the NFPA.               The second project entails a feasibility study of the use of                    knowledge-based systems as assistants when complicated finite element           programs are exercised for both analysis and design.  The last                  project described explores the role of distributed expertise in                 engineering design through the interaction of concurrently executing            expert systems.",
