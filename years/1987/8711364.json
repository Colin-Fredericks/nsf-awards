 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Brooklyn Museum holds a significant body of                         anthropological materials.  One of the most important for                       anthropological research are those objects collected between 1903               and 1911 by Stewart Culin, first Curator of Ethnology.  Coming                  from the Southwest, California, and the Northwest Coast, these                  9,000 objects represent one of the most well documented                         systematic collections in anthropology.                                                 For a variety of reasons, not the least of which is                     infestation with asbestos, this collection has been unavailable                 for researchers.  This grant will remedy this situation by                      properly storing, cataloguing, photographing and cross.indexing                 with the original documentation over 2,000 of the most important                objects in the collection.  The collection will be reinventoried                and thus made available to researchers.                                                 Much information has been scattered throughout museum                   collections and hence essentially lost to us.  With the                         reorganization of collections and their accompanying                            documentation, museums such as the Brooklyn Museum are                          discovering vasts amount of information about Native Americans                  and teaching us much about life at the turn of the century.",
