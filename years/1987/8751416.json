 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Mathematics Project is a three-year program designed to            enhance mathematics teacher competence by increasing substantially the          number of local Mathematics Teacher Projects (MTPs) in the United               States.  An MTP is a local cooperative effort by teachers, college and          university faculty, and professionals in industry to stimulate                  excellence in teaching at all levels, but especially in grades K-12.                                                                                            The project will first organize and conduct a national MTP Workshop to          bring together teams from 20 local areas interested in establishing MTPs        in their communities and 25 resource leaders from existing successful           MTPs.  The Workshop will allow for extensive discussions between mentors        and the participant teams and help the teams formulate specific action          plans for local implementation.                                                                                                                                 During the two-year period following the Workshop, the AMP staff will           maintain close ties to the 20 teams and provide assistance to them in           several ways until active MTPs have been launched.  This assistance will        include a quarterly MTP Newsletter containing useful news and                   information for the developing MTPs, and consultant visits to the sites         of developing MTP's.  In addition, an MTP Resource Manual will be               published, using the experience of the Workshop and follow-up                   activities, containing a comprehensive kit of information and guidance          for emerging MTP's.",
