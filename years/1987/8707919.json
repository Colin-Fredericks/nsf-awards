 "awd_abstract_narration": "There continues to be a gap between the special functional                 requirements known to characterize engineering databases and the                ability of currently popular database theories and software                     technologies to service these requirements.  This problem is                    especially annoying to those designing so-called CAD/CAM databases              from information relating to the design and manufacture of products.            A solution, if effected, is expected to provide significant                     productivity gains in both design and manufacturing.  The problem               stems largely from a lack of understanding of how to manage not the             data about the world being modelled, but the diversity of possible              representations of objects that are of interest in the CAD/CAM                  domain.  This research proposes to make progress on this issue by               first adopting a simplified conceptual schema for modelling the                 objects and relationships of an extensible framework that will allow            results obtained to be extended upward to a richer model when                   satisfying results are obtained.  This proposal presents a plan to              develop both the required theory and a software environment for                 working with the same.  The result will be the construction of a                \"first-pass\" conceptual modelling paradigm for the development of               engineering databases.",
