 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental new method has been recently introduced by                Gordon et al. (1984) to the analysis of the apparent polar                      wander (APW) path for North America, based on the concept of a                  best-fit paleomagnetic Euler pole (PEP).  By analogy with hot-                  spot tracks which also seem to follow small circles, and APW                    path is proposed to describe long intervals during which the                    direction of plate motion was constant.  The change from a                      rotation about one PEP to another is described by a cusp, the                   intersection of two small-circle track segments.  A critical                    test of the novel PEP idea, which in principle allows the                       complete description of plate motion, is the confirmation of                    the sharp cusp that results between the Carboniferous to                        Triassic and Jurassic to Cretaceous tracks for North America.                   The PI will make a detailed paleomagnetic study of Newark                       Supergroup rocks which represent a complete stratigraphic                       succession that encompasses the time interval of the proposed                   cusp.  Location of the cusp within this continuous and well-                    dated stratigraphic sequence will provide firm evidence of its                  timing and paleomagnetic signature.",
