 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently we found evidence which suggests that the Kaoiki earthquake            is repeated every 10.4 years.  The location and recurrence interval             appear to be very stable.  However, the magnitude varies between 5.5            and 6.6.  We propose to study precursors and mainshock source                   heterogeneities of the last (Nov. 1983) Kaoiki earthquake in order              to develop a physical model which may allow a detailed prediction of            the next mainshock in this area.  The parameters which we will                  analyze for the years 1979 to 1983 within the Kaoiki source volume              are: (1) attenuation (coda decay rate), (2) b-values, (3) the                   frequency content of local earthquakes, and (4) seismic velocity                variations using earthquake doubles.                                                                                                                            Our analysis of the seismicity rate in this volume revealed the most            outstanding precursory quiescence reported to data, with the rate               change varying from 0% near the hypocenter to 90% east of it.                   Preliminary results suggest that this heterogeneity of the source               volume is also reflected in the coda decay rate: Stronger attenuation           is observed in the volume which contains the highest background                 seismicity rate as well as the greatest precursory rate decrease.               We plan to determine whether frequency content and b values also                vary as a function of space and how any of these spatial differences            may relate to the complexities of the mainshock rupture.",
