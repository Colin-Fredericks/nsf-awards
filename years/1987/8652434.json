 "awd_abstract_narration": "This teacher enhancement project seeks to improve physical science              education of students in the intermediate grades (3-6) of the Tucson            Unified School District by increasing the physical science background of        142 intermediate school teachers.  The project will also provide                knowledge of, and experience with, instructional methodologies for              teaching science to elementary students, especially activity based              science instruction.                                                                                                                                            College scientists and science educators will work with three four              member teams, each including one HS chemistry teacher, one HS physics           teacher, a middle school teacher and an elementary science specialist in        an 11 day summer workshop.  During these workshops the team members will        enhance their science background and prepare materials for the inservice        program which they will deliver to the intermediate teachers during two         duplicate workshops of 14 sessions each during the academic year.  One          member of each team, the middle school teacher, will provide follow-up          support to the intermediate teachers as they implement the program in           their classrooms.  Principals will also participate in an inservice             program which will enable them to provide support and leadership for the        science program in their schools.  The ESS science materials will be            focal ingredients of both the inservice program and the science teaching        in grades 3-6.                                                                                                                                                  The project involves a unique collaboration of college and university           scientists and science educators, local industrial scientists and school        district teachers and supervisors from all levels.  The vita of the             staff indicate that they are well qualified in terms of both background         and experience to carry out the project successfully.  The Tucson               Unified School District is committed to the project as evidenced by a           considerable amount of cost-sharing.  The project will be evaluated             utilizing both internal and external evaluators.",
