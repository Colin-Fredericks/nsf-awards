 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will investigate the nature of the mitotic                     motility systems that move chromosomes.  The specific aim is to                 distinguish between and characterize the different components                   that collectively generate motility in the aster, and to                        determine which are involved in chromosome movement.  The                       transport properties of the aster will be examined at highest                   microscopic resolution, and then the effects of metabolic                       inhibitors on the polewards and antipolewards movements will be                 compared with the behaviour of prometaphase chromosomes.  The                   principal investigator will ascertain whether the higher plant                  spindle, with its broad open poles, shows a response similar to                 the contraction of prometaphase chromosomes induced in the                      radially organized, centric mammalian spindle by metabolic                      inhibitors.  Similar observations on the phragmoplast may show                  what its transport properties have in common with                               astral transport.  The permeabilized cell model, successful in                  investigating anaphase A, will now be used in attempts to                       reactivate prometaphase chromosome activity and astral transport.               Studies will examine chromosome movement, and any concurrent                    microtubule disassembly,by exposing PtK cells to ATP and various                analogs and inhibitors.                                                               The mechanisms responsible for chromosome movement during                 cell division remain one of the least understood, but important                 issues in cell biology.  Results obtained during the course of                  this project, on the comparative physiology of polar and                        antipolar transport, should substantially contribute to our                     understanding of these mechanisms.",
