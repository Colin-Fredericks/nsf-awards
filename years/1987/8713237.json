He will focus especially on obtaining measurements that            will explain effects of the forest-grassland boundary on tree species           composition, on the effects of altitude on forest mix, and on the               responses of vegetation to natural and human disturbances.                              This project will yield important insights into processes of            vegetational change in a fragile montane environment where small                disturbances or changes in ecological conditions have major and                 far-reaching consequences.  The anticipated findings will increase our          understanding of the ecology of fragile and marginal environments; the          results that will be obtained for the study area in Peru will be                applicable to similar environments in other parts of the world.",
