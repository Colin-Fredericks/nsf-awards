 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator intends to study limit distributions         of eigenvalues of random matrices of large, asymptotically infinite             dimensions.  Random matrices are assumed to have i. i. d. columns. Dr.          Yin has already obtained certain results on the existence of limit              distributions.  He now intends to obtain further results in that                direction, and to study convergence to the limit distribution when the          matrix size goes to infinity, including the case when the ratio of the          number of rows to the number of columns tends to zero.  The rate of             convergence will also be investigated, possibly using some preliminary          numerical calculations to get insight into the nature of the problem.           Dr. Yin also wants to study the limit value of the maximal and the              minimal eigenvalues, where he can employ some combinatorial                     techniques.                                                                             Random matrices constitute an active area of research in                probability theory.  Potential applications of random matrices include          signal processing, ecomomic games, computer science and other.                  Problems studied under this project may be related to studies in                signal processing, in particular to those involving a large number of           signals and sensors in complex communication systems.",
