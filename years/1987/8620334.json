 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamentel understanding of soil behavior under cyclic loading               conditions such as in machinre foundations and construction siting              conditions under heavy vehicular traffic is, at best, inadequate.  A            high safety factor is generally used in large construction operations           due to the inability to quantitatively predict the soil behavior under          these conditions.  The research develops a model of granular soils based        on a particulate mechanics approach for a wide range of strains and             incrementel loading conditions.  Specific quantitative models will be           developed and verified under laboratory conditions and from field data.                                                                                         The research makes systematic efforts to develop soil models and                compares the macroscopiv ptedictiond and relates the results with the           micromechanic phenomena at grain and contact levels.  The results will          provide quantitative   verification of the densification phenomena              developed by the investigator.      Large scale experiments for this            research will be carried in a unique test facility, in cooperation with         the University of Texas.                                                                                                                                        The principal investigator is a recognized expert in this research area.        A grant is recommended.",
