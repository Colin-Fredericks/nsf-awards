(The sole                     exceptions, due to budgetary constraints, were in l979 and                      l981.) These surveys provide data sets that are very widely used                by social scientists, especially to examine recent trends in                    American society. Because the core of the GSS is a set of                       questions that is identically repeated each year, the survey                    provides a uniquely valuable source of trend data for the                       research community.                                                                                                                                             The value of the GSS is also enhanced by the speed with which it                is distributed to the research community. Each year's survey is                 pretested in the Winter, conducted in the Spring, and made                      available to universities around the country in the Fall. Thus,                 the data are available during the year in which the survey was                  conducted. In addition, its complete documentation and easy                     access have made the GSS very widely used in the training of                    young scientists.                                                                                                                                               In addition to a core of replicated items, each year's GSS                      includes a unique module which either repeats portions of a                     classic study conducted 20 to 30 years previously and/or a                      module which addresses a topic of special interest to the                       research community. Recently included topics include batteries                  of questions pertaining to respondents' socio-political                         participation and their attitudes toward poverty. Current plans                 tentatively call for future modules on religion and family. The                 analyses of these special topics is greatly facilitated by the                  inclusion of the core items because they provide a wide range of                attitudinal, behavioral and demographic variables to be related                 to the items in the module.                                                                                                                                     Each year's GSS also includes a module that is developed by an                  international board of scientists. This international                           collaboration began in l980, and involved the principal                         investigators of the GSS and several social scientists from                     (ZUMA) in West Germany. They met to work on the design of a West                German survey to be modeled after the GSS, and they agreed to                   include common modules on such topics as family life and job                    values in their respective countries' surveys. British and                      Australian scientists were next to join the international                       research group, and scientists from five other European nations                 are expected to join in the next few years. These collaborative                 activities are building a data set that will greatly promote                    systematic cross-national research on topics of mutual interest                 to social scientists of different nationalities.                                                                                                                This award is for the first year of a five year cycle of the                    General Social Survey, to be conducted between l988 and l992.",
