 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of adhesive joints in the ccnstruction of various products is an        attractive alternative to mechanical fasteners.  The greatest problem in        structural bonding is the inability to quantify the strength of the             bonded assembly for design, quality control or maintenance.  Current            nondestructive evaluation methods have not been successful in solving           this problem.  This proposal is directed toward the evaluation of the           feasibilty of utilizing multiple-variable NDE methods to provide fast,          cost-effective, reliable determination of the strength of adhesive bonds        through the use of the IMPACT SONIC WAVE SPECTRAL ANALYSIS method.  The         potential for applying this method is evidenced by its previous                 successful application to evaluation of wood and wood products.                 Variations in material type, bonded area, quality, aging, stress                history, density and curing will be evaluated by SONIC WAVE NDE methods,        combined with destructive testing.  A model will be developed and               verified which can predict bond strength within a target of + 15                percent.                                                                                                                                                        The Principal Investigator is well qualified to conduct the research.           It is anticipated that the results will prove the validity of the               proposed NDE approach to predict the strength and stiffness of an               individual adhesive joint with a high level of reliability.  Such               results will indicate the direction to be taken with additional                 combinations of materials, adhesives and NDE equipment development.  The        results should provide the basis for a new design method for adhesives.
