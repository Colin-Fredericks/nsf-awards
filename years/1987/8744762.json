 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in our               understanding of how the human immune system functions.  Advances in            molecular genetics have led to a deeper understanding of the genetic            control of immune response, and are currently leading to an expansion of        our knowledge of the relationship between genes and certain human               cancers.  But knowledge of these conceptual advances in biology and of          the health-related applications has not yet filtered into the high              school curriculum.  In this project, the Biological Sciences Curriculum         Study, in conjunction with the Foundation for Blood Research, will              develop, field test, and distribute an instructional monograph on               advances in immunology and immunogenetics for use by high school                teachers and students.  The first half of the monograph will be devoted         to an update for teachers and to suggestions for introducing immunology         content into the existing secondary school biology curriculum.  The             second half will be devoted to classroom activities.                                                                                                            The monograph will be distributed by the National Association of Biology        Teachers to its 6000 members and by the National Center for Education in        Maternal and Child Health to others on a per-request basis.",
