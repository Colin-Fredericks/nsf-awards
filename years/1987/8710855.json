 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates novel algorithms for database                 processing in multicomputer systems. Parallel architectures for                 database  processing need to incorporate both parallel processors               (CPU's) and parallel I/O (disk access) capability. This research                is focused on a boolean n-cube connected architecture, with a                   disk attached to each node, thereby providing parallel I/O. The                 need to support parallel I/O gives rise to two important issues:                data combination and non-uniform data distribution.  Since the                  cube interconnection subsumes many other structures such as                     trees, rings, etc., this property is exploited to efficiently                   support data combination in a variety of database operations such               as Selection, Aggregation, Join, and Projection.  The research                  involves both analytic and simulation study of various database                 operations under a variety of initial and intermediate data                     distribution conditions, using a 64-node hypercucbe.                                    Modern fabrication techniques make it possible to produce               hundreds or even thousands of computing elements (processors) at                low cost. The significance of this research is that parallel                    processing algorithms are critical to harnessing the fabrication                potential to produce real benefit for applications such as                      database processing. Support is provided under the Research                     Initiation activity for New Investigators.",
