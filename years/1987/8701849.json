 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now clear that most animal cells are able to share                   small molecules with their rs by means of cell-to-cell channels.                An impressive set of evidence es that these channels are found in               \"gap junctions\", membrane specializations which have been                       analyzed with a variety of methods.  In addition to the                         permeability properties and structural features of gap junctions,               investigators are currently studying the regulation of the                      channel, the constituent proteins, the related ge nes, and the                  role of these intercellular junctions in development and normal                 tissue function. In this proposal partial support is requested                  for an International Conferenece on Gap Junctions to be held at                 the Asilomar Conference Center in California, in July of 1987.                  Over 100 new and established investigators will assemble to                     discuss new findings gleaned from a variety of experimental                     approach es (cell biology, immunology, microscopy, and genetics).               The Cell Biology Program recognizing the timliness of this                      conference, the quality of invited speakers, a nd the emphasis on               including young workers, recommends that an award be made.",
