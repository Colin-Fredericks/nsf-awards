 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a three-year cooperative research project in            risk analysis that will involve Professor Lucien Duckstein, University          of Arizona; Professor Istvan Bogardi, University of Nebraska; and three         faculty members at the Vienna Agricultural University in Austria: H.-P.         Nachtnebel, S. A. Radler, and J. Fuerst.  The collaborative effort is           concerned with an examination of multicriterion decision-making (MCDM)          tools that have been applied to model the mitigation of the hazardous           effects of water resources development on the human environment.  Fuzzy         set theory and Bayesian theory will be combined with MCDM techniques to         develop methodologies that take into account the existence of both              imprecision and uncertainty in water resource systems.  These                   methodologies will be applied to three illustrative, real-world problem         areas: water-related power systems, regional water system design, and           multicriterion groundwater management.  Special emphasis will be placed         on interactive computer techniques as well as graphical display of the          data, definition of the model structure, and generation of                      alternatives.  A clear representation of system output will be sought,          as well as the proper design of a knowledge base to aid in the decision         process.                                                                                                                                                        Decision makers in the water resources field and related areas are              currently without the requisite analytical tools to incorporate risk,           uncertainty, and imprecision in the decision-making process in an               adequate way.  There is thus a recognized need for further development          of risk analysis methodology, especially within a multicriterion                framework.  The cooperating researchers in this project will attempt to         improve risk assessment and management methodology by demonstrating how         trade-offs can be made between environmental risks and corresponding            costs.  Specific applications to water resources and hazardous waste            management in the United States and Austria will be sought.  The                selected application areas are important in both countries, and require         the utilization of advanced methods of risk analysis for thorough               study.  Both the U.S. and the Austrian partners in this effort have             carried out intensive research activity in MCDM analysis of water               resources engineering systems and in risk/reliability analysis, and the         project is expected to benefit greatly from their combined expertise.",
