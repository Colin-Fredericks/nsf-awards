 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important aspect of design is the balancing of conflicting              objectives into a unified goal.  Thus, the designer can be viewed as            a decision maker charged with identifying alternatives that best                match the overall design objectives.  This research focuses on                  methods to represent design goals in an operational form, suitable              for standard optimization formulations.  The goal of the research is            to contribute to the understanding of decision making in design and             the formalization of this process in computations.  The research                will focus on three aspects of the formalization of the decision                process: the construction of operational models for the aggregation             of design objectives and the representation of preference                       structures; the incorporation of decision making models and                     optimization algorithms into a unique computational process; and the            management of this information in a rule-based, computational                   environment.  The methodology relies on fuzzy set representation of             criteria for design evaluation and on the exploitation of                       sensitivity and constraint activity information to facilitate the               communication between optimization and decision making.  The                    implementation of these ideas in a computational environment will               promote and organize the understanding of the process of decision               making in design.",
