 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop an automated,                      computerized and integrated evaporative heat-moisture control                   system in the solid substrate fermentation of ammonia freeze                    explosion treated wheat straw by Trichoderma reesei for cellulase               production.  The system is based on blowing dry air through the                 moist substrate to cause controlled evaporative cooling, at the                 same time replenishing lost water by cool water spray.                                                                                                          Solid substrate fermentation (SSF) could be an alternative to                   submerged fermentation (SF) for producing fuel and animal feed                  from agricultural residues such as wheat straw and corn stover.                 The main advantage of SSF, compared to SF, is the high volumetric               productivity which is based on the low water content of substrate               and product.  This reduces fermenter volume, simplifies                         technology, increases product concentration and saves the cost of               water removal.  The most critical problem for SSF commercialization             is the control of moisture and temperature.  The PIs plan to design             and test a completely automated and computerized system based on                blowing dry air through the moist substrate to cause controlled                 evaporative heat removal, and at the same time replenishing lost                water by cool water spray to maintain constant moisture.  If the                concept can be proven in this research, a realistic technical base              will be available for the scale-up of SSF processes.",
