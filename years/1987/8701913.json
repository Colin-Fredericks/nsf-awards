 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the rabbit, most immunoglobulin (Ig) nominal allotypes are              presumed to be inherited via codominant allelic segregation.  However,          latent or non.allelic gene activation has been documented for the Ig            kappa light and gamma heavy chain gene loci.  Serological and structural        analyses have confirmed the existence of these latent Ig allotypes.             Molecular mechanisms acting at the nucleic acid level which allow the           expression of latent allotypes have yet to be determined.  A major              obstacle in studying the expression of latent Ig allotypes has been the         inability reproducibly to induce the expression of latent Ig molecules.         This obstacle has been circumvented by antigenic stimulation using              Trypanosoma brucei to induce the expression of latent Ig kappa light and        gamma heavy chain sequences in the rabbit.  Lymph nodes taken from              infected rabbits have been shown to contain poly (A) positive RNA               sequences encoding latent kappa light and gamma heavy chain allotypes.          This represents the first time latent allotypes have been detected at the       nucleic acid level.  The long term objective of this investigation is to        elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms which generate the expression       of nucleic acid sequences encoding latent Ig allotypes.  To achieve this        the following specific aims will be pursued:  Isolation and structural          analysis of poly (A) . positive RNA sequences encoding:  1) latent b5 and       b6 kappa light chains, 2) the latent a1.e14 haplotype, 3) the nominal b6        kappa light chain secreted by the rabbit.mouse hybridoma cell line H158.        Isolation of these RNA sequences will be achieved by employing standard         duplex cDNA cloning technology and novel allotype.specific screening            methodologies.  Isolation of cDNA sequences encoding latent Ig allotypes        will verify their existence at the nucleic acid level and allow direct          structural comparisons to be made with their nominal allotypic                  counterparts.  Information obtained will be used in future studies              designed to isolate the actively transcribed Ig kappa and gamma genes           encoding these latent sequences.                                                     These studies will contribute to our overall understanding of the          regulation of Ig gene expression.",
