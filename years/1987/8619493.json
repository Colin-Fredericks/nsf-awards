This is a          continuation of a 1982 U.S.-China Program cooperative research grant.                                                                                           This project addresses problems at the forefront of current research            on amorphous crystalline materials.  Amorphous silicon is a promising           material for many solid state devices.  A better understanding of               these materials is expected to improve the quality and reproducibility          of semiconductors which are useful for large area solar cells and               numerous electronic and optical devices.   The  Chicago and Shanghai            groups' combined expertise on semiconductor physics and materials               preparation and characterization will promote the U.S.-China                    Cooperative Science Program's objective of advancing scientific                 knowledge through international collaborative research.",
