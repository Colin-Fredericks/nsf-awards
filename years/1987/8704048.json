 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student populations.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  The University of Puerto          Rico-Rio Piedras will use RIMI support to enhance its surface science           research facilities.  The project will focus on two major areas: (1)            Optical and electrical properties of co-sputtered semiconductor and             metal-insulator films.  This component will include studies of                  hydrogenated amorphous semiconductor alloys, superlattices and                  localized gap states; and (2) Optical studies of solid surfaces.  This          component will analyze the surface enhanced Raman Scattering in                 granular composites and surface plasmons on rough metal surfaces.                                                                                               The experimental techniques for this project will include the use of            Auger electron spectroscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy,                 secondary ion mass spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy,              light scattering and attenuated total reflection procedures, infrared           and picosecond spectroscopy.  The principal investigator is a well              trained physicist who has published over 40 articles in refereed                journals.  The Foundation has supported this project because more               opportunities will be available for minorities to participate in state          of the art surface science research.",
