Interdisciplinary and team-           taught courses in solid state physics and in semiconductor device               physics are being established jointly by the departments of Physics,            Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering and Engineering              Science.  These lecture courses are being supported by laboratory               courses in both subjects to be first offered in the Fall of l987, and           they are to be required for all engineering students opting for a major         in microelectronics.  A dedicated computer and data acquisition system          will be acquired for  the laboratory which supports both of these               courses; a programmable lock-in amplifier will also be used in several          of the experiments.  These instruments will make for a fully modern             laboratory where students will gain experience in modern data                   acquisition techniques, as well as in the principles of solid state             physics and of semiconductor device physics.",
