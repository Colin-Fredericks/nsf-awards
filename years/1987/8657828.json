 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several closely-related areas of research will be pursued                  by this Presidential Young Investigator.  One area of research is               the creation of an interactive spatial mechanism synthesis and                  analysis computer package.  Such a package would, for the first                 time, place spatial mechanism design capabilities in the hands of               practicing designers.  Instrumental in this plan are efficient and              understandable methods for the designer to specify design                       requirements and to review results.  A significant amount of high-              level computer graphics will be necessary for displaying such                   information.  Further, it will be necessary for such a design                   package to contain optimization procedures that eliminate many of               the intermediate, low-level decisions currently required in the                 interactive design process.                                                          Another area of research is the design of closed-loop robotic              manipulators having many degrees of freedom.  These robots will be              superior to present open-loop manipulators in load-carrying                     capacity, accuracy, and dexterity.  The final area of research is               the design of high-speed bearings and shaft couplings.  Improved                theories in this area are expected to lead to a variety of                      applications including machine tools and turbomachinery.",
