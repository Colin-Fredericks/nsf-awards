 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the mature nervous system, cortical area 17 (primary                    visual cortex) receives afferent projections from the dorsal                    lateral geniculate nucleus and the cholinergic basal forebrain                  system.  This project will use light and electron microscopic                   techniques in laboratory rats to study development of each                      projection system, and to study how the two systems may interact                during development.                                                                                                                                                  Dr. Robertson and his colleagues have preliminary evidence                 suggesting that the geniculocortical system expresses                           acetylcholinesterase (AChE) transiently during the time when                    geniculocortical axons are invading the cortex and undergoing                   synaptogenesis with cortical neurons.  The function of the                      transient AChE is unknown, but is of interest because: (1) it                   appears to serve as a reliable endogenous marker for developing                 geniculocortical axons, and (2) the presence of AChE suggests                   that the developing geniculocortical axons may interact with the                developing cholinergic afferents from basal forebrain.                          Particular attention will be paid to time of arrival, laminar and               areal patterns, and ultrastructural morphology of each afferent                 system.  Possible interaction between the two afferent systems                  will be determined by studying the development of one system in                 the absence of the other.  Possible functions of the transient                  AChE will be studied by determining the effect of AChE inhibition               on development of normal morphology and by biochemical                          characterization of the transient AChE and its possible                         endogenous substrate.                                                                                                                                                Dr. Robertson is an experienced neuroanatomist who has made                substantial contributions to our knowledge of transient AChE                    expression in development.  The results of these studies will                   provide new information about the formation of thalamocortical                  connections in the developing nervous system, and about the role                of AChE in development.",
