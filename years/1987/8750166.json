 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is expanding and strengthening undergraduate offerings in          animal behavior and behavioral ecology through the purchase of equipment        that makes it possible to quantify aspects of what has been largely a           descriptive field.  It facilitates expansion of the range of techniques         introduced and used in the laboratory exercises of the Animal Behavior          course, and increases the diversity and sophistication of independent           study and/or senior thesis projects available to students interested in         these areas.                                                                                                                                                    The students use the event recorders to document sequences and temporal         patterning of behavior.  Tape recorders, a sonagraph and a sonogram             digitizer are allowing students to record and analyze vacalization in           detail -- critical elements in understanding territoriality, breeding           behavior and other aspects of animal interaction.  A motion analyzer            makes possible detailed examination of locomotion, stimulus-response            sequences, and related phenomena.",
