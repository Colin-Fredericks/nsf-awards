 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award partially supports several U.S. and Latin American                   participants in a regional workshop about the Nevada del Ruiz                   Volcano, to be held in Manizales, Colombia in November, 1987.  The              workshop is being organized by Dr. Stanley N. Williams of Louisiana             State University, with assistance from staff of the newly                       established volcanological observatory in Manizales.  Additional                support is being provided by COLCIENCIAS, the Colombian equivalent              of NSF, and by other sources.  The aim of the workshop is to                    develop a comprehensive model of the Nevada del Ruiz volcano by                 reviewing and integrating the various data accumulated by                       geologists, geophysicists, and geochemists since the catastrophic               1985 eruption of this still active volcano.                                                                                                                     The workshop should result in a scientifically valuable synthesis               which will improve our understanding of what is occurring beneath               the surface of this unusual volcano.  Prior to its eruption, Nevada             del Ruiz was not classified as \"high risk\"; more than 18 months                 after erupting, it is continuing to demonstrate an unusually high               level of activity compared to similar volcanoes which have erupted              in the past few years.  By holding the workshop in the vicinity of              the volcano itself, visiting scientists will benefit directly from              on-site observations and the opportunity to interact with local                 scientists to develop mutually beneficial collaborative projects.               Scientific attention often diminishes soon after the spectacle of               an eruption.  Holding the workshop now will help to maintain                    momentum in the research and the development of long-term volcano               monitoring strategies that should lead to increased geophysical                 understanding of volcanic processes in general.",
