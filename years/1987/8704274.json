 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an equipment grant under the activity Grants            For Scientific Computing Research Equipment For The Mathematical                Sciences program.  The project involves the purchase of special                 purpose equipment dedicated to the support of research in the                   mathematical sciences.  In general, this equipment is required                  jointly by several research projects and would be difficult to                  justify on one project alone.                                                           This research equipment support from the National Science               Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions of                       equipment from manufacturers and significant cost-sharing from                  the submitting institution.  This project provides a good example               of university, industrial, and government cooperation in the                    support of basic research in the mathematical sciences.                                 The research projects supported by this equipment include               work in numerical harmonic analysis, the study of partial                       differential equations, Riemann surfaces, Teichmuller spaces and                Kleinian groups, and computational problems in real and complex                 geometry.",
