 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students in Molecular Biology are carrying out experimental analyses of         genes and their proteins with special emphasis on methodologies used to         study recombinant DNA and gene cloning.  The instrumentation purchased          through this award is being used for the electrophoresis procedures             which chemically separate and identify proteins and DNA fragments.  The         major equipment items include vertical and horizontal slab gel                  electrophoresis units and various supportive instrumentation -- a               microcentrifuge, scanning densitometer, constant temperature incubator,         shaker bath, analytical balance, and pH meter.                                                                                                                  The student experiments are being developed around a model gene-protein         system in Bacillus, a spore-forming group of bacteria in which heat-            resistant spores are produced that contain sizeable quantities of small,        acid-soluble proteins (SASP).  Such proteins play important, but not yet        fully understood, roles in spore  germination.  Students are isolating          and identifying SASPs, and are determining the number of genes involved         in the coding their production.",
