 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Taguchi design method is a statistical design technique that           seeks to improve productivity by creating production systems that are           insensitive to variations in the input factors or changes in the                environment.  This is achieved by modelling the outcome of the system as        a response surface and using factorial experimental design techniques to        identify areas of the response surface which are relatively flat to             changes in inputs.                                                                   This Engineering Initiation Award proposes to create an alternative        to the factorial design methods by using spectral design methods.               Spectral design of experiments is a technique whereby factors that are          significant determinants of system behavior can be identified by                analyzing the spectra of the system inputs and outputs.  The resulting          analysis is comparable to a traditional factorial experiment under              classical design assumptions.  The spectral approach has the additional         property of yielding correct factor identifications even when a lag of          unknown duration exists between the introduction of a change to an input        and the corresponding change in the output of the system.  Combining the        Taguchi design method with spectral design of experiments will yield a          method that can be used for productivity improvement in industries in           which the Taguchi approach is currently not easily applicable, such as          chemical engineering and other process industries.",
