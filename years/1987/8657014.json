New dating and paleoen\u001avironmental              methods developed by the Principal Investigator for rock varnish                coatings, will permit radiometric age assignments and chronometric              age-determinations of many previously undateable desert surfaces.               Chemical changes in surface coatings have been found to record                  systematic variations in past levels of dust, alkalinity and                    photosynthetic pathways of adjacent vegetation.  The next phase of              research includes study of hillslope debris in humid-temperate                  environments and further development of rock varnish dating methods.            Understanding environmental changes depends on obtaining \"proxy\"                records that are both dateable and ubiquitous.  Desert varnish and              slope colluvium deposits hold great promise to provide important                information for paleoenviromental reconstruction of past events in              both semi-arid and humid environments.",
