 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a response to mounting evidence that the secondary              school curriculum does not provide adequate experiences in mathematical         modeling, problem solving, the probability concepts.  The proposed              instructional design emphasizes an eight step simulation model building         process, and the process of exploring simulation models as a strategy           for developing problem solving skills and for understanding probability         concepts.                                                                                                                                                       The approach to development of the materials is comprehensive:                  consideration is given to the student, teacher, and teacher training,           with special attention given to the teacher's role in influencing               instructional styles and curriculum change.                                                                                                                     The materials for implementing the instructional design and strategy            include a student manual, teacher manual, and teacher training manual.          These printed materials will be accompanied by computer software and            instructional fields for use by teacher and student.                                                                                                            This project aptly meets both the objectives of the Instructional               Materials Development Program as well as the thinking of mathematicians         and researchers in the cognitive sciences.  The materials, and the              attention given to real classroom situations will provide the inroad            necessary to modify the mathematics curriculum so that consideration of         the uses of technology in teaching of the discipline will find its way          into the secondary school classrooms.",
