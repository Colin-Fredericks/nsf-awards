 "awd_abstract_narration": "Branch will further analyze the optical spectra of young                        supernovae, \"young\" referring to a time when one observes an                    \"atmosphere\" reminiscent of a star.  The atmosphere is analyzed                 by a computer program for synthetic spectra.  One goal is to                    determine the shells of various chemical abundances in the                      progenitor star by analysing the ejected distributions.  A second               topic concerns radio observations of historically observed                      supernovae.  Second-epoch observations are already becoming                     feasible.                                                                                                                                                       Some aging stars are shattered by a giant explosion that we                     observe as a supernova.  The explosion generates most of the                    elements of which the Earth and life is made.  Observation of                   supernovae can inform us of the structure of the star that                      exploded and more generally about the evolution of stars and of                 our astronomical surroundings.  Branch will continue two lines of               investigating supernovae.  Mainly, he will analyse the radiation                spectrum emitted when a supernova is still young and bright.  His               work is very timely in view of the newly observed supernova.                    Branch will also investigate the radio emissions of slightly                    older supernovae to show how the newly exploding supernovae are                 transformed into the still older nebular supernova remnants of                  which the Crab Nebula is a famous example.",
