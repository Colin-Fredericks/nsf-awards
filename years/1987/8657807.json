 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator Award is for support of            Michael Leyton at Rutgers University.  Leyton's research centers                on perceptual organization. Perceptual organization is modeled as               representing the environment as hierarchies of deterministic                    machines, i.e. as nested systems of control, where these                        hierarchies have a common mathematical structure, especially                    adapted to the function of planning.  The sponsored work includes               deeper investigations of the mathematical structure of this                     model,  connections with information theory, and pilot studies of               auditory perceptual organization.                                                       The significance of this research is that an understanding              of perception, by a structured and principled approach, may                     contribute to major advances in computer systems capable of                     independently dealing with their environment by seeing, hearing,                and other forms of perception.  The Presidential Young                          Investigator Awards provide research funding to attract and                     support young researchers of the highest quality in the                         university environment.",
