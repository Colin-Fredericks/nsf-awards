 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is in                 the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                 subfield of electrochemistry.  The goal of this innovative                      experimental program is the development and implementation of a                 technique with which electrode reactions can be spatially mapped                and the efficiency of these processes more fully understood.                    Professor Engstrom and his undergraduate research students will                 use a microscope to collect the image produced by a light-                      emitting electrode reaction, detect this image with a position-                 sensitive detector, and use an imaging system to map the activity               of the electrode surface.  This technique will be used to study                 problems of non-uniform current densities at both micro- and                    macroelectrodes that plague both electroanalysis and                            electroplating technologies, non-uniform current densities in                   microelectrode arrays that are important to the development of                  chemical sensors, microheterogeniety of electrode surfaces, and                 defects in conducting polymer films.  The results of this project               should contribute to the optimization of electroanalytical                      devices and to fundamental knowledge of electrode processes at                  the microscopic level.",
