The IBM AT computers, related hardware, and SPSS/PC Plus             Statistics and Graphics software package is greatly enhancing the level         and sophistication of student research projects assigned for all                students in the Anthropology, Sociology, and Psychology research                sequence.  The students are gaining hands-on experience in creating,            storing and manipulating their data files.  They are doing basic to             complex descriptive and inferential analyses and graphic presentations          of their data.  These research capabilities are greatly enhancing the           existing curriculum by providing students with an up-to-date,                   technologically advanced learning experience in behavioral science              research.",
