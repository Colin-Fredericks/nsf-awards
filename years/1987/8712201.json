 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flexible manufacturing systems(FMS) are among the most                     important industrial applications of information technology.                    Yet, there is general agreement that there is very sketchy,                     incomplete and unsystematic information concerning the rate                     of diffusion of FMS and its impact on the productivity of                       capital and labor.  This research improves models of                            diffusion and collects original data on the use of FMS in the                   United States, Europe and Japan.                                                                                                                                The research studies the process by which the utilization of                    FMS has and will spread in major industrialized nations, the                    extend to which existing mathematical models of the diffusion                   process fit the data concerning the rate of diffusion of FMS                    in each country, modifies and extends these models to improve                   their usefulness, investigates the reasons why the Japanese                     seem to be ahead in the utilization of FMS, analyzes the                        impacts of FMS on the productivity of capital and labor and                     on total costs in each country, and analyzes the nature and                     adequacy of methods used by firms to evaluate investments in                    such systems.                                                                                                                                                   The research is significant from the point of view of                           analysis and policy because it will improve our ability to                      understand diffusion processes generally and will produce                       important information on the factors affecting the diffusion                    and impact of FMS in Japan, Europe and the U.S.  This is                        important information in our national effort to improve the                     international competitiveness of the U.S.",
