The program is designed to enable U.S.                  scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research              institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                   opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the propsective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project is in the area of paleoclimatic studies.                  Previous research has shown that a large fraction of climate variance           in the last 800 kyr is explained by cyclic variations in insolation             caused by regular perturbations in the earth's orbit (\"Milankovitch             Cycles\").  The principal investigator intends to conduct a combined             sedimentary time series and magnetostratigraphic study of a few                 selected magnetozones.  If the orbital cycles are successfully                  resolved, new quantitative approaches to paleoclimatology will be               possible.                                                                                                                                                       The project is under the direction of Dr. Timothy B. Herbert,                   Department of Geological and Geophysical Sciences, Princeton                    University, Princeton, NJ 08544, U.S.A., and Professor Hans R.                  Thierstein, Geological Institute, 5, Sonneggstrasse, Federal Institute          of Technology (ETH), Zurich, Switzerland.                                                                                                                       This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
