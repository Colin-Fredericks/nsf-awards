The program is designed to enable U.S.                  scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research              institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                   opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the propsective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project involves two interrelated studies.  One is to             determine which amino acid residues are present in the active site of           cap-binding protein (CBP).  The second project will be to devise assays         for, and identify an activity in the cell nucleus which recognizes the          cap during the process of mRNA splicing.                                                                                                                        The project is under the direction of Professor Robert E. Rhoades,              Department of Biochemistry, University of Kentucky, Kinkead Hall, East          Wing, Lexington, KY 40506-0571, U.S.A., and professor Ernst Kuechler,           Institute for Biochemistry, University of Vienna, A-1090 Wien IX,               Wahringerstrasse 17, Vienna, Austria.                                                                                                                           This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
