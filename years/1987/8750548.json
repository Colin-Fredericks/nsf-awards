 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student-originated projects involving scientific experimentation are a          key component of the introductory natural science and biology courses           required as a part of Edgewood's general degree curriculum.                     Environmental biology is an area popular with non-science majors.  The          goal of this project is to expand the experience in scientific problem          solving that the College can provide such students.  Approximately 75%          of the undergraduates who will benefit from this project are female, and        a large proportion) approximately 30%) are teacher education majors.                                                                                            Using controlled environment chambers acquired through this project,            students will be able to mount experiments in plant growth, plant-              herbivore interactions and other aspects of environmental biology which         require the ability to control such parameters as light intensity,              light/dark periodicity, humidity, atmospheres and temperatures.  The            Department's ability to support controlled experiments in these areas           should produce not only expanded experimental capabilities, but also            increased interest and enthusiasm on the part of students and, most             importantly, a better understanding on their part of the process of             scientific inquiry.",
