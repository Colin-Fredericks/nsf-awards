 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  will support a series of three annual \"Workshops on Reactive                    Intermediates.\"  These workshops have the dual purposes of (1)                  providing an effective forum for informal discussion by active                  scientists of current research in topical areas of organic                      dynamics, and (2) assisting the Program staff in identifying                    areas of research in organic dynamics which require incorporation               into the Program's long-range planning.                                                                                                                         Each workshop will bring together approximately 18 active                       scientists from around the United States for discussions of                     current research in mechanisms of organic chemical reactions,                   with an emphasis on critical evaluation of research in progress.                The informal discussion format is intended to stimulate challenge               and criticism, to facilitate the development of collaborative                   research approaches to common problems, and to prevent                          unproductive duplicative efforts.  The participants are drawn                   widely from the community of physical, organic, and                             organometallic chemists working on the chemistry of reactive                    intermediates, and a particular effort is made to incorporate                   young investigators, women and minority scientists into the                     mainstream of research activity in the areas of organic dynamics.               The topics chosen for discussion are selected to complement, not                compete with, other established and more formal conferences.",
