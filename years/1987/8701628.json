The program is designed to enable U.S. scientists and             engineers to conduct long-term research at research institutions in the         industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan, Australia,         and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide opportunities for the conduct of      joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities,       expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                     Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants for       professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering of          international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program is           particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking on          their research careers.                                                                                                                                         This research project addresses questions of the measurements on the            nature of the phonons emitted from a hot two-dimensional electron gas           contained in semiconductor devices at low temperatures.  Under these            conditions, the principal energy loss is by acoustic phonon emission.  The      research is of interest because the much higher electron mobility in these      devices should lead to well defined cyclotron frequencies as well as            providing an opportunity to examine effects associated with cutoffs in the      phonon-wave vector.                                                                                                                                             The project is under the direction of Dr. James M. Madsen, Department of        Physics, Colorado School of Mines, Golden CO 80401, U.S.A., and Professor       L.J. Challis, Department of Physics, The University of Nottingham,              University Park, Nottingham NG7 2 RD, England.                                                                                                                  This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance,       if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat administrative        allowance of $250 or the U.S. home institution.",
