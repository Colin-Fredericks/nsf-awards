 "awd_abstract_narration": "All cells accumulate and maintain high internal                            concentrations of potassium, usually against low external                       concentrations.  The plasma membrane proteins that mediate this                 transport are, therefore, of fundamental interest particularly                  since the molecular mechanisms they employ remain largely                       unknown.  There are yeast mutants that are defective for                        potassium transport, and he proposed project is to clone and                    sequence the gene encoding he low-affinity transporter proteins.                In addition, heterologous gene fusions will be constructed and                  used to generate domain-specific antisera that will be employed                 to determine the secondary structure of the transporter.  The                   antisera will also be used to inhibit potassium uptake and thus                 identify specific transporter domains directly involved in                      transport.  Once functional domains are identified, monoclonal                  antibodies that recognize epitopes within these domains will be                 isolated and used to identify the specific amino acid sequences                 involved.  Site directed mutagenesis will then be performed to                  obtain mutants deficient in transport.  DNA sequence analysis of                intragenic revertants of these mutants will permit sophisticated                model building regarding molecular mechanisms for ion transport.                     Yeast has emerged as a model organism for the genetic and                  molecular dissection of fundamental cell biological processes.                  The approach that has been so useful for the analysis of cell                   cycle genes, protein trafficking sequences, and transcriptional                 regulation, will now be extended to elucidate the genetic and                   molecular bases of ion transport.",
