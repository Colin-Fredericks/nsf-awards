 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses the vehicle-superstructure                      interaction problem which results from a vehicle traversing a highway           girder bridge.  The project will yield a better prediction and                  understanding of the load distribution characteristic and the dynamic           effect of traversing vehicles on girder bridges.  This insight is to            be obtained through application of a developed analytical methodology           and extensive comparison to existing field data, resulting in                   formulation of design recommendations.  This investigation is                   necessitated by the uncertainties associated with current design                practices which have been shown to be either overly conservative or             unsafe under general traversing vehicular loading.                                                                                                              The analytical methodology considers the vehicle-superstructure                 interaction problem based upon either a moving-mass, moving-force, or           static live load formulation.  The kinematic coupling, due to the               velocity of the traversing vehicle, is described within and is                  included in the moving-mass formulation.  The analytical methodology            is based upon the finite element method, and the necessary algorithms           for each formulation are derived.  The direct integration solution              approach is employed, allowing for future expansion into nonlinear              behavior and inclusion of substructure interaction.",
