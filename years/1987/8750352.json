 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support instrumentation in the Applied Mathematical           Sciences Department of an open-admissions college.  A classroom will be         equipped with twenty-five networked IBM-PC (or IBM compatible)                  microcomputers and a large scale projection screen for demonstration            purposes.  The equipment will be used in two junior level statistics            courses which are required of business majors.  Students will encounter         daily assigned classroom problems dealing with decision-making                  situations which require statistical analysis and interpretation of             computer output.  Solutions will be worked out on computers (two                students per machine), as in a lab.  Mathematically-shy business                students will have a greater appreciation of statistical concepts and           their applications to real world problems, more experience in dealing           with the popular IBM-PC machinery and increased interest in pursuing            optional senior level math courses in the area of the decision sciences.        Business students, who represent fifty-eight percent of UH-Downtown's           1986 graduating class, will receive enhanced training in quantitative           methods.  Ultimately, other faculty will be encouraged to use this              instructional lab for courses in computer science, numerical methods and        calculus.",
