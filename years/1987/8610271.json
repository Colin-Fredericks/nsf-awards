 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers often need to complement field and laboratory data with             observations of behavior in strategically designed indoor naturalistic          facilities, which deviate substantially from those envisioned in Federal        standards for research-animal husbandry.  This need has repeatedly              brought regulatory agencies, university administrators, and researchers         into conflict.  Clarification of the complex web of responsibilities and        obligations shouldered by regulatory personnel and university                   administrators will be necessary if the design and operation of indoor          naturalistic facilities is to be sustained as a viable component of             behavioral research.  Closer contact with the veterinary, zoo, and              humane communities can also help researchers anticipate problems,               improve plans, and advocate their research requirements more                    effectively.                                                                                                                                                    This conference will bring zoo and research veterinarians, university           administrators, regulatory agents, and humane-society professionals             together with scientists involved in behavioral research.  The                  proceedings will involve (1) inspection and discussion of extensive new         indoor naturalistic habitats of the New York Zoological Park, (2) panel         discussion of four hypothetical facilities that might be constructed on         a university campus, and (3) presentation of 15 technical papers on the         strategic use of indoor habitats; the ways in which they often deviate          from Federal standards; design and maintenance considerations related to        light, air quality, and substrates; population sizes; co-habitation of          multiple species; pests; hygiene, and security.  Perspectives from the          humane and animal-rights communities will also be presented.",
