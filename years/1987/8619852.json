 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of Dr. Kenneth J. Klabunde of             Kansas State University in a program of cooperative research with               Dr. Galo Cardenas-Trivino of the University of Concepcion, Chile,               focusing on the producion and characterization of a new class of                stable colloids in thin-film form.   The  U.S. principal                        investigator has developed a method, based on the clustering of                 metal atoms in organic solvents at low temperature, for producing               stable thin-film metal colloids using non-aqueous media.  The                   resulting colloidal particles are unusually pure and can be                     combined in thin-film forms with interesting electrical and optical             properties.  The properties of the resulting colloids and metallic              films are not predictable a priori, but may turn out to be                      insulating, metallic, or semiconducting, and therefore may have                 important uses.  For example, the films may optically resemble                  metal films but be only poor electrical conductors.  These                      properties, and the possibilities that others may be evidenced,                 form the stimulus for this work, which extends previous colloidal               formation using Au and Pd to Pt, Cu, Ag, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Ge, Sn,                and Pb.  Various solvents will also be used in colloidal                        formation.  The resultant colloid particles and thin films will be              studied using electrophoresis, electron microscopy, spectroscopy,               thermogravimetric analysis and other electrical and thermal                     measurements.  The objectives of the collaboration include the                  characterization of both the colloidal particles and the thin films             produced from them.                                                                                                                                             In this cooperative project colloid and thin film preparation will              be carried out primarily in the U.S. investigator's laboratory,                 while characterization will primarily be pursued in the laboratory              of the Chilean collaborator.  Considering the range of properties               of the materials already observed, in addition to an improvement in             our general understanding of particle stabilization in non-aqueous              media, this work could result in the development of materials                   useful in the ceramics, electronics, or catalyst industries, with               applications as decorative coatings, semiconductors, conductors,                solar cells, etc.",
