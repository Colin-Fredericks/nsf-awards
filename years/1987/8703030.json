 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project         between Dr. Willis Paull of the University of Missouri and Dr. Zsolt            Lipositz of the University Medical School, Pecs, Hungary is to study            the central regulation of the adrenal function by focussing on certain          neurochemical transmitter-specific systems in the forebrain and                 hypothalamus.  These studies will analyse connections between neurons           rather than between brain structures and will employ ultrastructural            double-labelling techniques developed by the investigators which are            likely to become important research methodologies for neuroanatomy in           the future.                                                                                                                                                     This project in neural science fulfills the program objective of                advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States         and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents, pool resources,            and share research facilities in areas of strong mutual interest and            competence.  Results should contribute significantly to our                     understanding of the chemical nature of interacting pre and                     postsynaptic neuronal elements with subsequent relevance to                     interpretation of vast amounts of data generated in other fields on the         adrenal function.",
