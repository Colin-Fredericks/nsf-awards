 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most striking characteristics of aquatic                     communities is the extreme spatial and temporal heterogeneity                   in zooplankton abundance.  A major consequence of patchiness is                 that individuals differ in the densities and species they                       encounter, and therefore are likely to experience different                     competitive pressures and predation risks.  The goal of this                    research is to determine whether patchiness in zooplankton                      communities affects the outcome of interactions among commonly                  co-occurring species under realistic conditions.                                        The research combines field measurements and experimental               laboratory manipulations.  The field measurements characterize                  the neighborhoods (the number and composition of the                            zooplankton and phytoplankton in close proximity) experienced                   by each species in 2 dates during the growing season.  The                      effect of sampling volume (1, 14 and 50 liters) and diurnal                     movements on estimates of spatial pattern (patchiness, number                   of other animals experienced by each individual, species                        specific tendencies to aggregate) will be tested.  The                          experimental manipulations measure the outcome of 2 types of                    interactions that are more likely to be affected by close                       neighbors than by mean population densities:  filtering and                     predation rate inhibition by neighbors.  The appropriate                        neighborhood volume for measuring these 2 types of interactions                 will be experimentally quantified and compared to the field                     measurements of spatial pattern at the same scales when possible.                       This approach links patchiness in zooplankton abundance to              the controlled study of species interactions under realistic                    field conditions.  Measuring density dependent interactions                     among zooplankton is necessary if we are to expand the study of                 zooplankton interactions to include the striking spatial and                    temporal distribution patterns observed in nature.",
