 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis of complex molecules found in natural systems                     places increasing demands on the synthetic organic chemist. The                 transition metals offer the fine chemical control needed for the                development of new methods for a range of molecules found in                    medicine and agriculture.                                                                                                                                       The overall objective of this grant in the Organic and                          Macromolecular Chemistry Program is to develop new synthetic                    methods using transition metal complexes to permit new modes of                 reactivity for organic functional groups.  This will be achieved                by careful study of the fundamental chemistry of the metal-                     organic species involved, to permit the development of useful,                  new synthetic transformations.  The newly developed processes                   will be applied to the synthesis of complex molecules when                      possible.  The scientific significance of the proposed research                 is that new chemical transformations of general use for organic                 synthesis will be developed, that new organic compounds with                    interesting physical, biological, and chemical properties will be               produced.  Thus beta-lactams will be synthesized by Pd(II)                      assisted aminocarbonylatin of olefins or vinyl carbamates.  A                   variety of carbocyclic systems - including medium sized fused                   bicyclic systems will be synthesized from simple diene starting                 materials by an unusual \"1,3\" cycloaddition of electrophilic                    olefins and alkynes to pi-allylpalladium complexes followed by                  reductive elimination.                                                                                                                                          A newly discovered photogeneration of aminoketenes and                          enaminoketenes from Group (VI) metal carbene complexes will be                  developed to provide an array of unusual organic compounds,                     including unnatural alpha-amino acids and peptides containing                   unnatural amino acids.  These unusual metal-bound ketenes are                   expected to have broad utility in organic synthesis.                                                                                                            Finally, new, practical, synthetic approaches to organometallic                 carbene and nitrene complexes will be developed and their utility               in organic synthesis will be assessed.",
