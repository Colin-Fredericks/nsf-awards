 "awd_abstract_narration": "More and more children come forth as eyewitnesses in legal                 proceedings.  To date research findings are suggestive but inconclusive         that children may be unreliable memory sources and be perceived as such         by jurors.  Previous studies, however, have seldom focused on children's        memory for legally realistic events or examined adults' reactions to the        actual eyewitness reports of children.  Dr. Leippe plans to accomplish          both of those tasks through a carefully planned program of research,            including simulation experiments.  In a first set of studies, first             graders, fifth graders, and college students watch a theft on videotape         and then attempt to identify the perpetrator and provide verbal reports         of the crime while also being taped.  The \"subject-witnesses'\" reports          are shown to adult \"subject-jurors\" who judge their accuracy and                \"delivery style\" (e.g., confidence, consistency).  Based on jurors'             assessments, trained observers' ratings, and performance indices of             witness accuracy, analyses address what accounts for actual and perceived       age differences in testimony.  In a second set of studies, subject-             jurors, drawn from college and jury eligible populations, are presented         with trials that include testimony from the first studies.  These               experiments aim to isolate the effects of such factors as age of witness,       strength of testimony, and reasonable doubt instructions on jury                behavior.  This program of research should contribute substantially to a        scientific understanding of the accuracy of children's testimony and its        impact in court.  By viewing the                                                child witness as a source of information and the jury as a                      receiver of such information, Dr. Leippe brings together                        theoretical work on information processing and persuasion to                    explain a basic legal phenomena--the causes of juror belief and                 disbelief in testimony.",
