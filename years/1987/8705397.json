 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major goals of this research program is the long-            term isolation of a single ionized atom nearly at rest in free                  space.  Using only rf techniques for observing the normal mode                  frequencies of the ion, bound to a small electromagnetic cage                   called a Penning trap, it will become possible to measure light-                ion masses relative to an appropriate calibration mass with a                   precision approaching one part in ten billion.  An applied                      magnetic field forces the ion to revolve in circular orbits about               the field direction at a rate which can be measured and compared                with the corresponding calibration frequency (which may be                      obtained from either a single electron, proton, or carbon 12 ion                depending on the particular experiment).  The ion of interest and               the calibration-ion are alternately stored in the same apparatus;               the ratio of their respective cyclotron frequencies, corrected                  for the trapping fields, yields the inverse mass ratio.  A                      variable magnetic bottle has been incorporated into this trap                   which has the effect of externally adjusting the quadratic                      magnetic field dependence at trap center.  Using this new                       variable bottle, the proton to electron mass ratio has been                     measured as a function of the magnetic field dependence to yield                a uniform-field value accurate to 20 ppb.  This ratio will be                   used primarily in a consistency check for the next least squares                adjustment of the fundamental constants.  Present efforts are                   concentrating on measuring the tritium helium-three mass                        difference which will have a direct bearing on the measurement of               the antineutrino rest mass.  On one occasion, one helium-three                  and two tritium ions were isolated at the same time yielding the                expected result that the effective cyclotron resonance was                      shifted according to the ions' resultant center of mass.  In yet                another experiment, the deuteron-proton mass ratio will be                      measured in order to indirectly yield an independent                            determination of the neutron-proton mass ratio.",
