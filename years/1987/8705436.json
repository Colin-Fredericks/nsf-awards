 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although there is evidence of periodic climatic changes in the                  geological record extending back to the Cambrian era (more than                 500 million year ago), the 100,000 year periodicities found in                  deep sea sediments are most prominent in the late Pliestocene                   (recent several million years).  It has been postulated that this               periodicity in the geological record reflects a nonlinear                       response of the climate system to changing external forcing due                 to incoming solar radiation variations induced by changing                      geometry of the earth's orbit.  This project focuses on numerical               modeling of this phenomenon.  With a multi-component model                      consisting of an ice-bedrock model coupled to an atmosphere-ocean               energy balance model, several numerical experiments will be                     carrried out to delineate the relative importance of interaction                between continental ice sheet and underlying bedrock (isostacy)                 in accounting for the observed spectral dominance at 100,000                    years.  Specific tasks include   (1) test in the coupled model                  the importance of rapid glacier termination (which occurs                       initially in the ice sheet-bedrock portion of the model), (2)                   model the rapid growth stage of the last major glaciation, and                  (3) with coupled model predicted ice volume changes and ocean                   temperatures, simulate an oxygen isotope record to compare with                 the deep sea fossil record.  This research is important because                 it will enhance our understanding of the physical basis for the                 dominant 100,000 year periodicity during the late Pleistocene                   epoch.",
