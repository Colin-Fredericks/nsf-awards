 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electron beam writing capabilities are becoming increasingly important          for research in a wide variety of fields.  Because such electron beams          can be focussed to small dimensions, they are capable of drawing lines          which have widths which are a fraction  of the wavelength of light; that        is less than .00001 centimeters.  For engineering applications, such            widths are important in optical device and holographic design and will          become increasingly so as the field develops further.  Such e-beam              writing machines are also seeing increased use in electronic and                microwave device and systems design.                                                                                                                            The present proposed effort is for the purchase of such a machine, to be        used as a shared facility, for applications to engineering research in          emerging technologies.",
