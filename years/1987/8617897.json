 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is provided for a combined numerical (super-computer) and               experimental study of instability and transition to turbulence in the           KEB class of 3-d boundary layers; the vonKarman-Ekman-Bodewadt layers.          In particular, we emphasize the roll of free-stream disturbances and the        excitation of the Type II instability, which has received little or no          attention in previopus studies, and the different routes to                     transition dependent upon the relative amplitudes of the Type I and Type        II unstable vortices that are known to occur in thes layers. These              studies should be viewed as generic research, i.e. having                       application to a wide variety of problems that occur throughout                 mechanical, chemical, and civil and aerospace engineering.  The results         of a successful program of research will provide the background                 information for understanding transition to turbulence in a broad class         of 3-d boundary layers.  Three-dimensional boundary layers occur over           swept-back airfoils, in the flow over and around vehicles of all sorts,         in rotating machinery (fans,  pumps, turbines, etc.), on the noses of           rotating projectiles, incurved pipes, river bends, and planetary                boundary layers.  Transitition to turbulenace in these layers is                important in enginerring design because it affects stresses,                    vibrations, nois, lift, heat transfer, ablation, etc.",
