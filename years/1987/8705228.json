 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metal compounds are used extensively as catalysts for                           facilitating structural conversions of hydrocarbons, as                         required for reforming petroleum distillates to produce high                    octane gasoline, and for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds,                  as is necessary in the utilization of coal for the synthesis of                 useful organic compounds. The goal of this project is to                        provide a more thorough understanding of such catalytic                         processes, with a focus on transition metal catalysis of the                    formation or cleavage of carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen                       chemical bonds.                                                                                                                                                 Mechanistic studies of reactions of hydrocarbons in the                         coordination sphere of soluble complexes of transition metals                   will be undertaken. The target systems have been chosen to                      provide well-defined examples of reactions which form or break                  C-H and C-C bonds. Reversible alkene insertions into metal                      carbon bonds, intramolecular gamma-C-H activations, and                         intermolecular C-H activations provide the focus for the work.                  Metal oxidation state, steric bulk and electronic effects of                    ancillary ligands, alkyl group structure, charge and chelate                    ring size will be investigated as variables in a detailed look                  at the mechanisms of representative reactions. Systems to be                    studiesd include complexes of Pt, Pd, Ti and Zr containing a                    deuterium-labeled 2,2-dimethyl-5-pentyl ligand which shows                      reversible alkene insertion by specific deuterium site                          exchange. Gamma-C-H activation will be investigated with a                      variety of deuterium-labeled square-planar iridium(I) alkyl                     complexes. Intra- and intermolecular C-H activation will be                     studied in a series of octahedral Os(II) and Ir(III) phosphine                  and phosphite alkyl hydride complexes. The possibility of                       dictating a preference for intermolecular activation of alkanes                 by the synthesis of cyclometallation-resistant ligands will be                  investigated. In all cases a thorough examination of mechanisms                 will be made using kinetics, deuterium site labeling, kinetic                   isotope effects, and the effect of substrate structure on                       reactivity.",
