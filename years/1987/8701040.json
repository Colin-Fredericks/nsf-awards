 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a cooperative research program involving Prof.          B.H. Brinkhuis of the Marine Sciences Research Center, SUNY-Stony Brook         and  Prof. Jose Zertuche of the Universidad Autonoma de Baja                    California, Mexico. The project has the goal of investigating important         factors in the growth and survival of the red seaweed, Eucheuma                 uncinatum, in the Gulf of California.  This study should be of                  importance in developing mariculture strategies for this economically           important species.                                                                                                                                              Since carrageenan can be extracted from Eucheuma, it would be                   beneficial to develop means to produce this seaweed (actually an alga)          under controlled conditions on a commercial scale.  In addition to the          general desirability of growth under controlled conditions, it has also         recently become apparent that natural populations of Eucheuma in the            Gulf of California are not sufficiently large to sustain a                      carrageenan-extraction industry. However, not enough is known about the         life cycle of Eucheuma--and particularly about the relationship between         its annual life cycle and photosynthesis and respiration--to commence           mariculture.  Such knowledge will be obtained by performing controlled          experiments on oxygen exchanges of Eucheuma in water samples as a               function of sunlight, and relating the level of irradiance to seasonal          and depth variations.  Complementary expertise and facilities at the            cooperating institutions will be used, and the end result could not             only be greater understanding of the cyclical processes that occur in           Eucheuma, but also the development of an important industry in Baja             California and elsewhere.",
