 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benedictine College will conduct a four week workshop for 140 teachers          in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.  The workshop will emphasize           instruction in:  physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics.  Each            teacher will participate in one of the four major areas of program.  The        instruction will focus on content and the development of materials that         are to be implemented in the classroom. All teachers will participate in        a series of interdisciplinary workshops.  An optional computer workshop         will be provided for teachers who want to learn or practice basic               computer concepts.                                                                                                                                              The staff is composed of master secondary teachers and college faculty.         The participants will conduct inservice activities during the academic          year for other teachers in their school system.  Over a two year period         the college staff will make site visits to each participant's school.           Teachers will be encouraged to attend professional meetings and make            presentations at these meetings.  Some finiancial support will be               provided for teachers who attend these meetings.                                                                                                                The school districts, from whom participants are chosen, are being              encouraged to provide support for inservice activites and to purchase           additional equipment and materials that will enhance their mathematics          and science programs.  The professional organizations in the states will        cooperate in coordinating and providing support for this project.  The          concerns of many small and rural schools will be addressed.",
