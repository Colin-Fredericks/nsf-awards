The                       objectives of this research are (a) to solubilize and separate, by              hydrophobic interaction chromatography, protein mixtures without                denaturation, and (b) to explore and exploit changes in                         chromatographic selectivity due to mild surfactants.  Mobile                    chromatographic phases containing n-octyl glucoside, CHAPS, or                  Triton X-100 will be examined over a range of concentrations below              and above the respective critical micelle concentrations.  The                  dependence of protein retention on surfactant concentration and                 ionic strength will be determined by isocratic chromatography for               an ensemble of proteins.  Isotherms for the binding of surfactants              to stationary phases will be determined.  The effects of                        surfactants on chromatographic efficiency, resolving power, and                 linear loading capacity will also be determined.  Protein                       recoveries (native and total) will be ascertained and indications               of on-column denaturation will be tested by measurements of                     specific activity, circular dichroism, or intrinsic fluorescence.               The correlation of solvent strength with interfacial tension                    measurements will be explored and convenient means will be devised              for the separation of surfactant from protein following                         chromatography.  The results of these studies will be of broad and              significant potential impact in protein chemistry and                           biotechnology.",
