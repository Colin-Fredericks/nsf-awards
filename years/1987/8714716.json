 "awd_abstract_narration": "Often in engineering analysis compromises must be made, i. e.                   approximations are used since the full or complete problem does not             lend itself to rigorous mathematical analysis.  However, with the               current explosive growth in computational power many of these                   formulations can be significantly improved with a view towards                  numerical solution rather than seeking an approximate analytical                solution.  A good example is the formulation of and the solution of the         transport equation which occurs in such diverse application as remote           sensing, communications, computer imagine representation, and radiative         heat transfer.                                                                                                                                                  The General Transfer Equation will be derived based on Multiple                 Scattering Theory for waves propagating in a semi-bounded random medium         containing randomly distributed discrete scatters with nonuniform               background.  Computational technique will be developed to solve this            multiple scattering problem.  Futhermore, comparisons will be made with         existing limiting approximate solutions, e.g. Distorted Born                    Approximation and the classical Transfer Equation.                                                                                                              The research will be carried out at an undergraduate institution by two         faculty members from different fields of engineering; mechanical and            civil engineering utilizing supercomputer resources at a NSF                    supercomputer center.  This limited support of short duration will              serve to stimulate more creative environment for cross-disciplinary             engineering research to explore new computational methodologies.",
