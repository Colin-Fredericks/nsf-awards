 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops methods for studying the failure of anchored and          unanchored liquid storage tanks subjected to seismic loads and applies          these methods to prototypical and scaled structures to provide an               understanding of damage mechanisms.  Phenomena such as buckling, lift-          off, and interaction of the structure with the contained fluid are being        considered.  With the use of supercomputers, understanding of the               influence of these factors can be gained through simulation.  The               emphasis is placed on determining which phenomena are crucial to                explaining damage.  Efforts are also made to correlate the computer             simulations with prototype data, as well as the limited shake table test        data from available sources.  This will help to advance the data base           for liquid storage tank design and also to provide a firm basis for             incorporating refinements into existing design codes.",
