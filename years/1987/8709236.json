 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economics uses a variety of arguments, ranging from mathematical                proofs to arguments from authority.  The received methodology in                the field stresses that only a subset of these arguments are                    to be recognized, but economists do not follow the received                     methodology.  So much has been shown tentatively in the principal               investigator's past work.  The contribution of this project                     comes from extending the inquiry to how economists in fact read,                starting with the puzzle that they do not agree in their                        readings.  The project examines how economists read, in a wide                  definition of the word, through detailed study of certain                       scientific debates in economics, examination of referee reports,                and a close analysis of the narrative role of economic theory                   and applications.  The tools are those of literary criticism,                   supplemented by philosophy and history of thought, but seen from                inside the science, by a practicing economist.",
