 "awd_abstract_narration": "Otterbein College will integrate computer modeling and computational            methods into the advanced courses of the physics curriculum and on-line         data acquisition and analysis into experimental laboratories.                   Integration of these techniques with the advanced courses require on-           site computer equipment for illustrative demonstrations, computational          experiments and problem solving, and the acquisition and analysis of            data.  The equipment necessary to implement this expansion of the               physics curriculum consists of 1)  a computer physics work station and          associated software; and, 2)  an experimental physics laboratory work           station with interface devices suitable for the diversity of instruments        found in an advanced undergraduate laboratory.  The acquaintance with           current practices of working physicists provided by the equipment               requested will give students a first-hand knowledge of all aspects of           computer use as a physics research tool.",
