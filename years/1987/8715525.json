 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Objective:  This proposal requests funds to partially support          approximately 30 U.S. participants in the 16th Pacific Science Congress         (PSC) to be held in Seoul, Korea, August 20-30, 1987.  The U.S. P.I. is         Dr. John E. Bardach, President, Pacific Science Institute of the PSA,           Honolulu, Hawaii; Prof. Tai Whan Shin, National Academy of Sciences,            Republic of Korea, is Chairman of the 16th PSC Organizing Committee.            PSA if a well-established international, nongovernmental organization           dealing with interdisciplinary science in the Pacific in environmental          biology, earth sciences, information science, and social and economic           science. The theme of the Congress is \"New Dimensions of Science,               Manpower, and Resources in the Pacific.\"  This broad topic will be              developed through the following three general symposia and fifteen more         specific sections: (1) Development of Science and Technology in the             Pacific Countries; (2) Population and Food in the Pacific Basin; and (3)        Prospect on the Major Resources of the Pacific Region.  More than 1100          scientists have preregistered for the Congress.  This project is                relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program        which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean        scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information,        ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of          mutual benefit.                                                                                                                                                 Merit of the Proposal:  The U.S. and Korean coordinators of this                international conference are highly respected scientists who have had           extensive experience in organizing international activities.  The U.S.          P.I. has been the recipient of NSF awards in support of previous PSA            Congresses and Intercongresses.  The proposed method of announcing NSF          support and the selection of the recipients of travel funds by a                committee of seasoned experts should be entirely satisfactory.  U.S.            participation in the 16th PSC will be beneficial to members of the U.S.         scientific community.                                                                                                                                           Funding:  This proposal is not supported by other U.S. government               agencies or other NSF programs.  Only U.S. participants will be                 supported.  A grant in the amount of $30,000 is recommended.                                                                                                    The Bernice P. Bishop Museum acts as the fiscal agent for the PSI, and          handles administrative activities of the PSI.  The offices of PSI are in        the Bishop Museum.  Dr. W. D. Duckworth, Director of the Museum is Vice         President/Treasurer of the PSI.",
