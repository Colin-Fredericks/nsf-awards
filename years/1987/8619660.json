 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at a first-principles understanding of               the influence of paramagnetic ion systems on the relaxation times               of protons of water molecules and therefore on the contrast-noise               ratio for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The magnetic moment                distributions between the paramagnetic ion and its ligands will                 be studied using both ab initio and approximate theoretical                     techniques, and the effects of these distributions on the contact               and dipolar hyperfine interactions will be assessed.  Systems to                be studied include transition-metal and rare-earth ions, and such               ions linked to protein molecules.                                                    These studies are expected to contribute to a more detailed                understanding and interpretation of the biomedically important                  MRI technique.  The images produced by MRI can be sharpened                     (i.e., heighten the contrast and reduce the noise) by chemical                  compounds containing certain metal atoms, but these may also have               toxic side effects.  This project is aimed at a fundamental                     understanding of how these compounds work to sharpen the                        image; appropriate non-toxic substances for administration to                   patients can then be devised.",
