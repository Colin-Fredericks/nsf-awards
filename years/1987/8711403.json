 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent evidence, derived largely from studies on vertebrates, indicates         that hormonal proteins and peptides occur as \"families.\"  Each family           contains structurally related molecules, two or more of which may be            found in a single species, or among diverse species in a phyletic               group, or even among representatives of diverse animal phyla.                   Contemporary research attests to the importance of elucidating the              structural basis of the consistancy and variability in peptide families         as well as the functional and evolutionary relationships among such             hormones.   This project focuses on a newly discovered family of                peptides isolated from crustacean and insect sources.  Because of the           simplicity in assessing its cellular actions, this invertebrate                 hormone family serves as an excellent model for evaluating peptide              hormone control mechanisms, functional relationships, and hormone-              receptor interactions.                                                                                                                                          This project involves the isolation, characterization, and chemical             synthesis of pigment-dispersing hormones (PDHs) from representative             species of crabs, prawns, and crayfish.  The purified and synthetic             hormones will be tested for their relative potencies in diverse                 bioassay systems.  By means of radioimmunoassays, the hormone levels in         blood and neuroendocrine tissues will be monitored under various                experimental conditions. Immunocytochemical tests will be employed to           localize hormone-producing cells in representative crustaceans as well          as in selected species of invertebrates.  Depending on the progress in          the above areas, studies will also be carried out to evaluate the               molecular basis of hormone-receptor interactions.                                                                                                               The knowledge derived from these studies would be of comparative                interest to those working with neuropeptides from other invertebrates           and vertebrates.  The inferences drawn from the simple invertebrate             system employed here would be of value in understanding the basis               mechanisms of hormonal molecular diversity and actions.  This project           will provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to           participate in mainstream research in a rapidly advancing research              field, thereby contributing to their career advancement in science and          biotechnology.",
