Since natural languages exhibit many features                     that are foreign to mathematical formalisms and that resist                     analysis by familiar logical techniques, many logicians have                    tended to neglect the goal of accounting for human languages                    and communication.  All along, however, there has also been a                   strong countercurrent within logic devoted to these larger                      interests.  In recent years, the challenges of natural language                 have seemed more urgent to logicians because of the need in                     artificial intelligence for theories of natural language and                    communication.                                                                                                                                                       Within linguistics as well, the need for a robust semantic                 component has been felt almost since the beginning of genera-                   tive grammar.  Since modern syntax stresses the theory of syn-                  tactic units of arbitrary size and complexity, it requires a                    theory of meaning that will serve to accommodate this sort of                   complexity.  Approaches based on logical theory have come to                    predominate in this area.  Since applications to natural                        language strain symbolic logic in many interesting ways,                        linguists cannot in general apply logical theories \"off the                     shelf\"; the process calls for creative adaptation and develop-                  ment of logical material.  Much of the interdisciplinary work                   in logic and linguistics is devoted to such problems.                                                                                                                Since linguistics and logic are separate, well-developed                   disciplines with many subspecialties, it is likely that the                     relatively informal communication across disciplinary boun-                     daries that has taken place so far has left unexploited many                    opportunities for scientific advances that can only take place                  by bringing together specialists from the two fields in                         meetings such as the one proposed here.",
