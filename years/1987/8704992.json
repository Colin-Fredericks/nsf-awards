 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to understand the ecological basis of                social behavior by focusing on a species of bird common in the                  Western United States with an extremely unusual social                          organization, the Acorn Woodpecker.  This species lives in family               groups of up to 15 individuals of both sexes and all ages; all                  birds in a group share in defending the territory and raising                   young.  The study population consists of about 120 birds, the                   majority of which are individually color-marked, and has been                   going on continuously since 1971.  Thus, the project allows the                 unique opportunity to obtain basic data on long-term demographic                consequences of group living.  It also allows an investigation of               some of the specific adaptations to group living shown by this                  species as well as the advantages and disadvantages of their                    unusual social organization.  In particular,  Dr. Koenig will be                exploring the consequences of group living using time-activity                  budgets, the mechanisms of brood reduction, and the role of vocal               behavior in group integration.                                                          Data acquired by the basic research being done as part of               this project will provide new information toward the                            understanding of the evolution of social behavior.  In                          particular, it will uncover more about both the short-term and                  long-term consequences of group living and of altruistic                        behaviors, many of which are shown by this species.",
