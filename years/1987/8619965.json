 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of nine U.S. scientists in a          joint seminar that will focus on the chemistry of heteronuclear cluster         compounds and multimetallic catalysts.  The seminar takes place under           the U.S.-Federal Republic of Germany Cooperative Science Program.  A            few scientists from other countries will also participate.  The main            topics to be discussed are (1) multimetallic catalysts in homogeneous           media, (2) the chemistry of mixed metal molecular clusters, (3)                 molecular clusters on supports, and (4) metal alloys.  Synthesis and            preparative methods, determinations of structure and bonding, and               studies of reactivity and catalytic properties will be reported upon at         the seminar.  The purpose of the meeting is to present the latest               research findings of the participants, to identify topics of mutual             interest, to formulate current problems and goals, and to plan                  directions for new research in the field.  The seminar co-organizers            are Professor Richard D. Adams, Department of Chemistry, University of          South Carolina, and Professor Wolfgang A. Herrmann, Inorganic Chemistry         Institute, Technical University of Munich, Federal Republic of Germany.                                                                                         The discovery that certain metal alloys have catalytic properties that          are far superior to their components has been one of the most important         developments to occur in the area of heterogeneous catalysis in the             last two decades.  Bimetallic catalysts (e.g. platinum-rhodium,                 platinum-iridium) are used extensively in petroleum refining, for               example, though the mechanism of their action is not understood.  The           study of transition metal cluster compounds has also become a focus of          considerable attention during the past twenty-five years.  These                compounds have provided unique opportunities to study the nature of             organic transformations at multinuclear metal sites, and may also               ultimately contribute to a better understanding of heterogeneous                catalysis.  The two related and important areas of research have many           features of their chemistry in common.  In general, however, they are           investigated by significantly different methodologies.  Researchers in          both the U.S. and the Federal Republic of Germany are very active in            these fields of chemistry, and many of the leaders in these areas from          the two countries, plus several from other countries, will participate          in the seminar.  The organizers of the meeting believe that by bringing         together scientists from the two disciplines to discuss their latest            research findings, the concepts and principles that these areas have in         common will be more fully revealed.  This should lead to a better               understanding of the chemistry involved and also stimulate new ideas            and directions for future research.",
