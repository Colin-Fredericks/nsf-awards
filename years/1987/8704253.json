 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student populations.                Eligible instiuttuions must also have graduate programs in science or           programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  New Mexico State                  University will use RIMI support to acquire a dye laser system for              performing materials and combustion research.  Combustion research is           becoming more and more important as a result of potentially rising              fuel costs and environmental issues.  Greater understanding of the              soot formation process will be sought through the utilization of laser          diagnostic techniques for the detection of flames and practical                 combustion systems.  Although all fuels have carbon as the major                chemical element, various soot and other carbonaceous materials should          have significantly different optical properties because of their                different composition.                                                                                                                                          The differential scattering cross section and extinction cross section          of homogeneous spherical soot particles will be found by the Mie                solutions, using complex refractive index, wavelength, and the                  particle size parameter.  The principal investigator is well trained            in optical diagnostics and radiative transfer of flame soot.  The               Foundation has supported this project because minorities will have              greater opportunities to perform meritorius combustion and materials            research.",
