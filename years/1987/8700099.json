 "awd_abstract_narration": "The properties of multiple valence materials will be investigated          by electron spin resonance and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.  The              systems to be investigated include metal in ammonia solutions near the          metal to insulator transition, compounds containing the same element in         at least two different valence states, intercalated layer materials and         one dimensional organic conductors.  All these materials have                   applications in connection with the development of high duty batteries,         catalysts, solid lubricants and new types of anisotropic conductors. The        research work will be carried out at the University of California-              Berkeley Biodynamics Laboratory and at the Stanford Synchrotron                 Radiation Laboratory.                                                                Dr. Acrivos will also teach a new graduate course on \"XAS Applied          to Multiple Valence Materials\" and co-direct Ph.D. theses at the                University of California-Berkeley.                                                   This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering         and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage         women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater         visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the participation        of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future         scientific vitality.",
