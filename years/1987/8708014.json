 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research by Dr. Sidney Auerbach examines the role of                   serotonin in mammalian physiology.  There are two conflicting                   views of the functional organization of serotonin-containing                    nerve cells in the brain.  Some evidence indicates that                         separate groups of these cells are involved in specific                         processes such as control of pain.  In opposition is recent                     evidence that the discharge rate of all serotonin cells is very                 regular and is not increased by physiological or behavioral                     challenges.  To reexamine the controversy raised by the                         electrophysiology data, Dr. Auerbach will use intracerebral                     dialysis to measure release in four anatomically and                            functionally distinct brain areas of freely behaving rats.  If                  release is not affected by challenges such as environmental                     cooling or  physical restraint, it will corroborate the                         electrophysiology and suggest that serotonin is not actively                    involved in responses to stress.  If serotonin release is                       increased, it will suggest that release is regulated at nerve                   endings independently of cell body discharge.  Dr. Auerbach                     will locally administer antagonists to vasopressin and opioids                  to test the possibility that brain substances released during                   stress act at serotonin nerve terminals to regulate serotonin                   release.  The research is expected to yield new insights into                   contradictory evidence concerning how serotonin cells function                  within the brain to regulate physiology.",
