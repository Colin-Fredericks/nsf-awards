The workshop will have several objectives:                   exchange of information on recent advances in the field; generate               outlines of joint research programs on problems of common interest;             and stimulate greater emphasis on research on amorphouis materials in           India.  It is anticipated that the proceedings containing invited and           contributed papers will be published.  The objectives of the workshop           fit those of the U.S.-India program in stimulating collaboration in             areas of interest to the two countries.                                         Merit:  The need for this workshop was identified during the XIV                International Congress on Glasses which was held in New Delhi in                March 1986.  The use of glass, ceramics, and amorphous materials is             fast becoming essential for many applications in communication and              energy , as well as other electrical and mechanical applications.  It           is likely that the workshop will help link some of the few leading              scienists in this area in India with those in the U.S. in future                research projects, to the benefit of the two countries.  The U.S. and           the Indian organizers are well qualified to direct the planned                  meeting.                                                                        Funding:  None other than this action.",
