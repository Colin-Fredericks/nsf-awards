 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a recommendation for an award to support research on fundamental        factors that affect the efficiency of the process by which small                discrete particles suspended in water and wastewater agglomerate to form        more readily settleable masses.  Almost all systems for treatment of            water and many for treatment of wastewater involve the addition of              chemical agents to produce a precipitate that acts as a flocculating            agent, the activity of which is affected by engineering design of the           basin within which the agglomeration is conducted.  Results of this             research may be applied to improvement of the design of these basins to         maximize the agglomeration, minimize the amount of chemicals used and           energy required for mixing, and improve the performance of this process.                                                                                        This project's objectives are consistent with those of the Environmental        Engineering Program and the investigator's qualifications are                   appropriate for the work to be done.                                                                                                                            Award is recommended as a 2-year Continuing Grant, the initial increment        of which is for $62,265 for 12 months starting on January l, 1987.",
