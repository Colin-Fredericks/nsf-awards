 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fission track thermochronology in the Wind River Range in the           Rocky Mountain foreland of western Wyoming has shown the potential to           measure the timing and the rates of tectonic uplift that occurred in            Oligocene/Eocene time.                                                                  The PI will use fission-track thermochronology to:  1) determine        time of uplift initiation and apparent uplift rate for basement-cored           uplifts in the Rocky Mountain foreland; 2) estimate depth of basin fill         in the associated basins; and 3) indentify faulting if it is present in         the cores of other ranges as it is in the Wind Rivers.  In addition,            field studies will be conducted to determine the age of this core               faulting and whether it is compressional or extensional.                                The significance of this project lies in its implications               concerning fundamental cause.  Most theories for foreland deformation           relate to horizontal subduction of the Farrallon plate and/or rotation          of the Colorado Plateau.  However, specific constraints are lacking             inasmuch as our understanding of the timing of deformation is only              general, our models of the geometry do not include young uplift of the          cores and we are not sure how deep the associate basins were filled.            This study is designed to provide the specific temporal and geometric           information needed to constrian theories of Rocky Mountain foreland             deformation.",
