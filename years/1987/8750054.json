 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effectiveness of teaching concepts of spectroscopy has been improved        by the Chemistry Department at Samford University through the recent            acquisition of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. Students        are learning NMR principles and applications of magnetic resonance to           chemical structure, first hand, by obtaining NMR information on                 different types of compounds and correlating this data with NMR theory          as well as other spectroscopic information. This results in a composite         \"picture\" of the molecule, and teaches students how chemical structure          can be investigated. The instrument is used exclusively by undergraduate        chemistry majors and minors in a number of chemistry courses in which a         carefully planned group of experiments teach various aspects of the             technique in a logical sequence that builds on what students have               already learned. This equipment complements existing instrumental               holdings and gives the department a more complete arsenal of analytical         tools through which to teach spectroscopic methods.",
