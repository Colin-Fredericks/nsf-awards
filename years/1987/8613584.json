 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approaching Social Cognition (ASC) is a new theory of social                    cognition concerning the social knowledge and cognitive processes               that people use to understand and act in the social world.  The                 theory is based on the framework of J. R. Anderson's ACT theory                 of memory and cognitive processes, but includes a number of                     extensions, including moods and emotions, our attitudes,                        opinions, and preferences, how we come to know other people as                  well as ourselves, and how we produce social behavior.  This                    research includes six experiments that will test and extend                     various aspects of the theory .                                                                                                                                 Three studies will investigate processes of social cognition, in                particular how they increase in speed and become automatic with                 practice.  One experiment will indicate how consistent the                      practice needs to be in order to increase the efficiency of                     processes; a second, whether individual differences in                          personality may be due to differences in people's cognitive                     processes; and a third, whether the complex relationships between               people's verbally expressed attitudes and their actual behavior                 may be understood by viewing attitudes as cognitive processes.                                                                                                  Two studies investigate the nature of organized knowledge and its               use in understanding new social experiences.  One experiment                    looks at the possibility that information about particular past                 experiences may be stored in memory and may influence the                       perceiver's reactions to similar new experiences, as an                         alternative to the conventional view that only abstract summaries               of past experiences are stored and used.  A second experiment                   examines the relationship between knowledge about categories of                 people (such as racial, occupational or gender categories) and                  stereotyping in person perception.                                                                                                                              Finally, a sixth will use computer simulation to investigate                    whether the various parts of the ASC theory can work together to                generate realistic predictions concerning social behavior, and                  whether those predictions match actual observations of human                    behavior in experimental situations.",
