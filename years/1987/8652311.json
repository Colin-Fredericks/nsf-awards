 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Museum of Science in Boston proposes a major modification of                its permanent New England Wildlife Zones exhibition hall in order               to improve its effectiveness with visitors with impaired sight,                 hearing, or mobility.  They will document and share with other                  museums the successful methods and techniques used in the                       exhibition development process is an effort to improve barrier                  free access in the country's more than 600 science and natural                  history museums.                                                                                                                                                The museum has completed a preliminary needs assessment with the                assistance of handicapped consultants, developed alternative                    design solutions to problems of limited accessibility and                       effectiveness for the hall's existing dioramas, and organized a                 design team that includes senior museum exhibition and education                staff and a handicapped scientist and educator as Co-PI.  The                   Massachusetts College of Art's Adaptive Environments Center will                provide assistance in design for the handicapped and evaluation                 will be under the direction of George Hein, head of Lesley                      College's Program Evaluatlion and Research Group.                                                                                                               Following an extensive design and evaluation process, new exhibit               units will be constructed as educational adjuncts to the existing               hall of dioramas, and the impact of the changes will be assessed,               as part of a dissemination plan that will include popular and                   professional papers and a \"how to\" work book distributed to                     science museum exhibit designers with the assistance of the                     Association of Science Technology Centers and the American                      Association for the Advancement of Science.                                                                                                                     This is a challenging project with the opportunity for a                        significant impact on handicapped individuals who are often                     excluded from the motivational and informational resources of                   science and natural history museums by unnecessary design                       limitations.  The Museum of Science's commitment is strong, the                 project staff are highly qualified, and there is active                         participation by handicapped individuals in the project.",
