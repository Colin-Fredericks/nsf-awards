 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two year project of the Maine Audubon Society will develop 320             Master Science Teachers in order to improve science teaching and                learning in elementary and secondary schools across Maine.                                                                                                      Through eight local workshops followed by one-on-one consultations with         the project staff, assisted by teacher/volunteer teams drawn from the           pilot year already completed, the paticipants will learn to develop and         incorporate inquiry-based learning activities in physical, earth, life          and ecological science into the curriculum.                                                                                                                     In the first year, 160 science teachers identified as promising by their        administrators in 16 school districts will be provided with new                 instructional materials in the form of a SCIENCE AND NATURAL HISTORY:  A        MAINE STUDIES SOURCEBOOK produced by the Maine Audubon Society.  Each           teacher will team with a volunteer who will assist in every aspect of           teaching this material throughout the year.                                                                                                                     In the second year these 160 teacher/volunteer teams will begin to train        their peers and strengthen their schools' curricula.  By the end of the         academic year 320 teachers will be qualified to extend the network to           neighboring towns.  The SOURCEBOOK, developed with the advice of                teachers, principals, scientists, Audubon members and the faculty of the        associated college and university will be refined by the staff and              teacher/volunteer teams.                                                                                                                                        Teachers will be eligible for either 3.5 or 5 recertification credits.          They can also apply the time spent in workshops to the requirements of a        three-credit graduate course on curriculum development they may elect at        the University of Maine, Farmington.                                                                                                                            Dr. Charles E. Hewett, Executive Director of the Maine Audubon Society,         and Dr. Dean Bennett, Associate Professor of secondary education at the         University of Maine, Farmington will be Co-Principal Investigators.             Dr. Bennett is the author of the SOURCEBOOK and Dr. Hewett is an outdoor        educator with experience in the applicaiton of the natural sciences and         economics to resource problems of private industry.  The three other            staff members include Leslie J. Hudson, the director of environmental           education at Maine Audubon Society, Twig George, a researcher/writer in         environmental education and Peter Corcoran, a naturalist/administrator          at the College of the Atlantic.  A marine biologist and a wildlife              biologist are resource persons.",
