 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was                  established in FY 1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the          research capabilities of the strongest and most productive                      predominantly minority institutions.  This planning grant project lays          the foundation for a plan that will increase the institution's quality          of research and research-related training.  Specifically, support for           this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory                  committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial            representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its               current and future potential for performing meritorious research                during the next five years.  Morgan State University will conduct               assessments to strengthen its relatively new School of Engineering.             The institution plans to address the problems of enlarging the pool of          minority engineers and strengthening the capability of those students           who choose to study engineering as a career.                                                                                                                    This institution has the facilities and personnel to do a                       comprehensive planning study.  The Foundation has supported this                project because the proposed work can lead to an increase in the                participation of minorities in science and engineering.",
