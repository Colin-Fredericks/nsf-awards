 "awd_abstract_narration": "The influence of terpenoids on decomposition and nitrogen               cycling in forest ecosystems will be investigated.  Terpenoids                  are  volatile organic compounds naturally produced by many                      plants.  The central idea is that they are produced in large                    enough quantities in forest ecosystems and persist long enough in               forest soils to act as regulators of organic matter breakdown and               key processes in the nitrogen cycle such as mineralization and                  nitrification; the former (mineralization) is the microbially                   mediated conversion of organically-bound nitrogen to inorganic                  nitrogen forms that can be taken up by plants, and the latter                   (nitrification) is the microbial transformation of ammonium to                  nitrate.                                                                                The research will be conducted on ponderosa pine forests of             New Mexico, although the results should have very general                       applicability.  The four specific objectives of research are as                 follows: 1) identify the temporal variation in terpenoid levels                 within the soil profile of an undisturbed soil profile in a                     ponderosa pine forest in a field study; 2) correlate terpenoid                  variation in the soil profile with variation in decomposition and               nitrogen dynamics in the soil in the laboratory; 3) identify the                specific terpenoids acting as regulators of decay and nitrogen                  cycling in the laboratory; and 4) test the results of the                       laboratory investigations in the field through a manipulation                   experiment involving burning to volatilize the terpenoids and                   then adding known amounts of specific terpenoids back to the                    system and following decomposition and nitrogen dynamics.                               The significance of this research lies in its focus on a                factor, terpenoid concentration, that can influence the nitrogen                cycle in forest ecosystems. Nitrogen is often a limiting nutrient               in forest ecosystems and understanding the cause(s) of this                     limitation would have important implications for forest                         management.                                                                             Dr. White is a young and very promising researcher and he               will receive strong support, both technical and intellectual, for               his research at the University of New Mexico.                                           The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends that this award be             made.",
