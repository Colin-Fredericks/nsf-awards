 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department at St. Olaf College is in the process of                 modernizing its introductory and advanced laboratories.  The                    instrumentation to be acquired will greatly increase access to computers        for data acquisition, analysis and display.  A variety of instruments,          with stand-alone capability as well as computer access, will give access        to state-of-the-art electronic devices.  These include:  a digital              multimeter, a digital storage scope, a versatile function generator, and        a power supply; all with GPIB capability. The computing equipment will          include terminals (with and without graphics capability) to allow               greater access to existing multi-user computers, and a PC/AT compatable         with high resolution color graphics, plotter, interfacing cards, and            software for data acquisition and analysis.  The large introductory             laboratory sections will benefit from the addition of four                      microcomputers, with bit-mapped graphics capability, to give access to a        routine already developed for data analysis.  Two printers will supply          hard-copy of the results.  A number of electronics and advanced                 laboratory experiments will take advantage of the greater precision or          speed of access to examine topics of fundamental interest, but not              generally accessible with conventional instrumentation.",
