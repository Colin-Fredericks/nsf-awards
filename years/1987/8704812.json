 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for                   the determination of the molecular structure of compounds as                    diverse as small polypeptide and complex metal clusters.  When                  combined with the latest computer software, the technique is                    becoming remarkably easy to put into practice.  The acquisition                 of X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the                 ability of chemists to carry out frontier research.                                                                                                             The Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University                  will purchase a new Single Crystal X-ray Structure                              Determination System with support from the Chemistry Shared                     Instrumentation Program.  The new instrumentation will be used                  to enhance research in areas of chemistry that involve the                      following types of materials:                                                                                                                                      1) conducting inorganic complexes and their precursors                          2) transition metal silicon compounds                                           3) binuclear transition metal chelate complexes                                 4) natural products, their derivatives, and precursors                             used in their total synthesis",
