 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort deals with the use of concepts borrowed form recent                 developments in modelling of brain function.  By issuing circuit                elements with specified characteristics and interconnecting them in a           dense manner (many elements - many interconnections among them) one is          able to perform calculations in a parallel manner; such calculations            being distributed throughout the interconnected elements.  The                  properties of such circuits make them advantageous for such functions as        pattern and motion recognition, generalization, and generally many              calculational efforts which are difficult with conventional computers.                                                                                          Although the model can best be a primitive and crude representation of          the complexities of biological neural systems, the concepts and                 approaches which have resulted from it have stimulated new and different        approaches to many engineering problems.",
