 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the task of keeping the high school and middle           school curriculum current in the area of contemporary genetics by               providing continuing education, inservice, and logistical support to a          selected and diverse group of teachers throughout the state of Kansas.          For maximum effectiveness the scope is focused on the specific,                 interdisciplinary topic of molecular genetics and the genetic effects of        radiation, using yeast cells as a model system.  However, the need that         is addressed and the approach taken should be appropriate for any field         where progress in research and technology is moving too fast for the            standard teacher education and curriculum development pathways to               respond in a timely fashion.                                                                                                                                    The project has been designed, and will be implemented, by an                   interdisciplinary team of professionals with strong commitments to              improvement of science education.  They represent professional                  competence in research in the discipline, research in science education,        and classroom teaching at the secondary and post-secondary school               levels.  They include university faculty members from the Kansas State          University (KSU) Departments of Physics, Biology, and Curriculum and            Instruction, a graduate student in Curriculum and Instruction, and high         school science teachers.  Thirty secondary school science teachers will         participate in the program during each of two years.                                                                                                            Each of the one-year periods will begin with a three-week, intensive            summer workshop on the KSU campus to introduce the participating                teachers to the content, teaching strategies, and technology.  Using            this knowledge base, the participants will develop lesson plans under           the close guidance of the staff.  The lessons will utilize laboratory           experiments in yeast genetics, microcomputer software, video materials,         and the critical thinking skills of problem solving and concept mapping.                                                                                        During the subsequent school year these lesson plans will be implemented        in the participants' classrooms.  The project staff will provide                continuing support during this phase.  Follow-up and consultation will          be facilitated through a 24-hour computer bulletin board and electronic         mail service, a series of teleconferences, one weekend conference               associated with annual conference of the Kansas Association of Teachers         of Science, as well as individual consultation by telephone and mail.           These communication channels will provide continuing contact between the        project staff and the participating teachers as well as offering the            teachers several ways to communicate directly with each other.                                                                                                  An important contingent of the project staff will be peer teachers who          have taught these materials.  During the first year these will be               teachers who participated in a related NSF-sponsored workshop and               teleconference project in 1985.  During the second year of the project          the pool of peer teachers will expand to include the teachers from the          first year.  By keeping the lines of communication open to all current          and previous participants we will be developing a network of teachers           who can share experiences and information and who can be provided               continuing support by the project staff, and subsequently, through              continuing programs that are the mission of the KSU Center for Science          Education.",
