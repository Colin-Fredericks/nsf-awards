 "awd_abstract_narration": "A feasibitlity study is proposed for development of a                 mathematical learning model for constructive induction and parameter            selection, and its application to a machining operation.  The model will        enable the decision maker (eg., machine operator) to arrive at the most         satisfactory decision regarding parameter selection in the machining            operation.  The model will \"learn\" from past performance of the                 operation, and from the operator's previous input, and automatically            determine machining                                                             parameters.                                                                          The model is based on decision variables such as feed and speed;           objectives such as cost, production rate, and quality; and the                  operator's overall index of performance or utility.  This approach              should enable the model to become more customized to the requirements of        a specific operation, operator, and equipment, and could be valuable in         enhancing the interaction of operator and machine.                                   The exploratory effort will focus on determining various ways to           construct the model and achieve the objectives, in terms of both theory         and application.  The proposed study appears to present a novel approach        to parameter selection for machining operations, which while far from           practical usefulness, seems a necessary starting point, which could lead        to a sharper definition of the concept.  An award is therefore                  recommended under the procedure for Expedited Awards for Novel Research.",
