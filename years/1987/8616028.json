 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fish gill is the primary interface between the fish and the fish's          environment.  The gill plays a major role in respiration and in the             regulation of ion and water balance. Control of blood flow through              this organ is then of primary importance in the maintenance of internal         body fluid homeostasis.  Dr. Olson plans a series of studies on the             action and metabolism of hormones and hormone-like factors in the blood         that regulate blood flow through the gill vascular network.  Dr. Olson          has developed a gill perfusion procedure that allows measurement of             blood flow, blood pressure, etc. in the presence and absence of various         agents such as angiotensin, bradykinin, biogenic amines, and other              compounds that are known to be regulators of blood flow in other                tissues.  He has adapted the procedure so that he will be able to               measure the uptake and metabolism of these compounds by the gill tissue         as they pass through the gill.  He will then be able to correlate               vascular changes with the metabolic events and determine which of these         factors are the major actors in the regulation of blood flow.                                                                                                   The research results are of primary importance to our understanding of          the regulation of blood flow in respiratory organs.  In addition the            results will contribute to our understanding of hormone metabolism by           gill tissue and to the role of environmental factors (i.e. pollutants)          that might damage the gills and thereby disturb blood flow through              the gills and upset hormone balance within the stressed fish.",
