 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimal use of video resources as an integral part of                   instruction in K-12 public schools has been hampered by the                     difficulty teachers experience in obtaining video materials that                meet specific instructional meeds, and obtaining access to video                equipment.  A project conducted by the Georgia Department of                    Education in the late 1970's demonstrated that utilization of                   instructional television (ITV) materials increased if teachers                  were given input into the selection and scheduling of ITV                       programming.  Since that time, the use of broadcast in Georgia as               a means of resource distribution instead of resource scheduling                 has given teachers greater flexibility in the selection of                      instructional video resources.  Two limiting factors remain: and                inability on the part of the teachers to determine which video                  meets specific instructional needs and a lack of video equipment                in the classroom.  The Georgia Department of Education and the                  Clarke County School System will develop and implement a model                  project which demonstrates that optimal video utilization is                    achieved if teachers are provided: 1) easy access to video                      equipment in the classroom, 2) video materials that support their               instructional needs, and 3) instruction in the use of video                     materials and the operation of video equipment.  This project                   will equip each math and science classroom in Clarke County with                a videocassette recorder and television monitor, provide each                   school with a collection of math and science video resources, and               provide teachers with a comprehensive video index, and                          development in the utilization of video resources.  The project                 will measure and compare level of video usage before and after                  classrooms are equipped with easily accessible equipment.                               That quality video materials increase learning has been                 documented.  The potential for improving teaching and learning                  through the use of new technologies has also been demonstrated.                 However, the demands of the classroom teachers tend to preclude                 their taking the steps now necessary to utilize the technologies.               This project will provide a model as well as documentation that                 teachers want and will use improved methods of instruction if                   unreasonable demands are not made in order to use the methods.                  The final results can be used as arguments for those making                     policy decisions for expending more resources on new teaching                   technologies.",
