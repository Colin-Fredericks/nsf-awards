 "awd_abstract_narration": "These investigators have examined the DNA content of                       individual cells of the  wild mushroom Amarilla mellea.  They                   observed that the basidiocarp (the part  above ground) contains                 cells that have one haploid nucleus, while the mycelium (root) is               thought to be diploid. The meiotic events involved in spore                     formation occur within specialized structures of the basidiocarp                and must be separate from those events that give rise to the                    haploid cells during generation of the basidiocarp itself.  The                 applicants propose a careful microscpoic examination of the                     basidiocarp to determine the site (or  timing) of haplodization.                They hope to identify particular cells undergoing meiotic                       divisions and to characterize the structure of the chromosomes in               these cells.  They also propose a simple genetic test of                        individual cells to  see if the haploid cells have different                    genotypes. If present, such genetic mosaicism could play an                     important role in the regulation of development of the organism.                Besides documenting an unusual and interesting phenomenon, these                studies will provide an opportunity for a  number of                            undergraduates to participate in scientific research.",
