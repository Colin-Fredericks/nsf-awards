PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  Deterministic analyses applied to velocity                fluctuation data obtained close to gas-liquid interface allow the               estimation of the length and velocity scales of individual eddies taking        part in gas absorption.  The mass transfer prediction by this method has        been shown to be superior to that by the statistical method employing           the root mean square velocity and the integral length scale in two              turbulence gas absorption.  An extension of the deterministic approach          to higher turbulence and for different device geometries is proposed.           The spectrum analyzer is expected to expand the scope in this research          significantly.  Simultaneous measurements of concentration and velocity         fluctuations by an oxygen microprobe and a laser doppler anemometer             allow, for the first time, the investigation of transfer phenomena on a         single eddy level.  This method is utilized to confirm the proposed             deterministic approach for analyzing mass transfer phenomena.                                                                                                   JUSTIFICATION:  The proposed research will help establish the                   deterministic method for analyzing the velocity fluctuation data to             obtain the length and velocity scales of individual eddies.  This new           approach is expected to give better prediction of the mass transfer             compared with the conventional statistical approach, and it could be            extended to heat transfer as well.  Potential applications exist in             design of new biofermentors and gas-liquid chemical reactors.",
