 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the long-standing goals of the computer-aided design                community is to write computer programs that will automatically                 design circuits from abstract descriptions of their desired                     behavior.  Programs that are effective circuit designers cannot be built        until the roles of knowledge-based and algorithmic techniques in circuit        design are understood.  Knowledge-based systems are ideal for studying a        large design space where the guidelines are poorly understood, but it is        nearly impossible to verify their correctness.  Design algorithms are           easier to maintain and verify, but a complete set cannot be built               without a more complete and formal understanding of circuit design than         is likely to exist in the foreseeable future.  Incorrect application of         either method can only produce unreliable programs or low quality               designs.                                                                             This research will focus on a program for automatic circuit                design that will partition the design task into algorithmic and                 knowledge-based parts, generate components, and combine the                     components into a single whole.  The major research issues are how to           partition the original design task and how to recompose the parts into a        functioning whole.",
