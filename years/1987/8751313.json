 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Teachers Association in cooperation with the               National Center for Excellence in Education will conduct a                      Physics and Computer Science Summer Institute for High School                   Teachers for 32 physics teachers of gifted students at Long                     Island University during two weeks in the summer of 1987 and another 48         teachers during three weeks in 1988.  At each institute, conducted by           NCEE, teachers will study advanced concepts in physics and computer             science with special emphasis on solving problems and explore                   alternative teaching strategies for which they will receive two graduate        credits from Long Island University. They will interact formally and            informally with eight eminent scientists, including two Nobel laureates,        who will visit the project and give evening lectures. Teachers will             observe and participate in the NCEE math, science, and computer science         program for 120 academically talented high school students and assist in        designing and running the mathematics and science olympiads in that             program.                                                                                                                                                        Following the institute, participants will expand or start science clubs        and organize physics competitions in their schools or districts with the        technical assistance of NCEE.  Also, they will be given release time to         conduct workshops for their colleagues to share information and teaching        methodologies from the institute using videotapes of the lectures.  NSTA        will prepare and disseminate a monograph based on the institute                 experiences to assist other teachers in setting up and running math             clubs and competitions.                                                                                                                                         One goal of this project is to establish a model that improves the              professional image of high school teachers by recognizing them as               legitimate members of a peer group that includes distinguished                  scientists, acknowledging the important relationship between a high             school teacher's professional status within the educational and research        community and his or her own job satisfaction.  By interacting with             leading research  scientists, institute participants will expand their          knowledge of science and their range of teaching skills and be able to          share the benefits of this experience with students and colleagues.",
