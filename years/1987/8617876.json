Earlier studies have suggested that               certain patterns of errors displayed by second language learners                are not directly attributable to either the native or the target                language grammars, but are nonetheless consistent with principles               that have been independently proposed as defining possible human                languages.  The investigation will focus on two such types of                   error patterns:  those involving anaphor binding, and those                     involving syllabic organization.                                                                                                                                     The interest of this project lies not only in its potential                to add to the fairly scanty data available on second language                   acquisition, but also in its relation to central issues in                      linguistic theory.  Much recent work in linguistics has been                    concerned with developing a theory that can provide a unified                   account of the range of variation across natural languages and                  the patterns of acquisition of the child language learner.  The                 formulation of this theory is still in the preliminary stages,                  and it is still an open question whether the principles of                      universal grammar play any role in the acquisition of a second                  language.  This study bears crucially on both the nature of                     second language acquisition and the nature of universal                         principles of linguistic organization.                                                                                                                               The investigators are well qualified to undertake the                      proposed research.  The Principal Investigator is a recent Ph.D.                who has been active in research in syntactic and phonological                   theory.  The Co-Principal Investigator has also been working                    productively in phonological and morphological theory, and, for                 the last few years, in the emerging field of scientific research                on second language acquisition.  Both have been very productive,                and their complementary skills portend well for a successful                    outcome of the project.",
