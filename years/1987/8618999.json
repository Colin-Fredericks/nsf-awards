 "awd_abstract_narration": "This longitudinal study of the development of law, under the               able direction of Dr. Calavita, examines the decisionmaking                     processes of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) as                it has interpreted Congressional legislation.  The focus of the                 research is on the period from 1952 to the present, a time in                   which the INS has exercised wide discretion in the interpretation               of Congressional statutes.  Also Dr. Calavita examines judicial-                administrative interaction and the influence of court decisions                 on INS decisionmaking and discretion.  Systematic analysis of                   archival data and in-depth interviews are used to probe the                     transition from formal law to law-in-action and the effect of the               external and internal environment on this policymaking process.                 Among the factors under study are a macro-level contradiction                   between the economic role of immigration and the political effort               to restrict immigration, INS response to concerns articulated by                special interest groups and individual legislators, and a dual                  personnel structure within the agency itself that includes both                 political appointees and career officials.  This study represents               an important attempt to advance knowledge of the evolution from                 formal to de facto law, while bridging the theoretical schism                   between macro- and micro-level explanations of legal behavior.                  It should add considerably to our scientific understanding of                   lawmaking in administrative agencies.",
