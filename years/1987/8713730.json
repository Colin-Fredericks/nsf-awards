 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of optimal foraging predicts that animals in nature will             select a diet that balances the energy consumed through feeding with            energy expended in such activities as self-maintenance, socializing, and        obtaining food.  Although this theory is an excellent framework for             studying the feeding patterns of predators, optimal-foraging theory             needs more careful evaluation when considering the ready adaptability of        some primates, such as the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), to extremely         diverse habitats and food resources.                                                                                                                            Through social learning, macaque monkeys of several species have                developed unique feeding adaptations.  On Koshima Island in Japan, the          monkeys (Macaca fuscata) carefully monitor the tidal movements and have         learned to remove and eat limpets when these animals have relaxed their         muscles under changing tidal pressure.  On Cayo Santiago, an island off         the coast of Puerto Rico, preliminary observations indicate that rhesus         monkeys may also have developed specific feeding techniques to harvest          marine organisms.  These monkeys are particularly suitable subjects for         assessing learned behavior patterns in relation to family relationships,        as the lineage of individual monkeys is known since the 1930s.                                                                                                  Does optimal-foraging theory account for these unique feeding                   adaptations?  Drs. Marriott and Tobach will carry out a pilot study that        will provide basic information for the development of two future long-          term projects on the feeding behavior and ecology of rhesus monkeys.            The first is an initial study of the feeding ecology of rhesus monkeys          on Cayo Santiago across the yearly seasons.  The second is a preliminary        descriptive study of feeding on marine organisms within the contex of           the overall feeding ecology.  The objective of this project is to               collect quantitative information across the yearly vegetational seasons         on 40 identifiable rhesus monkeys of both sexes.  All food items will be        sampled, identified, and combusted to determine gross energy.                   Continuous behavioral observations will include data on food-collection,        -preparation, and social aspects of feeding.  Estimates of energy               expenditure and input will be calculated to develop a bioenergetic              evaluation of feeding patterns.  Thus, Drs. Marriott and Tobach will            describe marine feeding adaptations of the Cayo Santiago rhesus monkeys         and will evaluate these feeding adaptations in terms of optimal-foraging        theory and the social status and lineage of individual animals.",
