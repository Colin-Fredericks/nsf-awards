 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Haslingden Group is the oldest cover sequence in the                Mount Isa Orogen; it is ca. 18 km thick and accumulated in the                  Leichhardt River Fault Trough (LRFT) between 1800 and 1710 Ma                   ago on ca. 1860 Ma-old continental crust.  The volcano-                         sedimentary Haslingden Group has previously been interpreted as                 a single-stage rift sequence and an overlying sedimentary                       package, the Quilalar Formation, as the sag phase associated                    with subsequent thermal contraction of the lithosphere.  Our                    preliminary work on the Haslingden Group suggests a more                        complex evolution involving at least two stages of rifting.                     This hypothesis will be evaluated by:  i) constraining the                      stratigraphic evolution of the Haslingden Group through a                       detailed sedimentological/paleogeographical analysis including                  quantitative analysis of shallow marine sediments of probable                   tidal origin; ii) contrasting the stratigraphic evolution of the                Haslingden Group with documented rift sequences in the geologic                 record; and iii) quantitatively modelling the subsidence                        history of the LRFT within the constraints of the stratigraphic                 analysis and the geochronological framework.  An understanding                  of the stratigraphic evolution of the Haslingden Group will                     enhance the understanding of less well-exposed rifts such as                    the North Sea and Keweenawan Rifts and of rifts in general.                             The proposed study is part of a multidisciplinary                       investigation of the Mount Isa Orogen, including a structural                   analysis of the LRFT, by the Bureau of Mineral Resources,                       Australia.  As part of this project we will be able to evaluate                 the evolution of the LRFT within its own tectonic context as                    well as within the framework of surrounding tectonic processes.                 The results of the analysis of the Haslingden Group will be                     integrated with ongoing structural-metamorphic, geochronologic,                 geochemical and sedimentological studies to formulate a                         comprehensive tectonic model for the Mount Isa Orogen.                          Subsidence modelling and integration  of various disciplines in                 developing a tectonic model for the Mount Isa Orogen will be                    undertaken while the PI is on study leave at the BMR for the                    duration of 1988.",
