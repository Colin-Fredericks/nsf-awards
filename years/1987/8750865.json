 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student laboratory opportunities in Molecular and Cellular Biology,             Endocrinology and Physiology are being enhanced, and increased                  opportunities for undergraduate research and internships are being              provided through the purchase of needed instructional instruments.              Renovated cell culture and endocrinology laboratory facilities as well          as new instrumentation for enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays, cell             culture, high pressure liquid chromatography, and spectrophotometry are         providing significant links between students' laboratory and field              experiences in whole organismal biology at the College's field station          and their laboratory experiences in Cell Biology, Physiology,                   Microbiology and Endocrinology on campus.                                                                                                                       Increasing student understanding of both the potentials and the                 limitations of blood screening procedures also is being gained by non-          majors through use of the enzyme-linked immunoassay equipment procured          under this award.  Such socially relevant laboratory experience is an           important aspect of education for non-scientists who will be decision           makers in a technology-based society.",
