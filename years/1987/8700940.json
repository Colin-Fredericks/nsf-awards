Often this                    plasticity has a genetic basis and as a result can influence the                rate and direction of evolution.  Morphological plasticity is                   little known among vertebrates.  Increasing evidence indicates                                                                                                  braziliensis and G.steindachneri, which represent the extremes of                                                                                               cichlid developmental modes.  Our research aims to answer the                   following questions: (1) What effect does the size at which                     feeding commences have on the amount of morphological plasticity                that is expressed? (2) Are there age-related differences in the                 amount of plasticity that can be induced? (3) Do induced                        morphological differences affect feeding efficiency on diets that                                                                                               are associated with different feeding modes?

This study will go beyond a description of morphological                   plasticity; it will examine plasticity in a developmental,                      genetic, functional, and ecological context.  Only through such                 an interdisciplinary approach can the effect of plasticity on                   evolution, and the evolution of plasticity, itself, be                          understood. 8700940                                                             McCume                                                                               Phenotypic plasticity is the modification of some trait of                 an organism in response to environmental change.

This research will integrate vocal, morphological,                and genetic data in the highly polytypic North American red                     crossbill (Loxia curvirostra) complex.  This group presents an                  unsolved evolutionary paradox: the birds are nomadic, suggesting                a high rate of gene flow, yet there is extreme diversity in bill                size, body size, and plumage coloration within the group.
