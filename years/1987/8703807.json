 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extensions of logics currently used in computer science are being               investigated.  Under particular consideration are extensions of temporal        and dynamic logic which appear to be quite natural and to have                  considerable expressive power.  A new model of alternating automata             working on trees is being used that allows very simple and efficient            decision procedures.  In basic cases, proofs of decidability of the             intended logics are being given that are simpler than the standard              proofs for the unextended logics.  Extensions of these methods are being        attempted to questions involving protocols where knowledge should be            taken into account for communicating systems.  Also under consideration         are some extremely strong dynamic logics with infinitary run quantifiers        in which essentially any fairness condition can be expressed.                                                                                                   The PIs propose to use tools they have developed in recent innovative           work in formal language theory to investigate logics used in computer           science.  The theory program can properly devote funds toward the               development and use of such methods in theoretical computer science.            The proposed work ties together in a positive way the theory traditions         of the U.S. and France.",
