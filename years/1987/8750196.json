 "awd_abstract_narration": "A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS), which has recently been          acquired by the Chemistry Department of the University of West Florida          is finding application in six undergraduate courses and in directed             student research. Courses in basic organic chemistry, with a variety of         majors, and advanced organic chemistry, with chemistry and allied health        science majors are significantly enhanced by the availability of this           system. Students are enabled to collect and evaluate firsthand data as,         for example, (1) separating and identifying halocarbons by examining the        molecular ions formed, (2) differentiating between isomers such as              methyl p-hydroxybenzoate and p-methoxybenzoic acid by examining the             fragmentation ions, (3) preparing and analyzing volatile                        organometallics, and (4) evaluating water supplies for organic                  contaminants.",
