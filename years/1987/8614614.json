 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. C. M. Wayman,                        Professor of Metallurgy, University of Illinois, to pursue with                 Dr. Myung-Chul Shin, Head, Precision Metals Research Laboratory,                Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, for a period of             24 months, a program of cooperative research on the properties,                 transformation characteristics, and shape memory behavior of                    grain-refined copper-zinc-aluminum alloys.  These alloys are                    typically brasses, containing about 70% copper, by weight, and 2-8%             aluminum.  They demonstrate the shape memory effect through which an            alloy deformed at some lower temperature completely recovers its                initial undeformed shape upon heating to a higher temperature.  The             research will involve the application of grain refinement techniques            such as zirconium doping to reduce grain size so as to improve                  formability and resistance to fatigue.  Transmission and analytical             electron microscopy will be used to examine presumably                          zirconium-rich second phase particles within the grains and along               grain boundaries, while the chemical composition of the particles               will be determined by analytical electron microscopy microanalysis.             The degree of coherency, strain fields, and other mechanical aspects            of the particles will be determined using transmission electron                 microscopy.  Macroscopic aspects of the research will include                   characterization of the alloys in terms of grain size versus                    fatigue, transformation temperatures, and the extent of shape memory            in the grain refined alloys.                                                                                                                                    This research is important because of the broad range of interest in            the applications of shape memory alloys to controls, fasteners,                 electronic systems, medical prosthetics, actuators, and other                   devices for transportation, computers, machinery, agriculture,                  energy, building, and other manufacturing groups.  This project is              relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science                Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of                scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through               collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  The U.S. and Korean               collaborators are highly respected scientists with extensive                    research experience and productive publication records in the field             of the proposal.",
