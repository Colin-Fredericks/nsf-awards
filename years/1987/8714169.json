 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in computing power have dramatically                       stimulated the development of methods in statistics and system                  optimization.  Much of the progress is due to an increased                      ability to optimize general multiparameter functions--partly as a               result of increased computing power in general, but more because                of algorithmic advances in optimization techniques.                                  So far there has been only sporadic informal contact between               those who develop new methodology and those who develop                         optimization methods.  This project will support a formal                       collaboration of reseatchers in the departments of Computer                     Science, Electrical Engineering, Operations Research, and                       Statistics.  Objectives include the development and                             implementation of algorithms in the areas of projection pursuit,                global optimization, multivariate smoothing, and decentralized                  controller design.  Associated with the methodological                          development will be research into theoretical and inferential                   properties, combined with issues of interpretation and graphic                  display.",
