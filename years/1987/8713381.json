Operating funds        are provided by the Department of State and reimbursed by the NSF for           salaries and benefits for the Head of the office and a secretary, their         housing, educational allowances, etc.                                                                                                                           The NSF/Europe office serves as an important link between the American          scientific community and the European scientific community through the          dissemination of technical information, the development of ad hoc               reports, and interaction with international organizations (NATO, OECD,          UNESCO, the European Science Foundation, etc.).  This office provides an        excellent opportunity for U.S. science to keep abreast of changes and           advances in European S&T activities and the status of European science.         NSF/Europe facilitates the Foundation's ability to access and maintain          liaison with European centers of excellence and to target the activities        conducted under INT's bilateral programs.",
