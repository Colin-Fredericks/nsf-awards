 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new course \"Field, Survey, and Analysis Techniques in Environmental           Biology\" is being developed.  This new course is introducing the                students to new concepts and techniques in ways designed to stimulate           interest in investigative studies and in research projects.  Using the          equipment procured through this award, Biology majors are gaining               experience in the description and analysis of ecological systems, as            well as in hypothesis structuring, field sampling, literature retrieval         and use, descriptive and analytical statistical techniques, field               surveys and experimental design methods.                                                                                                                        Methods and techniques involved in field studies of aquatic and                 terrestrial habitats are being introduced through studies of  aquatic           and terrestrial components of the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers and the          Chesapeake Bay.  Students are becoming better prepared for future               graduate or lab/research positions by using the newly available                 fluorescent and phase microscopes, fluorometer, ion analyzer,                   spectrophotometer, sieve shaker, incubator, colony counter, furnace, and        BOD and pH meters.  Like all other parts of the Gallaudet curriculum,           this program is designed especially to meet the needs of students with          severely impaired hearing.",
