 "awd_abstract_narration": "WNET/Thirteen will produce a series of 10 one hour public                       television programs, \"CHILDHOOD\" that will explore how children                 grow and develop,and how parents and societies have raised                      children throughout history and across cultures.  Extensive use                 of current research and scholarships from the disciplines of                    developmental and cognitive psychology, anthropology and                        sociology, education, history and culture will be used to create                a coherent and revealing view of childhood development.                                                                                                         The series will be heavily promoted on public television, will be               accompanied by a trade book and viewer's guide, and should                      generate audiences of more than 10 million viewers in its first                 series airing, based on prior experience with the producers prior               series, \"The Brain\"; the accompanying trade book sold more than                 150,000 copies.                                                                                                                                                 The producers of this series are highly skilled at the                          interpretation of complex scientific subjects on television, with               a number of award-winning series to their credit.  They have                    assembled an prestigious international team of advisors and                     consultants.  WNET has a realistic plan for raising the $7.5                    million necessary to complete the project from the PBS/CPB                      Superfund, corporations, and co-production agreements.  An award                of $200,000 in FY 87 and continuing funding of $200,000 in FY 88                based on satisfactory progress is recommended.",
