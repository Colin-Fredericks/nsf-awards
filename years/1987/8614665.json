 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will develop general, efficient methods for                  effecting asymmetric induction in organocopper conjugate addition               reactions and formally equivalent SN2' substitution reactions.  The             project has four specific goals.  First, several potentially effective          chiral non-transferable ligands, suggested by the preliminary study,            will be synthesized and examined.  These include a chiral bicyclic              \u01313.3.0! octahydrocyclopenta\u0131b!pyrrole ring system and a chiral                  binaphthyl amido ligand that may provide an electronic basis for the            asymmetric induction.  Second, mechanistic studies involving 1H, 13C,           and 7Li NMR experiments and molecular weight determinations will be             undertaken to probe the structures and compositions of the various              cuprate reagents.  Third, methods involving chiral transferable ligands         that can be readily transformed into a variety of substituents by               facile functional group manipulations will be examined.  Fourth,                methods involving readily prepared chiral substrates and their                  reactions with organocopper reagents in conjugate addition and SN2'             substitution reactions will be explored.  These methods involve chiral          alpha, beta-unsaturated hydrazones and allylic acetals.                                                                                                         This research was initiated at Boston University and then transferred           to Clemson University.  It will lead to the development of new,                 efficient methods for synthesizing natural products.  It has resulted           in nine publications.",
