 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this basic engineering research is to produce an                 instrument that will provide for fine control of muscle movement in             patients who have incurred irreparable damage to the nervous system eg.,        stroke and spinal-cord injury.  Thus through instrument control, the            patient will regain use of limbs that had lost all voluntary movement.          All research proposed here will be done on cats.                                                                                                                The proposed system provides for two sets of electrodes.  One set of            electrodes will be for sending electrical stimulation to the muscles to         produce contraction and relaxation in a way analogous to the electrical         stimulation the nervous system normally provides the muscles for                voluntary control of muscle movement.  A second set of electrodes will          monitor the electrical activity produced by the muscles and thus \"sense\"        the degree of contraction or relaxation which determines the position of        the muscle, then use this information to control the muscle movement;           this, again is an instrumentation technique analogous to the way in             which the nervous system normally controls muscle movement.                                                                                                     The unique feature of this research is that the electrical stimulus to          control the muscle movement will use a range of frequencies                     simultaneously.  The higher frequencies can be used to inhibit muscle           contraction; thus it is expected that a very fine muscle response can be        achieved.  The result will be a more stable movement with less fatigue          than previously achieved.",
