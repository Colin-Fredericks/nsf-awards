This project         aims to increase the numbers of students studying physics and the               quality of the instruction they receive by increasing the physics               knowledge and teaching resources shared between school and college              instructors.                                                                                                                                                    This sharing will be supported by the formation of local alliances among        secondary school physics/physical science teachers and college physics          instructors.  The American Physical Society will sponsor regional               workshops for school and college instructors who wish to form such              alliances.  The project will then provide experienced advice and support        to newly forming alliances, and will link collaboratives together               through an alliance newsletter and other publications.",
