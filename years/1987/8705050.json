 "awd_abstract_narration": "Karsten Grove's research will be directed towards the                      important questions of finding the relationships between the                    geometry and topology of Riemannian manifolds. The main emphasis                will be devoted to problems relating geometry and/or                            transformation groups to homotopy theory. The general areas to be               considered are finiteness problems for manifolds with bounds on                 curvature, diameter and volume; the structure of manifolds with                 non-negative curvature; Riemannian foliations and isoparametric                 submanifolds; Morse theory for maps.                                                 In the context of finiteness theorems he is seeking a result               which would show that for manifolds with curvature bounded below,               diameter bounded above and volume bounded below, there are only                 finitely many possible homotopy types. The focus of attention in                the case of manifolds of non-negative curvature will be the                     conjecture that such manifolds are rationally elliptic. Finally                 he will investigate relations between the homotopy and                          cohomogeneity of a manifold and the geometry of orbit foliations                of space forms.",
