 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to recommend funding for three years to study                    neurotransmitters in the ear.  Cells in the nervous system make                 functional connections called synapses; a biochemical compound                  used to transmit information across a synapse is called a                       neurotransmitter.  The synthesis, release, uptake and turnover of               neurotransmitters play key roles in information processing; the                 regulation of these steps by other compounds thus modulate the                  information transfer.  Not much is known about the                              neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in the inner ear, and this                 organ provides a model system with several neuroactive substances               to study their possible interactions.                                                                                                                           This project will quantify the neurochemical interactions within                the cochlea of the inner ear.  The cochlea contains the auditory                receptor cells which synapse on fibers of the auditory nerve that               carry signals to the brain; in addition, there are fibers called                efferents that carry signals from certain central brain regions                 out to the cochlea.  The efferent pathway apparently acts to                    modulate the sensory transmission coming in to the auditory                     pathway.  The auditory transmitter release may be affected, or                  the molecular receptor sites on the auditory nerve terminals may                be affected by neuromodulators released from the efferent                       terminals.  Thus this first synapse in the auditory pathway can                 be considered a \"multitransmitter\" synapse.  The bony shell                     containing the cochlea and nerve will be used in situ as a                      perfusion chamber to study the release, degredation and receptor                interactions of two major classes of neuromodulator candidates:                 the opioid peptides and acetylcholine.  Liquid chromatography,                  radioimmune assays and radioreceptor assays will unambiguously                  identify and quantify the neuroactive substances sampled from the               cochlear tissues.  To study mechanisms of possible co-                          transmission, perfusion of this space will be used to collect                   neuroactive substances in response to stimulation, and to infuse                specific substances that have known agonist or antagonist actions               at the synaptic receptor sites.                                                                                                                                 The Program in Sensory Physiology & Perception recommends funding               this project because it uses a cleaver, novel preparation to                    clarify the biochemical mechanisms involved in the auditory                     system, and the principles elucidated are likely to be applicable               to other interactions of neurotransmitters elsewhere in the                     brain.",
