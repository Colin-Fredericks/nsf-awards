 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns algebraic varieties with trivial                    canonical bundle. They play a special role in algebraic geometry                and its relations with other fields.  They form the main class of               examples of varieties with Kodaira number zero, which are the                   \"building blocks\" out of which many other varieties are                         constructed.  They also play an important role in differential                  geometry, for example, Yau's solution of the Calabi conjecture                  implies that all such varieties carry a Ricci-flat Kahler-                      Einstein metric.  Moreover in complex dimension three, varieties                with such a metric have recently been of interest to physicists                 studying supersymmetric string theories.  In this investigation                 the principal investigator will study several questions about                   algebraic varieties with Kodaira number zero, varieties with                    trivial canonical bundle and other related varieties.                                In this research the principal investigator will study the                 geometry of the objects one gets as the set of solutions of                     simultaneous polynomial equations.  These objects have formed the               core of geometric studies in mathematics for hundreds of years                  and remain a central focus today.  The applications of the                      studies of these objects becomes ever more widespread.  For                     example, today there are very important ramifications in physics.               Morrison takes a combinatorial approach to their study and makes                heavy use of the computer to determine their structure.  The                    results of this research will be very interesting to many people.",
