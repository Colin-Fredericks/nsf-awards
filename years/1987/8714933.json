The meeting is sponsored by COSTED, the Committee on Science           and Technology in Developing Countries, (UNESCO), a committee of the            International Council of Scientific Unions.  The past three workshops           were held in India in 1981, 1983, 1985.  The 1987 meeting is to                 address the following areas: materials and their characterization;              microelectronics, VLSI and ULSI devices; gallium arsenide devices;              infrared and radiation detectors and solar cells; and radiation                 effects on semiconductor devices.  Invited and contributed papers               will be presented, and proceedings will be prepared for publication             as was done with the previous workshops.  This project meets the                U.S.-India program criteria for support of U.S. participation in                meetings that enhance the exchange of information and improve the               potential for cooperative research between the two countries.                   Merit:  The area of this workshop is one of the most important for              industrial development, and is also one where advances are taking               place at a fast rate in the western world and also in India.  The               P.I. is eminently qualified to organize the U.S. delegation for                 maximum benefit to the participants and for enhancing the interaction           between the scientists of the two countries in this important field.            The Indian organizers are among that country's leading scientists.              Funding:  None other than this action.",
