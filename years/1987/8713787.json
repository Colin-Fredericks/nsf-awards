 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar-Terrestrial research is passing through a critical                point.  From the phase of exploration and study of the individual               components of the solar-terrestrial system, we are now entering                 the phase of understanding how these components are coupled to                  each other and how the sun-earth system works as a single whole.                Several recent studies and national and international program                   proposals have formulated broad objectives for STR during the                   next 10-15 years.  From these studies, the multidisciplinary                    nature of STR and the need for a global approach to the study of                the solar-terrestrial system emerge quite clearly.  So do the                   many potential benefits, intellectual, commercial and security,                 that science and society can expect from such an integrated                     study.  However, there is a need to distill from these broad                    objectives a modest, well-defined program that represents the S/T               contribution to the NSF's Global Geosciences Initiative.                                To this end, and in response to discussions with NSF, the               PI, Dr. Roederer, will lead an effort with the following tasks,-                        (I)  Examine the current status of scientific research in               S/T.                                                                                (II)  Identify new initiatives that are relevant to the                     National Solar Terrestrial Program (NSTP) and international S/T                 programs.                                                                          (III)  Formulate a plan which maximizes the scientific return                within modest budgetary requirements.                                               (IV)  Submit the plan \"Solar Terrestrial Research in Global                 Geosciences\" to NSF by November 1987.                                                   A steering meeting exists which will meet in Baltimore in               May 1987.  A workshop will be held in August 1987 and a final                   executive planning session in September 1987.  The end result                   will be a well defined set of major projects emphasizing ground-                based theoretical and numerical studies of interaction processes                governing the transfer of energy, momentum and mass in the solar                wind/magnetosphere/ionosphere/atmosphere system.  This set of                   projects will be proposed as the STR component of the NSF Global                Geosciences Program and would represent NSF's contribution to the               NSTP and SCOSTEP's Solar-Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP).",
