 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives and Relevance to Program Objedtives:  This recommended award         would allow Dr. T. Darrah Thomas, Oregon State University, and his              research associate, Dr. Michele Siggel, to collaborate with Dr. Leif J.         Saethre, University of Tromso, Norway.  They will study chemical                processes that depend on the ability of a molecule to accept charge.            Two factors affect this ability:  (1) the charge distribution in the            neutral molecule, which establishes a potential at the site of interest         that is more or less favorable to accepting charge, and (2) the ability         of the valence electrons to rearrange after the charge is added, and            thus create a more favorable environment for the added charge.  The             proposed research will try to determine the relative importance of these        two factors in a variety of chemically interesting systems.  The                research will use combined measurements of core ionization energies,            Auger kinetic energies, and gas-phase acidities together with                   theoretical calculations.  Dr. Thomas has developed one of the                  outstanding electron spectroscopy laboratories in the world.                    Dr. Saethre has worked with Dr. Thomas' group in the past and this              project is a continuation of their productive research history.  The            Norwegian research group is strong, especially for the required                 theoretical work of the project, and it has good research and computing         facilities.  The expected results of the research could increase the            understanding of fundamental chemical properties.  The project thus             contributes to an important objective of NSF's cooperative science              programs with Western Europe, which is to stimulate scientific progress         by bringing together scientists from the U.S. and Europe who have               similar research interests and who wish to engage in mutually beneficial        research cooperation.  Funds from this award would support necessary            transportation and subsistence expenses for the U.S. principal                  investigator and members of his research group, as well as communication        and shipping costs.  Return visits by Dr. Saethre are anticipated.                                                                                              Merit of Proposal:  The cooperating U.S. and foreign investigators are          respected for their previous research accomplishments, and there is a           very good prospect that this proposed research will lead to a                   significant contribution to scientific knowledge.  The U.S. principal           investigator is a respected, productive scientist.  His foreign                 colleague  is also carrying out important studies in this field.  The           work plan is sound and the budget is reasonable.  Both research groups          will contribute to the project and will benefit significantly from the          cooperation.  The government of Norway, through the Norwegian Council           for Industrial and Scientific Research and the Norwegian Marshall Plan,         is also providing support for the project.                                                                                                                      Funding:  This award will not duplicate other funding.  The principal           investigator receives project support from NSF's Division of Chemistry,         Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Grant Nos. CHE-8613418 and             CHE-8313251.  This recommended INT award would fund the addition of an          important international dimension to the first of these research                projects.",
