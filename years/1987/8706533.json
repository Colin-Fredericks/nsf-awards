 "awd_abstract_narration": "Context is crucial in archaeological studies.  The proposed             project will look at the geological context of archaeological                   sites on the Green River in Wyoming and see how the landscape                   influenced the way people used stone tools.  Specifically, the                  researcher will look at untested archaeological assumptions about               tool use: that people chose specific raw materials for certain                  tasks, that people selected raw materials by shape, size, and                   type of stone depending on the tasks, and that the availability                 of raw materials in an area influenced the way people planned                   for, made, and used tools.                                                              This is a low.cost but highly creative and potentially                  useful study that seeks a revised way to deal with long.standing                archaeological questions.  Its emphasis on detailed examination                 of the distribution of raw materials in a well.defined area is                  important; the project promises to address issues that have been                neglected.  There should be cost effective methodological and                   technical advances resulting in an increase in precision in                     documenting the distribution of raw materials as a result of this               project.                                                                                This study has the potential to provide useful information              and models not only on the specific sites and area under                        consideration, but also for other prehistoric hunter and gatherer               groups around the world.  Archaeologists will learn a great deal                about the physical landscape and how people used it.  It should                 also help anthropologists more precisely infer patterns of                      mobility and technological planning and decision.making processes               by prehistoric peoples.",
