 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reactors with complex chemistry, especially those involving                     heterogeneous catalysis, are important commercially.  Such                      complex systems can behave in unexpected ways, causing multiple                 steady states, instabilities, runaway reactions, explosions, etc.               The goal of this research is the creation of theory that provides               practicing engineers and chemists with readily applicable                       analytical tools to be used for:  (1) the operation of reactors                 with complex but well understood chemistry (the theory would                    provide an indication of the stability problems that should be a                source of concern) and (2) the study of reactors with poorly                    understood chemistry (the theory would provide means for the                    sensitive discrimination between rival mechanisms put forward to                account for laboratory observations).                                                                                                                           Multiple steady states, periodic composition oscillations and                   sustained aperiodic oscillations have been studied for many                     systems.  The PI's major contributions have been in the analysis                of isothermal reactors (commonly used in industry) where the                    source of the unstable behavior is to be found in the chemistry                 itself.  Isothermal reactors are governed by systems of coupled                 nonlinear differential equations where the variables are the                    species concentrations and the parameters are the rate constants,               residence times and feed concentrations.  These differential                    equations have a special structure which the PI has exploited to                predict the type of behavior to be expected for some systems.  In               this renewal work he plans to expand the theory to wider classes                of problems.  At the same time he will begin experimental testing               of the theory on the hydrogenation of ethylene on platinum in                   cooperation with an experimentalist whose laboratory is fully                   equipped for this effort.  Also, the PI is planning to develop                  commercial software to be used on IBM PC's to implement his                     theory.",
