Structure-function studies will be performed using mutant                       repressors.  These studies should elucidate the structural                      requirements of the tryptophan binding site, the process of                     dimer formation and the properties of heterodimers, the role                    of the amino terminal arm, and the relationship between the                     amino acid sequence of helix E, the DNA-recognition sequence                    of the repressor, and recognized base pairs in the three                        operators.  In addition, second site reversion studies will                     be carried out with various mutant classes to analyze                           compensating interactions within the repressor and                              functional alterations in different regions of the repressor.                   Physiological studies will be continued in an effort to                         better understand how trp gene regulation occurs in growing                     cells.  Studies on the evolution of tryptophan synthetase                       will continue and will focus on the gene rearrangement and                      gene fusion that occurred in the evolution of the single                        tryptophan synthetase polypeptide of yeast and Neurospora                       from the separate polypeptides of bacteria.",
