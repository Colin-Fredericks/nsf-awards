 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lactobacillus plantarum produces a manganese-containing                         enzyme with catalase activity, which has been called                            pseudocatalase to distinguish it from the heme enzyme                           catalase.  Pseudocatalase is an oligomer of subunits each of                    which contains two manganese atoms which have been shown by                     ESR measurements to participate in a binuclear cluster.                         Catalytic activity is inhibited by hydroxylamine and by                         fluoride in the presence of substrate, hydrogen peroxide.                       These features suggest that this enzyme is a close relative                     and a soluble homologue of the binuclear manganese enzyme in                    the oxygen evolving center of green plant photosynthesis.                                                                                                       Dr. Carter has crystallized this enzyme in the presence and                     absence of a combination of substrate and fluoride that leads                   to inactivation of the enzyme and attendant bleaching of the                    prosthetic group.  The crystals diffract to high                                resolution and he has collected three-dimensional native                        crystal intensity data to 4.5A resolution.  He now plans to                     solve the crystal structures and to analyze them for clues to                   their reaction mechanism and their relationship to the oxygen                   evolving center.",
