 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rice geophysics program has acquired a unique set of deep                   crustal marine seismic reflection and onshore-offshore seismic                  reflection-refraction data in the area of the Santa Maria basin                 along the continental margin of central California.  The data will              provide information on the deep crustal structure of the Salinian               and Sur-Obispo terranes, and the shallow to deep crustal structure of           the strike-slip terranes between the coast and the abyssal plain.               The data should provide both a reflection image and a velocity-depth            profile in the area at the coast allowing us to tie the reflection              data taken offshore to that already available onshore.  We propose a            one year study of the two data sets to determine the strructure of              the strike-slip terranes adjacent to and within the continental                 margin.  The study includes standard and specialized seismic                    reflection processing and interpretation of 165 km of marine seismic            reflection data, and processing and interpretation of the 120 km                reflection-refraction seismic profile.  The goals of the research               are: 1) to understand the Neogene tectonics of the margin as                    expressed in the sedimentary structures in the Santa Maria Basin and            particularly, 2) to determine if major thrusting has and is occurring           in the offshore terranes, 3) to determine the lower crustal structure           in the oceanic-continental transition zone of an active transform               margin, 4) to determine the depth to and structure of the Moho in               the oceanic-continental transition zone of an active transform                  margin, and 5) to form an image of the Moho and a laterally limited,            deep crustal low-velocity zone believed to lie beneath the                      continental margin.",
