 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to a Project Solicitation, Colorado State University                submitted a proposal to conduct a Supercomputer Summer Institute in             1987.  This proposal and eight others were reviewed by five reviewers           at a panel meeting.                                                                                                                                             CSU proposes a two week Institute for 25 students.  Instructors will            come primarily from the community of researchers at CSU who have been           using the Cyber 205 supercomputer on campus for several years.  In              addition to covering the \"nuts and bolts\" of effective supercomputer            usage, there will be two special emphasis sessions; half of the class           will attend each session, which will be conducted in parallel.  One             session will cover numerical methods, while the other will emphasize            modelling in the biological and quantum physics areas.                                                                                                          Of the three proposals which offered training on a Cyber 205                    supercomputer, the panel felt the CSU proposal was the strongest.               This Institute offered adequate honds-on experience with a good                 balance of intellecual material.  A variety of advanced computing               architectures will be covered.  The panelists were impressed with               CSU's plans in the networking area, including access to other                   supercomputers over the NSFNET.                                                                                                                                 Negotiation has reduced the budget to $63,000, a very reasonable                price.  In addition, CSU has proposed to include some undergraduates            in the Institute under the Research Experience for Undergraduates               program, at a cost of $7000.  CSU will contribute Cyber 205 resources           valued at $50,0000.                                                                                                                                             This is a strong proposal which can be expected to result in a                  valuable educational experience for the attendees.  An award in the             amount of $70,000 is recommended.",
