 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative: Many of the useful products formed by microorganisms are             known as secondary metabolites since they are not required for the              growth or primary metabolism of the microbes.  Antibiotics such as              penicillin and cephalosporin C are examples of secondary metabolites            currently produced on a large scale.  Products from genetically                 altered organisms also resemble, for the most part, secondary                   metabolites.                                                                                                                                                    Current production methods involve making the product in individual             batches.  It would be more efficient to do this in a continuous                 manner if good processing and separation steps could be developed.              The use of immobilized microorganisms (i.e., attaching the organisms            to solid supports) presents an attractive approach to continuous                processing, and that is the focus of the proposed research.  This               research will investigate the regulation of secondary metabolite                production by immobilized cells through controlling the nutrient                levels.  Also, it is intended to study the effect of immobilization             on the stability of genetically altered microorganisms, as well as              the effect on altering the metabolism of attached cells.  The                   results of the research should be extremely useful in developing new            continuous production processes for secondary metabolites.",
