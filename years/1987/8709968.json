 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radio Science is a cross disciplinary endeavour, encompassing                   basic and applied research in many diverse areas, such as                       radioastronomy, atmospheric research and telecommunications.  Much of           this research is international in character, due largely to the fact            that radio waves do not stop at national boundaries and propagate over          extremely long distances.  The international character of radio science         led to the foundation of the International Union of Radio Science               (commonly designated as URSI) in 1919.                                                                                                                          The aims of URSI are:  1) to promote the scientific study of radio              communications; 2) to aid and organize radio research on an                     international scale and to encourage discussion and publication of the          results; 3) to facilitate the standardization of measurements and               measuring instruments; and 4) to stimulate and coordinate the study of          the scientific aspects of telecommunications.  URSI accomplishes many           of its objectives through a triennial General Assembly.  Proceedings of         this meeting are widely and openly distributed and reach a broad                audience.                                                                                                                                                       Adequate U.S. participation in the General Assembly is clearly                  desirable.  Consequently, I recommend that the National Science                 Foundation award a Travel Grant to the National Academy of Sciences to          ensure the participation of qualified U.S. researchers at the XXIInd            General Assembly to be held in Tel Aviv, Israel, August 24-September 2,         1987.",
