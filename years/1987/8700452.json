 "awd_abstract_narration": "Major new developments in XUV and x-ray optics, with                            applications in a wide variety of scientific fields ranging from                x-ray astronomy to laboratory plasma diagnostics and synchrotron                radiation instrumentation are due to the improvement in                         techniques for producing stable multilayers of sufficient                       quality.                                                                                                                                                        The specific goal is to understand the basic physics of the                     instrumentation being built.  The construction of multilayer                    normal incidence optics depends on a proper understanding of the                x-ray optical properties of materials on very small spatial                     scales.  This problem is one of the central issues demonstrated                 by the large differences between actual and theoretical                         performance.                                                                                                                                                    Three distinct issues will be addressed:  (i)  continued                        development of techniques for the fabrication of multilayer                     coatings, with the specific aim of optimizing the procedures and                materials for the production of high quality normal-incidence                   optics at soft x-ray and XUV wavelengths.   (ii)  measurement                   and evaluation of multilayer coating performance, with emphasis                 on achieving near-theoretical results on figured substrates; this               includes determination of material combinations and substrate                   fabrication procedures which provide optimum performance; and                   (iii)  development of techniques for producing extremely fine                   grain x-ray phosphor converting screens, as part of a program to                produce a large area, high resolution soft x-ray detector for                   measuring multilayer mirror performance.  Such detectors are                    required because of the ability of normal incidence optics to                   image large fields of view with high spatial resolution.",
