 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Alan Goodman is the leading practitioner in the               USA of research regarding the properties of nuclei at high                      excitation energy.  He has been and is at the forefront of the                  use of the finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov cranking                  theory in nuclear physics.  He proposes to use this theory to                   calculate the properties of rare- earth and actinide nuclei as                  functions of the temperature or excitation energy of the nucleus.               Statistical fluctuations of the shape around the equilibrium                    deformation will also be calculated, and phase transitions                      induced by heating and rotation will be studied.                                        Professor Goodman is at the forefront of research regarding             the properties of nuclei which are simultaneously rotating and                  being heated.  He is a pioneer theorist in this area and is                     virtually the only U.S. researcher engaged in questions of                      nuclear structure at high excitation energies.  Goodman's                       research will provide information about the role of fluctuations                around the equilibrium deformation in nuclei and about phase                    transitions induced by heating and rotation.  This is important                 work, since nuclear behavior at finite temperatures will be an                  area of great interest in nuclear physics in the coming years.",
