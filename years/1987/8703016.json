 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silica, a porous solid material made by purifying and melting                   sand, is used widely as a solid support for industrial catalysts.               Such catalysts often consist of metal atoms or metal-containing                 molecules partially buried in the silicon-oxygen framework at the               silica surface.  In work preliminary to that proposed here                      molecules based on the silicon-oxygen framework, but soluble in                 organic solvents, were synthesized.  Metal adducts of these                     molecules are expected to be excellent models of the silica-based               catalysts, with the advantage that they can be studied by a                     variety of techniques to which surface catalysts are not                        amenable.  The studies should lead to a more profound                           understanding of silica-based catalysts and provide information                 needed for the rational design of better catalysts.                                                                                                             The aim of our research is to develop a new class of transition-                metal-containing siloxane macromolecules, called polyhedral                     oligometallasilsequioxanes(POMSS), that can be used to model                    reaction processes that occur on silica-supported metal-oxide                   catalysts.  The proposed research is focussed on three major                    areas:                                                                                  1)  Synthesis and Reactivity Studies of Ti and Zr-                      Containing POMSS:  By examining the reactivity of Ti and Zr-                    containing POMSS with substrates such as carbon monoxide,                       hydrogen, oxygen, ethylene, acetylene, etc., it is proposed to                  \"finger-print\" the inherent chemical reactivity of these                        interesting new complexes.                                                              2)  Reactivity Studies of V-Containing POMSS:  V-containing             POMSS will be used to gain access to reactive intermediates that                are believed to be involved in VO(OR)3-catalyzed oxidations of                  hydrocarbons by alkyl hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide.                          3)  Synthesis of POMSS Containing Group VII and VIII                       Transition-Metals:  Several synthetic approaches to POMSS                       containing late transition-metals will be used in efforts to                    develop the trisilanol ligand into a general ligand that can be                 used as a silica model with virtually any transition-metal.",
