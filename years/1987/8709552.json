 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the earth's climate                          variability in an interactive ocean-atmosphere system as modeled                by a low-horizontal-resolution general circulation model that                   includes a mixed-layer ocean component.  The focus will be on the               inter- and intra-annual variability aspects of the annual cycle.                 Very long model simulations (in the range of 50 to 100 years)                  will provide substantive statistical representations of the                     relevant variability events.  Analyses will focus on assessing                  (1) SST variability characteristics, (2) the relationship between               atmospheric circulation anomalies and SST anomalies and (3) the                 role of ocean-atmosphere energy exchange in forcing variability.                Additional simulations which include cases with prescribed sea                  surface temperature or atmospheric conditions will help in                      determining cause/effect relationships between SST and                          atmospheric variability.                                                              On time scales beyond a few weeks, the oceans strongly                    influence the earth's climate.  A productive approach to studying               the processes leading to that influence and the feedback to the                 oceans by the atmosphere is interactive models.  It is expected                 that the study will (1) provide understanding of the role of                    thermodynamical ocean-atmosphere interactions in producing                      tropical and extratropical variability of climate, (2) help in                  the assessment and interpretation of more complex systems which                 incorporate internal ocean processes and dynamic ocean-atmosphere               interactions, and (3) provide insight into fundamental aspects of               climate variability such as predictability and cause/effect                     relationships between the ocean and the atmosphere.  This                       research is relevant to the World Climate Research Program's                    Tropical Oceans-Global Atmosphere Program (TOGA).",
