 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enable the formation of a committee of physicists who         will lead a thorough reexamination of the undergraduate introductory            physics course.  Over a period of two years the committee will consider         issues relating to the introductory course and hold meetings, often in          conjunction with major meetings of the American Association of Physics          Teachers and the American Physical Society, in order to encourage               discussion of the issues in the physics community.  It will sponsor two         conferences of physicists which will develop a variety of ways to design        introductory courses to reflect the needs of students of physics and to         reflect the current way physics is done.  Through meetings and reports          the committee will establish a consensus in the community about what            kinds of approaches are valuable, and it will encourage the development         and wide distribution of courses based on these approaches.",
