 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fifty outstanding high school chemistry teachers from Idaho, Montana,           Oregon, and  Washington, will participate in a four week intensive              summer program and two follow-up sessions during the academic year.  The        instruction will focus on how to employ safe demonstrations  and the            utilization of computers in effective instruction.  These teachers will         provide in-service and leadership activities for other chemistry                teachers in their state.  The State Science Supervisor in each state            will provide support services and communications for the in-service             activities that will be conducted by the participants from their state.                                                                                         The instruction will emphasize \"descriptive \" chemistry and how                 demonstrations can be used effectively to reduce abstractions to some           degree and provide concrete observations through demonstrations.  A             concerted effort will be made to modify some standard demonstrations so         that they can be done with less expensive equipment and inexpensive             materials.  Managerial and CAI uses of the computer will be emphasized.         Software programs will be made available for teachers to evaluate.              Science, Technology, and Society topics will be stressed with a focus on        how they can be translated into the daily instructional program.                                                                                                Participants will develop materials to be used and distributed to other         teachers who participate in the in-service workshops that they present.         School district administrations will support the workshops presented by         teachers.                                                                                                                                                       The PI has been very instrumental in providing instruction for                  precollege teachers.  He and the staff are deeply committed to improving        instruction in secondary chemistry teaching.",
