 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last thirty years have witnessed dramatic changes in public                 sector labor markets.  Since the 1950's, the local public sector                has grown rapidly in size and become increasingly unionized.                    This transformation has prompted considerable research on local                 public labor markets emphasizing the impact that unions have had                on employment, wages, and productivity in the public sector.  A                 shortcoming of many of these studies is their failure to                        adequately recognize that public sector compensation is set                     within a broader context of a local budgetary process.  As a                    result, the full influence of local economic conditions, the                    fiscal environment in particular, on public wages has not been                  captured.  Potentially important city-specific traits helping                   influence the level and pattern of local public wages have been                 omitted from previous wage/earnings specifications.  The                        contribution of this project comes from reestimating local                      public wage equations on a variety of data and from testing for                 the importance of the neglected local fiscal variables.  These                  variables include proxies for the community's \"ability to pay\"                  wage premia to public workers and measures of the \"bargaining                   power\" of the local workers, i.e., their ability to appropriate                 local rents.  In addition, the project investigates the degree to               which measured local public wage differentials are reflected in                 lower land prices in the communities.",
