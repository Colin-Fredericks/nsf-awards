 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanisms involved in mitotic movements are central to                our knowledge of cell biology yet remain poorly understood.                     Understanding the regulation of these mechanisms is crucial to                  development of an integrated model of cell division and cellular                motility in general.  Recently a model system has been developed                where anaphase B (spindle elongation) can be studied in vitro                   using isolated, functional spindles from a diatom.  Using this                  system it was found that spindle elongation in vitro requires a                 highly phosphorylated environment.  Several phosphorylated                      proteins associated with the microtubule overlap zone were also                 identified.  Protein phosphorylation thus may play a key role in                the regulation of mitosis.  The identification and                              characterization of the protein kinase(s) involved is                           proposed.  An in vitro quantitative assay will be developed                     whereby phosphorylation levels of overlap zone proteins can be                  evaluated.  Phosphorylated overlap zone proteins may be integral                to spindle motor function.  Also proposed is an                                 immuno-analysis of these proteins.  A monoclonal antibody                       library will be raised against phosphorylated overlap zone                      proteins.  Any antibodies found to inhibit anaphase B will be                   used to purify the antigen for in vitro characterization.                       Antibodies also will be tried on higher plant cells to see if                   these proteins are common to the higher plant mitotic                           machinery as well.                                                                   Mitosis is central to genetic inheritance in eukaryotic                    cells.  Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved with the                 ordered movement of chomosomes is essential to any                              understanding of the mechanics of cell division as well as the                  transmission of genetic information.  The results of this                       study should greatly enhance the minimal understanding we now                   have.",
