 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, a renewal of Potter's current NSF-supported                      research project, will study the very rapid processes involved in               reading, comprehending, and remembering words, sentences, and                   pictures.  The main focus of the work is on levels or stages of                 processing:  What are the levels of processing, what is their                   time course, and how do they interact?                                                                                                                          I.  In reading, is the first stage of word recognition (a)                      responsive only to the visual word itself, as modular theories                  hold, or (b) is it influenced by the previous sentence context,                 as \"interactive\" theories propose?  The nonword illusion and                    letter migration are two phenomena that reflect early stages of                 word recognition; if they show an effect of sentence context,                   that will support (b).  An extension to \"nonobject\" perception is               planned.                                                                                                                                                        II.  As a sentence is read, several levels of representation are                presumably computed:  a syntactic structure, the literal meaning                of the word combination, and a broader interpretation of the                    meaning in the context of the text.  These levels of sentence                   processing will be tracked as they evolve over time, by varying                 the rate of reading and by probing recognition of a word in the                 sentence at several intervals after presentation.                                                                                                               III.  Immediately after reading a sentence, \"verbatim\" recall is                possible, even for long sentences that exceed the normal memory                 span of seven or so unrelated words.  This shows that one's                     memory for a sentence is efficiently structured.  The research                  will test the hypothesis that the structure is primarily meaning-               based; recall, like spontaneous sentence production, starts from                a set of ideas the speaker intends to express, and it relies on                 the verb to produce the appropriate sentence structure.  The                    words used to express the ideas of the original sentence are                    selected from recently-activated words, resulting in high                       accuracy of recall under normal circumstances.                                                                                                                  Together, these studies will give a picture of several levels of                processing during the reading, understanding, and recall of                     sentences, and will draw parallels to picture processing in                     certain cases.  The research will increase understanding of the                 reading process and may help in the design of improved methods of               reading instruction.",
