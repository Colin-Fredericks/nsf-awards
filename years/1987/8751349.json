 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will bring twenty-five high school physics and computer            science teachers from the state of Wisconsin to the University of               Wisconsin-Superior during the Summer of 1988 to participate in a                two-week workshop on electronics to better prepare them to teach high           school physics and computer science.  Teachers selected for the program         will learn concepts in basic and advanced electronics including                 electronics as it applies to the microprocessor.  A significant portion         of the workshop will be devoted to the development of strategies and            materials for use by the teachers in their classrooms, In addition,             participants will be able to choose self-paced modules in specialized           areas of electronics in which they way want to develop a better                 understanding.  The teachers will be expected to develop an electronics         project to assist their teaching.  This project will be utilized in             their classroom during the following school year and the results of its         effectiveness will be determined.  A teacher's guide of classroom               strategies will be developed by the participants in a follow-up seminar         to be held in the winter of 1988-1989.  This guide will be available to         19 CESA agencies in the state of Wisconsin and will be distributed to           the Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers.  Copies will be sent to the          Department of Public Instruction in each state office.",
