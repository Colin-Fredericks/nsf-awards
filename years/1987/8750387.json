 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the equipment (centrifuges, incubation equipment, specialized              storage apparatus, a DNA photodocumentation system, water purification          equipment and electrophoresis apparatus) secured through this project,          this Biology Department is expanding its course offerings in Molecular          Biology to include a core of four courses to deal biotechnology at              various levels.  Two of these provide intensive experience with                 practical genetic manipulation procedures in a student genetic                  engineering laboratory.                                                                                                                                         Recent advances in the technology of gene manipulation have created a           booming new industry, an extraordinarily powerful research tool, and            promises for novel solutions to medical, environmental, and                     agricultural/industrial problems.  A broad spectrum of undergraduates           have a need for education in the new molecular biology.  Those who plan         to continue in research-oriented higher degree programs will profit             greatly from having practical knowledge and laboratory skills that will         equip them to apply modern molecular genetic approaches to research             problems.  Students terminating their formal education at the B.S.-level        can be immediately employable in the biotechnology industry or in one of        the many research laboratories employing techniques of gene                     manipulation.  Pre-professional students can be prepared better to              understand and appreciate diagnostic and therapeutic techniques stemming        from the new biotechnology and to appreciate its potential for the              future practice of medicine.",
