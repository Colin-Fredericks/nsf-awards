 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attitudes are mental and neural states of readiness to respond to               objects and events in the social world.  The traditional areas of               research in attitude theory have included attitude management,                  attitude development, attitude structure and function, attitude                 change (persuasion), and the relationship beetween attitudes and                behavior.  Contemporary attitude research relies heavily on the                 use of verbally or semantically-based measurement techniques (the               self-rating scale).                                                                                                                                             This researcher is investigating aspects of attitude that do not                make contact with the verbal knowledge system.  The initial                     phases of this research will focus on assessments of attitude                   that do not require verbal reports.  Special emphasis will be                   placed on the measurement of affective or emotional components of               attitude, using techniques such as Ekman's Facial Action Coding                 System, and the analysis of voice quality as an indicator of                    vocal affect expression.                                                                                                                                        As part of this research, the Principal Investigator is studying                rational versus emotional control of blood donor behavior (with                 partial support from the American Red Cross).  Although people                  often provide rational explanations for their failure to donate                 blood, nondonation behavior is best predicted by emotional                      components of attitude.  The products of this research will                     simultaneously aid the Red Cross in their recruitment of blood                  donors, and contribute to an  important area of social                          psychological inquiry.",
