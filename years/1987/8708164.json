 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hydrofracturing method of in situ stress measurement                has evolved in the last fifteen eyars into an indispensable tool                in geophysical research.  For example, a major objective of the                 first deep scientific drilling in the U.S. at Cajon Pass,                       California, is to measure the state of stress, primarily by                     hydrofracturing, in the vicinity of the San Andreas fault.                      Depsite the general reliability of hydrofracturing, uncertainties               in its interpretation still exist and cases where the method is                 only partially successful or totally unsuccessful are now                       surfacing.  There are at least three major sources of diffi-                    culties in hydrofracturing data interpretaion: (1) reading the                  correct pessures from field records, (2) using the correct model                for calculating the in situ stresses and (3) evaluating the                     effect of preexisting fractures on hydrofrac pressures and                      directions.  The research is an attempt to resolve some of these                difficulties through laboratory testing and data analysis.  In                  addition, experimental verification of suggested innovative                     improvements of the method will be carried out.  Such confir-                   mation of one or more of these alternate techniques would enable                their use in either complementing orreplacing conventional                      hydrofracturing.",
