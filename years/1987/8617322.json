 "awd_abstract_narration": "Travel support of up to a total of $10,000 is provided for                      approximately 11 U.S. participants in the 7th International                     Meeting on Small-Angle Scattering, to be held July 13-16, 1987 in               Prague, Czechoslovakia.  Topics of the conference are the theory,               instrumentation and application of small angle x-ray (SAXS) and                 neutron (SANS) scattering.  Applications of both these techniques               are found in materials science (ceramics, metals, alloys, etc.)                 polymer science (mixtures, blends, solutions, etc.), molecular                  biology (membrane structure, proteins in solutions, nucleic                     acids, etc.), catalysis and chemical applications (structure,                   porosity, size distributions, surface areas, etc.), critical                    phenomena and condensed matter physics.  Participation by U.S.                  scientists is essential if the U.S. is to match the pace set in                 the last decade by the European scientists in both SANS and SAXS.               Currently in the U.S. there are six SANS facilities at both                     reactor and pulsed neutron sources.  Several high flux                          synchrotron source facilities are now available for SAXS.  It is                intended to support only those participants who will present                    papers and/or fullfill a significant technical function at the                  conference.  Applications will be screened rigorously for                       scientific merit by a procedure outlined in the proposal.  A                    final report will be provided identifying the U.S. scientists                   that were supported and describing the scientific highlights of                 the meeting.  Each person receiving support will also provide a                 one-page summary of their experiences.                                                                                                                          This is a jointly funded grant for Thermodynamics and Transport                 Phenomena and Polymers Programs.",
