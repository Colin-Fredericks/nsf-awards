 "awd_abstract_narration": "This meeting will bring together workers in the areas of DNA                    replication and mutagenesis for a combined meeting focusing on                  the events of DNA replication which effect mutagenic events.                    The area of DNA replication is rapidly advancing with                           increasing definition of the proteins required for initiation                   and elongation.  At the same time, studies in mutagenesis are                   becoming defined at the molecular level with accumulation of a                  large mass of data with regard to the spectra of mutagenesis                    and the contributions of the host cell to mutagenesis.  Recent                  evidence from several laboratories implicates specific                          replication events in mutagenesis and recently developed                        techniques allow the analysis of large numbers of transfecting                  or chromosomal mutations.  It is the intent of this meeting to                  open new contacts between investigators.  This meeting is not                   part of a continuing series, but has been designed to satisfy a                 defined need.  We anticipate that the meeting will be attended                  by 200-250 outstanding individuals from around the world.                       Poster sessions will provide an opportunity for all                             investigators to present recent work in great detail.                           Discussion leaders and speakers will be drawn from outstanding                  members of the research community, but a distinct effort will                   be made to include junior investigators and those with recent                   striking findings in the formal presentations.  Session                         chairman will be such outstanding scientists as Arthur Kornberg                 (Stanford), Charles Richardson (Harvard Med. School), Thomas                    Lindahl (ICRF, London), Paul Modrich (Duke U. Med. School),                     Harrison Echols (Berkeley), Jeffrey Miller (UCLA), and Peter                    Herrlich (Karlsruhe).  The sessions will cover: the basic                       enzymology of DNA replication, including the components of the                  replicative apparatus; DNA replication systems, including both                  prokaryotic and eukaryotic studies; mechanisms of                               misincorporation, including errors by the synthesis apparatus                   as well as adduct formation; the genetic control of                             mutagenesis, with particular attention to mismatch repair; DNA                  polymerase functions in mutagenesis; damage-directed                            mutagenesis, with attention to the spectrum seen in                             transfecting and chromosomal genes; and induced mutagenesis,                    with updating on eukaryotic systems.  The impact of this                        meeting should have long term affects on the research in the                    areas of DNA replication and damage, DNA repair, mutagenesis                    and cellular regulation of gene expression.",
