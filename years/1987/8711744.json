 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide sufficiently  delicate infinite                  dimensional analogues of Clarke and Rockafellar non-                            differentiable calculus to allow its application in infinite                    dimensional optimization and geometry of normed spaces.  The                    novelty of this approach lies in attempting to provide the                      subgradient formulas and normal cone formulas involving exact                   subdifferentials and exact normals.  Previous work by Treiman,                  and by the Russian school around Ioffe, Kruger and others has                   always used much less satisfactory approximate subderivatives.                  Up to date, the investigator has investigated the case of                       reflexive spaces obtaining, in cooperation with Borwein, an exact               basis of his now standard theory. She now proposes a general                    research program of building a comprehensive calculus of exact                  subdifferentials in Banach spaces with smooth norms.                                 This research is part of nonlinear analysis with potential                 applications to optimization and control theory.",
