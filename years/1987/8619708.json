 "awd_abstract_narration": "The detailed analysis of airglow and auroral optical                    emission measurements requires sophisticated computer models of                 electron impact energy loss/excitation processes, photochemistry,               and radiative transfer of optically thick EUV resonance lines in                the atmosphere.  Due to the complexity of the modeling effort,                  only one group (R.R. Meier and colleagues at NRL) has previously                been engaged in comprehensive modeling of the UV spectrum of the                dayglow and aurora.  In addition to collaborating with Dr. Meier                in the analysis of U.C. Berkeley SRP78-1 EUV data, we are now                   conducting or own theoretical investigations and analyses of both               EUV and visible region airglow and aurora.                                              The quantitative investigation of airglow and auroral                   excitation and emission processes plays a significant role in the               elucidation of the photochemistry and energetics of the coupled                 magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere system.  The daytime                        ionosphere is formed and maintained through the absorption of                   solar EUV radiation at wavelengths below 1025 \u001a.  In the auroral                zones, where geomagnetic storms may have a profound influence on                neutral atmospheric and ionospheric structure, much of the energy               deposited in the atmosphere by precipitating energetic electrons                is released in the form of optical emissions.  Thus, the                        spectroscopy of atmospheric emissions serves as an important                    diagnostic tool in understanding and monitoring the global                      terrestrial environment.",
