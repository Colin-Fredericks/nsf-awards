The                purpose is to bring together mathematicians, mathematics                        educators, representatives of community-based organizations and                 experts on early adolescent development to discuss the problems                 and possibilities of impacting the mathematics learning of middle               school students, particularly minority, women, and disabled                     students.  The findings of this meeting will be published as a                  AAAS occasional report and will be distributed to mathematics-                  based organizations, researchers, educators, community-based                    organizations, policy makers, and business leaders.  NSF's                      support will be acknowledged in this publication.",
