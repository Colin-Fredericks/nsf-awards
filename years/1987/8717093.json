 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator proposes to research a new concept              which he calls Design for Analysis.  Design for Analysis asserts                that the design of a product or system should include the constraint            that the design will need to be analyzed.  Therefore, if the design             can be analyzed using simpler and better-understood models, the                 design concept can be modeled and analyzed faster, allowing more                time for considering design alternatives and performing sensitivity             analyses.  The basic tenet is that the increased time for                       exploration will result in greater payoffs than time spent in                   modeling and analyzing a more analytically complex design.  Other               possible benefits of Design for Analysis might include: simplicity,             robustness, responsiveness, and simpler operations of designs.                       Two approaches could be pursued: (i) establish a number of                 instances where the concept of Design for Analysis leads to benefits            and also establish counter-examples; (ii) develop an understanding,             perhaps leading to a theory, of when and why this methodology works.            Initially, the principal investigator will pursue the first approach            in the two domains of manufacturing and computer systems.  If the               initial research is promising, the second approach will be followed.                 This award is made under the program for Expedited Awards for              Novel Research.",
