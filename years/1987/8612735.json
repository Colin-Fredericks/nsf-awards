 "awd_abstract_narration": "The construction of carbon-carbon bonds remains as a key challenge in           the construction of new organic molecules.  Implicit in this challenge          is the achievement of selectivity in forming the new bond.  This                research will investigate new reaction pathways for the selective               introduction of carbon-carbon bonds into acyclic systems.  The desired          selectivity will be sought in the selective formation of carbanions via         a heteroatom-assisted deprotonation.  New reaction types which will be          studied include:  (1)  the direct beta-lithiation of vinyl and dienyl           ethers; (2) the diastereoselective deprotonation of acyclic protons in          systems other than sulfoxides; (3)  the intramolecular addition of              unstabilized carbanions to ketones and aldehydes.  The products which           result from these reactions are often unique structures which will lend         themselves to numerous stereoselective transformations.  For example,           the first class of asymmetric dienes to exhibit complete pi-face                selectivity in the Diels-Alder reaction will be available through the           directed deprotonation of dienyl ethers.                                                                                                                        Whenever possible models will be proposed and tested in an effort to            delineate the exact effect that nearby heteroatoms have on the                  selectivity of deprotonation.  Based on this knowledge,                         heteroatom-assisted deprotonations can be rationally extended to new            systems rendering it an even more powerful method for selective bond            construction.",
