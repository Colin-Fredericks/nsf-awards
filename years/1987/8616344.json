 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sequestered Proton Domains in Chloroplast Energetics:                           Resuspending chloroplasts in sucrose or potassium chloride                      affects their subsequent response to single turnover flash                      excitation and to ATP formation.  This breakthrough observation                 will be used to determine how and when proton gradients formed as               a result of photosynthetic electron transport in chloropasts are                used to synthesize ATP and the factors effecting these reactions.                                                                                               Since the chemosmotic theory of ATP synthesis driven by a proton                gradient originally postulated by Dr. Peter Mitchell was                        generally accepted about 15 years ago there has been a                          controversy between those who claim that under in vivo conditions               localized proton domains are involved in the transduction and                   those who claim that only protons moving between bulk phases are                involved both in vivo and in vitro.  The results of this research               have the potential of settling the the controversy and defining                 the conditions under which each mechanism holds.  Most of the                   biological energy used by all organisms is based on this                        reaction.  It, therefore, becomes a keytstone of our bioenergetic               knowledge.",
