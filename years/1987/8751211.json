 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 3-year program is designed to provide 64 high school biology               teachers with the confidence, expertise needed to implement an                  experimental approach in their classroom teaching.  In conjunction with         school district personnel and university faculty, some of these teachers        will also help develop an In-Service Training Program for other high            school biology teachers which emphasizes use of a discovery/experimental        approach in the classroom.                                                                                                                                      During the first two years, each teacher (32/year) will develop a               research project in collaboration with a university faculty member of           the CA Poly Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology (ICMB).  The           independent research project will be done during four weeks of the              summer and the results presented at a symposium.  Teachers will also            participate in a week of intensive laboratory exercise workshops in             which they will gain hands-on experience with student exercises which           emphasize the discovery approach, quantification of results, and new            techniques for teaching cellular and molecular biology.  Teachers will          have the opportunity during the summer to expand their expertise in             computer-aided instruction and to acquire background and updated                information in various areas of cellular and molecular biology through          seminars and workshops, and the monthly ICMB Journal Clubs.  They will          also learn about and gain experience with modern techniques and                 instrumentation through their research projects, the lab exercise               workshops and an electron microscopy seminar.                                                                                                                   The help implement the scientific method in the high school classroom,          weekly group sessions during the summer and academic year workshops will        be organized to discuss various methods of incorporating this approach          in the classroom.  The teachers will maintain a teaching \"diary\" to help        them monitor their individual progress in achieving this objective.             University Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology faculty will            visit the classrooms of their high school faculty partners to encourage         them to make these changes.  During the third summer, six of the                participants, school district science education personnel (4-6) and the         ICMB Board will develop an In-Service Training Program designed to help         other teachers use an exploration/inquiry approach in their classrooms.         The project directors will visit school districts to promote the use of         the In-Service Training Program.",
