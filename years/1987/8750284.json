 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry, Geology, and Physics departments are establishing a new          X-ray laboratory.  Instruments in the laboratory (X-ray diffractometer          for powders and X-ray spectrometer) will be used to support several             courses offered in the undergraduate curriculum.  In addition, the              instruments are being utilized by both faculty and students for support         of the undergraduate research program at this institution.  The                 departments are committed to educating students through hands-on                experiments, utilizing a variety of instruments.  Rather than through a         single course in which the instruments are being used, an effort is             being made to integrate applications of X-ray methods throughout the            entire curriculum.  A Phillips PN1430 spectrometer coupled with the             Phillips PW1840 diffractometer offered the greatest cost advantage to           the university.  The system includes a matched computer system                  interfaced to the instruments.",
