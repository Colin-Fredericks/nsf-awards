 "awd_abstract_narration": "The reorganization of the NSF Chemistry Division has merged                     theStructural Chemistry and Thermodynamics Program and the                      ChemicalPhysics Program into a new Physical Chemistry Program.                  As aconsequence of the reorganization and the unique                            opportunitiesfor advances in the field, a workshop on physical                  chemistry willbe organized by Professors Jiri Jonas (Illinois)                  and Sandra C.Greer (Maryland).  This workshop will not only                     review the varioussubfields, but will review current investments                with the purposeof identifying areas of possible duplication or                 absence ofimportant work.                                                                                                                                       It is anticipated that the results of this workshop will                        impactplanning in FY88 as Professor Jonas is a member of the                    ChemistryAdvisory Committee and expects to make                                 preliminaryrecommendations at the fall meeting of the committee.                                                                                                The workshop organization will also benefit because Professor                   Greer was a rotator during the 1985.1986 academic year and thus                 understands the reorganization and has a good overview of the                   programs that have now been combined into Physical Chemistry.",
