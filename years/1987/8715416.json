The overall objective of the Japanese Technology Evaluation (JTECH)             study is to assess Japanese research and development in selected high-          technology areas and to compare the Japanese efforts with those in the          United States with respect to their potential impact on the long-term           economic competitiveness of the United States.  The assessments will be         carried out by panels of U.S. experts who will tour Japanese research           and manufacturing facilities as possible, review key Japanese technical         literature, and prepare draft reports of their findings.  These reports         will be reviewed by additional experts at a series of workshops.  So            far, seven fields of technology have been assessed in the first two             phases of the study.  This award is for administrative and logistical           support in connection with the third phase of the study, in which an            additional three technologies will be assessed.  Work performed under           this award will include assisting in the definition of topics for               assessment, recruitment of panel members, translation and provision of          appropriate Japanese technical literature to panel members, organizing          expert workshops, and editing panel reports.",
