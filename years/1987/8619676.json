This annual conference has established itself as a major forum                  for exchange of information among research groups from differing                disciplines, countries, and types of affiliation.  It can be                    especially valuable for younger investigators who lack an                       extensive personal network.  As a contact point between industry                and academia it is unmatched.                                                                                                                                   Dr. Gonzalez has assembled a promising program for the 1987                     session.                                                                                                                                                        I recommend that a conference grant for $5,000 be awarded to the                Gordon Research Conferences for the conference on Catalysis.",
