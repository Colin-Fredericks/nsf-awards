 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator intends to continue his research             on developing and analyzing models of  mechanoreceptors, and in                 particular, transduction in auditory hair cells.  This also                     involves the development, simulation and analysis of a systematic               model, as well as a micromechanical model describing the motion                 of sterocilia associated with individual hair cells.                                    In previous studies, the investigator has developed a model             of hair cell transduction based on experiments on the changes in                receptor potential in response to individual hair bundle displac-               ements. Parameter estimates were obtained from experimental                     observations on one animal species (frogs), but properties of the               model are believed to be valid for many other species.  In this                 project, several extensions of the model will be done.                                  Terms representing basal membrane currents will be added to             the equations.  The hair cell model will be coupled to a firing                 rate model to obtain the behavior of the postsynaptic afferent                  nerve due to simulation of the ciliary bundle.  Ultimately, this                model will be coupled with macromechanical and micromechanical                  models describing the motion of the basilar membrane and the hair               bundles.                                                                        The investigator also plans to initiate a study in dynamic                      networks of nerve cells.",
