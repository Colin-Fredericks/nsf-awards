 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cycle of water through the atmosphere greatly influences the                airborne distribution and concentration of a number of trace chemical           components.  This is especially true in cases where liquid water                (i.e. clouds and precipitation) is formed in the atmosphere.  The               dynamics of cloud formation can move trace species from one region of           the atmosphere to another.  Additionally, the importance of liquid              phase reactions which can change species from one chemical form to              another is only now being recognized and documented by atmospheric              chemical research scientists.  While the importance of cloud and                precipitation formation processes on atmospheric chemistry has been             suggested as the result of laboratory and modeling experiments, there           have been very few direct field measurements to verify and quantify             the significance of such processes.  The direct observation of these            effects is a difficult undertaking since specialized and extremely              sensitive measurement equipment and methods are required.                                                                                                       The objectives of this project are through the continuation of                  research initiated under NSF grant ATM-8305843 to: (1) measure the              extent of convective cloud and thunderstorm induced transport of                chemical species from the lower to upper troposphere; (2) measure the           influence of cloud light reflection and absorption on photochemical             processes; (3) measure the degree of entrainment of chemical                    compounds into clouds; and (4) test certain theories of                         photo-chemistry in the upper troposphere.  This research will be                carried out by equipping the National Center for Atmospheric Research           Saberliner aircraft with sophisticated chemical measurement                     instrumentation suitable for detecting selected species in cloud and            storm systems.  The chemical studies will be coordinated with                   meteorological studies of storm formation.  This project is expected            to provide important information regarding physical and chemical                processes which are of significance to the atmospheric sciences.",
