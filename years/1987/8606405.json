 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Lynda J. Goff, Associate             Professor of Biology, Crown College, University of California,                  Santa Cruz, to pursue with Dr. In Kyu Lee, Associate Professor of               Botany, Seoul National University, for a period of 24 months, a program         of research using the red algal model system Griffithsia to produce             heterokaryons to investigate two major problems.  The first                     investigation will examine the phenotypic effect of varying relative            nuclear numbers of two different genotypes in the products of                   heterokaryon fusion.  The second will determine if genetically                  different plastids can coexist in a common heterokaryon.                        Heterokaryosis is defined as the coexistence and coexpression of                genetically different nuclei in a common cytoplasm.  It occurs in               various fungal groups either upon the fusion of two genetically                 different nuclei and the subsequent migration of a nucleus from one             cell to another, or by the spontaneous mutation of one or more nuclei           within the cytoplasm of a multinucleate cell.                                                                                                                   This project is pioneering research which should have great                     significance to an understanding of the genetics of red algae.  At              present there is considerable interest in red algae because of their            economic potential as sources of complex carbohydrates such as agar,            agarose, and carrageenan.  In addition, the inter- and intraspecific            crosses of Griffithsia that will be undertaken should provide extremely         useful information on the speciation that has occurred within this              genus, throughout its Pacific geographic range.  Both collaborators are         highly respected scientists who have extensive research experience and          productive publication records in the field of the proposal.  This              project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative             Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation                between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange           of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through            collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
