 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator Award is being made to                Dr. Ralph Isberg, a newly appointed Assistant Professor of                      Microbiology at Tufts University School of Medicine.  His                       graduate research, carried out at Harvard Medical School, was on                the molecular mechanism responsible for the movement of                         transposable genetic elements from one location to another in the               bacterial chromosome.  The work resulted in several important                   publications that were considered to be highly significant in                   this rapidly advancing field.  He then went on to do postdoctoral               work in the laboratory of Dr. Stanley Falkow, at Stanford                       University Medical School.  That work, which he is now continuing               at Tufts, deals with the mechanism used by pathogenic bacteria to               enter and thrive in animal cells, including macrophage cells ---                important members of the immune system that normally function to                protect the animal from bacterial infection.  Dr. Isberg's                      seminal discovery was that a single bacterial gene, encoding a                  cell surface glycoprotein, was responsible for the infectivity of               the bacteria.  He elegantly demonstrated this by cloning the                    critical gene and genetically transferring it into the chromosome               of a normally benign, non-infective bacterial species.  The                     resulting recombinant organism subsequently acquired the ability                to infect animal cells.  He is continuing to apply biochemistry                 and genetics to solve important problems in the area of microbial               pathogenicity.",
