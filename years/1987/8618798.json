 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary motivation for fracture research on ice is related to the           prediction of maximum load-transmitting capability and the minimum load-        bearing capacity of ice masses.  This proplem is common to most                 engineering applications involving ice:  i.e., loads on arctic                  structures, bridge piers, ships, and bearing capacity of ice islands,           ice roads airstrips, etc.  The specific objective of the proposed               research is to investigate the effect of loading rate, testing                  temperature, and microstructure of fresh water ice on its fracture              toughness.  Preliminary to such studies, the effect of specimen size and        shape will be established.  Three types of ice that are common on many          nortnern rivers and lakes during winter will be examined.  The                  information obtained in this research will be extremely useful for the          prediction of maximum load-carrying capacity of ice; and it will lead to        the establishment of standardized fracture testing techniques for ice.                                                                                          The PI ie highly qualified to conduct the proposed research.  An award          is recommended.",
