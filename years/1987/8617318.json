 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal deals with the synthesis and characterization of glassy           forms of titanium carbide and titanium diboride--compounds known for            high hardness, low friction and chemical stability.  It is suggested            that these advantageous characteristics will be enhanced by eliminating         grain boundaries and long-range order, i.e., by preparing the materials         in an \"amorphous\" rather than crystalline state.  Preliminary results           show that such specimens can be prepared in the form of thin films by           chemical vapor deposition using an organometallic carrier molecule and          by thermal vaporization on a cooled substrate.  Analysis by various             spectroscopies indicate some interesting differences in the local               electronic and atomic environment of Ti, C and B in the films compared          with crystalline forms.  A major investigative tool in this project is          analysis of the extended fine structure above the characteristic x-ray          edge, studied by EXAFS for Ti and by EXELFS for C and B.  It is proposed        to extend the preliminary study to complete the characterization of the         local environment in the disordered films, test theoretical models              proposed for glassy metals, determine crystallization temperatures, and         compare corrosion rates and friction coefficients with crystalline forms        of TiC and TiB2.  The technological implications of this work including         applications for cutting tools, bearings, and corrosion resistant               surfaces, etc., will be addressed.",
