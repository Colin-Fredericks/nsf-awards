This model has been selected because extensive information regarding            somatic embryogenesis of carrots already exists in the literature.                                                                                              Embryos are thought to originate from single cells, or a small                  number of cells associated with a cluster of cells.  After                      induction, the embryos progress through several stages of                       development.  Recognition of the various stages of embryogenesis                and plantlet regeneration will comprise the major analytical                    procedures for assessing embryogenesis for this project.                                                                                                        Gases of various composition will be used in shake flask studies and            the information will then be transferred to the more industrially               applicable system of an agitated, scalable reactor.  The oxygen and             carbon dioxide effects will be studied to develop a bioreactor that             can be operated at controlled levels of the gaseous components.                 This development will provide a valuable tool for further                       investigations that will require the cultivation of embryos under               well defined nutritional conditions.",
