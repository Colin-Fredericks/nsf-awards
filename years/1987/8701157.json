 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 10-15 years atmospheric chemistry has evolved from            a young research discipline devoted primarily to local problems of              urban pollution and air quality to a mature science concerned with              the hemispheric to global scale cycling of a wide variety of chemical           species.  To a large extent this change has resulted from an                    increasing realization that human activities can cause chemical                 disturbances to the natural troposphere on scales far beyond local              concerns.  Well-known examples include changes in the                           regional-to-global concentrations of certain nitrogen compounds, lead           and other heavy metals, artificial radionuclides, a number of                   synthetic organic substances, certain acid-forming species, carbon              dioxide and methane.  These chemical changes in the atmosphere can              often extend to the earth's soils, oceans, and biota far from the               original source region.  They can result in alterations in the                  earth's climate, changes in vital nutrient cycles, and impact                   significantly on the public health and quality of life on earth.                    The Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE) will be a                coordinated multi-institutional atmospheric and marine chemistry                research project centered in the North Atlantic region.  The ultimate           goal of the AEROCE project will be the development of a predictive              capability for the continentally derived species observed in the                marine troposphere over the North Atlantic.  The selection of sites             and the measurement protocol in AEROCE has been developed jointly by            modelers and field experimentalists.                                                This element of the AEROCE project is concerned with examining              trace elements (Al, As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Sb, Se, and Zn) in                  precipitation to the North Atlantic to assess atmospheric transport             and deposition of continentally derived material to the sea.  The               North Atlantic is chosen because it is surrounded by relatively                 strong natural and anthropogenic  sources of these elements.                    Precipitation is sampled because it is largely responsible for trace            element deposition from the marine troposphere.  The data will be               compared to that in associated aerosols to help identify sources of             trace elements over the North Atlantic, to help confirm associated              air mass trajectory information, and to help evaluate the extent of             trace element removal by marine precipitation.  The corresponding wet           flux data will reveal the contribution of precipitation to North                Atlantic trace elements budgets.  Specifically, these wet atmospheric           fluxes comprise a significant portion of the global ocean flux and              ultimately influence the biological productivity of oceanic surface             waters.  To meet the research objectives, the P.I.'s will utilize a             carefully selected suite of trace elements, employ synoptic                     collection procedures, ensure accurate data through intercalibration            and quality control protocols, and integrate fully with other                   research results.",
