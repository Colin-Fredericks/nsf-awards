 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research program is to develop               methodologies for the design of nonlinear digital controllers for               nonlinear dynamic systems.  Since the choice of a controller structure          is highly dependent upon the structural properties of the underlying            system, the first step will be to determine how the geometric properties        of a continuous-time system are deformed by the introduction of the             usual sample-and-hold devices.  Recent work of the author and his               students has clarified the linear case, but for nonlinear systems, much         work remains to be done.  However, preliminary results show that the            additional flexibility gained by allowing multi-rate sampling is crucial        to achieving such design goals as feedback linearization;  this second          avenue of investigation will be further pursued.  A third goal will be          to develop a notion of \"transmission dynamics\" of a discrete-time               nonlinear system;  this will play the role of the transmission zeros of         a linear system and will lead to conditions for the existence of                controllers which simultaneously decouple and stabilize a nonlinear             discrete-time system. Finally, joint work will be done with Dr. C. Moog,        of France, and Dr. M. di Benedetto, of Italy, on differential algebraic         tools for the analysis of nonlinear systems.                                            The main objective of this research is to develop methodologies         for the design of nonlinear digital controllers for nonlinear dynamic           systems.  This research will be valuable in controlling high performance        nonlinear systems such as those encountered in advanced aircraft and            process control.",
