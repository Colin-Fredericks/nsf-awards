 "awd_abstract_narration": "All of the neurons of the autonomic nervous system and most             peripheral sensory neurons arise from the neural crest.  The                    neural crest is a transitory structure which appears on the                     dorsal surface of the neural tube shortly after neurulation in                  vertebrate embryos.  Neural crest cells migrate away from the                   neural tube along well-defined pathways to their final sites                    where they give rise to a variety of differentiated cell types.                 The differentiation of a neural crest cell into an autonomic                    neuron involves the acquisition of a specific neurotransmitter                  phenotype, which differs for different anatomical classes of                    peripheral neurons.  A developing neuron's choice of                            neurotransmitter is critical, since in order to establish a                     functional synapse with its target tissue, the neuron must                      synthesize a neurotransmitter which is appropriate to the                       receptors expressed by that target tissue.                                                                                                                              The long-term goal of Dr. Leblanc's research is to elucidate            some of the mechanisms which govern neurotransmitter choice in                  developing neurons.  In this project, the investigator will                     examine the differentiation of cholinergic properties in                        developing avian neural crest cells.  Dr. Leblanc will study (1)                the differentiation of choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity                 in neural crest cells in vitro, (2) the differentiation of CAT                  immunoreactivity in cranial neural crest cells in vivo, (3) the                 role of the cranial environment in directing cholinergic                        differentiation in developing neural crest cells, and (4) the                   effect of the trunk migratory environment on neurotransmitter                   expression in spinal motor neurons.                                                                                                                                     Dr. Leblanc is a well-trained developmental neurobiologist,             skilled in the use of tissue culture and transplantation                        techniques.  The results of this research will provide new and                  important information on the acquisition of neurotransmitter                    phenotype in developing neurons.",
