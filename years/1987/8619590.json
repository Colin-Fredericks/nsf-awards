 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this study, which is a continuation and extension            of studies carried out since 1972, is to monitor the brightnesses               of planets and satellites in the outer solar system along with                  their associated comparison stars in order to (1) set an upper                  limit to, or to detect, variability of the luminosity of the Sun;               (2) study the properties, including seasonal and climate effects,               of these bodies; and (3) study the natural variability of                       atmospheric transparency, including the long-lived effects of                   volcanism on the atmosphere, as well as possible anthropogenic                  influences.                                                                             One important result of this work has been the discovery of             clear evidence for a direct interaction between the global state                of a planetary atmosphere and variable solar uv output.  These                  effects are similar to the ones suspected and sought as inputs to               possible solar-climate effects.  Thus the work is important to                  sun-earth relationships in terms of changes in solar irradiance                 (climate change), variability in solar uv (atmospheric                          photochemistry) and observations of atmospheric aerosols                        (volcanoes).",
