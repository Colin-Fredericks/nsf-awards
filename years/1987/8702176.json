 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator (PI) proposes to examine two                    problems in the course of his research.  One of these                           problems involves determining the maximum amount of                             compression that can be achieved in a message so that it can                    be reliably transmitted over a communication system.  The                       research will focus on the little understood situation in                       which the characteristics of both the system and the message-                   generating device vary with time.                                                    The second problem that the PI proposes to explore                         involves determining the performance of procedures employing                    feedback for coding sequential data.  At present, the only                      general method for comparing two such procedures is to test                     to see which of them yields the smaller error.  Testing can                     be eliminated through the use of a formula for the error                        produced by a general feedback procedure.  The search for                       such a formula is included in the proposed investigation.                            More specifically, the principal investigator proposes                     to address communications problems including proving coding                     theorems for nonstationary communication channels having a                      variable-length structure, the calculation of the decoding                      error arising in linear filtering the output sequence of a                      feedback encoding scheme, and the determination of the                          optimal average rate at which a nonstationary information                       source can be encoded via a general class of variable-length                    source encoder.",
