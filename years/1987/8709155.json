 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraics eigenvalue problems are frequently encountered in                    engineering analysis.  For example, the dynamics analysis of                    structures leads to eigenvalue problems which are characterized                 by very large sparse matrices, i.e. matrices with many elements                 being zero.  The solution of this eigenvalue problem constitutes                a significant computational burden for structure models                         possessing thousands or tens of thousands of degrees of freedom.                                                                                                A new method, Component Mode Iteration, of solution shows                       promise.  It concerges quickly to the lowest modes of a structure               and the algorithm is inherently parallel, so that it would be                   natural to implement on a parallel processor.  This Engineering                 Initiation project will be directed toward the further                          development and testing of the component mode iteration                         algorithm.  Several refinements will be added to the current                    algorithm, e.g. eigenvalue shifts and automating the decision of                substructure division.                                                                                                                                          The institutional support is adequate and the P.I. is fully                     capable of carrying out the research.  I strongly recommend                     support.",
