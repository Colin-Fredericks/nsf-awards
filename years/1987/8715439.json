 "awd_abstract_narration": "The widespread availability of micro-computers together with an increase        in the awareness of structural engineers of the need to consider dynamic        effects in the design of structures, has created a need for structural          engineering software capable of modelling dynamic effects in buildings.         The ETABS Program developed on a large mainframe can provide the                modelling capability required by engineers.  The first step to make             ETABS available to the structural engineering community is to convert it        from a large computer environmental to the personal computer, this has          already been partially achieved.  However, in the conversion, the               original batch-type input definition method was retained.  This type of         problem definition approach is tedious and error prone.  To make ETABS a        practical tool with widespread use, the data input and data output              process should be facilitated using the latest techniques of interactive        computer graphics.  The research proposed will apply a series computer          graphics user-interface utilities that are currently under development          to transform the data input and output process of ETABS from a batch            mode to a fully interactive graphical procedure.                                                                                                                The following objectives will guide the proposed research:                                                                                                      1.   The resulting software should run in a PC-AT environment.                  2.             Both the input and output process will be through a menu-                       driven graphical interactive approach.                           3.             On-screen help information should be available.                  4.             The resulting software should be transportable to other                         engineering workstation configurations.                          5.             The pre- and post-processor tools developed should be                           applicable to similar batch oriented structural analysis                        programs.                                                                                                                                        The PC-AT environment is proposed as the target hardware                        configuration to make the end product of this research available                to as many engineers as possible.",
