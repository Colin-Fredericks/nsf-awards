 "awd_abstract_narration": "The feasibility of the double spiral reactor/heat                          exchanger was shown in Phase I.  Phase II research comprises                    three main tasks:  1. To design and build a spiral reactor that                 closely resembles the commercial model.  2. To determine its                    performance.  3. To develop an improved mathematical model of                   the reactor.  The aim of Task 1 is to make the spiral reactor                   leak tight, heat tight, and of minimum weight.  Task 2 will                     include measurements of temperature and heat transfer                           coefficients.  The improved model from Task 3 will be used to                   calculate the dimensions of a commercial reactor for any given                  flowrate and heat input.  The goals in Phase II are to produce:                 1. A procedure for manufacturing the double spiral reactor and                  an estimate of the cost.  2. An improved mathematical model.                    3. Experimental data to confirm the model.                                           This Phase II SBIR research is to bring to technical                       commercialization a device for cleaning contaminated air in                     confined working and living spaces.  The decontamination is to                  be accomplished by incineration, and the novel feature of the                   device is the attainment of the requisite temperature level                     without causing intolerable heating of the confined space whose                 air is to be cleaned.  The Phase I work demonstrated that the                   temperature level could be attained.  Phase II must deal with                   the heat loss issue as well as with the manufacturing of the                    device.",
