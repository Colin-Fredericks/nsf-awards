 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to teach scientific principles and methods to non-science         oriented majors in an applied area, the project would establish an              interdisciplinary course in Psychology and Legal Issues, using a                microcomputer laboratory.  There has been an increasing use of social           scientific reasoning and methodology for understanding legal issues.            Many pre-law students receive little if any instruction in the                  scientific method or any experience conducting research and handling            research data, experiences which would ultimately enhance their                 proficiency as future lawyers.  A microcomputer laboratory component            containing 20 Apple IIc Micro-systems will be used in a Psychology and          Legal Issues course jointly taught by faculty in the Psychology and             Political Science Departments and the School of Law.  It will provide an        interactive and experiential capability for teaching scientific methods         and principles to non-science majors.  In addition the microcomputer            laboratory will enhance the curricula of both the Psychology and                Political Science Departments by being available for use in existing            experimental and statistical courses.",
