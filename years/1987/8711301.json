Among                 nations, by contrast, there are often substantial differences in                rates and amounts of mobility. One possible explanation for both                of these patterns is that mobility rates are tied to stages of                  economic development. Because development levels do not                         ordinarily change during short intervals of time, rates of                      mobility between generations tend merely to undergo relatively                  minor fluctuations. However, because there are substantial                      variations in economic development among nations, cross-                        national rates of social mobility are also quite variable..                                                                                                     Contemporary surveys can not directly test the mobility-                        development thesis, even if they ask respondents' recollections,                because they can not collect data over a sufficently long period                of time. In recent years, however, sociologists and social                      historians have put together a number of data sets on mobility                  in the United States during the nineteenth and early twentieth                  century. They cover a sufficient period of time to permit the                   investigator to examine long term trends. (The birth cohorts in                 the disaggregated data range from l776 to l952.)                                                                                                                The analysis involves re-coding the occupational placements of                  respondents into the same categories so that mobility can be                    measured in comparable occupational terms in all of the data                    sets. In addition to examining the mobility-development thesis,                 the data sets permit analysis of both racial and regional                       differences in mobility in the United States during this 150                    year period.",
