 "awd_abstract_narration": "The experiments in this proposal are designed to examine the development        of connectivity in the prefrontal cortex of the rhesus monkey brain.            Recent advances in understanding the connections between the two lobes          of the frontal cortex (cortico.cortical connec tions) in mature monkeys         make this a model system for examining the rules and mechanisms which           govern their development.  Dr. Schwartz will conduct experiments to             provide detailed information on two aspects of development:  (1) the            tempo and pattern of ingrowth of cortico.cortical axons in the                  prefrontal cortex, and (2) the generation, targets and tempo of                 proliferation of synaptic contacts arising from callosal axons                  and the relationship of these events to columnar organization.                  These studies will examine fetal and neonatal monkeys using the                 neuroanatomical tracers HRP and tritiated amino acids at the                    light and electron microscope level.                                                                                                                            The results of these experiments will provide important new                     information on aspects of axonal growth and connectivity                        formation in the cerebral cortex of developing primates.  The                   cortico.cortical connections in the prefrontal cortex of primates are           highly developed.  Similarities in the pattern of behavioral                    impairments found following damage to the frontal lobes in humans and           monkeys suggest that the monkey prefrontal cortex may provide an                important model for understanding the structure and function                    of cognitive functions on humans.",
