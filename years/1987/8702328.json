 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Long-Term Ecological Research Project on Arctic tundra             ecosystems has five related sections: (1) baseline data                         collection, (2) experimental manipulations of whole ecosystems                  from the \"bottom up\" (i.e., nutrients, light, and temperature),                 (3) manipulations from the \"top down\" (grazers and predators),                  (4) linkages of land, water, and the atmosphere through exchanges               of elements, and (5) regional extrapolations.                                           Research in all five sections will involve terrestrial                  ecosystems, lakes, and rivers.  The major strengths of the                      research include the ability to apply experimental techniques to                whole ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic, and the                         application of new methods using stable isotopes.  The relative                 simplicity of arctic ecosystems makes them particularly good                    models for whole ecosystem research, and their location in a                    region of climatic extremes makes them particularly important to                include in the family of Long Term Ecological Research projects.                        This research project comprises a true interdisciplinary                research team from several different academic and research                      institutions.  The team is headed and led by a very senior                      scientist of international reputation whose personal performance                record is remarkable.  Based upon the accumulated scientific                    productivity of the past one may expect outstanding performance                 in the future by this formidable array of expertise.                                    In addition to coordination and collaboration among the                 principal scientists and their institutions this project also                   requires close contact with several federal, state and local                    agencies.  These aspects of the organizational burden are also                  well managed to the benefit of the project.                                             Facilities at the parent institution, the Marine Biological             Laboratory, are excellent as are the adjunct support laboratories               of collaborating scientists.  Field facilities provided through                 the University of Alaska are more than adequate to the task.                            The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends funding for the                first year of this new, five-year continuing award.",
