 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will determine appropriate new and innovative                computer-intensive statistical procedures and apply them to                     samples of discrete extragalactic sources defined by objective                  criteria, and to their relations with the predictions of                        mathematical cosmologies.  The probabilities of such deviations                 as may be observed, assuming the sample is unbiased and accepted                cosmology is correct, will be estimated by Monte Carlo methods.                 Statisical acceptability of the chronometric and Friedman                       cosmological hypotheses will be tested by comparison of their                   predicted observable relations with those observed in complete,                 or other statistically objectively delineated, published samples.               Computer applicable multivariate estimation for luminosity                      functions at several frequencies will be investigated.                               This research is cross-disciplinary, involving a symbiosis                 of Statistics with Computational Cosmology.  The fields of                      Statistics, Lie Groups, Modern Analysis, Geometry, Relativity,                  and Cosmology are all scientifically relevant in an essential way               to the testing, validation, and formulation of cosmological                     theories of the nature of the redshift and its objective                        statistical implications.  Senior scientists from these fields,                 which are normally  non-interacting, will combine their expertise               in re-analyzing extragalactic data and retesting the redshift                   theory.",
