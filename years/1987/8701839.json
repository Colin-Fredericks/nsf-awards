 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current development of low cost microprocessor components is                providing an expansion of multimicroprocessor applications to resolve           problems where time-critical needs exist.  Typical application areas            are robotics, nondestructive assembly line testing, defense systems.  A         key difficulty in the design of such systems is the development of the          structure of the overall task(s) to be performed and their resulting            distribution over the network of processors.  The problem to be                 investigated is in the properties of critical real time distributed             systems as they relate to the task structuring problem, and the                 corresponding development of algorithms which would be helpful to a             designer in structuring (or partitioning) a task set for this type of           application.  Implicit in this work is the use of performance modelling         methods to help establish the distributed system requirements needed to         insure the desired performance level for a particular task structure.           The research results will be used to develop a prototype, interactive           design aid to allow system designers to explore and evaluate                    alternative task structures.",
