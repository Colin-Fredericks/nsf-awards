 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sun is a source of energy.  A portion of this energy is                in the form of light (photons) which extends from the ultraviolet               to the infrared.  When the photons strike the Earth's high                      atmosphere they expend their energy in breaking up                              (dissociating), stripping electrons from (ionizing), and giving                 energy to (exciting) the atoms and molecules of the atmospheric                 gas.  These processes give rise to heating of the atmosphere                    which drives the circulation patterns (winds).  The relative                    composition of the atmosphere changes because of this which is a                feedback on the energy absorption process.  Understanding this                  coupling feedback system is an objective of Solar Terrestrial                   research.  The atoms and molecules excited in this process emit                 radiation which is characteristic of the chemistry as well as a                 measure of the concentration of the species.  The emissions can                 be an effective signature of the effects of the solar radiation                 on the atmosphere.                                                                   The objective of the research here is to measure the                       composition and temperature of the atmosphere.  This will be done               by using high resolution instruments to monitor the emitted                     radiation from the ground as the shadow height of the setting sun               moves up in altitude.                                                                The PI is an excellent scientist with extensive skills in                  analyzing optical data.  He has made extensive contributions to                 the field of Upper Atmospheric Science.  He is qualified to do                  this investigation.",
