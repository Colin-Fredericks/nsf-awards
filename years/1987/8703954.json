 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on some issues arising in the                          mathematical theory of control problems for linear systems.                      The central theme of this project is an operator of the form                   T + H*H where T is Toeplitz and H is Hankel. The motivation is                  two-fold. First, as previously shown by the principal                           investigator, the linear quadratic optimal control problem has a                T + H*H operator that reveals a lot of structure not identifiable               by conventional means. Secondly, as shown by the investigator,                  the H - infinity design problem alsdo involves a T + H*H                        operator, the largest eigenvalue of which provides the so called                achievable feedback performance, a critical parameter. As such,                 this operator reveals a strange connection between the linear                   quadratic problem and H - infinity problems. This connection will               be investigated along with its spectral and computational                       aspects.                                                                            This research is part of a larger effort conducted in this                  country by theoretical engineers and mathematicians to develop a                unified design methodology for linear control systems with                      robustness requirements on the design. This research combines                   fileds such as systems engineering and operator theory in                       mathematics.",
