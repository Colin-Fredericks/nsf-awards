 "awd_abstract_narration": "The marine sciences are of interest to students K thought                       undergraduate school.  However computer-aided instruction in the                marine science appears to be limited to approximately twenty-four               software programs currently available for microcomputers.  This                 project is directed at the 6-12 grade levels in the area of                     marine biology The objectives are: to design a lesson to                        demonstrate the form and function of fishes; to involve students                actively in the learning process by providing a computer                        environment for manipulating fish form, function and habitat in                 order to \"design a fish\"; and to demonstrate the concept that                   evolution is a function of environmental dictates.                                                                                                              The Apple IIc or IIe computer will be used in the                               development because the Apple II Series is currently the                        microcomputer used most extensively in the precollege level                     schools.  Evaluation of the lesson will proceed through the                     Delaware Department of Public Instruction, using Delaware                       schools.  In addition to various inservice programs, the Mid-                   Atlantic Marine Education Association and the National Sea Grant                Program will be evaluating the materials.  Marketing will be done               through the University office of Instructional Technology.                                                                                                      This project makes excellent use of the appropriate                             technology in a most suitable fashion.  Secondly, the product has               high potential to serve as a model for future development in                    other disciplines.  The availability of good software in the area               of biology is very low so a real need is being met by highly                    qualified persons and with a modest budget.",
