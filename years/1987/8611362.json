 "awd_abstract_narration": "The crust-magma interface in basaltic lava lakes occurs at a                    crystallinity of about 55%, which marks the transition from rigid,              albeit partially molten, crust to viscous magmatic suspension.  Most of         the original temperature contrast between the magma and its enclosure           occurs within this crust with the remainder occurring within a few              meters of the advancing solidification front (i.e. crust/magma                  interface).  The potential bouyancy available for large scale                   convection is thus limited by this reduced temperature contrast and             length scale.  The ensuing Rayleigh number is about 1010 times smaller          than previously thought.  The overall style of convection is not one of         turbulence.  The PI will investigate the dynamic and petrologic                 evolution of a sheet-like magmatic body cooling from either only the            top or from both the top and bottom.  The overall theme extends present         and previous investigations by B. Marsh, G. Brandeis, and C. Jaupart.           The critical issue of investigation is the dynamic interplay between            crystallization attending advancement of the crust-magma interface and          small scale convection in the suspension zone, just inward of the               advancing crust.",
