Using more than 20 interactive exhibits as well as              modern and extinct plant and animal species, visitors will experience           and explore this ancient, yet familiar world and develop a sense of the         relationships between past and present, living and dead, extinction and         survival as well as the continuity of natural processes.                                                                                                        The Museum will also construct related traveling exhibits for statewide         display and install semi-permanent satellite exhibits in four                   communities that have relevant geologic and paleontologic resources.            Exhibition designs will be based on formal and informal studies of              exhibit effectiveness, systematic study of learning styles of visitors          to the New Mexico Museum of Natural History, and interaction with               schools throughout New Mexico.                                                                                                                                  This new natural history museum has an impressive staff, a record of            institutional development and of state-wide community service, and a            clear plan for carrying out informal science education with                     regional themes that serve the varied populations of New Mexico.                The museum presently receives about 375,000 visits a year, of                   which 70,000 are in organized school groups with 45% Hispanic                   and/or Native American children.  There is a substantial outreach               program and extensive relationships with teachers and schools                   throughout the region.                                                                                                                                          This $1.6-million exhibit project is supported by $840,000 of                   state funds and $500,000 in private contributions.  A National                  Science Foundation award of $298,886 for FY87 is recommended.",
