 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Wind Engineering Symposium on High Winds and Building Codes will take         place in Kansas City  Missouri, November 2-4, 1987.  The U.S. Wind              Engineering Research Council (WERC) will sponsor this meeting that will         deal specifically with the information generated by recent research that        has been, can be, or should be incorporated into building codes and             standards.  The symposium will facilitate the transfer of this                  information as well as revealing new areas of wind engineering research         of greater importance to the safety of buildings.                                                                                                               The meeting will include sessions on: the ANSI standards and model codes        such as BOCA, UBC and Southern; important regional, state and city              codes; and comparison and analysis of diverse codes and standards.  A           few state-of-the-art foreign oodes, e.g., from Canada and Australia,            will be discussed as well. The papers presented and the panel                   discussions will be published in the form of proceedings.                                                                                                       The P.I. is a well recognized specialist in wind engineering and quite          capable to carry out this work and to produce a quality product.  He            will furnish NSF with twenty volumes of the resulting proceedings.  An          award is recommended.",
