 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a 30-month cooperative research project in                  biophysics between Dr. Kenneth J. Rothschild, Director, Cellular                Biophysics Program, Boston University, and Dr. Willem J. de Grip,               Department of Biochemistry, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.            The scientists and members of their research groups are collaborating           in a study of the detailed molecular mechanism by which rhodopsin               functions as a key component in the visual transduction process.                Aspects to be addressed include (1) how isomerization of retinal leads          to transient signal expression in rhodopsin, (2) the detailed                   configuration of the retinal chromophore at different steps in the              bleaching sequence, (3) the role of photoreceptor membrane                      phospholipids in the visual process, and (4) the role of rhodopsin              alpha-helices in transmitting the transductory signal from the                  chromophore to the transient signal sites.  Fourier transform infrared          (FTIR) difference spectroscopy will be used to study the light-induced          conformational changes occurring in rhodopsin and photoreceptor                 membrane.  Some of the studies will involve modified rhodopsin samples          produced in Dr. De Grip's laboratory.  These include samples with               isotopically labeled chromophore, proteolytically and chemically                modified rhodopsin, and rhodopsin reconstituted into different lipids.                                                                                          The experiments to be carried out here are aimed at understanding               better the fundamental processes that take place when light strikes the         retina of the eye.  A combination of advanced biophysical and                   biochemical techniques will be applied to detect the subtle structural          changes that occur in rhodopsin molecules in the retina in response to          absorption of light.  These changes ultimately give rise to the neural          excitation we interpret as vision, but the exact mechanism is not yet           understood.  Dr. Rothschild is a leader in applying FTIR spectroscopy           to the study of biophysical systems.  Dr. De Grip is an expert in the           field of rhodopsin biochemistry, and he will prepare many of the                samples to be studied in this project.  Working together, the two               scientists and members of their respective research groups hope to              increase significantly our understanding of the photochemistry of               vision.",
