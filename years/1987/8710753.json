 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent speculation into the nature of future computing systems has              focused attention on VLSI, artificial intelligence, and parallel                processing.  This research focuses on the design of VLSI building blocks        for multiprocessor systems specifically for LISP, the premier language          of AI (artificial intelligence) research today.  The initial system             organization is based on the SMALL LISP architecture, where processing          functionality is partitioned across two processing components--an               evaluation processor and a list processor--whose operation can be partly        overlapped.  A detailed design of system components based on this               partition is being developed.  VLSI layouts are being done to get               insight into timing and the feasibility of the approach.  Using this            information for guidelines, a software simulator is being developed to          simulate component performance as well as the effectiveness of the              system organization.                                                            This research is expected to impact computer architecture in several            ways.  It should provide insight into the feasibility of extending the          Decoupled Access/Execute type of architecture to multi-processing               systems.  It could provide an early preview of possible future                  generation LISP systems.  Finally, this functional composition approach         could provide another approach to the design of computer architectures          for other similar languages.",
