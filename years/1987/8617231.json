 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this two-year U.S.-China research project between                Marshall Peterson and Frederick Ling of Rensselaer Polytechnic                  Institute (RPI) and Shizhuo Li, Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute          of Metal Research is to study lubrication of metals with naturally              occurring oxide films.  The objectives are: to characterize the                 composition and properties of naturally occurring oxides at both high           and low temperatures; to determine the conditions which are conducive           to natural lubrication of a surface; and to advance understanding of            the behavior of oxide films in sliding contact.  Nickel, cobalt, and            iron alloys will be prepared with rhenium, molybdenum, copper, and              silver to form lubricating oxides.  The Chinese investigators will              prepare and characterize these alloys;  friction and wear properties            will be evaluated at the RPI laboratory; and a qualitative model of             solid film lubrication will be developed jointly.  The proposed                 research has significant practical applications.  The discovery of a            special oxide alloy or surface treatment that forms its own lubricant           that reduces friction and wear, would be cost effective and extremely           valuable for the aerospace and automotive industries particularly in            the development of energy-efficient engines and other advanced power            systems.                                                                                                                                                        The blending of the metallurgical, corrosion and tribology expertise of         the RPI and Shenyang Institute of Metal Research promotes the major             purpose of the U.S. - China Cooperative Science Program; which is, to           advance scientific knowledge through the combined efforts and abilities         of Americans and Chinese scientists and engineers.",
