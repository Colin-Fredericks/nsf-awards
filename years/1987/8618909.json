 "awd_abstract_narration": "This joint research program between Dr. Jacques Pankove, University of          Colorado at Boulder, and Dr. Han Daxing, Institute of Physics, Chinese          Academy of Sciences, Beijing, is designed to investigate light-induced          degradation of hydrogenated amorphous silicon, a phenomemon which               scientists believe is the major stumbling block to further development          of hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cells.  Such research is                important in the continuing search for improved semiconductor                   technology.                                                                                                                                                     In this project, Dr. Han will measure photoconductivity spectra after           various stages of light soaking and annealing.  The same samples will           then be tested at the University of Colorado to determine the                   luminescence characteristics.  Results will be discussed during                 reciprocal visits.  This will enable the two scientists to carry out            coordinated experiments on the same samples subjected to similar                treatment, an approach which will be carried out for the first time in          these experiments.  This project takes advantage of superior facilities         and capabilities on the part of both scientists and is an international         collaboration of great promise to both countries.",
