 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ascorbate, a water.soluble vitamin found in high concentrations                 in the mammalian forebrain, appears to modulate several different neural        functions.  This neuromodulatory role is especially                             evident in the neostriatum where physiological amounts of                       absorbate have been shown to alter neuronal activity and to                     interfere with the behavioral response to drugs that act in part                via neostriatal mechanisms.  To determine the neurochemical                     systems and processes underlying these actions of ascorbate a                   series of experiments will focus on a ppossible interactions                    between ascorbate and some well.known neurotransmitters.  Single.unit           recording techniques, including electrochemically.quantified                    iontophoresis, will be used to examine the effects of ascorbate                 on the neuronal response to iontophoretically.applied dopamine                  and glutamate and to glutamate released endogenously from                       cortico.neostriatal terminals.  Intraneostriatal infusions in                   freely.moving rats will be used to examine the role of the                      neostriatum in the behavioral effects of ascorbate.  Parellel                   experiments will examine the mechanisms that control                            extracellular levels of ascorbate, especially the dramatic rise                 produced by amphetamine.  Carbon.fiber microvoltammetic and                     electrochemically.modified electrodes will be used to obtain                    unequivocal information on extracellular ascorbate levels in the                neostriatum.  Follow.up work will extend these investigations to                other forebrain regions known to contain a high endogenous level                of ascorbate.  These lines of research will provide basic                       information about the mechanisms by which ascorbate regulates and               controls some important neural and behavioral processes.",
