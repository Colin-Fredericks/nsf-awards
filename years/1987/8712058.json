 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viscoelastic materials with fading memory exhibit behavior              that is intermediate between the nonlinear hyperbolic response of               elastic materials and the strongly diffusive, parabolic response                of viscous materials; they incorporate a subtle dissipative                     mechanism induced by the effects of fading memory.  Understanding               these effects is crucial to the proper design of computational                  methods for modeling both unsteady and steady viscoelastic flows.                       Analytical and computational techniques will be developed               for unsteady problems by adapting methods from the study of                     hyperbolic conservation laws.  Building upon the understanding of               classical solutions and their breakdown, a study of weak                        solutions to the governing equations will be conducted using two                approaches:  the method of compensated compactness and the random               choice method.  The latter requires an understanding of the                     Riemann problem for viscoelastic flows; its solution is an                      essential ingredient for designing computational algorithms.                    These ideas will be used to broaden the scope of the established                program of simulation of steady, two-dimensional viscoelastic                   flows, with the objective of resolving serious computational                    difficulties at high Weissenberg numbers.                                               This research represents a program in scientific computation            that unites methods from mathematical, computational, and                       engineering disciplines.",
