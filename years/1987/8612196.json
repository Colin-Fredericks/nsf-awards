 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although active noise control by means of destructive                           interference of sound waves has been studied for several decades,               inherent difficulties associated with the method have precluded                 its use on a large scale and 3-dimensional sources.  The lack of                success for large noise sources stems from a lack of knowledge of               how the surface acoustic intensity of the noise source is altered               with the addition of multiple active sources.   This project                    removes this limitation by developing a research tool that uses                 sound intensity prediction and optimization programs.   For a                   given noise source, the tool provides the guidelines for choosing               the optimum number and position of active sources to give the                   largest sound power reduction possible.  Recent development of                  affordable adaptive control systems using solid state electronics               makes it possible to use active noise control as a feasible                     alternative to more conventional noise control treatments.  The                 project's analysis is supplemented by an experimental activity                  which culminates with the demonstration of the active control                   method on a large turbo-machine.  ***",
