 "awd_abstract_narration": "Poor endpoint positional accuracy of current industrial robots has              restricted their applications to tasks that are error tolerant.  This           research focuses on improving end-of-arm accuracy by mounting                   additional sensors and actuators on the end effector.  The rationale is         to make the gripper insensitive to link static and dynamic deflections.         This technique requires design and development of a new sensor and              actuator capable of measuring and correcting the end-of-arm transverse          deflections in the vertical and horizontal directions.  To separate the         issue of compensating for the end-of-arm deflections from the overall           control problem of the robot arm, the additional sensors and actuators          will be tested on a single flexible beam controlled by a servo loop             controller.  A mathematical model describing the combined rigid and             flexible motions of the compliant link will be developed.  Performance          of the proposed approach will be evaluated through digital simulation           studies.  Further evaluation will be performed by testing the sensor            and actuator on an actual flexible link.",
