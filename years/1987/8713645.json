Laboratories to be visited represent the fields of                              chemistry, neurobiology and physics and are located at two                      institutions, the University of North Carolina and the                          College of William and Mary.  While on-site, official                           representatives will seek to determine if overall program                       objectives are being met through shared research experience                     in designated areas of strong mutual interest and                               competence.",
