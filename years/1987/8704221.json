 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transduction of chemical energy into mechanical work by                     muscle actomyosin in  situ is thought to involve the                            interaction of magnesium ATPase with crossbridges of myosin                     which cycle through steps of being bound to                                     and then free from actin.  It is widely held that while bound                   to actin, a crossbridge dissociates the ATP hydrolysis                          products and undergoes a structural change that produces                        force.  The many crossbridges in a muscle sarcomere operate                     asynchronously and the force generated by an individual                         actomyosin is thought to be transiently stored in an elastic                    component of the crossbridge.                                                                                                                                   Dr. Highsmith plans to obtain additional data on the                            structures of muscle myosin crossbridges which will test the                    hypotheses that the crossbridge portion called subfragment-1                    (S1) bends, by rearranging its constituent tertiary                             structural domains and generates force, and that its                            structure is reversibly distorted in order to store the                         mechanical energy involved.  The primary technique                              to be used is transient electrical birefringence in which a                     solution of S1 is subjected to an electric field pulse of                       adjustable strength and duration.  The motion of S1 under the                   influence of the electric field and its rate of field-free                      rotation will provide much needed structural information.",
