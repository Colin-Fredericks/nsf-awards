 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for two years of field research by                  Dr. Wrangham and his colleagues in the Kibale Forest which is                   located in southern Uganda. This area has an extremely high                     density of primates and the reseachers will focus their attention               on the common chimpanzee \u001aPan\u001a \u001atroglodytes\u001a. In the two related                aspects of the study they will study the process of chimpanzee                  group socialization and also examine the food calls made by these               animals. To accomplish these goals, they will make focal                        observations on adults encountered within the study area. They                  will record both activities of individual animals and will also                 note the composition of the group of which this animal is a                     member. A series of such observations will allow the                            reconstruction of the composition, fission and fusion of such                   groups. The team will also conduct focal tree.watches on fruiting               trees and this  will allow them to study how different groups and               individuals share valuable limited resources. They will  record                 information on the ecology of the entire study area to determine                both density and distribution of resources. Finally they will                   record chimpanzee vocalizations and through a combination of                    laboratory and situational analysis attempt to determine the                    number of different calls and the purpose or meaning of each.                                                                                                   The goal of this study is to understand the factors which                       determine how chimpanzees utilize the environment and the                       relationship between this strategy and group composition.                       Previous research has made it clear that in different parts of                  Africa these animals are organized differently and it seems                     likely that environment plays a role. However no detailed studies               have been conducted to answer this question. Closely related to                 the question of group organization is the issue of cooperation                  between individuals. Since vocalization sometimes serves to                     announce the presence of food, through a study of calls, insight                will, hopefully, be gained into the kinds of cooperation which                  take place.                                                                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons. First it sets the               context for understanding how humans act. Secondly data collected               may help to preserve these rare animals which are endangered in                 many parts of Africa. Finally, because of the participation of                  Ugandian students and scientists it should help strengthen the                  Ugandian scientific establishment and help forge links between                  Ugandian and U.S. reseachers.",
