 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a theoretical and empirical study of the                  allocation of operating licenses through a competitive market                   mechanism.  Federal, state, and local governments allocate many                 different kinds of permits that allow companies to conduct business,            e.g., broadcast licenses, airport takeoff and landing slots, liquor             licenses, and taxi medallions.  Previous work has shown that permitting         free-market sale or resale of operating licenses, an approach gaining           popularity with regulators, often does not result in an efficient               allocation of licenses.  The issue of whether the market produces an            efficient allocation is a question that can only be answered                    empirically.  Microeconomic theory does not provide a conclusive                answer.  The empirical part of this research will analyze the market            allocation of airport takeoff and landing slots and radio broadcasting          licenses.  This research is important because it will shed light on how         best to regulate these two public-service industries.",
