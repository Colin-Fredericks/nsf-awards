 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to partially support a workshop to be held at the           Laboratory of Mechanics of CNRS, Paris-Cachan, during the summer of             1988.  The purpose of the workshop is to assess the current status of           research in strain localization and size effect caused by cracking and          damage in brittle materials.  The workshop will provide a forum for an          in-depth discussion of the frontiers of research in this field.   The           workshop will be attended by several leaders in the field and will              result in recommendations for future directions in this important               research area.  Improvements in the understanding of strain localization        and size effects due to damage and cracking is essential for further            progress in the modeling of failure in concrete structures, geotechnical        engineering, mining, design of two-phase ceramic composites and many            other problems of materials and structural engineering.                                                                                                                                                                                            Professor Bazant is uniquely qualified to organize and chair this            workshop.  An award is recommended.",
