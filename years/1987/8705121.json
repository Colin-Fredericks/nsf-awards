 "awd_abstract_narration": "Progress has been made on analyzing micelle coagulation in a biological         system (milk).  Using a Zeiss IM, darkfield microscope with TV monitor,         camera, and microflash, particles as small as 0.095 micron were                 detected when the proteolytic enzyme rennet was added to diluted milk,          and the time course of coagulation was observed.  For this project,             Zeiss IBAS image processing system will be used to attach to the                darkfield microscope already in place in his laboratory.  The system            will allow particle sizes to be determined, enhancement of images from          the darkfield microscope (increasing resolution), and analysis of these         images.  After image enhancement, the geometric shape factors for the           model simulation can be calculated.  Comparison of these shape factors          for the actual flocs and the simulated flocs will test the                      applicability of theoretical models.",
