 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the most important recent revolutions in science belong to              Biology.  The discovery of means to routinely isolate, sequence, and            reintroduce genes into living cells has permanently changed biological          teaching and research agendas.  The tools of Cell Tissue Culture and            Recombinant DNA Technology are providing the basis for an appropriate           undergraduate education in modern Biology, and a hope for exploiting the        future promise of Biotechnology.                                                                                                                                This Department has identified Molecular/Cellular Biology as an area for        increased emphasis and, using local resources, has partially equipped an        area to include a functional Cell Tissue Culture Laboratory.  The               laboratory complex is housing a specially designed course \"Cell/Tissue          Culture\", as well as supplementing student experimentation in the               Botany, Microbiology, and Genetics courses.  Also, a new B.S. degree            program with an emphasis in Molecular/Cellular Biology is being                 inaugurated.  Thus the equipment provided through this project is               greatly expanding the efficiency, depth, and variety of possible student        experimentation in the areas of Cell Tissue Culture and DNA Technology.",
