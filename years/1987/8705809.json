 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue geochemical studies of lavas of known                relative age from several Hawaiian volcanoes, the eastern active                zone of Iceland, and a miocene basaltic plateau in eastern China.               A major objective is to understand the origin and evolution of                  interplate lavas because \"hot-spot\" volcanism is the major type                 of volcanism which is not an obvious result of plate tectonics.                 Moreover, in each of these areas there is a transition from                     tholeiitic to alkalic compositions and a specific objective is to               determine the cause of these transitions in different tectonic                  settings.  In Hawaii it is planned also to identify and interpret               geochemical variations within and between tholeiitic shields.                   This is an important objective because previous results show                    clearly that the plume component is most evident in the shield                  tholeiites, but little information exists about the temporal                    evolution of these shields. The approach will be to constrain the               mineralogy and composition of source components from study of the               lavas and where present, the peridotite xenoliths.  Field                       relationships, major and trace element analysis of whole rocks                  and minerals, and isotopic analyses (Sr, Nd, Pb) will all be                    used.  Models will then be developed using more complex melt                    segregation concepts.",
