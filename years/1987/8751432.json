 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Congress on Mathematical Education (ICME)                     is the most important forum for exchanges of scientific                         information among scholars in mathematics education.  The Sixth                 ICME will be held on July 17 - August 3, 1988 in Budapest,                      Hungary.  Given the current crises in mathematics education, it                 is essential that the United States be well represented by key                  mathematics educators and that information about the Congress be                widely disseminated among our nation's mathematics educators and                educational leaders.  The National Council of Teachers of                       Mathematics (NCTM), with the support of the Mathematical                        Association of America (MAA), will select 40 delegates to ICME-6                whose travel will be partially subsidized and who will submit a                 written summary of the Congress activities.  Those reports along                with invited papers by selected individuals will serve as a basis               for a monograph on Congress activities that will be published by                NCTM.  Articles will be prepared by the Awards Committee to be                  submitted for publication in NCTM and MAA newsletters and                       journals with a combined circulation of nearly 70,000.                          Presentations on Congress proceeding will be arranged at various                NCTM meetings.                                                                                                                                                  The necessity to gain mathematics education on a global                         basis cannot be too strongly emphasized.  Problems in education                 appear to be more universal than previously thought.  The sharing               of solutions among nations is vital if we are to develop the most               effective cures in mathematics education.  Attendance at this                   Congress by mathematics educators from the United States and                    subsequent publications will provide invaluable information to                  those persons concerned with the current state of education in                  mathematics, an area of significance in future political and                    economic areas.",
