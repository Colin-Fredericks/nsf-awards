 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  This proposal deals with the general question                of emulsion stability, which in the past has been dealt with                    using the same theoretical considerations that are applied to                   dispersions of colloidal solids in a liquid.  There is, however,                a fundamental difference when the dispersed phase is an                         immiscible liquid rather than a solid.  Molecules of the liquid                 may be incorporated into the interfacial phase forming rigid                    liquid crystalline structures which then stabilize the emulsion.                An immiscible liquid may also dissolve into micelles which tend to              form in the continuous phase when surfactant is present.  The                   presence of these swollen micelles in the continous phase can                   enhance the coalescence rate.  The hypothesis in this work is                   that one of these two phenomena is, in general, overriding; and                 the classical theory which is so successful in dealing with the                 stability of colloidal suspensions is not relevant when dealing                 with emulsion stability.  This research tests this hypothesis.                                                                                                  Novelty:  The research is innovative even though the techniques                 for evaluating emulsion stability and droplet coalescence rates                 are not.  The novelty arises because the chemical system used to                conduct the study is carefully characterized relative to its                    tendency to form liquid crystalline or microemulsion phases at                  equilibrium.  These crucial measurements are concerned with the                 behavior of the equilibrium systems.  If successful, a                          correlation between certain equilibrium properties and emulsion                 stability will be demonstrated, thereby providing an entirely new               and radical approach in structuring surfactant molecules.                                                                                                       Technical Impact:  The need to create stable emulsions is                       prevalent in many applications of surfactants.  Foods, paints,                  agricultural insecticides, and many other products are stable                   blends using new surfactant chemicals to obtain the desired                     stability.  On the other hand, sometimes the breaking of                        emulsions is required.  An entire industry has been created to                  deal with this problem, especially to service the oil industry.                 This research could profoundly influence the methodology used for               the selection of chemicals for emulsion destabilization, as well                as the types of chemicals used.",
