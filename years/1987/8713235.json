 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to a Project Solicitation, the Cornell Theory Center                submitted a proposal to conduct a Supercomputer Summer Institute in             1987.  This proposal and eight others were evaluated by a review                panel.                                                                                                                                                          Cornell has proposed a two week Institute for 25 young researchers              from June 29 to July 10, 1987.  Students will be reimbursed for                 travel, accomodations, meals, and some incidental expenses.  In                 addition to detailed training on the use of the IBM 3090/400 vector             supercomputer and FPS attached array processors, students will be               exposed to seminars from experts in the computationally intensive               areas of statistical mechanics, solutions of coupled multi-dimensional          equations, protein structure calculations, and quantum physics.                                                                                                 The review panel found this to be a strong proposal, and found favor            with the emphasis on hands-on access to the Cornell computer system.            Students will be expected to bring a working Fortran program for                optimization during the Institute.  The variety and numbers of                  terminals/workstations for student access was noted.  Training will             also emphasize the various methods and kinds of digital network access          to the Cornell facility.                                                                                                                                        While the initial costs were high, negotiation has succeeded in                 reducing the cost from $104,200 to $68,672, without reducing the                quality of the Institute.  In addition, Cornell has identified an               undergraduate component of $7000.                                                                                                                               The Theory Center ran a successful Supercomputer Summer Institute in            1986, and can be expected to do so again in 1987.  The Centers Program          recommends support in the amount of $75,672.",
