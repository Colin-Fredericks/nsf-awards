The brains of host rats               with viable indwelling fetal neurografts will be examined to                    determine the neuroanatomical patterns of neuronal and                          neurovascular integration that develop between the fetal                        hypothalamic transplants and surrounding host tissue and will                   confront the three following basic questions:                                                                                                                   1) What are the underlying mechanisms of formation of vascular                  patterns and neurovascular interrelationships that develop                      between the host brain and the graft which serve to maintain the                viability of extrinsic fetal neurografts?                                                                                                                       2) What are the ultrastructural correlates underlying the                       mechanisms of synptogenesis and neuronal plasticity between the                 transplant and the host?                                                                                                                                        3) What are the fine structural correlates and major                            neuroanatomical routes for the delivery of centrally acting                     peptides?
