 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research considers an important problem in structural safety.               Failures during construction represent a significant number of                  total structural failures.  Current treatment of construction                   loads tends to be ad-hoc.  This research will be a necessary                    first step toward rationalizing selection of construction loads.                                                                                                A number of factors influence the safety of multistory concrete                 structures during construction.  Among these factors are                        construction loads and their distribution on various levels of                  floors and shores.  Several previous studies have addressed the                 problem of load distribution among various floors.  However,                    determination of the magnitude of construction live loads has not               received adequate attention.                                                                                                                                    Slab formwork live loads include construction material storage                  loads, weight of equipment and workers, and impact loads when                   placing the concrete.  The proposed research will develop                       probabilistic models for predicting formwork live loads.  The                   developed models will be used to determine equivalent uniformly                 distributed loads for design of various formwork memebers.  This                study is based on the premise that the assurance of formwork                    design safety has to be based on a measure of risk in terms of                  probability.  Accordingly, the objective of the study is                        development of probability based loading criteria for concrete                  formwork.                                                                                                                                                       The results of the proposed research will provide the required                  load model for evaluation of the reliability of current concrete                building construction practices.  This is an important step in                  extablishing an acceptable level of risk for the construction                   stage of concrete structures and future development of                          probability based design criteria for concrete construction.",
