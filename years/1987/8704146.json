 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regulation of lysogeny by the plasmid prophages P1 and P7 is                    mediated by expression of genes located in the ImmC and ImmI                    regions of the phage genomes.  The c1 and c4 genes (located                     in ImmC and ImmI, respectively) are both required for the                       maintenance of lysogeny and are believed to code for                            repressors of transcription.  The structure of ImmI genes                       (specifically c4, ant/reb, and sim) will be determined by DNA                   sequence analysis.  Gene expression in the ImmC regions will                    be investigated by identifying transcription products                           produced in vitro and in vivo and measuring the effect of c1                    repressor binding on their expression.  The precise                             nucleotides involved in the interaction of the c1 repressor                     with its operator sites will be determined by studying                          repressor binding to synthetic oligonucleotides of defined                      sequence.  The characterization of P1 and P7 regulatory                         elements should provide insights into control mechanisms                        operating during bacteriophage infection and plasmid                            maintenance.",
