 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to improve the teaching of science at           the junior high and senior high school levels by training teachers to           use science fiction films as a supplement to the regular curriculum.            Such an approach supports the classroom teachers' efforts to teach              science and its relationships to technology and society and to motivate         pre-college students to study science.                                                                                                                          Two recent NSF grants funded the preparation of a teacher's guide               describing the physical principles illustrated or violated in a number          of science fiction films deemed suitable for use in a ninth or tenth            grade general science course.  This proposal will make use of both the          materials and techniques developed under the prior grants.                                                                                                      Master teachers and non-master teachers will receive intensive                  instruction in the use of science fiction films and in a number of              substantive topics in physics and biology related to the films during a         two-week institute during the summer.  Each team of three teachers will         have the support of one master teacher as they implement the program in         their classrooms during the school year.                                                                                                                        The principle investigator has a great deal of expertise in this area.          He was awarded an NSF grant in l978 under the Local Course Improvement          Program to develop an introductory level science course at Temple               University using science fiction films to introduce students to science.        This popular course has since been taught nine times and has reached            hundreds of students, many of whom have stated that they would never            have enrolled in a traditional science course.  In l984 an additional           NSF grant allow him to expand the effort to include precollege students.        The teachers guide written as a result of that grant  will be used to           support the training of teachers in the current grant.",
