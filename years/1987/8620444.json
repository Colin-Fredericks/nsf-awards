 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolution in plants often involves polyploidy, a doubling of            the genome.  Polyploidy is particularly common in ferns, where                  frequent episodes of interspecific hybridization and polyploidy                 have resulted in the formation of reticulate (or interrelated)                  species complexes in many genera.  The evolutionary relationships               within such groups of closely related species are often difficult               to determine, particularly using traditional methods of analysis.               Nowhere are the results of hybridization and polyploidy more                    evident than in Polystichum, a fern genus of nearly worldwide                   distribution consisting of 160 to 175 species.  A prime example                 of the interrelated species groups typical of Polystichum and                   many other plant genera is found in the Polystichum complex from                western North America, which contains five diploid and six                      polyploid species.  In this investigation, molecular techniques                 (i.e., enzyme electrophoresis and analyses of DNA sequences) will               be used to unravel the evolutionary relationships of these 11                   species.  This approach is potentially much more powerful than                  traditional analyses of plant structure and has not yet been                    applied to analyses of polyploid evolution in ferns; thus, this                 study may serve as a model for future investigations of                         hybridization and polyploidy.  Not only will this project clarify               the evolutionary relationships within the Polystichum complex                   from western North America, but it will also provide valuable                   insights into polyploidy, an important evolutionary process in                  both ferns and flowering plants.",
