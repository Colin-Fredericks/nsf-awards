 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert L. Lochmiller of Oklahoma State University is the                   recipient of a Presidential Young Investigator Award.  This grant               will enable him to initiate new studies in the area of animal                   nutritional ecology and population ecology.  For a very large                   number of mammalian herbivores, the most fundamental resource                   limiting population expansion is nutrient availability or forage                quality, as these directly affect recruitment and survival.                     Dr. Lochmiller's interest is in elucidating the mechanisms by                   which nutritional status influences immune system function and                  disease resistance in adult animals, passive transfer of immunity               to offspring, and immune system ontogeny (or development), and how              all of these relate to population dynamics.  Initial efforts will               be focused on assessing immunocompetence of newborn young (in deer              and in cotton rats), determining the influence of protein                       nutrition on development of immunity in the cotton rat, and                     measurement of mortality rates of young in both species.  The                   methods used in this research include state-of-the-art techniques               in immunology, histomorphology, and ecology (including radio-                   telemetry and ultrasonic detection).  Laboratory and field studies              are involved.  Much of this scientist's previous work has dealt                 with various aspects of the biology and ecology of the collared                 peccary (Tayassuidae), resulting in a prolific publication record               also notable for its outstanding quality.  Funding is provided for              a five-year duration.",
