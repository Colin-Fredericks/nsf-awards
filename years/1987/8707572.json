 "awd_abstract_narration": "The premotor cortex, one of the major areas of the                         cerebral cortex is suggested to be involved in numerous aspects                 of motor behavior.  One idea is that it has a role in the                       learning of motor skills.  Lesions studies suggest deficits in                  recalling movements from memory.  Other studies show the                        involvement of this part of the cortex in movement preparation.                 Dr. Timothy Ebner believes this brain area is concerned with                    the preparation and visual guidance of the limbs or hands                       during voluntary movements into various regions of reachable                    extra personal space.  His work proceeds under that hypothesis.                                                                                                      In primates trained to make voluntary movements in the                     horizontal plane which require visually guiding a cursor into                   target zones, the discharge of single neurons in the premotor                   cortex will be recorded.  Four aspects of the cell's activity                   in relation to complex movements will be studied.  First, is to                 define the region within two dimensional space in which a cell is               modulated during reaching movements.  Second, the relationship                  between the discharge pattern of premotor cortical neurons and                  movement kinematics will be addressed.  Third, the responsiveness               of premotor cortex neurons to \"errors\" in motor performance and                 corrective movement will be evaluated.  Fourth, how the discharge               of single cells change in the process of adapting a movement to                 match externally exposed constraints will be determined.                        Overall, these studies will define which features of two                        dimensional, visually guided movements are represented in the                   premotor cortex.",
