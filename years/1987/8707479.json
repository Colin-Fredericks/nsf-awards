 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research activity is supported under the Research Opportunities            for Women - -Planning Grants Program.  The research is at the                   interstices of political science and law and social sciences as it is           concerned with an investigation of compliance to public policies.  An           investigation of compliance to public policies permits both theoretical         and empirical analyses of the relationship between government and the           governed.                                                                                                                                                       The grant allows the investigator to plan for a research investigation          to refine a theory of compliance and to test the theory in different            policy settings in different countries.  The initial part of the                planning stage involves a preliminary assessment of welfare fraud in            the United States and the second part of the planning stage involves            the development of a formal research proposal.  The preliminary study           will enable the investigator to establish the criteria for selecting            programs and countries for the subsequent investigation.  This phase            will also enable the investigator to develop a research design for the          larger research acitivity.",
