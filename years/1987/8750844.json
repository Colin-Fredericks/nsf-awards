 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant has provided the Department of Biology a Hewlett-Packard             capillary gas chromatograph (GC) linked to a mass spectrometer (MS) with        a direct insertion probe that is being used to facilitate instruction in        Toxocology courses and to facilitate the development of more                    interdisciplinary undergraduate science projects.  Since the MS is an           essential tool in the qualitative and quantitative structural analysis          of unknown toxicants in the environment, projects have been designed in         six courses to teach how the GC/MS functions, and how it is used in             Toxicology and in other areas of the Biological and Physical Sciences.                                                                                          Experiments have been developed to exploit the advantages offered by the        GC/MS as well as show the disadvantages of inappropriate use (e.g.              unstable antibiotics injected into a GC/MS versus direct insertion into         the MS).  Student projects involve the use of the GC/MS to detect               environmental pollutants and unknown metabolites of well-defined toxic          chemicals or medications.  Stable isotope analyses, potentially useful          to those pursuing human nutritional toxicology research, and experiences        with new methods for using the GC/MS (e.g. with theoretical, pure               standards and with biological sample spectra) are providing instruction         on uses of a low resolution GC/MS in Toxicology.",
