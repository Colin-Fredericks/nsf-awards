 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tension receptors are important links in the feedback system                    controlling movements and maintenance of position.  The                         PRincipal Investigator in this project has been studying such                   receptors in the limbs of crabs and crayfish.  These provide                    particularly favorable material with which to explore the                       mechanisms by which such receptors work and the ways in which                   the information obtained from them is used by the organism.                     This is because the behavior of the animals is relatively                       simple and the joints and muscles in which the receptors are                    found are rather easily accessible.  The studies here will use                  two species of crab and two of crayfish.                                                                                                                        There are four main objectives of this project:                                                                                                                 1.  To study the output of individual tension receptors on the                  tendon that closes the joint, characterizing its action.                        2.  To obtain descriptions of the structure and general                         responsivities of tension receptors on other tendons of the                     walking legs.                                                                   3.  To attempt to determine if the muscle of the legs have                      length detectors as well as tension receptors.                                  4.  To compare the tension receptors in the pair of claws, one                  of which is much larger than the other.                                                                                                                         This exploratory work has considerable potential for leading to                 a model system that can give important clues to the workings of                 the proprioceptive sense.",
