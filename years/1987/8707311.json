 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to study biochemical events in the early stages of            detection of chemicals by odor receptors.  The project will be directed         by Dr. Richard Bruch, who will be using catfish as the organism under           study and amino acids as the odorants.  The reasons are that the                olfactory receptors of catfish are conveniently accessible and much is          known about their physiological properties.  Amino acids are natural            components of foods for catfish, and they have evolved sensitive and            specific receptors for them.  The information about basic mechanisms            obtained from this study is expected to find application in other               organisms and for other odorous chemicals.                                                                                                                      Dr. Bruch's basic hypothesis is that there are specific receptor                proteins for amino acids in catfish olfactory receptor cell ciliary             membranes, and that when these proteins interact with amino acids the           protein/amino acid complex somehow initiates a particular series of             biochemical reactions.  These involve the participation of a so-called          \"G-protein\" (a protein that binds a guanine nucleotide) and leads to            increased metabolism of a certain class of membrane lipids, the                 phosphoinositides.  He will test this hypothesis by measuring binding of        radioactive amino acids to proteins from the cilia in an attempt to             demonstrate that the receptor proteins really exist.  He will measure           phosphinositide turnover upon amino acid stimulation, including the             effects of added guanine nucleotides and of modifiers of the G-protein.         He will also study the regulation of the enzyme, phospholipase C, which         initiates phosphoinositide turnover, and attempt to determine its               location in the cell.                                                                                                                                           This project hold the promise of contributing greatly to our                    understanding of transduction in olfactory receptor cells and in sensory        cells in general.",
