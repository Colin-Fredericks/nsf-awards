 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs represent one of the world's most diverse ecosystem             types in terms of species and also one of the most highly                       productive.  As the waters surrounding most coral reefs are                     oligotrophic (i.e., extremely depauperate in nutrients), planktonic             assemblages of animals and photosynthesizers are very dilute and do             not provide much in the way of food for coral reef organisms.  Most             of the high productivity of reefs is based ultimately on the                    photosynthesis of seaweeds and algal-containing corals.  Thus                   factors that affect seaweed primary production contribute greatly to            the entire organization and functioning of coral reef ecosystems.                   Dr. Carpenter and collaborator Dr. Susan Williams, of the                   University of Washington, want to look at possible mechanisms by                which this high reef production is maintained in such nutrient poor             environs.  They hypothesize that the high numbers of reef herbivores            are able to rapidly recycle nutrients bach to the seaweeds, and that            nitrogen fixation may be an important, in situ nutrient-producing               process.                                                                            Both Drs. Carpenter and Williams are productive young                       researchers very familiar with the ecology of coral reefs in the                Caribbean.  Dr. Carpenter's background in reef herbivores and algal             productivity will balance nicely with Dr. William's considerable                nutrient dynamics experience.  Support for this two-year                        investigation is recommended.",
