 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Witold K. Brostow,                   Department of Materials Engineering, Drexel University, to pursue               with Dr. Daniel Ate're' Jonah, Professor, Department of Mathematics,            Fourah Bay College, University of Sierra Leone, for a period of 24              months, a program of research on molecular theories of solubility.              The research will deal with the  the statistical mechanics of                   solubility of gases in liquids and in amorphous solids, solubility of           solids and liquids in supercritical fluids, and vapor-liquid                    equilibria of dilute systems.                                                                                                                                   Professor Jonah has already developed the first version of the theory           of dilute solutions and solubility, while Dr. Brostow has made                  experimental observations on vapor-liquid equilibria of highly dilute           solutions and has developed equations for isobaric expansivity and              isothermal compressivity which are required to make the theory                  usable.  The research is expected to lead to a better understanding             of  solubility and would be useful in industry for improving                    efficiency of separation and purification of materials and also for             better protecting amorphous polymers from the effects of gas                    solubility on their properties.  This project is relevant to the                objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks           to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and                engineers and their counterparts in developing countries through the            exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and           through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  The U.S. and              Sierra Leonian collaborators are highly respected scientists with               extensive research experience and productive publication records in             the field of the proposal.",
