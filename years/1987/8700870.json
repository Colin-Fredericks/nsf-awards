 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although much is known about the variation among individual                plants in ability to produce seeds, little is known about how                   different individuals within natural plant populations differ in                their ability to produce pollen.  The differential success of                   individuals in siring seeds could be a powerful force influencing               the ecology and evolution of plants.                                                 This project addresses the possibility that individuals can                differ in their success in siring seeds during the                              postpollination phase in the blue columbine, Aquilegia caerulea.                It will also determine if differential success of males, should                 it exist, occurs prior to fertilization or after fertilization                  during seed development.  The study employs a number of modern                  techniques that allow determination of , for example, paternal                  contributions to seeds when pollen from more than one individual                has been applied to a single stigma.  Controlled breeding                       experiments will reveal the effects of environment, maternal, and               paternal parents on seed produciton and seed and seedling                       characteristics.  By doing such studies in both natural and                     cultivated populations of plants, the project can determine tha                 potential for selection on male reproduction in nature.  Further                studies can determine whether variation in success of individuals               is caused by features which are inherited by offspring.                         Understanding the potential for selection on male success after                 pollination is relevant to studies in evolutionary biology and to               development of artificial selection techniques in crop breeding.",
