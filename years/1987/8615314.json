 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jensen proposes to utilize the cataloging of                                oligonucleotide sequence.  The strong conservation of ribosomal                 RNA through evolutionary time is the basis for assembly of a                    credible phylogenetic tree for prokaryotes.  Slow changes in                    rRNA can be quantitated in the form of SAB values by                            oligonucleotide cataloging, thus providing an evolutionary                      scale against which the evolution of other gene-product systems                 can be measured.  It is possible now for the first time to                      reconstruct in prokaryotes the events in the evolution of                       biochemical-pathway arrangement and biochemical-pathway                         regulation.  We propose to obtain data that will permit such                    evolutionary deductions to be made with respect to the pathway                  for biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids.  This will be carried                 out in a large but manageable division of prokaryotes, the                      \"purple\" bacteria.  Data already obtained allow construction of                 a working model for deductions about the evolution of (i)                       tyrosine-pathway cofactor specificity, (ii) DAHP synthase                       isozymes, (iii) the phenylalanine pathway and its regulation,                   and (iv) the tyrosine pathway and its regulation.  As new                       cataloging data identify brance positions on the tree where                     gaps limit interpretations, we will proceed with analysis of                    these organisms.  At shallow levels of divergence, rRNA/DNA                     hybridization will probably be more appropriate for                             identification of evolutionary points of divergence in                          correlation with fine-tuned instances of recent biochemical                     change.",
