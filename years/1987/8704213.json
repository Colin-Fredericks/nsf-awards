 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Beall to conduct human biological research               in Phala, Tibet Autonomous Region, Peoples Republic of China. The               approximately 170 male and female nomads  (between the ages of 15               .85) to be studied reside at high altitudes of between 4900 .                   5450 m above sea level and the goal of this project is to                       understand how people adapt to year round habitation at such                    heights. Dr. Beall will measure the distribution of hemoglobin                  concentration, percent arterial oxygen saturation and                           ventilation. Study participants will provide fingerstick blood                  samples for hematological analysis and undergo noninvasive                      oximetry. Resting ventilation volumes will also be measured. This               will yield basic epidemiologic data on age and sex differences in               these parameters and allow Dr. beall to test the hypothesis that                an inverse association exists between hemoglobin concentration                  and percent arterial oxygen saturation. Dr. Beall also                          hypothesiszes that there is a positive association between the                  percent of arterial oxygen saturation and ventilation.                                                                                                          This is an extremely interesting study population because it                    resides year round at such a high altitude. It is also                          interesting because it appears that Tibetians adapt to the oxygen               stress imposed by high altitude differently from South Americans                who live in the Andes. This latter group exhibit barrel chests                  and higher levels of hemoglobin concentration. These features                   appear to be abscent in Tibetans.                                                                                                                               This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of how humans adapt to physical stress. It may aid                in the management of altitude sickness and will help to open this               extremely interesting part of the world to U.S. reseachers. I",
