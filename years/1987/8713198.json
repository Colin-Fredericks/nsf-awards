 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study proposes to investigate the potential use of                         streptomyces to accomplish coal liquefaction, (streptomyces is a                living microorgranism best known for its ability to produce                     antibiotics). The research will attempt to understand better the                rate determining enzyme kinetics, transport steps and the                       optimum environmental conditions for coal liquefaction utilizing                a three phase (solid, liquid, gas) sparged slurry reactor for                   the investigation.                                                                                                                                              Finely ground lignite coal will be fed to the reactor containing                water and essential nutrients.  The reactor will be sterilized                  and then inoculated with an active and dense culture of                         streptomyces species along with an excess air.  The principal                   manipulated variables will be pH, oxygen, and particle size.                    Mass spectroscopy will be used to analyze for microbial biomass,                product concentration and key enzymes.                                                                                                                          Coal is one of the largest sources of energy.  However, energy                  demand is greatest for liquid fuels.  Chemical and thermal                      processing for coal liquefaction require extreme conditions of                  temperature, pressure and chemical environment.  Several species                of fungi have been identified that are capable of growing on and                degrading coal.  However, the process of coal solubilization is                 not understood and the products have not been well                              characterized.                                                                                                                                                  This is a high risk/high return project in which processes could                be developed for the production of novel aromatic chemicals or                  polymers or for the conversion of solid to liquid fuel. Initial                 studies have already been carried out demonstrating complete                    liquefaction of liqnite coal in shake flasks.  The selection of                 streptomyces enhances the probability of success of this                        project.",
