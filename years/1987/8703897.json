In some cases, a                    reconstruction can be induced by the addition of controlled                     amounts of adatoms.  Questions about why and how such                           rearrangements occur represent fundamentally inportant topics in                                                                                                surface science.  In addition, the possibility to induce such                   effects has the potential of providing a source for new materials                                                                                               with novel and possibly very useful properties.                                                                                                                 A study of geometric structure of such reconstructed surfaces                   using medium energy ion scattering with channeling and blocking,                                                                                                a powerful, novel, high resolution technique for surface studies                                                                                                will be employed.  These studies are to be complemented with                    studies of the electronic structure using angle resolved                        photoemission with synchrotron radiation and with inverse                       photoemission.  Among the systems to be studied are the                         reconstructions that occur on the (110) surfaces of gold and                    platinum and the adsorbate induced reconstructions that occur on                                                                                                similar surfaces.  This research will ultimately lead to new ways                                                                                               of changing the location of atoms on surfaces and thus produce                  synthetic surfaces with useful properties.",
