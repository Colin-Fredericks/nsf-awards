 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to support two years of research on                 late Neogene terrestrial Paleoclimatology, zoogeography, and                    biochronology of Asia.  Pertinent data are available for the                    Siwalik group of southern Asia (Pakistan), and indicate                         important paleoenvironmental changes through time, reflecting                   in part, the development of monsoons.  We propose to develop a                  second data source in the Yushe Basin, Shanxi, PRC, the longest                 (late Miocene through early Pleistocene) sequence of                            fossiliferous Neogene strata known in eastern Asia.  Detailed                   knowledge of the faunal history of Yushe Basin, coupled with a                  precise chronology based on paleomagnetic reversal stratigraphy,                will contribute to reconstructing Asian terrestrial                             paleoclimatology.  By reference to sequences from Pakistan and                  the Miocene oceans, our results will show which terrestrial                     climatologic trends were local, and which may have been                         worldwide in scope.  Development of the vertebrate fossil                       record of the Yushe Basin will provide information on mammalian                 paleobiogeography, with particular relevance to interchange                     events with North America.  Documentation of East Asian faunal                  succession will also provide the biostratigraphic basis                         necessary to define Asian provincial mammal ages.  The proposed                 research is a joint project with Chinese colleagues at the                      IVPP, Beijing, and our institutions jointly contain major                       unstudied fossil collections from Yushe Basin.  This proposal                   is specifically concerned with augmenting the collections of                    micromammals, and constructing a precise magnetochronology, as                  a contribution of data necessary for paleoclimatologic,                         paleobiogeographic, and biochronologic syntheses.",
