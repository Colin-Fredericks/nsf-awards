 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the feasibility of integrating two                different, but related approaches to validation of concurrent software          systems.  Specifically, the integration of the analysis techniques that         are associated with a particular concurrent system modeling scheme,             called constrained expressions, and certain static analysis techniques          for studying synchronization properties of concurrent systems will be           studied.  The complementary nature of the strengths and weaknesses of           these two approaches suggests that their integration will produce               techniques that surpass existing analysis techniques in both power and          practical utility.                                                                                                                                              While the theoretical limitation of general approaches to validation of         concurrent software systems are known to be quite severe, little is             known about how limiting these considerations actually are in practice.         Experience with existing concurrent system analysis techniques is               limited to \"toy\" systems, due to the computational complexity of the            techniques and a lack of automated support.  The demand for reliable            concurrent software requires experimenting more fully with these                techniques to determine how they \"scale-up\" to useful, realistically-           sized systems.",
