 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase I of this SBIR research project has demonstrated the                 technical feasibility of a novel new approach to separation of                  micron sized particles which is based on differences in their                   surface characteristics.  The new method employs an adaptation                  of electrostatic coalescence technology now widely used in                      desalting and dewatering of petroleum feedstocks.  In the Phase                 II effort, ETCI will build a batch operated laboratory test                     cell for use in studies of the physical, chemical and                           electrical parameters of the separator.  Several different                      methods of preparation of feed to the separator will be                         investigated.  Studies of the physics of capture will be                        undertaken using a novel separator built on the stage of a                      microscope.  This work will use thin film deposition technology                 to simulate sources of intense electric capture forces.                         Particle capture will be studied using very small monosized                     spheres made of glass or latex.  In the later stages of the                     Phase II effort, ETCi will build a batch operated laboratory                    scale prototype separator and demonstrate the new separation                    process in beneficiation of micronized coal.                                         The principal investigators are well qualified to conduct                  this research, and a grant is highly recommended for Phase II                   of the Small Business Innovation Research Program Solicitation.",
