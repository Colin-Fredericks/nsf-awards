 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:  In maritime regions at the southern edge of the Arctic,             blanket bogs have grown over large areas of sloping terrain that once           supported forests.  The classic locality for blanket bogs are the               highlands of the British Isles, especially the western coastal region of        Ireland, where blanket peats cover a diversity of substrates.  The              numerous roads that have been built through these blanket bogs provide a        unique cross-sectional profile of the peat and underlying mineral soil          along toposequences covering many kilometers.  The study of such                sequences will allow the determination of whether the blanket peat              originated simultaneously over the entire slope or progressively upslope        by drainage impedance near the base of the slope.                                                                                                               Field work in Ireland will be conducted in close cooperation with               faculty from Trinity College, who have extensive experience with Irish          peatlands.  The effect of Holocene climatic changes on the formation,           development, and stability of these peatlands will be examined along            toposequences where the local effects of changing slope, soil, and              hydrology may be distinguished from the more regional influence of              climate.  In particular the relation of peat growth to prehistoric              forest clearance will be studied, as well as the relationship of peat           erosion to human disturbance over time.                                                                                                                         The U.S. investigators Dr. Paul H. Glaser and Dr. Herbert E. Wright will        collaborate in this research with Dr. W.A. Watts and Dr. Paul Dowding of        Trinity College, Dublin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Relevance:  It is the objective of the U.S.-Ireland Cooperative Science         Program to promote mutually beneficial research cooperation and to              enable U.S. scientists to take advantage of special research                    opportunities.  This award fulfills that objective by enabling                  Dr. Glaser and Dr. Wright to spend two years in collaboration with Irish        scientists with complementary expertise.                                                                                                                                                                                                        Merit:  There is an excellent prospect that the proposed research will          result in a significant contribution to scientific knowledge.  The              principal investigators are respected, productive scientists, who will          be working with other international experts in this field.  The work            plan is sound and the budget is reasonable.
