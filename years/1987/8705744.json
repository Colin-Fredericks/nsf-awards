 "awd_abstract_narration": "The influence of both hydrologic regime and temperature on              production and decomposition processes in low-gradient blackwater               river-floodplain ecosystems will be investigated.  The major goal               of this research is to develop a model to predict the magnitude                 of green plant production, and the carbon (energy) dynamics                     associated with consumer and decomposer activities in these                     ecosystems as a function of abiotic conditions. Results from                    previous NSF-funded research will provide most of the data needed               to build the model.  New field and laboratory research will be                  conducted to supply data that is essential to the model-building                effort, but is unavailable either in extant data sets developed                 by Meyer and Benke or in the literature.                                                For the past six years Meyer and Benke have studied the                 organic carbon dynamics and trophic pathways in the Ogeechchee                  River and its floodplain in the lower coastal plain of Georgia.                 In this new research they will synthesize their previous work in                a model that uses two abiotic \"driving\" variables, \"hydrodynamic                regime\" and temperature to predict a series of biotic                           characteristics of the system including; system primary                         production and respiration, secondary production, and the                       dynamics of bacteria.  If the model is carefully crafted it will                be a useful tool for clearly outlining the possible affects on                  the biology of black water rivers of the southeastern United                    States of disturbances such as damming and dredging, and changes                in thermal-regime like those associated with power-plant cooling.                       New field and laboratory research will address the following            issues: availability of dissolved organic carbon to bacteria in a               river's water column; the role of protozoa in controlling                       bacterial populations through consumption; the importance of                    protozoa as food sources for macroinvertebrates; and the                        importance secondary production in the floodplain.  This new                    research is key to our understanding of the structure and                       function of blackwater rivers.                                                          The research team that will conduct these studies is strong.            Drs. Meyers and Benke are experienced stream ecologists, and Dr.                Weigert, a consultant on the modeling task, is a world-recognized               ecological modeler.  The institutional settings for the project                 will provide excellent scientific interaction and a synergistic                 environment of colleagues and related research.  The Ecosystem                  Studies Program recommends award of this grant.",
