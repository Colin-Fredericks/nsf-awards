 "awd_abstract_narration": "Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction         in the U.S. and the world.  Reinforced masonry construction use is              increasing in moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent          features of economy, fire safety, architectural flexibility and ease of         construction.  The present state of masonry structural analysis and             design, and materials and construction technologies does not enable an          accurate prediction of building behavior under lateral loads such as            seismic loads.  In the U.S., masonry buildings are designed and built           with methods, codes, and standards that rely upon a mixture of working          stress methods, empirical rules, and questionable methods for                   determining allowable stress values.  Masonry is also a complex building        material because of the large number of design and construction                 variables which influence the final products configuration and its              response under seismic loads.  In order to describe the seismic response        of masonry buildings it is necessary to develop the fundamental                 knowledge base to determine basic design methodologies consistent with          safety and economic requirement.                                                                                                                                This research project addresses additional issues and items in the U.S.         Coordinated Program for Masonry Building Research.  These include data          and information exchange between the research components of the program,        use of photogrammetry to supplement conventional displacement                   measurements of in-plane specimens, e.g., shear walls, and communication        and consultation with appropriate code and regulatory groups.  These            objectives will be addressed by meetings between researchers, use of            electronic mail, introduction of photogrammetry to enhance analytical           model development, and establishing liaison with technical groups to            secure their advice regarding the form and content of program design            recommendations.",
