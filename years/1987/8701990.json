 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is based on a unique system of trans-acting           lectin regulatory gene mutations in Dictyostelium.  The goals of the            proposal are to study the role(s) of the lectins in morphogenesis and to        examine some novel aspects of developmental gene regulation.  The disA          and disB mutants fail to express lectin.  The drsA mutation supresses           disB and renders lectin expression constitutive.  Cells carrying the            disA mutation are defective in the morphogenetic processes of streaming         and chemotaxis.  Using an in situ bioassay, Dr. Alexander will determine        the specific effects of the disA, disB, and drsA lectin regulatory gene         mutations on the capacity of the cells to form streams during                   aggregation. The distribution of lectin in the cells of the migrating           slugs will be determined by immunofluorescent techniques.  Dr. Alexander        will determine the effect of the drsA suppressor mutation on the pattern        of transcription of the lectin genes during growth and development.             This will clarify the nature of the phenotypic suppression.  He will            establish whether strains carrying the mutation are sensistive to the           effects of cAMP which is a specific regulator of lectin gene                    transcription in wild type cells.  Genetic methods will be used                 throughout the study to provide properly constructed experimental and           control strains.                                                                    Dr. Alexander is using the simple model system of the cellular slime        mold to study the general developmental problem of trans-acting gene            regulation and its relationship to the morphogenesis of multicellular           organisms.",
