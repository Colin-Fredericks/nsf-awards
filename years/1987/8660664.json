 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to investigate a laser-assisted, thermomechanical         process for cladding of high melting refractory metals on low melting           substrates without melting or damaging the underlying substrates.  This         unique process fuses the clad material to the substrate without gross           melting of the clad layer and substrate.  Careful control of laser              parameters is required to produce proper thermal coupling for                   metallurgical bonding (fusion) of the clad layer with the substrate             material without thermally damaging or melting the substrate.  An               analytical thermal model will be employed to establish the necessary            laser parameter requirements.  In the proposed process, refractory metal        foils will be metallurgically bonded to steel substrates by bringing the        foil into thermal contact with the substrate alloy and using a scanning         laser beam to heat the foil and substrate to the alloy eutectic                 temperature.  When the interface between the foil and                           substrate reaches this temperature, a eutectic liquid will form which           will subsequently resolidify after passage of the scanning laser beam           and form a metallurgical bond between the foil and substrate material.          Spring-loaded rollers will be used to hold the foil in place and a              protective gas shroud will be employed to prevent oxidation of the clad         layer during the laser treatment.  Post cladding treatments consisting          of carburizing and oxidizing furnace treatments will be investigated to         demonstrate the ability to produce refractory metal carbides and oxides         on the clad surface, which should have application where high                   temperature oxidation and wear resistance is required.  The post                cladding treatment is necessary because currently it is not possible to         clad ceramics by direct fusion with a laser.  In this Phase I research          the plan is to produce clads of a variety of refractory metals on               ferrous substrates under laser parameters established by the thermal            model, perform tests to evaluate the integrity of the bond, perform post        cladding carburizing and oxidation treatments and evaluate the oxidation        behavior and wear resistance of these surfaces, and compare the results         to those of a conventional fusion-cladding process.  A Phase II is              planned which will investigate specific applications of interest to             potential Phase III sponsors.  If the research is                               successful, Phase III will investigate commercialization of this                process.                                                                             This process has the potential to produce clads of high melting            refractory metal alloys, carbides and oxides on low melting point               substrates without significant melting or thermal damage to the                 underlying substrate material.  The proposed process provides for               cladding of large surface areas at twice the coverage rate of                   conventional fusion-cladding processes.  The process has potential for          use in conventional industrial and advanced aerospace applications, such        as advanced turbine components, rocket nozzles, high temperature                combustion systems, and chemical process industry systems.",
