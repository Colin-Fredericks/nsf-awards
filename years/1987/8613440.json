 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the second of a two-part research investigation of the behavior         and modeling of partially prestressed concrete beams subjected to               cyclic fatigue loading.  Partially prestressed beams are defined here           as concrete beams reinforced with a combination of prestressed and non-         prestressed reinforcement, designed to allow cracking under full                service load (dead plus live load).  The following aspects of fatigue           will be investigated:  the fatigue life of the members, cracking and            crack width increases under fatigue, and deflection and deflection              increases with the number of cycles of loading.  The first phase of the         research dealt with rectangular sections tested under constant                  amplitude fatigue loading.  The second phase deals with T sections              under variable amplitude fatigue loading simulating real live loads on          bridges.  The research comprises an experimental and an analytical              program.  The experimental variables include three levels of                    reinforcement and, for each, four levels of partial prestressing which          include the two boundaries of full reinforcing and full prestressing.           The total experimental program and the measurements to be recorded are          designed to provide a comprehensive data base on cracking deflections,          and their increases with cyclic fatigue loading.  The analytical                program to predict crack widths and deflections under fatigue is                designed to generate rational models that remain valid at the                   boundaries, represented by fully reinforced and fully prestressed               concrete.",
