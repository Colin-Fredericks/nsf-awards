 "awd_abstract_narration": "The generative entrenchment of an entity is a measure of how much of            the generated system depends upon the presence or activity of that              entity.  It has been demonstrated that entities with higher degrees             of generative entrenchment tend to be more conservative in                      evolutionary changes of such systems.  Models of complex structures             incorporating the effects of generative entrenchment have                       demonstrated their relevance in analyzing and explaining a variety of           developmental and evolutionary phenomena.  Dr. Wimsatt and Mr.                  Jeffrey Shank will extend prior simulations and analyses of a variety           of cases and problems and investigations of a number of results on              the evolution of gene control networks, extending not only their own            work but that of S. A. Kauffman and others to investigate the                   influence of different degrees of generative entrenchment on the                behavior of these networks and their evolution.  Since virtually any            system exhibits differential degrees of generative entrenchment among           its parts and activities, these studies and results have in addition            broad potential application for theoretical, simulation, and                    experimental analyses of developmental programs and their                       significance for evolution, macroevolutionary change, the                       innate-acquired distinction and investigations using it in                      linguistics and cognitive psychology, developmental constraints, and            constraints on the evolution of complex adaptations and scientific              change.",
