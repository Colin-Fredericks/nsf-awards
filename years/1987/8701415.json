 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical tomography, or the application of Radon                    transforms and integral geometry, is in the forefront of                        scientific investigation.  For example, one may cite Cormack's                  Nobel prize work in medical imaging.  Image reconstruction is a                 major scientific and engineering frontier for X-ray tomography,                 emission tomography, electron microscopy, radio astronomy, and                  nuclear magnetic resonance.  Its mathematical foundation in the                 Radon transform and its computational execution via algorithms                  form the subject matter of this proposal.                                               Professor Quinto is an expert in theoretical analysis of the            Radon transform, who holds to the scientific perspectve that                    theoretical progress must go hand in hand with computational                    implemention.  As Professor Quinto has made noteworthy                          contributions in both areas he commands a perspective of the                    entire field.  Thus, the project has a dual thrust.  On the                     theoretical side, Professor Quinto will continue his                            investigation of support theorems for generalized Radon                         transforms.  He will consider such problems for transforms with                 real analytic measures on real analytic submanifolds, including                 limited data theorems for X-ray and k-plane transforms as well as               transforms coming from a double fibration and subgroup invariant                transforms.  In computational work, Professor Quinto will                       complete the implementation of his algorithm to invert the                      exterior Radon transform.  Solution to this problem could allow                 good computer tomographic imaging of the organs around the                      beating heart, of metal in bone, as well as nondestructive                      evaluation of rings or cones such as rocket nozzles.",
