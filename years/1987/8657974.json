 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. N. Gregory Mankiw under the National         Science Foundations's Presidential Young Investigator Awards program.           The objectives of this program are to provide research support to the           Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and engineering           faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the capability of U.S.             academic institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified             science and engineering personnel for academic and industrial research          and teaching.  Dr. Mankiw has already made significant research                 contributions to the field of economics, and he has the potential to            become a leader in academic research and education.                                                                                                             This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research interests         in the study of macroeconomic issues and questions.   Much of Dr.               Mankiw's empirical research involves the application of time-series             analysis and other econometric techniques to a variety of topics.               Among the topics are testing the permanent income hypothesis,                   investigating the term structure of interest rates, studying stock              market volatility, and studying the demand for money and the effect of          real interest rates on consumer spending.  At the theoretical level,            Dr. Mankiw is especially interested in investigating the importance of          capital market imperfections for macroeconomic issues.  In addition, he         will also explore the interaction between macroeconomics and industrial         organization, and the role of imperfect competition in explaining both          price rigidity and the impact of fiscal policy on aggregate                     expenditures.",
