 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Massachusetts at Amherst will create within the               general education context a series of courses that will provide                 education majors with a comprehensive constructivist perspective                concerning science and mathematics instruction.  Because the courses            that will be designed are intended for a broader audience than the              education major, not only will students of other majors reap the                benefits of this epitemological approach, but the education majors will         have the experience of being taught as they should teach.                                                                                                       The individual components of the project consist of the modification            and/or development of (1) a faculty seminar on contructivism, (2) a             basic mathematics course, (3) an undergraduate course on the learning of        mathematics and science, (4) an interdisciplinary science laboratory            course, and (5) an interdisciplinary science course.  To accomplish             these tasks an interdisciplinary team of eight scientists and                   mathematicians, two educators and two teachers will study recent                developments in the theory of science learning and apply them to the            construction of the new courses.",
