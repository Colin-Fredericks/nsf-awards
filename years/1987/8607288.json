Educational and occupational opportunities attendant        to development are known to lower fertility, but the way familial               changes mediate between economic development and fertility is less well         understood. Varying studies have hypothesized that familial changes             could impact upon fertility via inheritance, production patterns, gender        roles, or marriage rules; but a lack of systematic data has made it             difficult to isolate specific effects.                                                                                                                          The investigators will examine two Tamang villages in Nepal, chosen             because they represent markedly different levels of economic                    development. Through extensive fieldwork and sample surveys they will           relate fertility to household and family patterns, and relate the latter        to variations in the larger social organization of the villages. Data           will be collected from multiple cohorts to permit the investigators to          infer how changes have been occuring.",
