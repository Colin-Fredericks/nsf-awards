 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has established that the characteristics of animal              territories can have important implications both for the survival and           breeding success of individual territory-owners and for the population          ecology of the entire species.  For species with seasonal territories,          such as migratory birds, events during the initial period of territory-         acquisition and settlement may have a strong impact on such                     characteristics as territory size, the extent of contact between                adjacent territories, and the density of territorial individuals within         the habitat.  For example, the number of animals simultaneously                 competing for territories during the settlement period may affect               territory sizes, leading to smaller territories in years when many              individuals are competing for space than in years with fewer territorial        contenders.  Similarly, when all of the settlers arrive at one time             (simultaneous settlement), territories may be smaller and more densely          distributed than when the arrival of settlers is spread out over many           days or weeks (sequential settlement).                                                                                                                          Despite the potential importance of settlement behaviors of territorial         animals, there are very few empirical or theoretical studies of these           phenomena.  Dr. Stamps will investigate the process by which settlers           acquire territories using three different, complementary research               techniques:  field experiments, theoretical modeling, and a review of           the literature on settlement.  Field experiments using juvenile lizards         will provide controlled, empirical tests of two processes that have been        hypothesized for territorial species:  (1) a relationship between number        of contenders and territory size, and (2) a relationship between                temporal pattern of settlement (sequential versus simultaneous) and             territory size.  The results of these field studies, in combination with        a review of the scattered literature on settlement, will be used to             develop a set of general computer models of settlement.  In turn, the           results of these models will suggest further directions for field               experimentation.                                                                                                                                                These detailed studies on territorial settlement should be useful to the        many ecologists amd behavioral biologists working with seasonally               territorial species.  In addition, this work is directly relevant to            problems in conservation and the protection of endangered species, many         of which defend territories on a seasonal basis.",
