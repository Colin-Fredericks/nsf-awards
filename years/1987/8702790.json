Scattering attributes to be measured include                            nonreactive scattering angular distributions, angular                           distributions of excited products, and mass-resolved relative                   cross sections for Penning ionization, all carried out over a                   wide range of collision energy.  Penning ionization electron                    spectra are to be measured under conditions of high kinematic                   resolution .  In conjunction with other scattering studies,                     these results will be used to estimate potential surfaces for                   more complicated target molecules, as well as to resolve the                    overall Penning resonance width (lifetime of the complex                        against ionization) into orbital-specific components.                                                                                                           This research program makes an important experimental and                       theoretical contribution to the understanding of the                            fundamental reaction dynamics of chemiionization processes.                     This kind of spectroscopy of excited intermediate states                        addresses the boundary line where differences and similarities                  are likely to be found between neutral-neutral and ion-molecule                 reaction dynamics.",
