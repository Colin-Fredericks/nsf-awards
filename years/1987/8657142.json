 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research activities for this Presidential Young Investigator Award              include two areas within the Construction Engineering and Construction          Automation fields:  (1) Design of construction work systems for the             application of advanced robotics, and (2) application of expert systems         to contractor prequalification process.                                         The first of these research areas focuses on the restructuring of the           traditional industrial construction processes to meet the capabilities          and expose the advantages of automated construction equipment, either           sensor-driven or numerically controlled.  After the design of the new           processes performance of the automated construction equipment may be            estimated through computer simulations of relevant work parameters. The         second research area recently undertaken by the investigator                    pertains to the application of expert system methodology to the                 analysis of construction contractor prequalification processes.  The            work concentrates on the creation and structure of the heuristics-based         body of knowledge and knowledge engineering for a prequalification              expert system.  The investigator is also involved in the development of         a prototype of such a system as an aid to owners and developers.",
