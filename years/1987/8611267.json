 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program addresses the dynamic response of a finite                deformable pile embedded in a half space under harmonic axial                   loading.  The problem will be formulated to yield a Fredholm                    integral equation of the second kind which can be solved with                   suitable Green's functions.  The analytical results will be                     verified by performing scale model experiments in a centrifuge                  with overconsolidated clay and dry cohesionless sand.                                                                                                           Because of the needs in the design of structures to accomodate                  dynamic loading due to causes other than earthquakes such as wind               and machine loads, detailed knowledge of the structural response                is necessary for both safty and economic reasons.  While dynamic                analysis of the structure is reasonably well established, the                   dynamic interaction between the soil and the foundation system is               still open to question.                                                                                                                                         The centrifuge experimental program has a potential to provide                  the necessary data base for the calibration and translation of                  the theoretical analysis into direct engineering applications.                  In addition, the investigation will provide an opportunity to                   examine closely the suitability of various proposed techniques on               dynamic centrifuge modeling, which is still very much in its                    infancy.  The experience gained in this investigation will                      reinforce and expand the current knowledge and technology on the                applications of the centrifuge technique to important areas of                  soil dynamics.",
