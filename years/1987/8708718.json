 "awd_abstract_narration": "Devices which have two states of transparency to light beams have               the potential of being used as two state logic devices.  In this                particular case, these two states are stable to perturbations and               can be changed by an additional optical pulse.  The authors of                  this proposal has been involved in the demonstration of a                       complete set of logic gates and clocked optical flip flops based                on these devices.  The logic gates perform such operations as;                  and, or, and nor functions and the clocked flip flop, which is                  able to operate in two states can be flipped from one to the                    other by an independent pulse (clock).                                                                                                                          A recent comment that optical logic circuits, or rather                         combinations of them, can be simpler in complexity than the                     corresponding electonic equivalents, has been noteworthy and                    alleviates somewhat the criticism of the relatively large size of               the optical components.                                                                                                                                         This research is in an area of current controversy and the author               has proposed highly innovative approaches to optical signal                     processing questions.",
