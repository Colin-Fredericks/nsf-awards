 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with statistical signal processing and image          processing. In particular the PI is developing robust algorithms for            signal parameter estimation in correlated noise and also for the                segmentation of objects from background in noisy images.  Robustness is         important because otherwise optimal schemes can perform poorly in the           presence of statistical outliers.  The goal of robust signal processing         is to maintain the near optimal performance in such a case.                                                                                                     In the parameter estimation area, it is planned to concentrate on               nonlinear estimation in nominally Gaussian noise, making use of                 previously developed results in linear estimation and estimation in             independent and weakly dependent noise.  In the image segmentation area,        the concentration will be on image models that result in robust maximum         a posteriori (MAP) segmentation algorithms.                                     The three reviewers assembled in a panel rated this proposal as                 Excellent.  The investigators career potential is thought to be                 outstanding.  The area of research is quite relevant to the CSP program.        A two-year award of $57924 is highly recommended.  This award should be         funded at $25088 in FY87 and $32836 in FY88.",
