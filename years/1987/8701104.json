 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for basic research in the foundations of                computing.  The major emphasis is in the area of inductive                      inference, the capabilities and limitations of computers to learn               by example.  Several problems dealing with multiple machine                     inference, probabilistic inference, and the complexity of                       inference will be studied.  The problem of inductive inference is               related to the problem of program testing.  The continued                       exportation of ideas and techniques from the field of inductive                 inference to applications concerning the testing of programs will               be a main focus of this research.                                                       Other problems under study include foundational issues                  concerning data flow architectures and implementations of                       applicative programming languages.  Issues and problems                         concerning abstract complexity theory have come out of the                      preliminary work of a previous NSF project. The fundamental                     problem addressed in this research is to classify and otherwise                 delimit the space of complexity measures that apply to a given                  programming system.",
