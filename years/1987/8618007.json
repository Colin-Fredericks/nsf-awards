 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of stronger and tougher structural materials requires a         better understanding between macroscopic measures of ductility and              microstructural mechanisms of the fracture process.  This is a research         topic which is of growing importance as the limitations of continuum            mechanics in the microscale has been recognized.                                                                                                                The research investigates micromechanical modelling of the fracture             process.  The approach involves constitutive descriptions of nucleation,        growth and coalescence of micro voids.  Of particular importance in the         void nucleation by particle decohesion and the mechanisms of void               coalescence.  Large scale numerical analyses will be employed to carry          the micromodelling into the macroscale where comparisons can be made            with observations of ductile behavior in fracture.                                                                                                              The principal investigator has an international reputation for his work         in numerical simulation of ductile fracture.  This research program             provides an opportunity to extend the modelling of the fracture process         into the microscale.
