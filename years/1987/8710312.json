 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cellular slime molds form by the aggregation of amoebae into a              multicellular organism that orients and moves as a unit and ultimately          forms a fruiting body consisting of a stalk supporting a mass of spores.        In the last year Dr. Bonner has shown that NH3 orients (repels) moving          cell masses and it does this by speeding up cells on one side of the            cell mass.  In this proposal he wishes to gain further evidence for the         effect of NH3 on cell speed, especially on separate individual cells, so        that ultimately it will be possible to study how NH3 affects cell speed.        Dr. Bonner has also shown recently that exogenous NH3 affects the               prespore-prestalk ratio rapidly and dramatically.  Again he wishes to           establish this effect on a firm basis and show how the cells can rapidly        shift from the prestalk to the prespore state.                                      There is great interest in morhphgens, signals which direct major           events in development.  NH3 is an example of a compound that affects            both differentiationn and cell movement.",
