 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to conduct a workshop to identify the top            priority topics for innovative research relative to the technology of           the system of manufacturing which should be pursued under a proposed            Strategic Manufacturing Research Initiative.  This workshop was                 recommended by a previous workshop held in 1986 to explore the                  appropriateness of this new initiative.  Eighty to one-hundred                  participants are to be invited, representing industry, academia, and            government.  This workshop will attempt to reach a consensus as to the          top six priority research subjects, ranked in order of priority.  These         research subjects will be the focus of the proposed initiative whose            goal is to move top priority manufacturing technology frontiers ahead in        large jumps through major innovations.  This proposed \"Strategic                Manufacturing Research Initiative\" should lead to improved                      competitiveness of the USA in manufacturing.  The proposed workshop is          expected to provide NSF valuable information to aid in program planning.",
