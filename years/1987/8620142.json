 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed work is to develop theoretically                  a comprehensive mathematical model of the zinc/bromine (Zn/Br2)                 cell which will aid designers in the development of this                        battery.  The Zn/Br2  flow battery has been receiving increased                 interest in recent years as a durable, rechargeable storage                     battery for use as a peak levelling device by utility                           companies.  The need in the utility industry for some means to                  reduce the surge of the daily electrical load demand on                         generating facilities has existed for many years.  Demand is                    high during the daytime when schools, factories, and businesses                 are open whereas during the night and early morning hours the                   demand is at a minimum.  Generating facilities need be                          continuously operated at 100% of their rated power to be most                   cost-effective.  To achieve this 100% operation and at the same                 time satisfy cyclic demand, peak shaving (load levelling)                       devices, such as the Zn/Br2 battery, must be employed.                                                                                                          The Zn/Br2 battery has several attractive features for use as a                 shaving device.  Batteries are compact and truckable and                        therefore can be optimally located at distributed sites near                    substations to yield a decrease in transmission line costs.  In                 case of problems such as transmission line outages the                          batteries can supply at least enough power for vital loads in                   the area such as hospitals. The Zn/Br2 battery is relatively                    efficient, inexpensive, and clean compared to the conventional                  load levelling devices, coal fired units and gas turbines.                      This model development is based on the conservation of mass and                 charge supplemented by a transport equation, which includes a                   migration term for charged species in an electric field, and an                 electrode kinetic expression.  The proposed model will be                       developed by augmenting a previously published model to include                 a porous layer on the bromine electrode, zinc complexation,                     predictions for discharge mode, a second bromine-rich phase,                    time dependence, and a recirculation system.  Model parameters,                 kinetic and thermodynamic, will be estimated from those used in                 previous work and by comparing model predictions with                           experimental data in the literature.  Also, the model will be                   used to investigate the effects of cell dimensions, physical                    parameters such as the void fractions of the porous regions,                    and operating conditions on cell performance.   The resulting                   model will be a set of algebraic and three dimensional partial                  differential equations, two dimensional in space and one                        dimensional in time.  The model development should lead to a                    better understanding of the physical phenomena which affect the                 performance of eletrochemical cells in general.",
