 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal the PI will address physiolgical and                       structural questions concerning the contribution of calcium (Ca)                to three specific plant systems: 1) cytokinin-induced bud                       formation in Funaria, 2) phytochrome-stimulated spore germination               in Onoclea, and 3) germination and pollen tube growth in                        Tradescantia and Nicotiana. In the physiolgical studies he will                 determine if the intracellular free Ca changes in response to a                 stimulus. The kinetics of Ca changes will be examined micro-                    spectrophotometrically in target cells of Funaria that have been                microinjected with the absorbant Ca-indicator dye arsenazo-III.                 Particular attention will also be given to the role of the                      phosphatidyl inositol (PI) cycle in mediating development.                      Pharmacological agents that enhance or inhibit portions of the PI               cycle will be tested for their effect on development. Structural                studies will focus on cytoskeletal and membrane components. The                 ability of fluxes in Ca to modify these components will be                      analyzed at the light microscope level using fluorescent stains                 and antibodies, and at the electron microscope level using                      material that has been prepared by a rapid freeze fixation method,              in which cytoplasmic structure is preserved with exceptional                    fidelity.                                                                                                                                                            Calcium ions act as intracellular messengers in many                       organisms. They are thought to couple the stimulus to the response              and thus to mediate or trigger many important developmental                     events. The role of calcium ions as intracellular messengers has                not been as well studied in plants. These studies will contribute               to an understanding of the role of Ca in stimulus/response                      coupling in plants.",
