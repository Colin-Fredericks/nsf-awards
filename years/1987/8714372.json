 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with face seal performance under conditions           where a phase change may take place.   The program is primarily                 theoretical, but extensive use is made of existing data, industrial             experience and ongoing experiments at NASA Lewis,                               This project will develop more complete and accurate analytical                 models for steady and transient behavior of face seals and for their            stability analyses under a wide variety of practical operating                  conditions.                                                                     Current industrial design of high pressure pumps and                            rotating machinery is moving in a direction where two-phase                     conditions are definitely occurring in the seal gap as examples,                high pressure water pumps and cryogenic liquid pumps.  Moreover, in             very simple common operating seals the two-phase condition is often             present and may dominate the behavior and performance of the seal.  A           thorough understanding is essential for proper design under such                conditions.",
