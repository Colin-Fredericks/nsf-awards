The focus          of the project is on instruction in experimental design and research            methods with applications in the areas of learning, cognition and               sensation and perception.  The equipment requested will provide for a           state of the art experimental psychology laboratory.  The equipment             includes a computer controlled operant conditioning system with eight           student lab stations.  This equipment will permit students to conduct           experiments in a variety of basic learning processes.  Also requested           are twelve personal computers which will provide the means for                  conducting a number of experiments in perception, cognition and                 learning.  The equipment will facilitate instruction by giving students         first hand experience with a variety of experimental research methods in        scientific psychology.",
