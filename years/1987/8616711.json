 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amphipods are crustaceans that have evolved a variety of                   feeding behavior.  An analysis of caprellid amphipods is proposed               to explore the relationships between body parts involved in                     feeding and digestion, and the feeding behavior of the animal.                  Data would come from two sources: videotaping appendage motion                  during filtering, scraping, scavenging and predation, and                       morphologic analysis of whole body, appendages and foregut with                 light and scanning microscopy.  Data would be collected and                     analyzed using a microcomputer-based image analysis system.                        The proposed research would increase our understanding of                    crustacean biology and of how morphology and behavior are related               in evolution.  The research plan will serve as a model for the                  use of computer-based image analysis in functional morphology                   research, and will greatly enhance the undergraduate experience                 of two students working with Dr. Caine.",
