 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative: Knowledge on solids circulation, mixing and their                    relation to heat transfer in a fluidized bed is of critical                     importance to the design of fluidized bed combustors and chemical               reactors and to the development of a rational procedure for scale-              up.  To date systematic, quantitative data on the subject have been             limited.  Accordingly, it is proposed to design and build a                     radioactive particle tracking facility in order to study the                    hydrodynamics, mixing, segregation and heat transfer in atmospheric             and pressurized fluidized beds.  This versatile facility makes use of           radioactive tracer particles which are dynamically identical to the             particles to be studied.                                                                                                                                        The motion of the tracer particles is tracked by an array of                    scintillation detectors and analyzed by an on-line computer.  The               solids velocity and occurrence probability of any particular                    species of particles can be obtained by using a tracer which                    matches their density, size, and shape.  The results are expected               to contribute to the formulation of the scaling laws for fluidized              bed design.  The proposed investigation will include: (1)                       Construction of a 12-inch diameter bed, (2) Measurements of mean                and fluctuating components of solids motion, (3) Measurements of                particle size and density segregation, (4) Measurements of solids               mixing, (5) Influence of bed hydrodynamics on heat transfer to or from          immersed surfaces and (6) Measurements of the hydrodynamics of solids           in pressurized fluidized beds.",
