 "awd_abstract_narration": "Assimilation of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks by                  basalt magma is an unavoidable consequence of volcanic activity,                and the presence of xenoliths (foreign rock fragments) in ocean                 island and propagating ocean rifts is evidence that assimilation                does occur during oceanic volcanism.  The process of assimilation               is poorly understood and whether melting, disintegration, or                    diffusion into or out of the material being assimilated is the                  dominant process will depend on the type of material being                      assimilated, on the kinetics of magma interaction with that                     material, and on the temperature and composition of the magma.                  The experiments supported here will investigate the first of                    these problems; the melting, disintegration, or diffusion from                  various mantle minerals and alteration minerals, when placed in                 contact with molten basalt.  The products of the experiments will               be chemically analyzed by electron microprobe and isotope                       dilution mass spectrometry.  Preliminary experiments have                       produced unexpected and interesting results, and further work                   will determine the importance of assimulation to the major and                  trace element chemistry of seamount, ocean island, and                          propagating rift basalts.  This project will be supported at                    $120,470 for 2 years.",
