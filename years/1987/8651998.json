 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Teacher Enhancement project will increase the expertise of 20 high         school biology teachers per year in the areas of biotechnology,                 biological research, problem solving and scientific writing.  These             twenty teachers will return to their schools, following a 6-week summer         program, to enrich their instructional program, to provide inservice            experiences for their colleagues, and to exert leadership in curriculum         reform and laboratory development.  Teachers will be selected from              school districts in the upper midwestern states of Minnesota, Wisconsin,        Iowa, North and South Dakota.  Follow-up activities will assist the             teachers in both their instructional modifications and leadership               activities.                                                                                                                                                     Teachers selected meet in the spring to consider their summer research          project with the appropriate college faculty.  The project is planned           and partially developed by the time they arrive for the summer.  During         the summer, in addition to working on their project, they attend                seminars on contemporary topics in biology and develop activities for           their own classrooms related to both the research activities and                seminars.  In addition, they will develop the outline for the inservice         activities which they will conduct.  During the academic year,                  university staff will make visits to the participant's schools and              conferences will be held at the University or other appropriate settings        to further the knowledge of teachers or to report research results.                                                                                             The proposal is an outgrowth of an honors workshop for high school              teachers conducted in the past two years.  The PI is well-qualified to          conduct the program, being a research biologist, but also having prior          experience in directing teacher development activities.  The other staff        are research biologists from the University.  Experts in biotechnology          from the private sector will be used as speakers and consultants.",
