 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this project a prototype derivation system for scientific                 programs, designed to facilitate the production of efficient                    implementations on parallel processors will be developed.  The system           will be based upon a \"wide-spectrum\" language that supports all phases          of the software development process including specification, design,            prototyping, optimization, testing, debugging and maintenance.                                                                                                  Building on their previous work on the scientific programming systems -          the R programming environment, the R validation system, the Russell            compiler and the PFC system for automatic detection of parallelsism -           the project team will implement a sophisticated programming environment         to provide automatic or semi-automatic support for program                      transformation and refinement at all stages of the derivation process.          It will be possible to augment the environment's standard                       transformation support by producing libraries of design rules written           in the wide-spectrum language itself and mechanisms for validation of           refinement steps will be built in at every level.                                                                                                               To take advantage of the existing base of scientific software, the              system will support the integration of FORTRAN subprograms into                 programs written in the wide-spectrum language.  Furthermore, it will           be possible to translate a low-level dialect of the language to FORTRAN         77, extended by the inclusion of primitives for the explicit                    specification of parallelism.  The resulting FORTRAN program, typically         consisting of many small procedures, can be optimized to high                   efficiency using interprocedural analysis and optimization techniques           developed for the R project.",
