 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lack of detailed geophysical constraints on the                     structure of mid-ocean ridges has severely limited efforts to                   develop a comprehensive understanding of the processes forming                  the oceanic crust.  The generation of new oceanic crust and                     lithosphere at accretionary plate boundaries is fundamental to                  plate tectonic theory.  Current geological models for the crustal               generation process include the existence of shallow crustal magma               chamgers.  Despite the growing support for the models, data                     defining both the existence and geometry of axial magma chambers                remain controversial.                                                                   This project is a multichannel seismic investigation between            two well-studied segments of the East Pacific Rise at 9 degrees                 north and 13 degrees north.  The volcanic petrology has been                    examined through a series of dredging and ALVIN dive programs.                  The tectonic and structural fabric has been examined with side                  scan sonar and multibeam bathymetry.  Existing seismic refraction               data indicate the presence of an axial low velocity zone,                       presumably associated with a magma chamber beneath the rise                     crest.                                                                                  The objective of the present award is to complete the                   analysis and interpretation of this unique data set.  Specific                  problems to be addressed include:  1)  The physical properties of               the material below the magma chamber reflector; 2)  the shape of                the magma chamber walls and floor; 3)  the development of ocean                 crustal structure during its first few million years; 4)  the                   effect of basement morphology of recorded seismic reflections;                  and 5)  variations in magma chamber characteristics along the                   rise axis.",
