The objective of the symposium is to                       consider several important topics such as magnetics in                          bioseparation and treatment of tumors, separation and control of                viruses, membrane filtration, flocculation of microorganisms,                   biological contamination and its control, etc., at an                           informaive, creative and multidisciplinary forum.  The technical                program will contain plenary lectures, invited and contributed                  papers from research centers and laboratories of a number of                    leading academic, commercial, and governmental organizations in                 biotechnology, medicine, and pharmaceuticals.  A workshop to                    identify the related emerging issues, further research topics                   and new applications will also be held. Workshop proceedings                    will be widely distributed.
