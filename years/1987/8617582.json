 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to examine how                well the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community                   Climate Model treats the planetary distribution of heating in its               climate simulations.  A series of sophisticated diagnostic tools                will be employed by the PI who is a world leader in this kind of                research.  Proper specification of heating distributions are of                 great importance in climate modeling and so this research treats                a subject primary to advancements in climate understanding and                  prediction.                                                                             Heat energy from the sun is received at the earth's surface             and within the earth's atmosphere non-uniformly in space, in                    particular from equator to poles, but also around a latitude                    circle because of ocean and land distributions.  Our weather and                climate respond to these distributions in solar heating.  In                    order to successfully simulate and predict climate in computer                  models one must represent them in terms of heating functions as                 accurately as possible.                                                                 For model simulation and prediction of climate this is a                necessary first step.  It is also a difficult task because of the               non-linear interactions between solar radiation and atmospheric                 moisture and trace gases, surface boundary conditions, and                      ultimately terrestrial radiation retransmitted to the atmosphere                and to space.  Research of this kind is key to understanding the                climate system.",
