 "awd_abstract_narration": "The geologic range of the mammalian order Multituberculata              is from the Late Triassic to early Oligocene (approximately 195                 to 35 million years ago); the group is therefore the longest-                   lived order of mammals known.  In addition to their great                       longevity, multituberculates constituted one of the most abundant               and diverse mammal groups during the Late Cretaceous and                        Paleocene (from approximately 75 to 58 million years ago).                      Almost nothing, however, is known about the evolutionary history                of multituberculates from the Late Jurassic to the early Late                   Cretaceous, an interval of over 50 million years.  It is during                 this interval that two of the three major subgroups of                          multituberculates arose.                                                                Although a large collection of North American                           multituberculates of Early Cretaceous age has been known for over               35 years, it has never been described.  This collection, from                   north-central Texas, comprises approximately 165 isolated teeth                 and lies roughly in the middle of the 50 million year gap in our                knowledge of multituberculate evolution.  Recent field work in                  south-central Montana has revealed the presence of another Early                Cretaceous multituberculate-bearing locality in western North                   America.  The objectives of the research proposed here are                      therefore as follows: 1) to describe the collection of                          multituberculates from Texas and to evaluate their phylogenetic                 relationships to other multituberculates; 2) to conduct field                   work at the new locality in Montana in an attempt to find                       additional multituberculate specimens from this crucial interval                of time but from a different geographic region within North                     America; and 3) to perform a detailed analysis of dental function               and jaw movement of Early Cretaceous multituberculates to                       determine their dietary proclivities.",
