 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John Sutherland has proposed the organization of a                  workshop meeting to discuss important new research opportunities                and initiatives in coastal marine ecology.  Participation will                  include both long-standing leaders in benthic ecology, as well as               some of the creative young scientists who are shaping the future                of the discipline.  This area of research is changing rapidly                   with the collaboration of scientists from various disciplinary                  backgrounds, all leading to much increased understanding of how                 living organisms interact with one another and their physical                   setting to determine the structure, functioning, development, and               diversity of natural communities in the coastal regions of our                  nation and world.  Many of these collaborative investigations are               beginning to provide basic scientific knowledge that can be                     useful in the development of marine biotechnologies, for example,               studies on how plant chemical defense compounds (natural                        herbicides) act to deter herbivores.                                                    Dr. Sutherland is a leading figure in coastal marine                    ecology.  He has been a productive research scientist with                      funding from the Biological Oceanography Program.  The Program                  recommends support for the proposed workshop at $10,000.",
