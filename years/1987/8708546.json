This                 project will investigate aspects of these processes by examining                the chemistry and isotope geochemistry of igneous rocks associ-                 ated with the two major tectonic events in the region, the                      Taconic and Acadian orogenies.  Between ~460-430 Ma ago, a                      bimodal volcanic sequence and two distinct calcalkaline plutonic                series were emplaced in an island-arc and Andean-type continental               margin, presently known as the Bronson Hill Anticlinorium, during               the closure of the Iapetus ocean.  Detailed trace element and Sr,               Nd- and Pb- isotope studies of these rocks can resolve the                      relative roles of mantle and crustal components involved in                     magmagenesis.  In rocks whose crustal contributions are high, Nd                and Pb isotope studies combined with ongoing U-Pb zircon work can               reveal the nature and age of underlying and hitherto hidden                     continental crust.  The results of this study will constrain                    models dealing with head and mass transfer from the mantle and                  within the crust during orogenic episodes.",
