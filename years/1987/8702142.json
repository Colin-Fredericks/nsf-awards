 "awd_abstract_narration": "Luteinizing hormone (LH) and chorionic gonadotropin regulate                                                                                               the secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum.  Sheep                    luteal cells will be used for studying physical events                          accompanying human chorionic gonadotropin or ovine luteinizing                  hormone binding to the luteinizing hormone receptor.  The goals                 of this research are to study luteinizing hormone receptor                      aggregation, distribution, and molecular motions on sheep luteal                cells during the luteal phase of the estrous cycle and to study                 how the physical behavior of the receptor is affected by its                    interactions with the hormones.  First, LH receptor aggregation                 will be examined on viable cells before and after hormone binding                                                                                               using fluorescence energy transfer and measurements of LH                       receptor rotational motions.  Receptor distribution will be                     examined using computer-enhanced low light microscopy and                       electron microscopy.  Second, the roles of the subunits of the                  hormones and of their associated carbohydrates in modifying                     lateral and rotational motions of hormone-occupied LH receptors                 will be determined.  Third, cytoskeletal interactions with the LH                                                                                               receptor before and after hormone binding will be characterized.                                                                                                Finally, interactions of the hormone-occupied LH receptor with                  other luteal cell membrane proteins will be examined.                                Progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum is required to                                                                                               maintain uterine conditions for embryonic development in early                  pregnancy. LH and chorionic gonadotropin regulate progesterone                  secretion, but much remains to be learned about their cellular                  mechanisms of action.  The proposed biophysical characterization                of hormone-occupied receptors on the membranes of luteal cells                  and an analysis of the interactions of the hormone-receptor                     complex with other plasma membrane constituents is a first step                 in understanding the mechanisms by which these hormones regulate                luteal cell function.",
