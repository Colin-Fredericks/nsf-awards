 "awd_abstract_narration": "This analysis of the hydrographic structure of the Greenland Sea is a           part of a five-year international program of integrated oceanographic           research in the Norwegian and Greenland Seas whose objective is to              quantify the environmental effects that are active in the production            of intermediate and deep water masses.  The data base for this project          is a series of oceanographic cruises, the first of which will take              place in the summer of 1987 on board the West German research vessel            POLARSTERN.  That cruise will focus on the western Greenland Sea, with          sufficient coverage on the eastern side to allow for overlapping of             sections that will be taken by other participants in the program.  A            second major thrust of the project is to begin a shore-based analysis           of both new and existing data for the examination of the regional               circulation and vertical structure, and to prepare a volumetric census          of water masses.",
