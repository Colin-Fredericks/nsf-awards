 "awd_abstract_narration": "Baby painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) are unlike the young                of most other turtles, in that painted turtles hatch from their                 eggs in late summer or early autumn but seldom emerge from their                nest until the following spring.  Because the nest itself is                    shallow, turtles hatching at northerly localities presumably must               survive exposure to freezing temperatures over the course of                    winter.  Unfortunately, few measurements have been made of                      environmental conditions inside nests of painted turtles during                 winter, so the preceding statement is based largely on                          conjecture.  A viable alternative explanation is that hatchlings                survive only in nests situated in relatively warm micro-                        environments (e.g., beneath insulative snow cover, on south-                    facing hillsides) and that survivors emerging from nests in the                 spring have not been exposed to freezing temperatures.                               This research will be aimed at determining whether                         temperatures inside nests of painted turtles actually fall to                   levels in winter that are low enough to cause body fluids to                    freeze in other terrestrial vertebrates.  If hatchlings do,                     indeed, survive exposure to low temperatures, later investigation               will focus on whether survival depends on a capacity for animals                to withstand supercooling or whether it is based on an ability                  for them to sustain partial freezing of body water.  The research               may ultimately demonstrate the existence of a unique                            physiological adaption to winter conditions.",
