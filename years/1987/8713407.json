 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action would provide funds for the completion of two               experiments supported through NSF grant PHY85-09316.  Both                      experiments use accelerator facilities at Fermilab and involve                  collaborators from other institutions.                                                  The first experiment, E580, was approved to be scheduled for            800 hours of data taking in 1978.  Data was taken in 1980 and                   several papers have since appeared from this experiment.  This                  work will be completed by a graduate student at Notre Dame who                  will write his doctoral thesis on the scattering process in which               a pion diffractively dissociates into three pions.                                      The second experiment, E743, was designed to study short                lived particles containing the c-quark.  A high resolution bubble               chamber was exposed to a beam of 800 GeV protons.  The principal                investigator will complete his contributions activities in                      progress to measure lifetimes and the production dynamics of                    particles containing c-quarks.",
