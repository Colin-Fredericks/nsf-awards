 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a recommendation to support research to characterize the removal        of trace metals from dilute aqueous solutions by biologically active            films in reactors that are designed to treat wastewater and films that          develop on surfaces submerged in natural bodies of water.  The metals to        be studied are cadmium and lead.  Results of this research are likely to        be used in improving the engineering design and operation of biofilm            reactors and in assessing the impact that trace concentrations of metals        remaining in effluent will have on natural aquatic eco systems.  In a           previous project under NSF Grant No. 8304120, the investigators examined        trace metal microbial interactions by film-forming, marine organisms.           Results of this prior work will be applied to the objectives of the             current project.                                                                                                                                                The objectives of this project are consistent with those of the                 Environmental Engineering Program.  The qualifications of the                   investigators are appropriate for the work to be done.  This project            will be conducted in a collaborative effort by three co-investigators           representing capabilities in environmental engineering, chemical                engineering and microbiology.                                                                                                                                   Award is recommended as a three-year Continuing Grant the initial               increment of which is in the amount of $139,806 for 12 months staring on        February 1, 1987.",
