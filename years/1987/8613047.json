 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vast collections of fragile art objects and artifacts held by               museums in moderate and high seismic risk regions of the country are            vulnerable to damage or destruction should a significant earthquake             occur.  The museum community is beginning to address the problem of             seismic protection of fragile artifacts on exhibit and in shortage.             There are very few publications that provide guidance to museum                 professionals that take into consideration the special requirements for         dealing with seismic risks.                                                                                                                                     Research work has been completed to identify existing protection methods        and to develop new and improved methods that meet the criteria of the           museum community for protection from seismic events.  Work was done to          determine the advantages, disadvantages, relative effectiveness, and            limitations of the different protection methods.  This research project         will complete research necessary to establish guidelines for protecting         museum artifacts from earthquake damage and prepare documentation that          can be used for a guide useful to the museum community.  Methods will be        developed and tested that protect artifacts on display and in storage           from earthquake damage.  Dissemination of the research results will be          done in cooperation with the user community.                                                                                                                    An award is recommended for this one year complete research project.            The principal investigator is highly qualified to conduct the research          and the institution provides excellent support facilities.",
