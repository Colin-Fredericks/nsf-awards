 "awd_abstract_narration": "The availability of the computer as a tool for research has enabled             mathematicians to make great progress in understanding chaotic behavior         in nature.  The resulting body of knowledge is fascinating not only             because it models physical phenomena but also because it leads to               colorful, visually appealing, geometric forms.  Moreover, the knowledge         of mathematics required to explore these ideas is minimal.  Anyone with         an understanding of elementary algebra and access to a modest                   microcomputer can create computer images of chaotic sets and can study          their structure.                                                                                                                                                This project will create a textbook that will make these ideas and              activities available for secondary school students.  The book will              introduce students to the ideas of complex dynamics, fractals, and              chaos.  It will include simple computer programs that will enable               students to generate their own fractal images.  Several very high               resolution computer generated images will be featured in the book, many         in color.  Each chapter will contain a series of projects or exercises          designed to involve students in the exploration of the relevant                 mathematics.                                                                                                                                                    The book will be field tested at sites in Massachusetts, Virginia, and          Minnesota.  It will be published by a commercial publisher.                                                                                                     The project director, Robert Devaney, is a well known researcher in the         field of complex dynamics.",
