 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-term (27-year) data sets on patterns of primary and                secondary productivity and nutrient cycling dynamics for Castle                 Lake and Lake Tahoe, California, will be analyzed to determine                  the relative importance of biotic recycling of nutrients and the                supply of \"new\" nutrients in controlling lake productivity.  In                 addition, a limited set of measurements at the two lakes will be                made to continue the long-term data sets.                                               The major product of this new research will be a conceptual             model of factors that control primary and secondary production in               the two California lakes.  This model will be useful for                        designing further scientific research.  As important, the model                 will be useful for developing future management strategies for                  large lake systems that are located in watersheds undergoing land               use changes such as resort development.                                                 Dr. Goldman and his colleagues have long records of doing               high quality science and using this science to help solve                       societal problems.  The institutional support for the research is               excellent.  The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends award of                   this grant.",
