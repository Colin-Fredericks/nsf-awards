 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Equipment Grant is for acquisition of         computer equipment compatible with a microvax II for a new research             group for computational gaseous electronics being established under             the direction of Professor Kushner.  The purpose of this group is to            computationally investigate multidimensional and transient phenomena            in low temperature, highly collisional plasmas.  These plasmas are              applied to technologically important devices such as gas lasers,                plasma processing reactors, lighting sources (plasma displays), MHD,            and pulse power switches.  There are three research projects in                 progress in Professor Kushner's group during which large computer               simulation programs are being developed:  1) modeling plasma                    deposition and surface morphology of amorphous silicon, 2) simulation           of surface flashover discharges on spacecraft, and 3) modeling of               fission fragment pumped excimer lasers.  Research has also been                 proposed to investigate the flow of plasma through constrictions (as            applied to thyratrons), a microwave controlled opening switch, and              plasma instabilities initiated by particulate matter in gas                     discharges.",
