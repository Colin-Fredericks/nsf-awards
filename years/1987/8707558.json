 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of Dr. Marshak's project is to understand the                  molecular mechanisms controlling the formation of neurites during               the growth factor, neurites during growth and differentiation of                stimulation of neurite extension by the polypeptide growth                      factor, neurite extension factor (NEF), and on the molecular                    events that result in the establishment of neuriteic connections.               NEF is an acidic protein of mass 21,010, whose complete primary                 structure has been elucidated.  NEF stimulates neurite outgrowth                from central neurons and neuroblastoma cells, but not from                      peripheral neurons.  Thus, NEF is the first well-characterized,                 soluble, polypeptide differentiation factor for the central                     nervous system.  NEF appears to be secreted from astrocyutes, and               to act on post-mitotic neurons.  A receptor for NEF on cerebral                 cortical neuronal cell membrane fractions has been demonstrated,                and appears to be specific and of high affinity.  The specific                  objectives of the project are: 1) to further characterize the                   receptor for NEF; 2) To identify the mechanism of signal                        transduction for NEF; expression of proteins involved in neurite                formation, including cytoskeletal proteins.  As models of the                   central nervous system, these experiments will employ primary                   chick embryo cerebral cortical neurons and mouse neuroblastoma.                                                                                                 The proposed project is a multi-disciplinary one involving                      protein biochemistry and cellular neurobiology, as they relate to               cellular development and the interactions between cells.  This                  research is anticipated to yield information of value to studies                of disorders in cellular growth and differentiation.",
