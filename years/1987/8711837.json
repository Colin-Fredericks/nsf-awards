 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many species of birds, song is important in maintaining a territory          and attracting a mate.  However, in other species, song may also allow          members of cooperative groups to integrate the opposing demands of              competing with group members for breeding opportunities and                     collaborating with them to survive.                                                                                                                             The Australian magpie (\u001b-\u0001Gymnorhina tibicen\u001b-) is a cooperatively              breeding songbird.  In some areas, magpies live in male-female pairs,           like most other songbirds.  In other areas, however, magpies live in            groups of 2 to 8 birds.  Each group communally defends a large territory        year-round. All magpies, of both sexes, sing communally in many                 situations ranging from territorial defense to nest-building.                                                                                                   The research to be conducted by Drs. Brown and Farabaugh will focus on          several aspects of the role of song in social interactions.  First, they        will test the hypothesis that song is used in recognition of group              members.  Second, they will compare vocal imitation and sharing of songs        within groups versus pairs of magpies, to investigate whether or not            song-sharing contributes to social cohesion.  Third, by comparing               behavior accompanying song within groups versus pairs, they will                investigate the role of song in social interactions.                                                                                                            This research project offers an important opportunity for uncovering            previously unknown functions of bird song.",
