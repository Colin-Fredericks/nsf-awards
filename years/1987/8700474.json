 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for a continuation of work to develop optical                  wave guidelines for high rate optical signal processing.  The                   previous work led to the development of a nonlinear optical                     interferometer capable of performing logical functions at,                      potentially, extremely high rates.  The proposed project seeks to  use          this interferometer (or a suitably modified version of it) to  perform          fundamental quantum measurements, in particular, to                             provide for lossless taps on light propagation in an adjacent                   fiber guide.                                                                                                                                                    Although it is hard to say how wide spread the application of the               proposed research will be, it is certain that the outcome of this               research will broaden the understanding of how to make                          measurements on quantum systems without substantially altering the              features one is trying to observe.                                                                                                                              The PI is considered to be extremely well qualified to carry out  the           proposed research and I recommend funding of this project for  three            years in accordance with the budget submitted with the                          proposal.",
