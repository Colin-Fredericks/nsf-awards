 "awd_abstract_narration": "3He accumulates in minerals exposed at the earth's surface                 because cosmic rays cause spallation of smaller nuclei from                     target nuclei.  Because the cosmic ray flux and production                      rates are fairly well constrained and the cosmogonic component                  of 3He in minerals can be determined, measurement of 3He and                    4He abundances in minerals at the earth's surface can be used                   to calculate the exposure ages of minerals.  This knowledge can                 be used to study a variety of processes that take place at the                  earth's surface on a time scale of 100 years to several million                 years.                                                                               Measurements involve the 3He and 4He abundances in rocks                   whose exposure ages are fairly well constrained by geologic                     evidence and by conventional K-Ar or 14C dating methods.                        Samples will be cored from glaciated surfaces (Sierras) and                     recent Lava flows (W. United States, Hawaii).  In the Scripps                   Isotopic Laboratory, researchers will test radiogenic gas                       separation techniques and the possible efficacy of neon for                     radiogenic dating.                                                                    Knowledge of the exposure age of surfaces will have                       important applications in Quaternary stratigraphy and                           geomorphology, in the study of chemical and mechanical erosion                  rates, and may have applications to understanding seismic                       recurrences and other mass movement phenomena.",
