 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the design of interactive tools                 and procedures through which a user can enhance the effectiveness               of automatic information retrieval.  It includes the development                of a graphic interface for the SMART information retrieval system               and the experimental evaluation of the resulting system in such                 tasks as query expansion and reformulation, searching of clustered              document collections, and the construction of knowledge bases with              user-supplied information.  Use of an enhanced SMART system with                its existing evaluation packages makes it possible to compare the               results of highly interactive searches with results obtained from               better known methods of information retrieval.                                                                                                                  The principal investigator enjoys an international reputation as a              productive scientist and a pioneer in the experimental analysis of              information retrieval.  He is supported by Karen Sparck Jones of                the University of Cambridge, a noted authority on the design of                 retrieval experiments, and Donald Crouch of Tulane University, who              has recently specialized in the graphical representation of                     information.",
