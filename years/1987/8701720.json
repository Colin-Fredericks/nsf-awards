 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Stuiver, together with colleagues from                   other laboratories to conduct radiocarbon determinations on a                   series of  German and Irish oak trees which date from between ca.               2500 and 5200 B.C. The absolute ages of tree rings within this                  sample are independently determined through the construction of                 an annual ring chronology which starts at the present and works                 back into the past. With these new determinations, Dr. Stuiver                  will construct a series of calibrations which will allow the                    accurate conversion of radiocarbon years into true age. Although                the two are closely correlated they are not identical. Using this               technique calibrations have been established from the present                   back to 2500 B.C. and this project will extend this by                          approximately another 2700 years.                                                                                                                               Because of the complicated relationship between \"radiocarbon age\"               and \"true age\" sometimes materials with different true ages can                 give the same radiocarbon age. At some radiocarbon ages, the                    possible range of true ages can be smaller and at others larger.                For archaeologists these discrepencies can be extremely important               when comparisons are made from one culture area to another. For                 the more recent period Stuiver's calibration curve allows one to                correct for this and it is important that this be extended                      further back in time.                                                                                                                                           This research is important not only to archaeologists but to                    astronomers and geophysicists since the data provides information               about changes in both solar radiation and in the earth's magnetic               field.",
