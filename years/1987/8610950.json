 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the United States there exists an abundance of unreinforced masonry          buildings.  During past earthquakes, such buildings have suffered major         structural damage and often collapsed.  Current repair and                      rehabilitation techniques for unreinforced masonry buildings are                generally costly and disturb the occupancy and architectural features of        the buildings.                                                                                                                                                  This research project will examine a repair and rehabilitation technique        that eliminates the above-noted problems.  In the research, unreinforoed        brick masonry walls are strengthened by coring or drilling holes through        the center of the unreinforced brick masonry walls followed by the              placement of reinforcement in the drilled hole, and filling the hole and        adjoining voids with various types of grouts.  This research will               concentrate on fullscale field tests to determine structural and                economic feasibility.  The research will aid in future development of           needed technology in the rehabilitation and strengthening of both               historical and non-historical buildings against future seismic loads.                                                                                           The principal investigator is highly qualified to conduct the research          project and an award is recommended for the first year of the two-year          complete project.  The institution provides excellent support                   facilities.",
