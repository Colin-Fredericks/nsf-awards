 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major element in this project is an intensive six-week summer               workshop for 24 high school teachers of chemistry and physical science          drawn primarily from Kentucky.  The workshop will consist of formal             chemistry coursework in the fundamentals of chemistry, with particular          emphasis on inorganic chemistry, laboratory work, the development of            demonstrations, computer assisted instruction, and a component focussing        on the teaching of science in secondary schools.  Follow-up activities          in the academic year include monthly meetings of groups of 4-7                  participants and four general meetings of all participants.  The project        will be conducted in each of two project years, with a separate set of          participants in each year.                                                                                                                                      Teachers having the least formal or poorest training in chemistry will          be given top priority in the selection process.  Priority will also be          given to those who have not had recent experience or instruction                updating their knowledge of the discipline.  Individual commitment will         be assessed by telephone interviews with the applicants, and                    institutional support will be generated through a special conference for        the principals of the teacher/participants.                                                                                                                     Participants will receive graduate credit in both chemistry and                 education.  Except for the commuters, participants will be housed at the        site of the workshop, Murray State University.  Room and board and a            weekly stipend of $200 per teacher will be provided from grant funds.           Contributions of $250 per teacher during the first year and $500 per            teacher during the second have been assumed in developing the budget.                                                                                           This project is carefully planned, well balanced, and has the potential         of being of considerable benefit to the participants and their                  colleagues.",
