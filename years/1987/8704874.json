 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parameters derived from spectral analysis of radar signals,                viz. their strength, Doppler shift, and Doppler spread, contain                 information about winds and turbulence in the atmosphere.                       Further statistical analyses of time and spatial series of these                parameters in turn provide information about atmospheric wave                   phenomena influenced by gravity, interactions of these waves with               winds, and about their eventual breakdown into small scale                      chaotic or turbulent motions.  The mechanisms through which radar               signals are scattered by turbulence and optimum techniques for                  deriving most useful parameters from these signals are also of                  significant interest for designing radar experiments.                                Several middle atmosphere radar facilities have been                       constructed in the U.S., Japan, West Germany, and Scandinavia.                  We continue to have access to some of these radar facilities for                designing and conducting new experiments, and to data collected                 with them.                                                                           Efforts at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) are                      directed towards the statistical signal processing of radar and                 rawinsonde data tapes, sophisticated graphical displays of                      results, interpretation of these results in terms of fluid wave                 and turbulence phenomena in the atmosphere, and on mechanisms of                interactions between atmospheric turbulence and the probing radio               waves.                                                                               It is anticipated that over the next three years about 7-8                 MS and 2-3 Ph.D. theses could be supported with the purchase of                 the data processing and graphics equipment provided by this                     grant.",
