 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth of crystals for use with laser beams is of importance in             providing control, different colors, and ultimately devices which are of        interest in signal processing applications.  This is an area which is           difficult because of the diversity of approaches as well as the rather          qualitative nature of the growth techniques.  A variety of crystals are         of interest, of which urea is one.  The company is attempting to grow           crystals of the quality and size necessary for the above applications.          It is likely that they will succeed.  With this will be the ground-work         for a variety of other organic crystals which are of interest.  This            effort is important and is one of the few by a compnay specifically             interested in non-linear optical phenomena.",
