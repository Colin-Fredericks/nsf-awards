 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to build and test a novel chemical vagor                           deposition (CVD) reactor consisting of five parts in a                          rectangular cell.  The proposed reactor is totally different                    from those presently in commerical use.  By operating the                       reactor at a low pressure a stagnant fluid medium of constant                   temperature will be provided for film deposition in the absence                 of buoyancy-driven free convection.  The supply of source gas                   for the deposition will be by diffusion rather than forced                      convection or flowing fluid.  Experimental work will be done                    first to see if the reactor is viable.  Then, based on this                     prototype the governing design equations will be tested over                    wide ranges of operating conditions and modified to establish a                 reliable set of design relationships.  Once the concept and                     design of the novel reactor are demonstrated on the basis of                    silicon epitaxy and polysilicon deposition, the use of the                      reactor for superlattice film growth will be tried.                             Superlattice structures with very sharp interfaces between                      alternating layers will be grown by using two of the reactors                   side by side with the deposition zones interconnected by a                      corridor.",
