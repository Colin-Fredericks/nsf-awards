 "awd_abstract_narration": "Repair and retrofit of existing structures to resist seismic events is          important to Earthquake Hazard Mitigation.  Application of the proper           repair and retrofit procedures can save damaged structures and upgrade          existing structures for high seismic resistance; thus potentially saving        resources and lives.                                                                                                                                            This research project will be a workshop to provide an opportunity for          researchers, designers, and regulatory officials to exchange ideas and          discuss current research.  The aim is to assess the state-of-the-art in         the United States and Japan and to provide a statement of need for              future research activities.  A proceedings of the workshop will be              published., This will be carried out under the U.S. Panel on Wind and           Seismic Effects of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Program in Natural                Resources (UJNR).                                                                                                                                               An award is recommended for the one-year complete research project.  The        principal investigator is highly qualified and the institution provides         excellent support facilities.",
