 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education                  (WICHE) and the Northwest Academic Planning Forum propose to                    establish NorthWestNet, a regional network comprising the states                of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon and WAshington.                 (The schools include:  University of Washington, University of                  Oregon, Oregon State University, Oregon Graduate Center,                        Washington Sate University, University of Idaho, Montana State                  University, University of Alaska, and the North Dakota State                    Board of Higher Education).  They also propose to establish the                 Northwest Academic Computing Consortium (NWACC) to administer                   NorthWestNet and other activities which will enhance                            supercomputer access and the environment for academic                           scientific computing in the region.  the NorthWestNet regional                  network would thus provide access to supercomputer resources and                national data bases and provide intercommunication with other                   researchers in other regions by virtue of a link from the region                to the NSFNet which connects the six NSF supercomputer centers.                         The Foundation is requested to support the plan by funding              necessary equipment and communication facilities for three years.               The participating institutions will provide research training,                  and technical support of the project as well as space, utilities                and other resources as required.                                                        NorthWestNet, with linkage to NSFNet which interconnects all            of the NSF supercomputer centers, would improve the capability of               scientists and engineers at these and future research                           institutions in the northwest area to access and utilize all                    supercomputers resources, to encourage intercampus cooperation,                 and to provide for the development of a community of scholars                   that extends beyond campus or state boundaries.  Thus this                      regional network is essential for gaining effective and robust                  infrastructure for cooperative research.",
