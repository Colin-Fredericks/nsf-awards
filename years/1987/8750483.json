 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biology Department is unusually fortunate in owning a 300-acre field        station located within 20 miles of the main campus.  The field station          contains a number of different terrestrial and aquatic habitats:                prairies and forest, ponds and river.  Located at the field station is a        laboratory building staffed by a resident naturalist.  The field and            laboratory equipment provided through this award are making this field          station self-sufficient and more fully functional.                                                                                                              The new field equipment includes soil and water test kits; the                  laboratory equipment includes microscopes, balances, drying ovens, and a        microcomputer for data storage and analysis.  Since the station already         has adequate dormitory space, the addition of a fully equipped                  laboratory allows students to live and conduct meaningful research on           site.  The equipped station laboratory is particularly valuable during          the January interim term when students may study a single topic in              depth.  With guidance from the resident staff and from the two Ph.D.            ecologists on the Biology faculty, the field station now is able to             introduce substantial numbers of undergraduates to a high degree of             sophistication in studying ecological research methods.",
