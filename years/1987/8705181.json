 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of setting out an array of nine data buoys on             the annual ice cover of the Ross Sea in order to determine its                  movement, rate of deformation, strain rates, and divergence/production          statistics.  The buoys will be dropped from a C-141 aircraft in the             course of the McMurdo mid-winter airdrop mission.  Buoy sensors will            measure surface air pressure and temperature, and transmit this data,           as well as location data, via satellite approximately every two hours.          The buoys are expected to operate for at least four months, and                 possibly up to ten months.                                                                                                                                      The data will be used in the statistical characterization of the sea            ice kinematics, the sea level pressure field, and the geostrophic               wind.  The strain rate and divergence data when combined with passive           microwave data, can be used to assess the regional and sub-regional             ice budget.  The sea ice movement in response to the mean and                   fluctuating component of the wind field may be used to assess the               relative importance of forcing by wind and currents, and of the                 momentum dissipation by internal ice stresses.",
