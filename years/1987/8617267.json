 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is for a broad, systematic investigation of               statistical earthquake recurrence models, with the objective of                 improving engineering seismic hazard analysis.                                                                                                                  The models to be studied range from current renewal models to a variety         of new models, including (l) \"characteristic earthquake processes,\" (2)         hybrid and coupled slip-time predictable models, (3) and stochastic             models of spatial and temporal variation along the fault plane.  This           suite of models will be used interactively, e.g., the more physically-          based models helping to support and/or constrain the more empirical             models.                                                                                                                                                         Comparative numerical studies will be made with the different models            concerning both recurrence predictions and site-hazard analyses.  This          comparison will set the limits of validity of current (Poisson) models.         Also to be considered are the parameter uncertainties, as well as a new         representation of the \"areal source zone.\"                                                                                                                      The senior principal investigator is internationally recognized for his         many contributions to earthquake engineering research and practice,             especially in the area of this study.  The associate investigator has           also demonstrated his ability to contribute to this project.  They have         the necessary institutional facilities, and together the principal              investigators are expected to make a significant advance in seismic             hazard assessment.",
