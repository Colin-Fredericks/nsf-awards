 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanical face seals are used in many industrial applications such as          turbopumps, rocket engines, and chemical processing equipments to               protect against loss of fluids in rotating equipment.  The non-contact          operation in these seals is achieved by permitting the sealed fluid to          penetrate between the mating surfaces to provide means of lubrication.          The purpose of the proposed investigation is to study the dynamic               characteristics of face seals to provide a computer model for                   performance prediction.  The project is a combined theoretical and              experimental program.  Once the theoretical model is verified by                experiments, a computer model will be developed.   This research                and development will advance the state of knowledge in seal design.",
