 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the project is to develop the physiological psychology         program at Kalamazoo College to a level that allows students to:  (1)           have access to a laboratory course in physiological psychology, (2)             participate in group research projects, and (3) conduct supervised, but         independent research projects.  At present, insufficient equipment for          animal care and the lack of some basic laboratory equipment have                precluded the expansion of the physiological psychology program.  The           acquisition of cage washing equipment and animal housing will allow the         expansion of the animal care facility, thereby increasing the research          capacity.  The acquisition of equipment necessary for brain surgery             (drills, stereotaxics, cryostat, microscope) will greatly expand the            surgical techniques that can be used in research and, when combined with        the equipment already possessed by the College, will provide students           with enormous flexibility in the type of research they can conduct.             Increased research capacity and complexity will significantly improve           the departments ability to train students in the techniques and theories        of physiological psychology and related fields.",
