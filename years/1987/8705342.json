 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ways in which the community of algae and bacteria, the              periphyton community,  at the sediment surface in lakes controls                the fluxes of oxygen, carbon and phosphorus at the water-sediment               interface will be studied.  The research is organized around four               tasks: 1) elucidation of the mechanisms involved in producing the               day-night fluctuations of phosphorus afflux from the sediments to               the overlying water; 2) determination of the importance of algal                heterotrophy and tolerance of suboxic conditions in the                         maintenance of the algal community under the seasonally changing                conditions present at the sediment-water interface; 3)                          identification and quantification of the roles of the biological                and physiochemical factors at the sediment-water interface that                 are involved in the control of oxygen dynamics of lake                          hypolimnia; and 4) determination of the various sources of                      nutrients for the algae and bacteria of the periphyton community.                       The research will be conducted at two sites: an alkaline                lake, Lawrence Lake, in Michigan; and an acidic lake in the                     vicinity of Orno, Maine.  State-of-the-art systems will be used                 for the isolation and manipulation of periphyton that permits                   variations in light levels and the chemical composition of the                  \"porewater\" solutions in which the periphyton is grown.                         Extremely detailed measurements of chemical conditions at the                   boundary layer between sediment and the water column will be made               with a computer-aided microelectrode data acquisition system.                   Dr. Klug's research team has pioneered in the use of this system                in studies of lake biogeochemistry.                                                     The significance of this research is its focus on phosphorus            dynamics of lakes.  Phosphorus has been identified as the                       nutrient responsible for the euthrphication of many lakes and                   rivers.  Understanding factors that control phosphorus dynamics                 in these water bodies is clearly important to their management.                         Dr. Klug is a world leader in the study of lake                         biogeochemistry.  The institutional support for this research is                outstanding.  The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends award of                 this grant.",
