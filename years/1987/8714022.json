 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two faculty members, one research associate and                         undergraduate students will work on an experiment being performed               at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva,                 Switzerland.  The experiment involves a large detector (known as                L3) and is built by a collaboration of 300 physicists from                      throughout the world.  L3 is located at the new electron-positron               colliding beam facility presently under construction at CERN.                   The purpose of the experiment is to make precise tests of the                   current theory of elementary particles known as the \"standard                   model\".                                                                                 The Union College Group will have well defined                          responsibilities for the detector.  They are concerned with the                 design, fabrication and implementation of two monitors for the                  muon system:  1) the drift velocity monitor; and 2) the readout                 for the laser alignment apparatus.  This work will involve the                  participation of about 15 undergraduate students in forefront                   research at Union College and off-campus.",
