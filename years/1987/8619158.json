 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a sampling program to determine the physical                controls on chemical constituent deposition and regional chemical               composition gradients over the Greenland ice sheet.  The program                will include three types of sampling: (1) snowpits and shallow                  cores (total depth about 20m), (2) surface snow, and (3) air                    sampling.  The study areas will include the general regions of                  the GISP II site, Dye 3, Dye 2, and Camp Century.  In each of the               study areas one main snowpit and a shallow core at the base of                  this snowpit will be analyzed and a high volume air sample will                 be collected.  Traverses via snowmobile will be conducted from                  each of the main sites.  Sampling will be carried out every 10 to               20 km along the traverse routes, which will be up to 250 km in                  length.  Sampling during the first season will be in the GISP II                site area north of Crete, because of a major reduction in                       logistical cost that will be realized by combining with Dr. John                Bolzan's field party during their glaciological and geophysical                 survey.  Work will also be initiated in this area because of the                importance of acquiring as much information as possible about the               GISP II site prior to deep drilling.",
