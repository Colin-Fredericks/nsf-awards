 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this project, the department of chemistry of the University of            Washington will conduct a four-week in-service institute for 30                 precollege chemistry teachers from Washington and other states in the           Pacific Northwest, during each of the summers of 1987, 88, and 89.              Follow-up activities, aimed at establishing a lasting network for               regional teachers, will include the development of curricular units and         various modes of inservice teaching by institute graduates, the creation        of academic year minicourses, and the continuing exchange of new                institute materials.                                                                                                                                            The content of the workshop, based on experience in the summer of 1986,         will feature lectures on \"The Interactions of Energy with Matter and a          second series of lectures which will address different themes in each of        the project years:  \"The Chemistry of Metals,\" \"Chemistry of Non-               Metals,\" and \"Environmental Chemistry.\"  In addition, each summer will          feature a component on the Frontiers of Chemistry, including lectures           and site visits on such subjects as Enviromental Chemistry, Modern              Analytical Chemistry, Surface Chemistry, and Medical Imaging.  Three            afternoons per week will be devoted to laboratory work, participants            will receive assistance in preparing and presenting demonstrations, and         there will be an introduction to the use of computers in chemistry.  In         addition, all participants are expected to give pedagogical                     presentations to their colleagues, to prepare a library report, and to          participate in workshop sessions devoted to issues in teaching.                                                                                                 Thirty teachers (estimated to be 27 from high school and 3 from junior          high school) will be selected each year from applications solicited from        Washington and other states in the Pacific Northwest.  Non-commuters            will be housed and fed at the University, with expenses covered from the        grant, and all will receive stipends of $200 per month.  The teachers           will receive nine academic quarter credits for their participation in           this institute, and another two on completion of a curriculum unit.             Outreach and network activities are expected, and will be supported by          academic year minicourses.",
