 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most civil engineering systems consist of a heavy primary structure             supporting a light secondary system.  Examples include piping                   containment vessels in nuclear reactors, and equipment such as computers        in buildings.                                                                                                                                                   This research project considers those structural systems in which both          the primary and the secondary systems behave in a nonlinear manner.  It         considers special characteristics of secondary systems such as: tuning;         time-varying nonlinear effects including a decrease in stiffness of the         structure; and the influence on the assessment of the reliability of the        system due to uncertainty in the system parameters.  The analysis of            parameter uncertainty will be performed using methods of structural             reliability theory.                                                                                                                                             The results of this research can be used to assist and interpret the            results obtained from  experimental and time-history methods. In                addition, the research can be developed further in the analysis of              secondary systems, such as in developing damage criteria and system             identification techniques and investigating  more general and complex           nonlinearities.  Finally, the research can be extended in other areas           including the analysis of structures subjected to narrow-band                   earthquakes - e.g. the September, 1985 Mexico earthquake.",
