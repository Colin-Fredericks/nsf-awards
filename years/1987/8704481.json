 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomic sodium is released into the lower thermosphere and               upper mesosphere by ablative vaporization of meteors and                        meteorites.  The resulting free atomic sodium layer near 90 km is               the source of the chemiluminescent upper stratosphere the                       resulting NaO, NaO2 and NaOH can react with gaseous HC  affecting               the chlorine and ozone chemistry of the upper atmosphere.                               The reactive and photolytic processes controlling the sodium            airglow as well as the chemical evolution of mesospheric and                    stratospheric sodium have use of molecular beam, fast flow                      reactor, and laser photolysis techniques to sections and product                branching ratios necessary to fully model the thermospheric and                 mesospheric chemistry of gaseous sodium compounds.                                      The study of the chemistry of sodium in the upper atmosphere            is important because the sodium layer is an indicator of                        dynamical motions in the 80-120km region of the atmosphere.  When               probed by LIDAR the layer shape reveals atmospheric waves and                   winds and temperature changes, information which it is hard to                  obtain otherwise.                                                                       These studies of the chemistry of the sodium layer have long            been needed to understand its formation and variations, and Drs.                Herschbach (who recently received a Nobel Prize) and Kolb are                   leading scientists in the field.",
