 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feeding guilds of neotropical hummingbirds are known for                   their diversity and flexibility of composition, but the actual                  mechanisms that determine the structure of these guilds are                     unknown.  It is known that guild member species differ in their                 ability to exploit different resource states and that changes in                guild structure can be correlated with changes in food                          availability.  Thus, it seems probable that differences in                      energetic constraints are a major mechanism behind changes in                   guild composition, yet this has not been empirically                            demonstrated.                                                                        It is the goal of this study to quantify this suggested link               between the energetic success of individual species and their                   relative representation in the guild.  Syntopic pairs of species                found at Monteverde, Costa Rica, will be used to test a priori                  predictions on relative energetics.  Energy budgets will be                     measured using: a) flight-cage experiments to quantify energetic                responses to manipulated changes in competitor pressure and food                availability, and b) field metabolic rates (using doubly-labeled                water) during periods of high versus low resource availability.                      The research will be conducted by Mr. Harry Tiebout under                  the direction of Dr. Peter Feinsinger.  This excellent team                     assures a productive project on an exciting topic in tropical                   ecology.",
