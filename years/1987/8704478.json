 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a portion of the work of                        the Arcadia project.  Arcadia is a major, joint research                        effort the aim of which is to gain fundamental understandings                   about desirable architectures for the integration of software                   tools into environments and particularly in support of                          software testing, analysis and evaluation.  Arcadia is an                       experimental research project which aims to gain these                          understandings through the creation and experimental                            evaluation of an actual environment prototype--Arcadia-1.                       A key innovative feature of the approach being taken by                         Arcadia is to consider software processes to be items of                        software themselves and to view an environment as a mechanism                   for specifying, compiling and interpreting these processes,                     using software tools and software workers as interpretation                     primitives.                                                                                                                                                     Work at the University of Massachusetts on the Arcadia project                  will focus on two important aspects of software development                     environments, namely object management and analysis tools.                      The object management mechanisms will be a central feature of                   the Arcadia environment architecture.  On the one hand, it                      will serve to organize and orchestrate the myriad pieces of a                   software project being created and maintained by users of an                    environment.  In addition, it will constitute the primary                       structuring and integration mechanism for the environment                       itself, since all the tools and information structures                          comprised by an environment can and should be viewed as                         objects subject to management.                                                                                                                                  Analysis tools and their integration are an important focus                     of Arcadia, both as a test case for the environment                             architecture's extensibility and integration capabilities and                   as a contribution to expanding the power and usefulness that                    environments offer to their users.  This project will focus on                  two classes of analysis tools: software testing tools and                       tools for analyzing concurrent and distributed systems.                                                                                                         Major experimental research efforts are needed to provide                       basic understandings of overall software development                            environments.  The Arcadia project is a significant effort                      toward achieving those understandings.",
