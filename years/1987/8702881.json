 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research Harris will continue to study the                         arithmetic of holomorphic and non-holomorphic automorphic forms                 and relations with special values of L-functions.  It will                      concentrate on the conjectures of Deligne on the special values                 of L-functions attached to the cohomology of algebraic varieties                in the only cases in which these L-functions are known to be                    tractable: namely, when they can be realized as automorphic L-                  functions.                                                                           Automorphic functions are complex analytic functions that                  encode number theoretic information and allow one to bring the                  powerful machinery of analysis to bear on the number theory                     problems.  In this case the area of application is in arithmetic                algebraic geometry, namely in the area of number theory connected               with the solutions of systems of polynomial equations.  This then               becomes a sweeping area of study encompassing most areas of                     mathematics in its tools.  Harris is a master of this and much                  exciting mathematics will result from this research.",
