 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the development of a feedback design             methodology for nonlinear systems, based on a nonlinear enhancement of          classical root-locus theory.  This proposed nonlinear \"frequency                domain\" methodology, for example, is capable of designing, in a                 systematic way, stabilizing \"lead-lag\" compensators, nonlinear PD               controllers for set-point control, feedback strategies for disturbance          decoupling with closed-loop stability or perhaps even asymptotic                tracking and disturbance rejection for a broad class of nonlinear               systems, based on nonlinear analogues of classical control concepts             such as relative degree or nonlinear \"minimum phase\" properties.  This          methodology has been successfully employed for stabilization in the             large of scalar, affine (in the control) \"minimum phase\" nonlinear              systems under certain regularity conditions.  However, many                     applications of interest are multivariable, sometimes not affine, and           very often have singularities.  This work will systematically develop           and extend this design methodology so as to include such systems,               drawing where necessary on techniques in geometric control, dynamical           systems and classical control.",
