 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrative: Aseptic processing involves continuous food sterilization by         heating and packaging that may be sterilized by various methods,                including heat.  Besides the convenience of continuous sterilization            other possible advantages resulting from this strategy include lower            cost product packaging and the potential improvement of product quality         via ultra-high temperature/short time treatment.                                                                                                                Mathematical models with experimental verification will be developed to         represent fine and course particle velocity distributions in holding            tubes designed for aseptic food sterilization.  This work has been              proposed because no reliable technique presently exists for continuous          in-situ measurement of temperatures within individual particles flowing         through tubes.  Therefore, the detection of particle \"cold spots\" would         be essentially impossible without predictive theoretical models.                                                                                                Important process parameters that will be investigated include; Reynolds        number, particle-to-pipe diameter ratio, radii and orientation of bends,        pipe inclination, and particle concentration.",
