 "awd_abstract_narration": "Though geology is primarily a field science and the most effective              method of study is in the field, most earth science teachers have little        if any such experience.  This program is designed to help teachers              develop field skills and to provide them supplies, resource materials,          and field activities that can be utilized in their earth science classes        in Arkansas and Missouri.                                                                                                                                       The program will consist of two segments.  The first portion will               introduce earth science teachers to as much diverse geology as possible         to develop their field skills.  The course will begin at the University         of Arkansas and Missouri campuses with a three day intensive review and         an introduction to the geology of the field area, Lander, Wyoming.  In          Wyoming the participants will work in field projects, and a resource            unit on a field topic in geology.                                                                                                                               The second portion of the program will occur in Arkansas and Missouri           and involve the teachers in applying the skills learned in field camp to        develop resource materials and field activities for their earth science         classes.  These reports will be edited and printed as a fieldguide to           the geology of the state.",
