 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to elucidate the mechanisms of               adsorption, desorption, surface reaction, diffusion, tungsten                   nucleation and film growth in the heterogeneous chemical vapor                  deposition of tungsten hexafluoride and tungsten hexachloride and               to develop fundamentally based, non-empirical reaction rate                     expressions based on these mechanisms.  An experimental approach                based on complementary ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) techniques will be                employed so that the various reaction steps can be isolated and                 examined individually under well-defined conditions.                            Temperature-programmed desorption and reaction spectroscopy                     (TPD/TPRS) will be used to separate adsorption from decomposition               and desorption and to determine the rate constants for each step.                                                                                               Rate expressions based on mechanisms suggested by the TPD/TPRS                  studies and scanning kinetic spectroscopy (SKS) experiments will                be compared to growth rate curves.  Clean silicon and clean                     tungsten surfaces will be investigated to establish behavior of                 the silicon reduction and hydrogen reduction reactions,                         respectively, in the absence of chemical species which may act as               poisons or promoters.  Impurities, dopants and surface insulating               layers will then be introduced systematically and their effects                 on the deposition reactions will be quantified.  Successful                     completion of this research will lead to a greater fundamental                  understanding of the tungsten deposition reactions, particularly                with respect to the limits of selective deposition, the self-                   limiting growth behavior exhibited on silicon, and to methods for               intentionally promoting or poisoning the surface reactions.                                                                                                     The proposed research is motivated by new demands placed on                     materials as lateral and vertical dimensions in semiconductor                   devices continue to shrink in the drive for faster, more reliable               integrated microcircuits.  Tungsten possesses properties which                  make it an attractive candidate for a number of technologically-                important applications in very large scale integration (VLSI)                   circuits.  Some manufacturers are already incorporating tungsten                interconnects  into their circuits, but existing technology                     leaves much room for improvement in quality control and                         production of very fine structures.",
