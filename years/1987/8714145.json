 "awd_abstract_narration": "William Fulton works in algebraic geometry.  He has three                  main areas that he will concentrate on during this research                     program.  The first is the subject of Chern classes of direct                   image bundles for branched coverings of projective spaces.  The                 next is intersection theory and enumerative geometry.  This                     includes the search for Porteous formulae in the presence of                    singularities or excess components and questions of reality or                  rationality of solutions.  The last is the applications of                      intersection theory to toric varieties and to varieties of                      geometric figures such as n-tuples of points.                                        Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects                   arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial                         equations.  This is one of the oldest and currently one of the                  most active branches of mathematics with widespread applications                through out mathematics and reaching into physics, computer                     science etc.  Fulton is one of the very best practitioners of                   this subject with his constant flow of very deep contributions.                 This proposal will undoubtedly lead to many more exciting                       results.",
