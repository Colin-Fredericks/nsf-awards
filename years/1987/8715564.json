 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall purpose of this project is to develop improved theoretical          and practical understanding of risk perception, communication, and              management.  Specifically, the research will (1) examine cognitive              models that people use in thinking and making decisions about risks;            (2) develop improved risk communication methods based on these models;          (3) examine the role of risk perception and communication in effective          risk management; and (4) develop improved analytic approaches and tools         for risk management.  As part of the project, case studies will be              undertaken in six areas:  radon in homes, 60 hertz electromagnetic              fields, solar ultraviolet light, seat belts, dam safety, and chemical           carcinogens.                                                                                                                                                    Despite the importance of risk perceptions in risk communication and            risk management, little research has focused on integrating theory and          practice through multidisciplinary collaborative work.  This innovative         project will integrate theoretical models and empirical data from               several case studies to develop improved methods for effective risk             communication and management.  It is expected that the project will             provide important information for both analysts and decision makers.            Specifically, it is expected that the results of the study will (1)             contribute to the development of improved understanding of the role of          risk perceptions in the decision making process; and (2) provide                analysts and decision makers with more powerful methods for addressing          difficult and complex issues in risk communication and management.",
