 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  The diffusive and adsorptive properties of                   hydrocarbons on high-silica zeolites are investigated by                        gravimetric and NMR methods to resolve the differences in                       diffusion measurements, which are reported in the literature to                 be of several orders of magnitude between measurements made by                  these two techniques, in order to gain fundamental understanding                of diffusion in zeolites.                                                                                                                                       Novelty:  A new apparatus is being constructed and will be used                 to make simultaneous diffusion measurements of identical zeolite                samples, activated under exactly the same conditions, under                     identical sorbate pressure, using NMR and gravimetric methods.                  This unique method of measurement will make it possible to                      compare the results from microscopic NMR measurements to those                  from macroscopic gravimetric measurements, thus resolving                       currently existing large differences.                                                                                                                           Technical Impact:  The information obtained from the proposed                   work will not only provide fundamental understanding of the                     transport and adsorption properties of zeolites but also will be                of importance in improving engineering design in such important                 operations as purification of gas streams, separation processes,                and catalytic conversion units.  A better understanding of the                  diffusion mechanisms and equilibrium properties can provide                     valuable information in understanding catalytic behavior of                     shape-selective zeolites used in practical industrial                           applications such as xylene isomerization, dewaxing and                         conversion of methanol to gasoline.",
