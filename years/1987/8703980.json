In this program, Raman and Brillouin scattering                    methods will be applied to a broad range of such semiconducting                 and metallic systems.                                                                   Resonant Brillouin scattering experiments on semiconductor              quantum layers focusses on elucidating the complex, yet                         important, valence subband structure.  Quantitative estimates for               several fundamental electron and lattice parameters of these                    ultra thin layers will be realized.  Research on zinc arsenide                  epilayers, including structures grown on indium phosphide, that                 are a new and novel class of superlattices, provides exciting                   prospects for fundamental results.  This thrust is also expected                to have a significant impact on device applications, as for                     example long wavelength photonic devices.                                               Interest in metallic superlattices is, primarily,                       understanding effects of structural anisotropy and tunable                      coherence lengths on electronic excitations in normal and                       superconducting states.                                                                 The overall program also provides valuable structural and               optical characterization that are valuable for improved                         fabrication of novel modulated systems.",
