 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Committee on Radio Frequencies (CORF) was formed by the National            Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1961, and it has been supported in some            form by the National Science Foundation (NSF) since 1963.  Committee            activities have predominantly involved radio astronomy issues.  In              1969, the Subcommittee on Space Science was added to the existing               Subcommittee on Radio Astronomy, and NASA began contributing                    approximately 25 percent of the support for CORF.                                                                                                               The CORF is the nongovernmental focal point for radio frequency                 requirements for scientific research.  Over the years, the CORF has             played a leading role in representing the needs of the scientific               community in national and international spectrum management forums,             particularly during U.S. preparations for World Administrative Radio            Conferences.  The NAS has administered the CORF expertly for the past           25 years, and it is appropriate for that arrangement to continue.                                                                                               The CORF provides timely and authoritative advice and recommendations           to the NSF and other Government agencies on the use of the radio                spectrum for research purposes.  The NSF has a direct interest in the           activities of CORF and its two Subcommittees and cooperates closely             with the Committee through the Electromagnetic Spectrum Management              Unit.  Input from the CORF to the NSF is of particular value since the          NSF represents the research use of the radio spectrum on the                    Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) of the National                 Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA).                                                                                                        CORF activities in the 1987-1988 time period will revolve around                domestic spectrum allocation activities, participation in the current           cycle of meetings of the International Radio Consultative Committee             (CCIR), preparations for the upcoming Mobile World Administrative Radio         Conference of the International Telecommunication Union and advice on           the implementation of its Final Acts.  CORF will also participate in            the preparations for the upcoming Orbital World Administrative Radio            Conference.                                                                                                                                                     The role CORF plays in national and international spectrum management           is becoming more important with the increasingly intense competition            for radio frequency spectrum.  Support for CORF for the 1987-1988 time          period is highly recommended.  The NAS requested support for CORF for           the period 1987-1990.  Due to some concern expressed by the reviewers           regarding the administration of CORF, the recommendation for $54,000            covers the NSF contribution to CORF for 1987-1988.  The NAS should              submit a new proposal to satisfy the reviewers.",
