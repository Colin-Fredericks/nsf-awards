 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is designed to investigate the possibility of                      synthesizing a new class of materials (known as transition metal                complexes, with a structure called zeolitic structure) for rapid                absorption and desorption of gases.  It is proposed to use these                new materials for selectively absorbing oxygen from air so that                 the oxygen can be desorbed subsequently to provide a source of                  highly pure oxygen.  The presently-available devices absorb                     nitrogen from air to produce a left-over gas stream with                        predominant oxygen content.  However, this leads to impure                      oxygen, with a substantial amount of argon, carbon dioxide and                  moisture.  Successful completion of the proposed work promises to               provide an economic source of pure oxygen for medical use and for               welding and metal cutting.  Additional applications are also                    possible.                                                                                                                                                       The PI, Dr. Neil Hendricks, ahs very good training in the                       background areas needed for this work, and his employer, Maxdem                 Inc., has good facilities for conducting this Phase I work under                the Small Business Innovation Research Program.                                                                                                                 An award for $40,000 for six months is recommended.",
