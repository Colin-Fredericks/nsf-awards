 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program shall develop and apply cryogenic and room                 temperature torsion balances to search for anomalous long-range                 interactions in nature.  Such interactions reveal themselves as                 anomalies in the effective gravitational interaction.  Recent                   strong impetus for such investigations comes from reported                      experimental evidence for a very weak long range \"fifth force\" in               nature.  An experiment is being conducted to test for such a                    force by searching for a composition dependence in the forces                   experienced by equal masses of different materials suspended from               a torsion balance located on a hillside.  A related experiment is               being designed to search for composition dependence experienced                 by such a balance due to a local movable mass.  Another                         experiment is being conducted to search for anomalous long range                interactions between samples with polarized electron spins,                     magnetically isolated with superconducting shields.  The                        performance of the torsion balance is being evaluated to assess                 its suitability for application to other experiments in                         gravitation such as an improved test of the equivalence of                      inertial and gravitational mass.",
