 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves development of a new approach to                    radical initiated polymerization based on the concept of                        captodative stabilization, and the use of new initiating systems                based on reversible dimerization of cyclic captodative radicals.                New monomers will be synthesized that will allow evaluation of                  the balance between radical stabilization and reactivity.                       Dehydroalanine derivatives (which are known to be highly active                 radical monomers) will be examined first to evaluate tacticity,                 copolymerizability, and the use of reversible termination by                    coupling to generate radical block copolymers.  Analogs of                      dehydroalanines will then be synthesized in which the captodative               groups include combinations of nitrile, nitrate, sulfonate, or                  phosphonate derivatives with amine, hydroxyl, sulfhydryl, or                    silyl functionality.  Bond strengths and charge distributions of                monomers and intermediates will be calculated and correlated with               empirical data.",
