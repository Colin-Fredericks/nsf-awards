 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many structures in earthquake prone areas are constructed using                 reinforced concrete.  In seismically resistant design, proper behavior          of the reinforced concrete structural elements depends a great deal on          the ductility of the structure.                                                                                                                                 Confinement of concrete in critical locations plays a significant part          in achieving ductile behavior of structures.  In this research, basic           mechanisms of confinement by rectilinear ties will be investigated using        analytical models and experiments with laboratory specimens.  A rational        method will be developed to determine the required amount and                   configuration of confining steel which will result in economical and            safe design of structures.  Results from this research are expected to          provide the basis for modifications and recommendation in the                   confinement provisions of various U.S. design codes such as American            Concrete Institute ACI 318 and SEAOC.                                                                                                                           The Principal Investigator is highly qualified to conduct the research          and the institution provides excellent support facilities.  An award is         recommended for the first year of this two-year complete project.",
