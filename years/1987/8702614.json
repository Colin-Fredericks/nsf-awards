 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Xenopus oocyte, after undergoing a prolonged period of growth,          remains in a state of developmental arrest in the ovary.  In response to        progesterone, the oocyte resumes meiosis, is released from the                  surrounding follicle cells, and becomes a fertilizable egg.  This               process has been shown by Dr. Robinson not to invlove an increase in            calcium, at least insofar as can be detected by calcium microelectrodes         or aequorin. Using his modified fluorescence microscope and the calcium         indicator fura 2, he propose to probe the cortical region to a depth of         about 10microm. underneath the plasma membrane and determine if there           are increases or decreases in calcium during the maturation process.            Dr. Robinson will also look for gradients of calcium associated with the        animal-vegetal axis of the oocytes.  These measurements will be extended        to the smaller oocytes that are in the process of developing and                expressing the primary polarity axis.  Using the method of fluorescence         polarization, Dr. Robinson will measure membrane fluidity during                maturation induced by steroid and non-steroid agonists, with the aim of         identifying a common mechanism of action.  In collaboration with Dr.            Susan Strome, Dr. Robinson will extend the calcium and vibrating probe          measurements to the early development of Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes         and zygotes.                                                                        The significance of this research lies to two areas.  The first is          that of the mechanism of steroid hormone interaction with cells.  It has        long been thought that steroid hormones exert their effects directly on         the genetic machinery.  In the amphibian oocyte on the other hand,              progesterone is known to have its effect at the surface of the cell,            although the nature of the surface-hormone interaction is unknown.              Recently, it has become apparent that a surface effect is a general             feature of steroid hormone action. The second aspect of this work               addresses the important problem of pattern formation.",
