Dr. Barth's primary research interest is in the mechanisms                 regulating brain cell excitability and their role in normal and                 pathological human cortical function.  For his dissertation he                  conducted a series of studies to explore the neuromagnetic                      fields produced outside of the head by both normal sensory                      processing and pathological epileptic discharge.  This work                     used a newly developed superconducting biomagnetic sensor                       called the Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)                  to map extracranial magnetic fields.  From these neuromagnetic                  maps, Dr. Barth demonstrated that it was possible to accurately                 localize restricted electrical brain currents within the                        cranium.  Dr. Barth pioneered the use of neuromagnetometry to                   study human focal epileptic disorders.  Neuromagnetic field                     maps were effectively used to determine the location of an                      epileptic focus within the brain for neurosurgical evaluation,                  and to noninvasively study dynamic interactions between brain                   regions during epileptic seizure discharge.                                                                                                                             Dr. Barth's neuromagnetic investigations also extend to                 animal studies where he is exploring the neurophysiological                     basis of brain magnetic fields and using this knowledge to                      study slow and rapid changes in cellular electrical currents                    that may underlie changes in cortical excitability.  Here, the                  response of the brain to sensory and direct cortical                            stimulation are under investigation as well as the brain's                      response to drugs that induce or reduce focal epilepsy.                                                                                                                 Dr. Barth presently holds a joint appointment in the UCLA               Departments of Neurology and Psychology, with neuromagnetometry                 laboratories in both departments.  His work has included the                    improvement of mathematical models for interpreting human                       neuromagnetic fields, for localizing pathological brain                         activity and studying multiple simultaneously active brain                      regions.  Dr. Barth is continuing his investigation of the                      physiological basis of slow changes in brain excitability in                    animals and relating this work to recent neuromagnetic studies                  of information processing in the human brain.",
