 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Equipment Grant provides funds for            purchase of high speed, high sensitivity image converter streak camera          system which will be used principally for intense ion beam research.            The physics of high power pulsed accelerating gaps and intense ion              beam propagation will be investigated using visible light emitted by            accelerating or drifting ions, or light which results from the                  energetic ions interacting with matter (such as a scintillator).  The           streak camera system collects light intensity data as a function of             position and time with subnanosecond temporal resolution and                    submillimeter spatial resolution, with sufficient sensitivity to allow          several new diagnostic techniques to be tested, and previously used             ones to be improved.  An example in the former category is a technique          to determine the electrostatic potential as a function of position in           an ion-beam accelerating gap using Doppler shifted resonance                    absorption of tunable dye laser light by the accelerating ions.  In             the latter category is an experiment to measure the electric field vs           position in the accelerating gap by coupling the streak camera to the           output of a spectrometer and monitoring the Stark shifted line profile          of specially selected ion emission lines.  In that case, the intensity          vs position vs time data from the streak camera will become intensity           vs wavelength vs time.  Similarly, ion transverse velocities vs                 position and time both in an accelerating gap and in a propagation              region can be measured by monitoring the Doppler width of appropriate           emission lines.  An improved understanding of the physics of intense            ion beam sources and of propagating ion beams will come from these              measurements which will, in turn, improve the ability to customize              beam sources for particular applications in science and engineering,            such as materials surface modification and inertial confinement                 fusion.",
