 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do individuals handle disputes and how is this process                      affected by the values and norms of various cultural groups?                    While cultural norms and mores are typically assumed to be                      important, little of the extant literature has sought to                        illuminate why, how, and in what ways.  Drs. Hostetler, Kidder,                 and Huntington seek to do so through comparative study of                       disputing in Amish society--both conflict management within this                society and between the Amish community and outsiders.  The                     context of Amish society is particularly interesting because of                 the strongly held commitment of this group to refrain from the                  use of law.  Based on systematic analysis of verbatim interviews                and observation data, the study is designed to identify the                     origin and range of disputes in this separatist group, examine                  the alternatives for handling grievances and their consequences,                determine the social and economic costs to individuals prevented                by their religious beliefs from using the judicial system, and                  illuminate the relationship between disputing and community well-               being.  By focusing on settlements in two geographic areas (one                 traditional Old Order Amish and the other modernizing Amish-                    Mennonite), this collaborative team intends to unravel both the                 relationship between cultural values and disputing and whether                  changing cultural mores stimulate different patterns in conflict                management.  Thus, the research should advance our understanding                of disputing in society and the ways that such processes are                    affected by ideology, social solidarity, and social change.",
