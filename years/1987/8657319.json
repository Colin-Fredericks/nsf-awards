 "awd_abstract_narration": "LeVeque is studying numerical methods for solving nonlinear             partial differential equations, particularly those arising in                   fluid dynamics such as the Navier-Stokes equations or the                       inviscid Euler equations.  The Euler equations are a hyperbolic                 system of conservation laws with solutions that can involve shock               waves and other discontinuities.  Special numerical methods are                 required to determine highly accurate solutions with sharp dis-                 continuities.  LeVeque is studying a class of explicit methods                  that can be efficiently applied with large time steps.  This work               involves both algorithmic aspects and extension of the                          mathematical theory of wave interaction in nonlinear conservation               laws.  One aspect of this work is the specification of boundary                 conditions with reasonable time steps for bodies embedded in                    Cartesian grids.                                                                        A related question, handled by different techniques, is the             proper specification of boundary conditions for numerical methods               that solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by                        fractional steps.  A sequence of easier subproblems is solved in                each time step that require special nonphysical boundary                        conditions.  One application of the incompressible Navier-Stokes                equations is to model wave propogation in the cochlea (inner                    ear).  LeVeque is involved in an ongoing project in this                        direction with C. Peskin.                                                               LeVeque is also studying the interaction of solitary waves              in nonlinear partial differential equations such as the KdV                     equations arising in elasticity.",
