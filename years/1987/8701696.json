 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of decomposing a large-scale nonlinear control                  system into an interconnected family of smaller-scale subsystems                is a natural one and has received the attention of many                         researchers. The vast majority of the work done on this problem                 thus far has concentrated on local decompositions. By                           decomposition one usually means a change of variables that                      produces an equivalent system that has at least two independent                 but interconnected parts. Decomposition is very important from a                practical point of view, because it simplifies the analysis of                  complex systems.                                                                    The investigator proposes a notion of global system                         decomposition which is reasonable from a conceptual point of view               and has potential of producing results that can be applied to                   specific examples. He will attempt to extend known results on                   local decompositions to a global setting. Both necessary and                    sufficient conditions of existence of global decompositions will                be sought. A study of symmetry groups associated with a control                 system will constitute a portion of this research. Applications                 of global decompositons to the study of global controllability of               nonlinear control systems will also be pursued.                                     This research attempts to develop further the applications of               differential geometry to control systems. If succesful, it could                produce results of considerable importance for such applications                of control theory as robot manipulators and helicopter                          autopilots.",
