 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  Mass transport of small organic molecules                    through well characterized interfacial films, adsorbed on latex                 particles, will be studied.  Interfacial films of the \"condensed\"               type, those with strong interactions between adsorbed molecules                 such as the sodium hexadecyl sulfate/sodium hexadecyl alcohol                   mixed surfactants or sodium lauryl sulfate at high ionic strength,              will be used.  The effect of agitation on the mass transport will               be also studied.                                                                                                                                                The proposed work is aimed toward the understanding of mass                     transport through tightly packed molecules in the interface.  Most              studies have been on liquid drops, where the transport resistance               was due to the reduced liquid recirculation near the surface of the             drop.  In this work the substrate is a polymer particle and                     recirculation effects are absent.  The mass transport resistance must           than depend on the barrier properties of the interfacial film.                                                                                                  Technical Impact:  In commercial latex manufacture, colloid                     stabilization is often based on mixed stabilizers,                              ionic/nonionic surfactant mixtures, which often lead to                         interfacial layers of tightly packed molecules.  Information                    about the mass transport through such a phase in the turbulent                  agitation regime is needed for the effective kinetic modeling                   of commercial reactions.  Such information is currently not                     available.  This work will yield some of this missing                           information.",
