 "awd_abstract_narration": "The H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Blue River, Oregon is               a US Forest Service property dedicated to research and education.               It is jointly managed by the College of Forestry, Oregon State                  University, and the US Forest Service's Pacific Northwest                       Research Station.  Established in 1948, it has become one of the                most heavily utilized Experimental Forests in the country, with                 more than 100 separate research projects annually during the last               4 years.  About 85 scientists and 30 graduate students were                     involved in research at the Andrews Forest in 1986.  Three                      factors contribute to this heavy use: 1) quality and variety of                 the natural resources/habitats available; 2) numerous long-term                 data sets and permanent plots; and 3) a tradition of                            collaborative research on a wide range of biological and                        ecological topics.                                                                   The scope of the research program at the Andrews Forest is                 currently limited by lack of equipment and physical plant                       resources.  This project will provide funds to: 1) help equip a                 laboratory for soil and tissue analyses; 2) acquire streamflow                  and temperature data loggers; 3) help construct a Research                      Support Building; and 4) add a large (24x36 in) plotter to the                  computer facilities.  Substantial cost sharing funds will be                    provided by Oregon State University and the US Forest Service.",
