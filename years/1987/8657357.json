 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant initiates funding for the principal                          investigator's Presidential Young Investigator award.  To date,                 the PI has received a Petroleum Research Fund Award of $18,000                  that qualifies for NSF matching funds (American Chemical Society,               Petroleum Research Fund, Grant                                                  1987).  Accordingly, $43,000 in funds are provided in this                      action ($25,000 for the base award plus $18,000 in matching                     funds).  The PI`s work involves studies of ionic and transport                  properties of materials of geological and geophysical interest.                 Several avenues of investigation are being pursued.  Direct                     determination of the frequency-dependent AC impedance of                        two-phase systems (crystal-melt systems) at high temperatures and               pressures will lead to models incorporating both textural                       parameters and frequency into the theoretical formulations of                   bulk impedance of multiphase systems.  Geophysically, these                     results will be significant in terms of characterization of                     shallow geothermal anomalies and in terms of interpretation of                  upper mantle electrical conductivity anomalies and the thermal                  and physical state of the upper mantle.  Additional experiments                 are being developed to determine electrical conductivities of                   volatile-bearing melts at elevated P and T.  Determination of                   the effects of volatiles, especially H.2O and CO.2, on ionic                    transport is of significance not only in the geological problems                of magma formation, ascent, and eruption, but also in materials                 science and ceramic engineering in terms of corrosion and                       weathering resistance.  A novel type of experiment combines                     tracer diffusion studies with electrochemically-induced migration               studies of volatiles in melts.  These studies will enable                       determination of the complete array of ionic transport, chemical                equilibrium, and isotopic exchange parameters in melt-volatile                  systems.",
