 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative program of research between J. W. Mayer, Cornell         University; S. S. Lau, University of California (San Diego); and J. M.          Poate, AT&T Bell Laboratories at Murray Hill will investigate ion-              induced formation of crystalline, metastable phases.  The study will            emphasize three major areas:  1) aluminum-transition metal systems with         emphasis on ion-induced formation of the quasicrystalline, icosahedral          structure,  2) direct, hot substrate, ion-induced transformations to the        metastable phase in binary systems near deep eutectics, and  3)                 formation of metastable phases in ternary systems using ion irradiation         of metallic alloys on silicon or germanium and  of germanium-silicon            alloys on metal films.  The primary analytical approach will be based on        Rutherford backscattering, x-ray diffraction, transmission electron             microscopy and in-situ electrical measurements.                                                                                                                     The research is a continuation of a previously successful and               productive investigation under support from the NSF (DMR-8106843).              Research on beam-induced metastable phases is a promising path to the           development of new classes of materials with unique surface and                 electronic properties.  The objective of the research is to provide             important information on the physics of these new materials and on the          range of new compositions and properties that may be available.                 Fundamental understanding is needed in this area to provide guidance for        materials scientists and engineers who are now seeking new materials and        processing techniques.  The research will also have a significant impact        on the production of qualified researchers in the field of materials            science and electronics.",
