 "awd_abstract_narration": "The P.I.'s previous studies have provided much new data                 towards an understanding of evolutionary processes and have                     reaffirmed the belief in the high potential of studies of the                   late Neogene planktonic foraminiferal Globoconella group for                    evolutionary insights.  Briefly, there are several principal                    factors that, in combination, provide opportunities that may be                 exploited through this program:                                                      1.  Large numbers of well-preserved, measurable specimens in               continuously cored sedimentary sequences of late Neogene age (7                 Ma to present) offer a high potential for time resolution due                   to core quality resulting from use of the hydraulic piston corer.                    2.  Clear evolutionary changes at all latitudes shown by                   the species shape (biometric) investigations.                                        3.  Sufficiently broad geographic coverage of the sequences                will reveal the role of migration and biotic competition in the                 evolutionary process.                                                                4.  The location of sequences in distinct surface water                    masses separated by oceanographic fronts acting as partial                      barriers to planktonic foraminiferal species and which acted as                 partial barriers to gene flow during the last several million                   years.                                                                               5.  The existence of paleoceanographic information from the                same sites for which the evolutionary investigations are being                  conducted.  This includes oxygen and carbon isotopic stratigraphy               and abundance variations in planktonic foraminiferal assemblages.                    6.  A suite of easily recognized morphometric features that                are now accurately and rapidly measured using the well-developed                methodology.",
