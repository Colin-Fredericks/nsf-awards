 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current optimization approaches to nondeterministic structural systems          subject to random loads almost invariably treat the serviceability and          ultimate limit states separately.  A major drawback to these approaches         is that design decisions at one limit state must be made in the absence         of explicit information as to their consequences at other limit states          of concern.  This leads either to a considerable waste of money because         of overdesign or to a low reliability of structural systems.                                                                                                    The essential objective of this project is to develop an efficient and          effective method for the multi-objective reliability-based optimization         of structural systems subject to performance constraints imposed                simultaneously at both serviceability and ultimate limit states.  Almost        no basic studies in structural optimization have been performed to              develop such a method.  A survey of recent research will be made for            identifying probabilistic behavior models for nondeterministic                  structural members under service and ultimate random loads.  These              individual models will be incorporated into a general system model which        will be used for developing a multi-objective reliability-based                 optimization method whereby performance constraints will be satisfied           simultaneously at both service end ultimate limit states.  This method          will be extended to accommodate generel response sensitivities of the           optimum solution to changes in the random parameters that define the            loading and the member resistances.  It is anticipated that the results         will be of considerable value for the efficient design of structural            systems under multiple reliability-based performance constraints.",
