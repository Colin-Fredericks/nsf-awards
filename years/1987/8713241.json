 "awd_abstract_narration": "The studies proposed here will provide a phenotypic and                    molecular characterization of the facet mutations of drosophila.                These mutations, which map to the well studied notch locus,                     affect development of the eye.  Preliminary data indicate that                  these mutations alter non-coding regions of the notch transcript,               thereby suggesting the possibility that the mutations are                       regulatory, rather than structural.  This is consistent with the                observation that other notch mutations affect a well defined step               in neurogenesis in the early embryo, rather than morphogenesis of               the eye.  The eye defects caused by facet mutations are less well               described; the ultrastructural analysis proposed here should                    increase our understanding of the relationship of the two                       different phenotypes associated with mutations at the notch                     locus.  Additional proposed experimentation will identify other                 genes that play a direct role in controlling the expression                     of notch, or in the function of its product.                                         One of the central aims of modern biology is to provide an                 understanding of the mechanisms that control development of                     multicellular organisms.  Study of drosophila has been one of the               most important approaches to this problem, in part because of the               powerful genetic analysis possible with this organism.  A number                of mutations which affect cellular differentiation in drosophila                are known; among these, mutations at the notch locus have been                  shown to affect the decision of certain cells in the early embryo               to form either neural or epidermal tissue.  Remarkably, some                    notch mutations, called facet mutations, instead cause defects in               the eye.  The proposed experiments will provide a careful                       analysis of these eye defects, which have not been well                         characterized previously, and of the genetic alterations which                  cause them.  In so doing, they should provide important insight                 into the kinds of mechanisms involved in the regulation of cell                 growth and differentiation.",
