 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbohydrates represent a major organic component of all                marine organisms, especially phytoplankton, and thus these                      substances constitute a large fraction of oceanic particulate                   organic matter (POM).  However, in comparison to other                          important groups of biomolecules, eg, lipids and proteins,                      surprisingly little attention has been paid to carbohydrates in                 oceanic POM.  Therefore, a study to test the following                          hypotheses:  1.  During descent of particles in the water                       column, storage carbohydrates are preferentially lost while                     structural polysaccharides are relatively  enhanced in the                      residue.  The latter compounds can be used as biomarkers, while                 loss of the former may be used to estimate the energy potential                 (caloric value) and rate of degradation of POM with depth;  2.                  Algae are the major sources of carbohydrates in the sea, but                    close to land, terrigenous sources may become locally                           important.  These inputs can be differentiated on the basis of                  their carbohydrate compositions;  3.  As a result of microbial                  degradation during descent of particles, new polysaccharides                    are formed.  These new saccharides are to a large degree                        compositionally distinct from the original materials and thus                   may be used to estimate the degree of microbial degradation                     POM.                                                                                    The study will be based largely on analyses of samples                  from sediment traps deployed as part of the VERTEX Program.                     Analytical techniques will include the use of selective                         depolymerizations coupled with high resolution GC and HPLC.                     When put in the context of the VERTEX Program, especially work                  being done on proteins, lipids, and microbial activity, the                     proposed study of carbohydrates should contribute significantly                 towards our understanding of the processes affecting fluxes of                  organic material and diagenesis in the watr column.",
