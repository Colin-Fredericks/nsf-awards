 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several naturally occurring isomers of dehydrodiconiferyl glucosides        (DCGs) can substitute for cytokinin in tobacco pith and leaf cell               division bioassays.  These DCGs have been found in Vinca rosea and              Nicotiana tabacum.  In rapidly growing crown gall tumors and non-               transformed tissues the DGCs are found in micromolar concentrations             whereas in quiescent pith tissues their levels are one hundred fold             reduced.  These results suggest that cytokinin may exert control of cell        division by regulating the accumulation and/or availability of DCGs.            The objectives of the proposed work are to: 1) determine the timing and         biochemical basis of DCG accumulation after cytokinin treatment of              quiescent tissues, 2) determine whether adenylate cytokinins are                required for DCG accumulation or vice versa, and 3) initiate studies on         the uptake and metabolism of DCGs.                                                  The stimulatory effects of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin on        cell division have been known for many years.  However, the mechanisms          by which these hormones exert their control is not known. Dr. Binns has         evidence that implicates dehydrodeconiferyl glucosides in the cell              division response to the hormone cytokinin. If this link proves to be a         causal one it will provide the first meaningful physiological link              between the hormonal signal (cytokinin) and the cellular response (cell         division).",
