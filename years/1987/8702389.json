 "awd_abstract_narration": "The single cell green alga, Chlamydomonas, has two whip-like               flagella that are used for swimming.  If the flagella are                       mechanically removed by vigorous agitation, they grow back                      rapidly.  During regrowth a family of genes that encode the                     flagellar structural proteins, alpha-and beta- tubulin, are                     activated and produce copious amounts of RNA and protein.  Once                 the flagella have completely regrown, the tubulin genes becomes                 inactive.  The objective of the proposed work is to elucidate the               molecular mechanism responsible for tubulin gene regulation.  In                tubulin gene that are necessary and sufficient for on-off                       switching. The experimental approach to be used involves gene                   transfer techniques, and the use of isolated nuclei.  The                       principal investigator also describes experiments designed to                   isolate and characterize proteins in the nucleus that bind to the               tubulin gene regulatory regions, and as a consequence, somehow                  activates or inactivates the genes.                                                  One of the central questions in biology today concerns the                 mechanism involved in the regulated expression of genes in higher               plants and animals.  This mechanism is fundamental to such                      processes as growth and development.  This proposal, then,                      approaches a timely and important problem by developing and                     exploiting a model system ideally suited for the analysis of gene               expression.",
