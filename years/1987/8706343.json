 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. John I. Bruce, Director,             Center for Tropical Diseases, University of Lowell, to conduct with             Dr. Chamlong Harinasuta, Dean Emeritus, Faculty of Science, Mahidol             University, Bangkok, a U.S.-Thailand Conference on Application of               Biotechnology to the Study of Animal Parasites and Their Vectors,               Bangkok and Chiangmai, Thailand, November 30 to December 4, 1987.               The conference will bring together 7 U.S. scientists and some 50                Thai participants/observers to exchange information and ideas on the            study of animal parasites, the complex interactions occurring                   between animal parasites and their vectors, and the application of              current biotechnology to problems involving animal parasites and                their vectors.  Two scientists each from Indonesia, Malaysia, and               the Philippines also are expected to participate.  This grant will              support only U.S. participation in the conference.                                                                                                              Scientists at Mahidol University have developed a profile of                    endemicity of the major zoonotic parasites and their vectors whose              distribution, prevalence and incidence are related to                           water-resources development.  The application of new                            biotechnological procedures could be extremely beneficial as an aid             to enhancing knowledge and devising logical approaches to                       containment of these parasitoses.  The conference will provide an               opportunity for U.S. and Thai scientists to identify priority areas             for future research cooperation in parasitology and to develop                  specific cooperative research proposals.  This project is relevant              to the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program                which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S.                   scientists and engineers and their counterparts in developing                   countries through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of                 mutual benefit.  The U.S. and Thai collaborators are highly                     respected scientists with extensive international research                      experience and productive publication records in the field of the               proposal.",
