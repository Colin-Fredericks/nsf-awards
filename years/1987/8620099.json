 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding action will provide partial support to the American                organizers and participants of the First International Conference               on Industrial and Applied Mathematics.  The conference is being                 organized jointly by four international societies, and will be                  held in La Villette, Paris City of the Sciences and Industry,                   from June 29 to July 3, 1987.                                                           The four societies -- Gesellschaft fur Angewandte Mathematik            und Mechanik (GAMM, Germany), Institute of Mathematics and Its                  Applications (IMA, U.K.), Society for Industrial and Applied                    Mathematics (SIAM, U.S.A.), and Societe de Mathematiques Appliqu-               ees et Industrielles (SMAI, France), are sharing in the planning                of the program, the implementation, and the other costs.  SMAI is               hosting the conference and Institut National de Recherche en                    Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA, France) is the conference                administrator and site manager.                                                         The program features invited presentations by leading                   international experts in topics such as advanced scientific                     computing, robotics, geometric modeling, computer aided design                  and manufacturing, discrete mathematical methods, fluid dynamics,               signal processing, control theory, biomathematics, computer                     tomography, aerodynamics, fluid dynamics and optimization.                              There will be many minisymposia and contributed papers.                 Expected attendance will be over 1200 participants.  It will be a               truly multidisciplinary event, involving applied mathematicians,                computer scientists and engineers.                                                      The local organizer INRIA expects to recover most of its                costs from conference registration fees.  The four sponsoring                   societies have agreed to seek the support of their respective                   governments to offset their own conference costs such as travel                 and per diem expenses of their respective invited speakers, other               contributing participants and program committee members, and                    other miscellaneous costs such as the preparation and                           distribution of conference materials to their own memberships.                          An important feature of this award are funds to support                 travel of fifteen young American scientists presenting papers at                the conference.  The selection of the scientists will be adminis-               tered by SIAM.                                                                          The award is split-funded by the following NSF programs:                Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, Special Projects,               Advanced Scientific Computing - Computational Science and                       Engineering Initiative, System Theory and Operations Research,                  Computer Integrated Engineering, and Automation and System                      Integration.  Program Directors for these programs jointly                      recommend this award.",
