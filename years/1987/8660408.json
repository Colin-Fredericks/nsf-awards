 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is in response to NSF Program Solicitation for Small              Business Innovation Research (NSF 86-19) and is requesting support for          Phase I research of this program.                                                                                                                               The overall goal of the proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of           measuring on-line the density of mammalian cells in bioreactor                  suspension cultures with the use of an optical sensor.  The optical             sensor is designed to be inserted into a reactor through a sampling port        and will be connected to a Helium Neon laser source and a                       microprocessor.                                                                                                                                                 Research objectives for Phase I research are as follows:                                                                                                        1. Build a prototype optical sensor as described in the proposal.               2. Test the system using plastic microspheres as test materials.                Different sizes of calibrating microspheres at various particle                 densities will be studied to optimize the technique for determination           of particle concentration and mean particle size.                               3. Obtain number density and size measurements from samples of mammalian           cells and then optimize the instrument for the range of values which           will be representative of bioreactor suspension cultures.                                                                                                     If successful, this optical sensor would be a significant new tool in           the analysis of mammalian cell cultures.                                                                                                                        The Panel reviewing this proposal rated it second of the 36 proposals           reviewed and recommended it highly for funding.  The investigators are          considered to be very capable of carrying out the proposed research and         I recommend funding of this proposal in accordance with the budget              submitted with the proposal.",
