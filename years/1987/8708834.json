 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal investigates the influence of chemical contaminants               on permeability and effective porosity of clay to predict the in-               situ input parameters of chemically contaminated clay.                          Mathematical models are adopted to solve the problems of ground                 water contamination.  The effective porosity, permeability and                  chemical dispersion coefficient of soils are the required input                 parameters for these models.  These input parameters must be                    post-contaminated in-situ measured vales.  The current in-situ                  test methods are not capable of estimating these input                          parameters.                                                                                                                                                     The electrical properties of clays will be utilized in this                     investigation.  Fluid flow occurs only between the clusters                     formed by mixing of clays with electrolytic solutions, and the                  cluster volume changes with the passage of chemicals due to                     physico-chemical interactions.  The electrical properties of soil               exhibiting such interactions can quantify the cluster volumes.                  Previous studies by the author showed the feasibilty of                         predicting in-situ permeability by determining the electrical                   properties of soil.  Therefore, the non-destructive in-situ                     electrical method will be used to predict in-situ effective                     porosity and change in soil permeability during the passage of                  chemical contaminants.                                                                                                                                          The research results will enable a better prediction of local                   contaminant plume and a prediction of regional flow computations                under certain conditions.",
