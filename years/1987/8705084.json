 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important problems in the study of solar                flares is the understanding of the mechanisms of particle                       acceleration.  An essential step in the solution of this problem                is the determination of the characteristics of the accelerated                  particles.  The characteristics observed or inferred from flare                 radiation, however, are not those of the accelerated particles                  but are these characteristics modified through interaction with                 the flare plasma.                                                                       The aim of this research is the detailed investigation of               these interactions with ambient plasma waves, particles and                     macroscopic magnetic and electric fields.  This work will find                  application also in the study of electrons in the earth's                       ionosphere and many other situations.  The results from this                    analysis are used for study of the impulsive phase gamma-rays                   hard x-ray, microwave and type III flare radiation.                                     Many of the details of interaction of energetic particles               have been analyzed under previous grants.  This grant will                      complete some of these and begin investigation of effects of the                geometry of flaring loops and their homogeneities on the                        observable quantities.  It is intended to concentrate on some                   statistical analysis of the observations and begin work on                      acceleration mechanisms, initially in a manner that will be a                   natural extension of previous studies.",
