 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Kwang Yun Lee, Electrical            Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University, to pursue                with Dr. Young Moon Park, Professor of Electrical Engineering, Seoul            National University, Seoul, Korea, for a period of 24 months a                  program of research on a new technique for optimization of long-term            power system expansion planning.  These collaborators will attempt              to determine the most economical and reliable generation and                    expansion plan in an electric power system over a long-range                    planning horizon (usually 5 to 30 years) subject to a number of                 technical, economical, and social constraints.  They will apply                 Pontriagin's maximum principle and use novel assumptions regarding              random load and characteristics of generating plants of several                 types and other assumptions regarding the transmission network in               order to simplify the problem and make it possible to develop a                 closed-form analytical production model and reliability indices                 rather than simulation models, with a considerable reduction in                 computation time, without sacrificing reliability.                                                                                                              The topics of optimal electric power generation and transmission are            most important both to countries such as Korea, where the utilities             are expected to expand rapidly, and to the United States.                       Predictions about the need for new power plants in the United States            often have been excessive and plants under construction have been               cancelled with an enormous capital loss.  This project seeks to                 develop a new method for power system planning which would be                   beneficial to the United States and Korea.  This project is relevant            to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                 which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and               Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific              information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration            on problems of mutual benefit.  The U.S. and Korean collaborators               are highly respected scientists who not only have extensive research            experience and productive publication records in the field of the               proposal but also have produced several joint publications from past            collaboration.",
