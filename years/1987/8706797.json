 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researchers propose to continue studying the low-                   latitude ionosphere and thermosphere during magnetically quiet                  and disturbed periods.  They will use the NCAR TGCM, our                        ionosphere model and satellite data in their effort to understand               the basic processes that govern the behavior of these regions.                  The model predictions will be compared to available data in order               to study the effects of winds, tides, and electric fields on the                low latitude ionosphere.  They will investigate the effects near                the equator of the high latitude energy source, as occurs during                a magnetic disturbance, as well as the presence of low latitude                 energy sources, such as neutral particle precipitation.                                 The dynamics of the ionosphere and thermosphere are of                  interest since it is in this region (above 150 km altitude) that                radio waves propagate for long distances for ground to ground                   communication, and for ground to satellite communication.  The                  winds, tides and electric fields, have important effects on                     ionospheric structure and hence on the quality and reliability of               such communication.",
