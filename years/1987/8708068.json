 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Philip Deutchman is a major contributor to the                field of heavy-ion collisions in nuclear physics, i.e., the study               of what happens when you scatter one atomic nucleus on another.                 In the last few years he has become an expert regarding the                     problem of pion production below the threshold energy from heavy-               ion collisions.  In the present proposal he plans to expand his                 work on this problem by calculating pion production through the                 mechanism of delta-hole and nucleon-hole excitations in                         peripheral nucleus-nucleus calculations.  By including quark                    degrees of freedom in his calculations, he hopes to find quark                  signatures which experimentalists could look for in heavy-ion                   collisions at intermediate to high energies.                                            One of the important fields of nuclear physics is that of               nucleus-nucleus collisions, known as heavy-ion collisions.  In                  these collisions it is possible to produce pi-mesons, also called               pions.  Professor Deutchman has been an important contributor to                the area of pion production below the threshold energy in heavy-                ion collisions.  He has developed useful computer codes for                     computing this process.  He now proposes to expand  his computer                codes to include more physical processes, such as the formation                 of delta particles in the interaction.  Quark degrees of freedom                will also be included.  This research is important in developing                a consistent theory of pion production in heavy-ion collisions                  and may predict quark signatures which could be looked for                      experimentally in intermediate high-energy heavy-ion collisions.",
