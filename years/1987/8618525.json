 "awd_abstract_narration": "World sea levels have been rising throughout this century, and                  there is a consensus that will continue to rise.  Littoral                      populations have responded in two general ways: by moving inland                and by building defenses, e.g., dykes and barrages, being both                  measures expensive and/or economically and socially disruptive.                                                                                                 The present work will explore a third option for managing the sea               level rise: the manipulation of the natural sources and sinks of                ocean water volumes by storing water in unsaturated aquifers.  It               is estimated that diversions of ocean-bound freshwater affected                 during this century has already resulted in a reduction in the                  rate of increase of the rising of sea levels.  Additional                       diversions may be an economic solution to this potentially                      catastrophic hazard.                                                                                                                                            The project will utilize geological records on moisture deficient               regions, data on the effects of natural and man-made water                      impoundments on global water balance, Landsat imagery, and                      material form the Thematic Mapper panels, in selected areas of                  the U.S., Ukraine, India, the Sahel, and Argentina.",
