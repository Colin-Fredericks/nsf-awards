 "awd_abstract_narration": "This natural products chemistry project is a collaborative                      research effort at the interface of biology and chemistry                       directed toward identifying the chemicals that marine organisms                 produced to control and defend their environment.  It is                        supported jointly by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry and               Biological Oceanographic Programs.                                                                                                                              The chemical and biological foundations of chemical defense in                  marine plants and selected marine invertebrates will be                         investigated.  The project will focus upon defining the natural                 products chemistry of \"avoided\" marine plants, gorgonian corals                 and didemnid ascidians found in the Caribbean Sea.  The natural                 functions of specific marine secondary metabolites will be                      defined.  Specific components of this project are as follows:                   (1) chemical studies of the bioactive components of \"avoided\"                   marine algae, including those of the previously un-investigated                 genera Vidalia, Wrightiella, Bryothamnion, and Trichogloea; (2)                 chemical studies of Caribbean gorgonian corals, such as those of                the genera Pseudopterogorgia, Eunicea, Lophogorgia, and similar                 investigations of \"avoided\" didemnid ascidians; (3) the                         development of a feeding inhibition bioassay, to be utilized (in                reef habitats) to measure feeding deterrence and avoidance                      phenomena; and (4) the continuation of an interdisciplinary                     program, with marine ecologists, exploring the natural functions                of marine defensive chemicals, that is their effects on feeding,                reproduction, larval settling phenomena and survival.",
