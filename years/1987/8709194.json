 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research aims to improve the architecture of sequential                decoders of both the ZJ Stack and Fano types, to exploit code                   parallelism for increased decoder speed and performance, and to                 establish an objective basis for the jump-ahead resynchronization               method often used in continuous sequential decoders.  Pipelining,               branch order and metric increment mechanizations, and a unique                  \"file-drawer\" memory for ZJ decoders are among the architectural                issues to be investigated.  A computer search using the San Diego               Supercomputer will be made to find good convolutional codes of                  rate m/n where n is moderately large and not necessarily                        relatively prime to m.  The resultant codes will be used in an                  investigation of decoder features that permit this intrinisic                   parallelism to be exploited.                                                         Acceptable compromises in providing partial branch metrics                 and rank order for decoders operating in a multiple-branch-per-                 node mode will be studied through an anlysis of the impact on the               exponental bound parameter, RO.  To determine the optimum size of               jump, the resynchronization method will be studied by simulation                using a specially constru\u001ated trial encoder circuit board.  A                   related analysis of the optimum constraint length of decoders                   will be made based on t\u001ae tradeoff between undetected error                     probablility and the error event span during resychronization.                  The research will result in improved performance of this                        important constituent of many modern telecommunication systems.",
