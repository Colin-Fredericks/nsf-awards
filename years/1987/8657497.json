 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator Award is being made to                Dr. Mark Rose, a recently-appointed Assistant Professor of                      Molecular Biology at Princeton University.  During his graduate                 and postdoctoral career at the Massachusetts Institute of                       Technology, from 1976 to 1985, Dr. Rose completed seminal and                   pioneering research on the molecular genetics of yeast.  He                     developed the idea of gene fusions for yeast in Dr. Botstein's                  lab, a technique which has now become one of the major tools in                 yeast molcular genetics.  He was also involved in the development               of the now standard Bal 31 linker-deletion technique for                        constructing hybrid genes. During that period he made a major                   discovery:  that specific mutations in the URA-3 gene were based                on the random insertion of a transposable genetic element called                TY 3.  Later, in Dr. Fink's laboratory, Dr. Rose focused his                    attention on the analysis of mutations in the genes called KAR                  (for karyogamy) which lead to defects in the fusion of nuclei                   during the cycle of sexual reproduction, called conjugation, in                 yeast.  These genes appear to specify the cytoskeletal structures               (microtubules) which are necessary for many processes including                 nuclear fusion, cell division, cell movement, and intracellular                 transport.  At Princeton he will continue to combine the very                   powerful molecular genetics of yeast with cell biological and                   biochemical techniques, in order to understand how this                         interesting and essential set of KAR genes function in the cell.",
