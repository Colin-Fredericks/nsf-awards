 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 10-15 years atmospheric chemistry has evolved from            a young research discipline devoted primarily to local problems of              urban pollution and air quality to a mature science concerned with              the hemispheric to global scale cycling of a wide variety of chemical           species.  To a large extent this change has resulted from an                    increasing realization that human activities can cause chemical                 disturbances to the natural troposphere on scales far beyond local              concerns.  Well-known examples include changes in the                           regional-to-global concentrations of certain nitrogen compounds, lead           and other heavy metals, artificial radionuclides, a number of                   synthetic organic substances, certain acid-forming species, carbon              dioxide and methane.  These chemical changes in the atmosphere can              often extend to the earth's soils, oceans, and biota far from the               original source region.  They can result in alterations in the                  earth's climate, changes in vital nutrient cycles, and impact                   significantly on the public health and quality of life on earth.                    The Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE) will be a                coordinated multi-institutional atmospheric and marine chemistry                research project centered in the North Atlantic region.  The ultimate           goal of the AEROCE project will be the development of a predictive              capability for the continentally derived species observed in the                marine troposphere over the North Atlantic.  The selection of sites             and the measurement protocol in AEROCE has been developed jointly by            modelers and field experimentalists.                                                This project is to be a meteorological research and support                 element of the Network Studies portion of the AEROCE effort.  The               specific objectives of this research element are: the determination             of the height and structure of the atmospheric boundary layer at each           site using routinely observed meteorological sounding data;                     understanding the large scale transport processes at each site for              the duration of Network sampling using isentropic trajectory analysis           techniques; and assessment of the rates of wet removal over the North           Atlantic by compiling a basin-wide rainfall climatology for the                 region.",
