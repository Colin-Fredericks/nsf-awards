 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this study is to examine several aspects of                 the evolutionary history of the jays in the genus Aphelocoma.                   Biochemical comparisons of enzymes (starch-gel electrophoresis)                 from different populations throughout the species' ranges will be               used to generate phylogenetic (genealogic) hypotheses for the                   populations under study.  Then, using those phylogenetic                        hypotheses, three other aspects of the evolutionary history of                  the genus will be investigated.  First, the historical geography                of the genus will be evaluated through an analysis of the                       relationship between phylogenetic relationship and geographic                   proximity.  Second, the processes leading to the formation of new               species in the genus will be studied by determining the amount of               genetic differentiation associated with different types of                      barriers to dispersal.  Finally, historical morphological                       characteristics will be estimated through procedures designed to                approximate the most likely sequence of evolutionary changes in                 the morphology of the species.  Thus, this study will produce                   important information on the details of the evolutionary history                of the Aphelocoma jays, information which is available for few                  avain species.",
