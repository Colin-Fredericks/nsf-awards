 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a joint project conducted by investigators on two                       University of California campuses, viz. Dr. David Jenkins at                    Berkeley in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department                  and Dr. Blaine L. Beaman in the Department of Medical                           Microbiology and Immonology at Davis.  Research will involve                    determination of the causes for growth of organisms in suspended                activated growth biological treatment system for wastewater that                are responsible for or contribute to the production and stability               of excessive amounts of foam.  The research will involve studies                in suspended growth reactors and in chemostats employing single                 and dual pure cultures.  The mean cell residence time at which                  Nocardias are washed out will be determined for a range of                      temperatures.  The effect of various substrates on Nocardia                     growth, foaming potential and cell wall composition and structure               will be determined.  The influence of dissolved oxygen                          concentration and of the installation of selector reactors on                   Nocardia growth will be determined.  The Nocardias present in the               suspended growth systems will be physiologically and                            morphologically characterized and the nature of the foaming                     principle will be determined for Nocardia growth on a variety of                substrates.",
