 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of the nitrogen cycle, which includes                            determination of reservoirs of nitrogen in the atmosphere,                      hydrosphere, and lithosphere, is hindered by limited data on                    nitrogen abundance in rocks.  Recent investigations of coal-rich                shale, illite/smectite clays, and hot spring deposits suggests                  that ammonium (NH4) bearing minerals may be much more abundant                  than previously recognized.  This research will investigate the                 geochemistry of NH4 in coal-rich shale and glauconite-bearing                   strata.  Specific goals include a better understanding of                       fluid/mineral reactions associated with coal-bearing, low grade                 metamorphic shales and with the environment of glauconite                       formation.  To achieve these goals, it will be necessary to                     characterize the mineralogy and chemistry of these strata using                 various laboratory techniques (NH4 analysis, SEM, BSEM, TEM, XRD,               XRF, and petrography) and to conduct hydrothermal experiments and               geochemical calculations that measure equilibrium constants of NH4              fixation reactions.  The results may show that NH4 - illite in                  coal-rich shale can be used as thermal indicator.  Presence of                  NH4-illite should seriously affect measurements of the illite                   crystallinity index, long used to measure the thermal maturity of               shales.  Additional results may include possible explanations for               low radiometric ages of glauconite and for differences in alkali                contents between Fe-rich illite/smectite (glauconite) and Al-                   rich illite/smectite.",
