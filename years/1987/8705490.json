 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to a Primarily Undergraduate Institution will                        support research in the general area of organometallic                          chemistry. The award will permit the participation of four                      undergraduates in the synthesis of new compounds which may be                   useful as homogeneous catalysts for structural transformations                  of organic compounds. The undergraduate participants will gain                  experience in the use of a number of essential spectroscopic                    tools, such as nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared                          spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                                   The focus of the research project is the chemical reactivity                    patterns of iron pentadienyl species, with specific emphasis on                 transformations at the metal center. The development of                         stereocontrolled carbon-carbon bond forming reactions is the                    central theme of the research. The four specific goals of the                   project are:                                                                                                                                                         1. To define the fundamental mechanistic differences                       between the pentadienyl ligand and its two isoelectronic                        counterparts, cyclopentadienyl and pi-allyl;                                                                                                                         2. To develop new synthetic routes to metal pentadienyl                    complexes which contain ancillary ligands other than neutral                    two-electron donors;                                                                                                                                                 3. To develop the first general procedures for selective                   endo substitution of (polyolefin)metal complexes;                                                                                                                    4. To provide the first general and versatile methods for                  functionalizing metal(polyolefin) complexes with electrophiles.",
