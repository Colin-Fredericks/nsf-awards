 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both novae and supernovae involve a lengthy chain of nuclear                    reactions.  We observe the end products through optical,                        ultraviolet, and gamma-ray spectral lines.  Five projects are                   specified to determine the initial chemical compositions in the                 exploding stars that will yield the final observed compositions.                The main parameters of interest are initial oxygen and iron                     abundances, details of mass transfer onto the exploding star in a               binary pair, and specific neutron donors in supernovae.                                                                                                         The Earth and life thereon are composed mainly of elements made                 long ago in exploding stars.  Many of the elements are made in                  supernovae, of which the new nearby supernova is one example.                   Recently the more ordinary novae have been recognized as                        important contributors to cosmic nuclear changes.  Modern                       observations inform us in detail what elements are ejected from                 these exploding stars.  The computing projects supported by this                grant will elucidate the original conditions of the stars and the               nuclear processes that lead to the observed elements.  The                      results will clarify both the evolution of these stars and the                  cosmic evolution of the elements.",
