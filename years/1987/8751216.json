 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop a model for the improvement of physical           science education in grades 4-8 through the development of 15 kits of           resources and materials to be used in the training of teams of science          educators who will, in turn, use the kits to enhance the physical               science background and classroom methodology of teachers in their               geographical regions.  The project is a cooperative endeavor of three           universities in geographically distinct regions of the nation:                  University of Rhode Island, Louisiana State University and San Diego            State University.                                                                                                                                               The project involves three distinct activities: 1. the development of           the kits of resources and materials by teams of scientists, science             educators and teachers;  2.  the training of 36 three member teams ( 12         from each region) in the use of the kits in their classrooms and to             provide inservice for their peers; and 3. the implementation of the             inservice programs with support from both the training staff and                regional advisory committees associated with each university site.  If          the model proves successful, future initiatives will involve the                dissemination of the model through the development of more teams                in a region or increasing the number of universities involved in the            model.                                                                          The program has the potential to make a significant national impact.                                                                                            The program is deserving of funding for the following reasons:  an              eminently qualified staff representing scientists, science educators and        exemplary classroom teachers; focus on an area and level of science             education often cited as needing improvement;  utilization of personnel         and materials from a formerly funded project which enjoys an excellent          reputation; the utilization of a \"model\" which has transferability to           other populations and areas of science; and the cooperation of several          institutions and constituencies which provides greater insurance of a           significant impact and continuance beyond the time of NSF funding.",
