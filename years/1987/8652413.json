 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor McGervey and a staff of three master secondary school physics         teachers will offer an intensive three-week course of instruction               focusing on topics in physics and physical science.  The instructional          format includes lectures, laboratory work, and group discussions.               During the following academic year, Prof. McGervey will visit each              participant in his or her home school.  In addition, there will be              monthly meetings of all project participants held at various locations          throughout northern Ohio and a full weekend program at Case Western             Reserve University.                                                                                                                                             The participants will be 25 middle school and high school physics or            physical science teachers.  They will be selected from among a                  significant number of physics teachers in northern Ohio who need                upgrading in their knowledge of fundamental principles of mechanics,            wave motion, optics, thermal physics, electricity and magnetism, and            nuclear radiation.                                                                                                                                              The evaluation plan calls for (1) subject matter testing of the                 participants (2) questionnaires exploring the opinions of participants          about the match between their needs and program emphases; (3)                   questionnaires administered at the end of the project year that                 evaluates the project's impact on the participant's students; (4)               evaluations by supervisors of the participants.                                                                                                                 The program is well designed and has produced numerous satisfied                customers during the past two years.",
