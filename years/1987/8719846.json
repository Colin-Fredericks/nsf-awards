 "awd_abstract_narration": "A neural network model for task allocation among multiple                  mobile robots is proposed.  The goal of the system is to allocated              tasks adaptively while optimizing an overall performance index and              avoiding conflicts among the robots.  Robots will be allocated to               work locations according to the activation levels of corresponding              units in the network.  Adaptiveness to environmental or internal                system changes will be achieved through a process of constraint                 propagation and relaxation.  It is proposed to resolve potential                collisions among the moving robots by analyzing a global path                   planning problem followed by a local path replanning problem.                   Structural changes in the connectionist network will provide the                information for conflict resolution in replanning to avoid                      collisions.  The usefulness of the framework for controlling mobile             robots will be demonstrated by simulation on a TI Explorer Lisp                 machine, using an object-oriented simulation language being                     developed in PI's laboratory.",
