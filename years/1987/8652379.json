 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is designed to assist the middle school science teachers of        Iowa in moving toward a curriculum emphasizing the interactions of              science, technology, and society.  During the summer of 1987 the first          60 teachers, in two sections of 30 each, will study either life science         or physical science.  The second and third summers will involve 60              teachers in pairs of workshops emphasizing life science, physical               science, or earth science, depending on demand and need.  These six-day         workshops will update participant's content knowledge and provide               opportunities to be a member of an S/T/S learning environments.                 Teachers attending the summer course will receive one semester hour of          graduate credit.                                                                                                                                                Each group of 60 teachers will be joined by an additional 60 teachers in        attending 2 two-day Chautauqua programs.  Each year four Chautauqua             Conferences will be organized for different geographical areas                  throughout the state.  The initial meeting will focus on such topics as         developing a S/T/S rationale, model teaching examples, and on evaluation        techniques.  A follow-up session six months later will review teacher           products, teaching activities, and evaluation efforts.  During the              period between Chautauqua programs follow-up will be provide by fifteen         area Education Consultants.  The area Consultants will visit Chautauqua         participants in their areas.  These follow-up visits will supplement            visits by University of Iowa staff.  In addition, a monthly newsletter          will provide continuing links to staff and other participants.  Those           attending the Chautauqua series will receive three semester hours of            credit.                                                                                                                                                         During each summer, following the NSF Summer Workshop, a one week               Leadership conference will be hosted by the various utility companies of        Iowa.  The workshop is designed to provide additional background, as            well as specific planning for the Chautauqua series held during the             following academic year.  These teachers will provide examples and              expertise in curriculum development and implementation.  One semester           hour of graduate credit will be awarded upon successful completion of           the Leadership Conference.",
