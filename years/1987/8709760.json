 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  Higher mass transfer rates can be achieved in                packed bed rotary devices where the liquid attains an acceleration              many times that due to gravity.  There are potential commercial                 applications in many fields.  The objective of the proposed                     research is to provide a rational basis for the scaleup,                        operation and design of rotary devices for gas-liquid                           contacting.  To accomplish this goal, the shape, structure,                     velocity profile and stability of liquid films in rotors of                     readily characterizable solid surfaces is first examined.                       The penetration model or the convection-diffusion model is then                 adapted to develop suitable expressions for the mass transfer                   coefficients, including a statistical model for random                          distribution of solid surfaces.  This provides a rational basis                 for scaleup.  Liquid holdup and texture in the rotating packed                  beds is measured by a modified electrical conductivity method                   thereby providing additional information on the characteristics                 of liquid film flow in these devices.                                                                                                                           Scientific Novelty.  The research has two novel features, (1)                   systematic use of sound fundamental knowledge generated in                      equipment of known geometry to generate design procedures for                   equipment which are otherwise difficult to characterize, (2)                    development of a modified electric conductivity method for                      measurement of liquid-up and texture in rotating equipment.                     Such measurements are normally difficult.                                                                                                                       Practical and Technical Impact.  The work will provide a firm                   basis for design and thereby increase potential commercial                      applications of this device.  It is expected that the device                    would find application in high purity specialty chemicals which                 cannot be often readily produced in traditional equipment.                      Another potential application is in monomer stripping in                        polymerizations.  Moreover, as one looks into the future, there                 is a need to develop equipment for gas-liquid contacting in                     outer space under reduced or zero gravity environment.  The                     proposed research will facilitate the realization of many of                    the above possibilities.",
