 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research project between         Professor Christopher T. Russell, Institute of Geophysics and Planetary         Physics, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Professor            Willibald Riedler, Institute for Space Research, Austrian Academy of            Sciences, Graz, Austria, and their respective research groups.  The             scientists will jointly study available data on the interaction of the          solar wind with small bodies in the solar system.  The scientific               objectives are (1) experimental investigations of the influence of              comets, asteroids, and meteor streams on the interplanetary medium; (2)         modelling of the potential mechanisms of interaction between the                interplanetary medium and these minor bodies of the solar system; and           (3) development of new data processing and analysis methods to improve          the investigation of events which might be caused by these interaction          processes.                                                                                                                                                      Professor Riedler and his Austrian colleagues were successful in probing        Halley's comet in 1986 with instruments on board the Soviet spacecraft          VEGA 1 and 2, and are preparing instruments for the Phobos mission to           Mars, expected to be launched by the U.S.S.R. in 1988.  Through this            U.S.-Austrian cooperative project, Professor Russell and his research           group at UCLA have access to the VEGA data from Comet Halley and to the         personnel who can assist in working with those data.  Professor Russell         also expects to have access to magnetic field data from the Soviet Mars         2, 3, and 5 missions as a result of this collaboration.  Analysis of            these latter data should lead to a greater understanding of the solar           wind interaction with Mars, as well as help prepare for future Mars             missions.  The scientists also plan to exchange modelling results and to        develop improved software for scientific analysis and on-board                  processing of data.  Professor Russell and members of his research group        have been active in observational and theoretical studies related to the        interaction of the solar wind with solar system bodies for many years.          Professor Riedler and his colleagues have been involved in parallel             studies.  Cooperation between the groups should enhance their respective        research programs considerably.  Funds from this award would support            necessary transportation and subsistence expenses for the U.S. principal        investigator and members of his research group.  The Austrian Science           Foundation (FWF) is providing counterpart support for the project and           has approved the inclusion of this activity under the Memorandum of             Understanding between the NSF and the FWF.",
