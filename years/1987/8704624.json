 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of the effects of high pressures on the rates of                        chemical reactions reveal information about reaction                            mechanisms which cannot be obtained in any other way. In                        particular, such experiments provide insight into the                           expansions and contractions which molecules must undergo in                     order to react. However, such experiments are very difficult                    and require specialized equipment available at only a small                     number of universities. The Principal Investigators are the                     only group in the United States applying such techniques to the                 study of electron transfer reactions.                                                                                                                           Volume of activation studies on outer-sphere electron transfer                  reactions will be continued and expanded.  It is planned to                     measure molar volumes in non-aqueous solvents in addition to                    doing high pressure NMR research.  The prime goal is to obtain                  volume of activation values as an aid in determining reaction                   mechanisms and testing of theories for the kinetic behavior.                    In addition, it is planned to look at solvent exchange kinetics                 and equilibria in mixed solvent and with mixed ligand systems,                  e.g. Co(II) complexes with HMPA in HMPA, or Co(II) complexes in                 water-methanol and water-ammonia mixtures.  These measurements                  will be done at various pressures and temperatures.  Besides                    kinetic data, information on solution species and structures                    will be obtained.",
