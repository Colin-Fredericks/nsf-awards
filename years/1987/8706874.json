 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Susman and his colleagues to continue                    their research on the pygmy chimpanzee (\u001aPan\u001a \u001apaniscus\u001a)\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a in the            Lomako Forest of Central Zaire. Previous work by the team has                   been hampered because of the difficulty of locating and tracking                individual animals for extended periods of time. The species is                 aboreal and the vegetation thick. With NSF support radio collars                will be placed on focal animals. These collars, which have been                 tested for safety, do not hamper the animals, and with the aid of               a receiver, will allow researchers to pinpoint the location of                  individual animals. Thus the team will acquire an accurate record               of individual and group movements to calculate home range areas                 and assess ranging behavior. These variables will then be                       correlated with resource distribution and availability.                                                                                                         The size and shape of an animal's home range and the spatial                    relationships between groups are often the starting points for                  understanding socioecology. Home range size has been a focal                    variable in studies of the adaptive significance of body size,                  group size, diet, and social organization. To understand the size               and shape of home range areas requires long term data on the                    movements of known individuals. Without these data home ranges                  can only be estimated. Unfortunately, most studies of forest                    primates rely on ranging data that is pieced together, often from               discontinuous observations on a number of individuals over an                   extended study period. This project will, for one species at                    least, remedy this situation.                                                                                                                                   This research is important because of the light it will shed on                 the earliest stages of human development. Of the extant great                   apes, the pygmy chimpanzee is nearest in size to early hominids.                Thus it provides the best baseline against which uniquely human                 triats can be compared. This work should also aid in the                        protection of this extremely rare species.",
