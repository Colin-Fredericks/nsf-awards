 "awd_abstract_narration": "Burghelea will study some aspects and implications of cyclic            homology in algebra, topology and geometry.                                             In algebra, he plans to study the cyclic homology of                    algebraic varieties and crossed product algebras associated to                  actions of groups on algebraic varieties; he will also study the                Chern character for group rings.                                                        In topology he will study the homology type of B Diff(M) in             the stability range, and at the prime 2.                                                In geometry he will study the relationship between the                  Selberg trace formula, cyclic homology and closed geodesics.                            Exploring the uses of cyclic homology will render a powerful            technique more versatile.  Ultimately applications to theoretical               physics and other consumers of higher mathematics should profit.                **8                                                                             8701643                                                                         Bergman                                                                                 Three important properties of universal algebras will be                studied:  the amalgamation property, deductiveness, and                         congruence modular varieties.                                                           The research on the amalgamation property centers on two                problems.                                                                       1.  Determination if the amalgamation property plus residual                    smallness implies the congruence extension property.                            2.  Characterization of the amalgamation bases of the variety.                          The plans for deductiveness are less specific.  The general             issue is to attempt to classify those varieties that are                        deductive.                                                                              A third avenue to be pursued is the representation problem              for the commutator in congruence modular varieties.                                     All of these topics concern the foundations of algebra and              are likely to be applied outside of algebra only to the extent                  that they condition a mode of thought about algebraic questions.",
