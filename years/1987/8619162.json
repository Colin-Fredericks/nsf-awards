 "awd_abstract_narration": "Designing a chemical process is a complex task that                        requires complex algorithms and procedures as well as a large                   body of knowledge acquired through experience.  However, the                    available computer-based chemical process design software tends                 to be analytically-based and does not take advantage of the                     knowledge of the designer, nor are most systems capable of                      explaining to the designer the reasons that a particular                        decision was made in the design.                                                     The goal of this research is to create an interactive                      computer-based design aid for chemical processes that will                      reason with partial descriptions; that will be capable of                       explaining the factors resulting in a particular decision; that                 will be able to learn from the designer; and that will take                     advantage of the large body of analytical programs that are                     already available.",
