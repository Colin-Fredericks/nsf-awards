 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will investigate two-photo absorption and         the associated self-refraction in various semiconducting materials in           bulk and thin film structures with differeing dopants and growth                techniques. The PI's will use the techniques and knowledge developed            under NSF grant ECS 8310625 to investigate new materials.  This NSF             sponsored work showed that the two-photon absorption coefficient in             undoped bulk semiconductors could be predicted to within 50% knowing            only a few material parameters. Questions still remain about the effects        of impurities and defects. Current researach has resulted in the                development of a predictive model for two-photon absorption in undoped          bulk semiconductors and the development of the photo-Hall technique to          investigate nonlinear absorption and subsequent self-defocusing.  The           possibilities of engineering the nonlinearities in semiconductors by            intentionally producing defects and adding impurities as well as using          thin-film architectures including narrow-band interference filters and          multiple-quantum wells will be investigated. The PI's will collaborate          with researchers at North Texas State University and Heriot-Watt                University, and with materials suppliers such as Hughes Research                Laboratories, Texas Instruments, Purdue University and Notre Dame               University.                                                                             This reserach intends to apply experimental techniques and              theoretical understanding developed under past NSF sponsorship to               perform an extensive study of nonlinear two-photon absorption and               associated self-refraction in a wide variety of semiconducting materials        and thin-film structures.  The results of these studies should have             broad applications to such fields as optical bistability, optical               limiting and switching, and laser-induced damage to optical materials.          Several university and industrial collaborators are supplying samples           for this research.",
