 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S. Yugoslav cooperative research                project between Vojko Antoncic of the University of Ljubljana's                 Institute of Sociology and Thomas Smith of the University of                    Chicago's National Opinion Research Center is to create a social                indicators and regulators data set comparable to the General Social             Survey (GSS) carried out in the United States by the University of              Chicago.  The GSS has been supported by NSF since 1972.  Two surveys            will be conducted in Yugoslavia: one on social microstructures                  social networks and support groups and a second in social equalities            and inequalities.  At first, Yugoslav respondents will be limited to            the Republic of Slovenia, but it is expected that the survey will be            extended to all of Yugoslavia.  This is a significant project since             collaboration with Yugoslavia will enable researchers to perform                cross-national analyses and to test the same theoretical models in              varying social contexts.  West Germany and United Kingdom are                   participants as well, but Yugoslavia is the only socialist country in           the survey.                                                                                                                                                     This project has been approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on              Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a joint             fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav            governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the                 Department of State and no NSF funds are involved.  The grants are              composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  Funds include travel for U.S. scientists to                Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'               living expenses in the U.S.",
