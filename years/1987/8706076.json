The program is designed to enable U.S.                  scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research              institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                  opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      The research project concerns attempts to quantize gravity starting             from Einstein's theory of general relativity.  Many fundamental                 problems remain unsolved.  The canonical approach of Dr. Chris Isham is         a unique attempt to address precisely those issues which are critical           to our understanding of the theory.  A recent reformulation of                  Einstein's theory by Dr. Abhay Ashtekar has enabled Dr. Lee Smolin and          the proposer to arrive at a canonical theory of gravity which has               remarkable properties.  The proposer and Dr. Isham will address these           issues.                                                                                                                                                         This project is under the direction of Dr. Paul Renteln, University of          Southern California, Los Angeles, CA  90089-0484, U.S.A., and Professor         C.J. Isham, The Blackett Laboratory, Prince Consort Road, Imperial              College, London SW7 2BZ, England.                                                                                                                               This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
