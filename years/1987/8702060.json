 "awd_abstract_narration": "This reseach will focus on several problems in applied                  probability and statistics which stem from biophysical                          experiments that aim to measure current flow through ionic                      channels in cell membranes.  This measurements are usually noisy                binary signals; the mathematical model usually used by                          neurophysiologists is that the state of the molecule is a Markov                jump process with a finite state space, and that the observed                   data is a function of that process.  The fundamental reseach                    questions are:  What may be learned about the Markov process from               the observations, and how may it be learned?  Other research                    topics in the area of nonparametric function estimation and                     smoothing will also be studied.                                                         This research is in the general area of statistical time                series analysis.  This research will focus on developing better                 methods to get information from data that can take on only one of               two values at any given time, but that can move from one state to               the other as time goes by.  Such data is a common result of                     biophysical experiments and this research promises to inhance                   and, to make more efficient, the accrual of knowledge from                      biophysical research.",
