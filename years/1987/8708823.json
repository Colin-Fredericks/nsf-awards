 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gas-driven fractures are of practical importance in the                         stimulation of gas and oil wells, rock blasting with explosives,                and the containment of underground explosions.  The modeling of                 the problem requires the coupling of two processes; gas flow and                rock fracture. Much work has been done on the formulation of the                problem, however, the numerical solution of the resulting                       equations are far from satisfactory.                                                                                                                            Recent advances in computer graphics have made addressing these                 problems much more tractable.  It is now possible to modify the                 computational mesh describing the instantaneous fracture surface                during the computation using interactive graphics.  An efficient                approach will be to develope automatic remeshing schemes for the                more common situations and to rely on the user for unusual cases.               Limiting special cases leads to robust remeshing algorithms.                                                                                                    The goal of this Engineering Initiation project will be to couple               the rock fracture finite element code with the gas flow pressure                computations and develope an interactive algorithm to simulate                  gas well explosions as an example problem.                                                                                                                      The institutional support is adequate and the P.I. is well                      experienced in the development of computational algorithms.  I                  strongly recommend support.",
