 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sheer  magnitude of the number of chemicals in use (over 60,000) and        the rate at which new chemicals are commercially introduced (200-1000           per year) requires that screening assays be developed to predict                environmental toxicity.  This research proposes to assay the                    environmental toxicity of five classes of hazardous chemicals on three          classes of microorganisms which are environmentally significant.  The           hazardous chemicals investigated will be 1) the congeneric chlorinated          phenols, 2) the congeneric chlorinated benzenes, 3) the congeneric              chlorinated aliphatics, 4) an additional selection of chemicals in the          U.S.E.P.A. Priority Pollutant list and 5) selected inorganic ions.  The         environmentally significant microorganisms will be:  1)                         Heterotrophs/activated sludge, 2) Nitrites and 3) Methanogens.                                                                                                  The principal investigator has an excellent research record and he is           highly qualified to perform the proposed work.  A two year continuing           grant is highly recommended.  This is an award of $106,440 for the first        year.",
