 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project Drs. Lipe and Bradley will continue their                       archaeological research in the Goodman Point region of the McElmo               district in Southern Colorado. In addition to numerous surface                  scatters and smaller sites, this area contains the Sand Canyon                  Pueblo, a large 13th century A.D. settlement. This apparently                   single-component single-story walled site has 250-300 surface                   rooms, ca 90 kivas, at least 14 towers, several informal plazas                 and at least one associated reservoir. Clearly it was a central                 focus for the region. During one season of field research, the                  investigators will continue excavation at the Sand Canyon site,                 survey the 7.5 km surrounding area, and excavate at two smaller                 sites which date from a slightly earlier period in time.                                                                                                        The Goodman Point region, during this period formed an outlier of               the Chacoan culture which was centered in New Mexico. This                      culture which unified a large portion of the Southwest                          U.S.A. seems to have developed quickly and then rapidly                         disappeared. Although a great deal of work has been done in the                 heartland of the Chacoan region, much less has taken place in the               outlying regions. This project should provide insight into how                  this complex, spatially extended culture arose, was maintained                  and then declined. It will provide a model of sociopolitical and                economic organization.                                                                                                                                          Anthropologists are interested in the process which leads to the                development of complex societies such as our own. Archaeological                data, because of the long term perspective they provide, offer a                unique insight into this question.",
