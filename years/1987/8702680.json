 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is in the broad area of complex algebraic                     geometry and involves three investigators.  The unifying theme of               the research is the geometry of subvarieties of moduli spaces.                  Carlson will study subvarieties of the Griffiths period domains                 i.e. variations of Hodge structures.  Clemens will consider                     subvarieties of a fixed variety and their Abel-Jacobi theory.                   Toledo will examine the metric and function-theoretic properties                of subvarieties of symmetric spaces as well as of more general                  domains.  These subjects are closely related and much work of a                 joint nature will result.                                                            The subject of this proposal is algebraic geometry, the                    study of the geometric objects obtained as the set of solutions                 of systems of polynomial equations.  The emphasis here is the                   study of their geometric (as opposed to their algebraic)                        properties. It still represents a nice blend of algebraic,                      analytic and, of course, geometric ideas. The three individuals                 work together as a powerful team to produce much of great                       interest.",
