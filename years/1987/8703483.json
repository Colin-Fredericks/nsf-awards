 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in continuum fixed-point theory, an area of             geometric topology.  The central topic is the following classical               unsolved problem.                                                                       Does every plane continuum that does not separate the plane             have the fixed-point property?                                                          Recent attempts by the principal investigator to answer this            question led to the establishment of several fixed-point theorems               for deformations and arc-component-preserving maps.  These                      results suggest a new concept involving the decomposition of a                  continuum into uniquely arcwise connected sets.  One of the                     principal investigator's goals is to establish a purely                         topological theorem based on this concept that will generalize                  the Poincare-Bendixson theorem.                                                         It is surprising that an easily formulated question about               the plane has defied solution for many years.  Techniques                       developed for its solution can be expected to be basic,                         illuminating, and employable elsewhere.",
