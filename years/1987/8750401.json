The equipment is being used by a variety of students, from first-year           Biology majors and Science Education students to advanced students              conducting independent research.  About one-half of the students belong         to an underrepresented minority -- Hispanic, Native American, or Black.         A substantial number also are non-traditional, older students acquiring         advanced education in order to enhance their ability to work in science-        or technology-related employment.  Most are women.",
