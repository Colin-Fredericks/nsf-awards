 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supercritical fluids have received widespread attention as                 processing fluids, but virtually no attention as media in which                 to carry out chemical transformations.  The potential advantages                of using a supercritical fluid reaction as a medium are that it                 may be possible to increase the selectivity of a reaction while                 maintaining high conversions, to dissolve reactants and catalyst                in a single fluid phase so that the reaction occurs                             homogeneously, and to improve or greatly facilitate the                         separation of products from reactants, catalyst, and unwanted                   byproducts by utilizing the phase behavior exhibited by the                     mixture in its critical region.  The goal of this research is to                determine how the variables in supercritical fluids affect the                  products and kinetic parameters of photoinitiated polymerization                processes.  Systematic studies to determine chain-reaction                      parameters, such as initiator cage effects, oligomer/polymer                    dispersivity, oligomer/polymer stereochemistry, inhibition rate                 constants, and initiator energy-transfer quenching parameters                   will be carried out in carbon dioxide as a function of                          temperature and pressure.",
