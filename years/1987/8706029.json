 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Frances Simes Hastings Natural History Reservation,                    founded in 1937 and operated by the University of California at                 Berkeley, serves as a field research station for studies in the                 ecology and natural history of animals and plants.  It is located               in the upper Carmel Valley 50 km southwest of Monterey,                         California.  The 900-ha site offers a complete representation of                Mediterranean habitats characteristic of the central Coast                      Ranges.  Existing facilities include office space, a dry                        laboratory, library, and residences for permanent and visiting                  researchers.                                                                         Research at Hastings is conducted by two resident                          scientists, research associates from several University of                      California campuses, students and visiting investigators.  Since                1937, over 240 publications have resulted from studies at the                   Reservation, including 43 in the last five years.  The site is                  best known for research in vertebrate ecology, but past and                     ongoing studies span a spectrum of topics in plant and                          invertebrate ecology as well.                                                        This project will provide funding to expand an existing                    office/dry laboratory building to provide additional office space               and a well-equipped, modern wet laboratory to meet the special                  needs of field research with a strong laboratory component.  In                 addition to the laboratory building, partial funding will be                    provided for a sewage system and drain field to serve the new                   laboratory, as well as selected items of vital laboratory and                   field equipment.",
