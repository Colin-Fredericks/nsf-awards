 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests an Expedited Award for Novel Research to            investigate a novel concept of a high performance, linear induction             motor (LIM) based system for transporting raw material, manufactured            parts and tools in manufacturing systems.  Existing technology for              material transmission is slow and bulky.  The proposed concept                  consists of multiple lightweight vehicles, each using a pair of                 linear induction motors for propulsion along an overhead guideway. The          vehicles would circulate around the guideway at high speeds.  A major           distinction between the proposed system and existing overhead track             systems is the very high accelerations and velocities that can be               obtained using linear induction motors.  The time between a                     request for a vehicle and the completion of the required delivery is            expected to be less than a minute over reasonable distances.  A                 prototype vehicle and guideway have been designed and constructed. The          proposed research will enable the feasibility of the concept to be              proven.  Crucial system concepts will be tested in order to                     evaluate the potential to leap-frog existing material transportation            technologies.  The results will provide an assessment of LIM                    performance and of vehicle/guideway performance and identification of           future research needs in this area.  If this work is successful, a              follow-on proposal will be submitted to address the future                      research issues.                                                                     There is a need for a raw material, manufactured part and                  tooling transmission network that has properties similar to and can be          treated logically like a data transmission network.  The                        objective of the proposed research is to prove out the feasibility of           such a system.  The benefits of the proposed system include rapid               transmission of material, just-in-time delivery, elimination of need to         buffer parts, and modularity of system design.",
