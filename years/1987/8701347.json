 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1987 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute in Elementary             Particle Physics (TASI-87) will be held during the four week                    period, July 5 to August 1, 1987 in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  The                  format and aims of the proposed TASI-87 are very similar to those               of previous TASI's, held at University of Michigan (Summer,                     1984), Yale (1985) and University of California at Santa Cruz                   (1986).  The seminars and lecture series will include four                      courses on  topics in:  (1) standard model physics, experimental                tests, future facilities and detectors, and expectations of                     physics in the TeV range; (2) strings, superstrings and other                   efforts to find theories unifying the standard model with                       gravity, and the efforts to extract predictions from these                      theoretical proposals; (3) present and future experiments and                   accelerators; (4) grand unified theories and the astrophysics-                  particle physics-cosmology connection.  Seminars on a variety of                special topics will supplement the main lecture series.  The                    local organizing committee is composed of members of the                        Theoretical Division at the Los Alamos Lab.  The lectures and                   seminars will be held on the campus of St. John's College in                    Santa Fe, which is 40 miles from Los Alamos.                                            This Institute provides a unique, crucial opportunity for               American graduate students in theoretical elementary particle                   physics to receive advanced training in the recent developments                 in this field.  Thus, the Institute is very important to the                    future strength of the field.",
