 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Crosby and Allen, with help from colleagues in Costa               Rica and Panama, will study the mosses of Central America in                    order to compile an illustrated identification guide to the                     estimated 1100 species of mosses in this tropical region.  The                  moss flora will include descriptions of all known species,                      reliable keys for their identification, illustrations of                        diagnostic morphological features, and notes on their                           geographical ranges and habitats.  The materials for this study                 comprise herbarium specimens collected in the past as well as new               collections from poorly sampled areas in Central America,                       collected with the support of other funding sources.  Computer                  facilities will be used in all aspects of the production of the                 resulting manual.                                                                       Although individually, mosses are small, seemingly                      insignificant plants, they are important in retarding soil                      erosion, in providing seed-beds and habitats for soil                           invertebrates, and in other aspects of ecosystem processing of                  materials.  They also are subjects of study into mechanisms of                  drought resistance and of pollution effects.  Provision of a                    reliable manual for the identification of Central American mosses               will facilitate such studies for tropical regions of the world.                 As well, such a manual will help stabilize the scientific                       nomenclature of these plants and provide data for assessing their               historical biogeography.",
