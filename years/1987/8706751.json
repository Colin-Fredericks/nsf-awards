 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Carl Carlson is a major contributor to problems of            interest to low-energy particle physics and nuclear physics,                    particularly regarding work on gluonic hadrons.  He proposes to                 continue his work on perturbative QCD as well as to develop a                   dedicated computer for performing lattice gauge calculations.  He               also plans to calculate the low-energy nucleon-nucleon                          interaction from a quark cluster model.                                                 In recent years nuclear physicists have become interested in            problems in the low-energy region of particle physics.  This move               has increased the interactions between particle and nuclear                     physicists concerning problems of common interest.  Professor                   Carlson has played an important role in the development of                      physics in this interface regime.  He proposes to do research                   regarding the role that the quark degrees of freedom play in                    determining the nucleon-nucleon interaction and the properties of               atomic nuclei.  He also proposes to build a computer at the                     College of William and Mary especially for performing                           calculations related to these problems.  This important research                should help to advance this forefront area of physics.",
