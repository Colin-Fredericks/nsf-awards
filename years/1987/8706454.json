 "awd_abstract_narration": "La Selva Biological Station is a lowland tropical rainforest               site in Costa Rica.  It is owned and operated by the Organization               for Tropical Studies, a consortium of over 30 US and Latin                      American universities, and plays a key role in the ecological                   training and research of the scientists of the Western                          hemisphere.  Since the initiation of improved laboratory                        facilities in 1983 and the completion of expanded living                        accommodations in 1986, La Selva has moved to a higher plateau of               research sophistication and expertise that is involving a far                   wider spectrum of biological scientists than ever before.                       Current collaborative efforts between physiological ecologists,                 population biologists, community ecologists, ecosystem                          researchers and systematists have resulted in exciting                          synergistic approaches that promise to achieve a new level of                   understanding about the tropical rainforest ecosystem.                               Collaborative research activities at La Selva have also                    inevitably led to an expanded need for analytical facilities to                 address fundamental biological questions about the tropical                     rainforest.  This project will address part of that need by                     providing funds for a 4000-square-foot, air-conditioned research                laboratory to permit plant chemistry and large-scale soil                       analyses.  Because of La Selva's ties to an increasingly larger                 proportion of the tropical research community, this facility will               benefit users from an exceptionally broad geographic and                        disciplinary spectrum.",
