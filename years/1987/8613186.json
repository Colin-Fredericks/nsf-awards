 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the investigators will take reproductive                        histories from men and women of an Indian society in Paraguay,                  in order to compare their demography with that of other hunter-                 gatherer (foraging) groups.  The PI's hope to get data on the                   births and deaths in the past few years and access local                        records on births and deaths since 1971.  They will also                        observe work patterns and social relationships among tribal                     members.                                                                                                                                                        The PI's will analyze the age-sex structure of the population,                  the causes and rates of mortality, women's fertility, men's                     fertility, and population growth rates.  They will test                         hypotheses about reproductive tradeoffs among the tribesmen,                    including the role of food sharing, the age at first marriage                   for both sexes, the interbirth interval, the sex ratio of                       offspring, step-parenting, promiscuity and spouse-sharing.                      They will also analyse the causes and consequences of                           infanticide and homicide in the population.  This research will                 contribute to the growing body of data on modern foraging                       peoples and is urgent because of the rapid disappearance of                     the foraging way of life.  Only by collecting such data while                   it is still available can scientists construct and test models                  about the demographic parameters that characterized our                         ancestors until very recently.",
