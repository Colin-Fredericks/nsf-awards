 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to undertake a preliminary examination                    of the growing use of NSF sponsored supercomputers and                          computers that may substitute for some or all of their                          functions.  The goal is to develop a research plan leading to                   a better understanding of the determinants of demand for                        large-scale computing services and better pricing structures                    to make the most efficient use of the services and their                        alternatives.  The researchers will review the extant                           literature on demand and pricing of computer services,                          develop a conceptual model of demand for supercomputing                         services, will develop pricing models appropriate to the use                    of supercomputing services, meet with knowledgeable                             individuals, and develop a full research plan.                                       NSF has an interest in the pricing and demand for                          computers for several reasons.  First, NSF supports                             university-based supercomputer centers.  There soon may be                      demands for more computer time than these centers can supply                    and some price or non-price rationing scheme will be needed.                    Second, supercomputers may involve transferring large volumes                   of input or output between remote users and a central                           computer, so network congestion and usage charges may be                        significant. Third, NSF grants often include an element for                     computer usage; so NSF has an added interest in efficient and                   equitable pricing policies for all types of computer                            services.",
