 "awd_abstract_narration": "Develop and extend the concepts of sketch and categorical theory as a           tool for the specification and precise description of data types and            the syntax and semantics of computer languages.  The sketch gives a             formal finite specification of a data type or language construct, or of         a whole language.  Categorical semantics includes:  initial algebra             semantics, greatly generalizing the work of Goguen; the categorical             theory generated by the sketch, which encapsulates the whole language           implied by a sketched specification; and models in the categorical              sense as functors.  Specific tasks will include: (a) Using FS sketches          with multiple initial algebras as models for data types with overflow.          (b) Using sketches to specify a functional programming language, which          will involve understanding (c) the correct place in the hierarchy of            types of sketches and theories for such descriptions, and (d)                   the correct abstract semantics and its connection with computable               semantics. (e) Understand how the recursive definition of data types            can be sketched. (f) Understand the way functions as first class                objects and the resulting cartesian                                             closed category interacts with the use of sketched specifications and           with the semantics. (g) Formulate the correct definition of                     \"environment\" in this context. (h) Analyze an existing functional               programming language using these techniques. (i) Develop a prototype            implementation of a categorical computer language.",
