The materials will            focus on the specific needs identified by the Underprepared Math Teacher        Assessment Project and will include: (1) video lecture and discussion           presentations enhanced with computer graphics; (2) videos of model              lessons conducted by exemplary middle and junior high school teachers;          (3) videos analyzing problems and situations commonly confronted by             middle and junior high school math teachers; (4) guidebook with                 exercises, explanations, and resource information to be used in                 conjunction with the videos. These tapes will have open and closed              caption for use by hearing impaired teachers.                                                                                                                   This Utah State University project involves classroom teachers, local           school districts, Utah Office of Education and  national review boards.         There is significant cost sharing by the school districts, the State of         Utah and the university.",
