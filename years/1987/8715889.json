The research project is                  in the general area of bioinorganic chemistry and is concerned                  with the active site structures of metalloenzymes and with the                  factors which determine the rates of electron transfer between                  metalloproteins. To probe the effects of distance on rates of                   electron transfer, general reactions will be developed for the                  carbodiimide-assisted attachment of redox active transition                     metal complexes to lysine, glutamate, or aspartate residues of                  cytochrome c. This approach will generate a number of                           singly-modified derivatives with varying distances between the                  heme and the attached complex, so that measurement of                           intramolecular electron transfer rates will yield the distance                  dependence of that rate. This approach will be extended to                      other proteins such as myoglobin and other cytochromes. Another                 subproject will involve spectroscopic characterization of the                   Ni-containing prosthetic group of S-methyl coenzyme-M                           reductase, the enzyme which catalyzes the production of methane                 in the energy-producing cycle of methanogenic bacteria. The                     nature of the axial ligands bound to Ni in the enzyme will be                   determined using magnetic susceptibility, NMR, resonance Raman                  spectroscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy.",
