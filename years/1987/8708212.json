 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic considerations permeate the ways in which different laws or            rules relate to various aspects of corporate control.  Despite the              fact that rules influence corporate behavior and the structure of the           market, systematic theoretical and empirical work is far too scarce.            Dr. Bebchuk seeks to investigate the influence of economic factors in           this area by means of the development of several theoretical models to          examine 1) how laws or rules with respect to fee-shifting affect the            incentive to sue; 2) the way in which scope of the liability for losses         due to breach of contract is affected by situations in which the buyer          places a high value on contract performance (a value that the seller is         unaware of) and where there are transaction costs in determining that           value; 3) a new method for corporate reorganization which overcomes             what are now thought to be problems inherent in the reorganization              process; 4) how alternative rules for allocating costs incurred in              proxy contests may be utilized to provide input to the evaluation of            possible changes in the law governing the financing of proxy contests;          5) the interpretation of charter provisions of management powers and            duties; and 6) a normative standard for evaluating legal rules                  governing corporate acquisitions.  A young, productive scholar with a           concern for making his results accessible to both legal scholars and            economist, Dr. Bebchuk is especially well situated to contribute to             illuminating the interface between law and economics in the area of             corporate control.",
