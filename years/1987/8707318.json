 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to create and analyze new estimates of           gross national product for the U.S. for the period 1834-1928.  As a             first step, the study will involve an extensive analysis of the                 accuracy of current GNP estimates for that period.  Preliminary                 research suggests that the estimates greatly exaggerate the size of             business cycles because very volatile production series are used to             interpolate between benchmark GNP estimates.  This research is                  important because it will provide new insights into the nature and              causes of business cycles both in the past and in the modern era.               Furthermore, this study will also provide a better understanding of how         the economy has changed over time and how those changes affect                  macroeconomic performance.                                                                                                                                      In order to deal with the excess volatility in the existing data                series, regression procedures will be used to convert available                 fragments of production data into new estimates of gross national               product.  Explicitly accounting for the differences in volatility               between GNP and the interpolating series will yield estimates of GNP            for the 19th and 20th centuries that represent cyclical movements much          more accurately.  This new data series will be used to measure the size         of business cycle fluctuations and to estimate the cyclical behavior of         prices over this period.",
