 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past few decades, it has become increasingly common for                people to set forth for remote, harsh, and potentially dangerous                environments in the interests of science, commerce and national                 defense.  The focus of this conference is on innovative behavioral              research pertaining to psychological and social adaptation to the               antarctic, and by analogy, to outer space and other potentially harsh           environments.  The meeting will provide an opportunity for a diverse            group of behavioral scientists, antarctic researchers, operational              personnel, and space scientists to discuss common interests and future          plans.                                                                                                                                                          The conference will specifically explore the application of recent              theories and methods to understanding life in Antarctica and analogous          settings.  Experienced participants will be encouraged to identify              critical research needs for behavioral research within isolated and             confined settings and to apply the results of behavioral research               findings to future polar and spaceflight operations.  A report of the           proceedings will be produced which will include a synthesis of                  recommended future research directions in this area of scientific               activity.                                                                                                                                                       The Polar Biology and Medicine Program recommends support of this               conference.  The National Space and Aeronautics and Space                       Administration is providing joint support of the conference.",
