 "awd_abstract_narration": "Foraminifera are single-celled animals which secrete a calcareous               shell.  From previous studies of McMurdo Sound, it seems clear that             foraminifera have a large effect on the biological dynamics in shallow          water populations.  They are present in great numbers, which also               translates into considerable biomass, and are capable of rapid growth on        a variety of food sources.  They must be an important part of the               benthic meiofauna, which is itself a vital part of the benthic marine           ecosystem.  The objectives of this research are to study the                    distribution and ecology of important shallow-water Antarctic benthic           foraminifera, their predatory activities, including the kinds of prey           they consume, and how they modify the structure of the benthic                  meiofaunal community.  Their predation on the larvae of large benthic           animals will also be studied, because they may well control the size of         adult populations in this way.  A series of experimental techniques will        be employed, including:  manipulation of abundances in the field to             monitor effects on the rest of the system; the release and re-capture of        marked individuals in the field; and the establishment of laboratory            microcosms, which can be continuously observed and manipulated at               will.  The research will provide a deeper appreciation of the role of           benthic foraminifera in the communities in which they are abundant.",
