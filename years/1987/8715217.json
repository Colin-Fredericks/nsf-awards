 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop a mathematical theory for       the analysis and control of discrete event systems (DES).  DES arise            in a variety of areas including, for example, multi-robot systems,              manufacturing systems, data bases, distributed computing, pattern               recognition, distributed and hierarchical optimization, and the higher          level intelligent control of complex processes.  The main thrust of             the research is to develop a 'real-time' extension of supervisory               control theory for DES.  This will extend its scope by addressing two           issues of great interest in applications:  timing and performance.  In          addition, the research will expand upon and continue work on modular            supervisor synthesis; distributed and hierarchical supervisors;                 structured controllers and aggregated models; the complexity of                 supervision, and forcing controls.  The relationship of the                     supervisory control framework to other models (e.g., the max-algebra            model, and stochastic models) will also be investigated with the aim            of unifying, to some extent, the tools available for the study of               discrete-event systems.",
