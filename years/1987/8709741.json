 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many difficult problems require the analysis of a large number of               subproblems and the subsequent combining of the results to form an              overall solution.  The quality of the solution depends both on how well         and how fast this analysis is done.  A fast and effective method for            performing such analyses in the domain of chess has been described and          a prototype implemented in the Hitech chess machine.  Hitech, which has         surpassed all previous efforts in computer chess by more than 150               rating points, has demonstrated the power of this method in a limited           problem domain.  However, there remains the open question about the             applicability of this evaluation method to other problem areas.                                                                                                 The focus of this research is to better understand the power and                generality of this architecture with respect to other problems in               Artificial Intelligence and on its development of the tools with which          new instances of this hardware can be built for other problems.  The            first goal is being pursued by performing case studies in a number of           promising problem areas and proposing solutions based on this                   architecture.  At the same time a general evaluation chip is being              designed and implemented that will be targeted for Hitech, but will             include the features common to any evaluation chip.  The second phase           of the research is taking a solution proposed in one of the case                studies and constructing a prototype using the tools developed during           the design of the first evaluation chip.                                        The project focuses on generalizing a problem solution approach found           effective in one problem area to a broader class of problems and                evaluating its effectiveness in these new areas.  The approach combines         this powerful solution approach with modern VLSI technology to produce          a unique problem solution capability.",
