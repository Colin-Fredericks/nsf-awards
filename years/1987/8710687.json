 "awd_abstract_narration": "Specific disease resistance is manifested by a                             hypersensitive response (HR) to the pathogen that includes                      localized necrosis, production of phytoalexins, and changes                     in cell wall structure.  Specific R/A mediated HR's often                       differ phenotypically, even among congenic lines of plants.                     This observation suggests that an R/A gene interaction does                     not simply trigger a universal plant defense response.                          Instead, the defense response may, in part, be uniquely                         specified by the interactive R/A gene pair.  This hypothesis                    will be tested by comparing, at the molecular genetic level,                    two specific R/A gene interactions in the Capsicum                              annuum/Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria interaction                       (bacterial leaf spot disease of green pepper).  As part of                      this comparison the specific R genes will be identified and                     cloned.  Once a specific resistance gene is cloned many                         experiments can be done that will elucidate the mechanisms of                   specific disease resistance.                                                         If a specific resistance gene can be cloned and                            characterized, a major breaktrhough will occur in our                           understanding and ability to control disease in plants.  But                    even if a specific gene cannot be identified, a detailed                        comparison of two different R/A gene interactions at the                        molecular genetic level will provide insight into how                           specific resistance is conferred.",
