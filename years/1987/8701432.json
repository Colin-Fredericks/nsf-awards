 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will look at the economic, political, and                 social position of a traditional landowning elite in northeastern               Brazil.  The researcher will analyze the changes that have taken                place within this group as a response to increasing                             industrialization, the concentration of money, and the                          development of regionalism in the market that are occuring in                   Brazil.  Specifically the student will look at how the landowning               elite has changed in its relationship to other groups in the                    region and in the nation as a whole.                                                    This research is very relevant to the situation in                      developing countries all over the world with special emphasis on                South America.  The researcher will be able to answer questions                 about how families and groups have strategies for resource                      investment and their use, and will look at the political                        implications, especially the impact of new democratic structures,               on such strategies.  This project will have implications for                    developmental projects by focusing on the groups that control                   regional resources.",
