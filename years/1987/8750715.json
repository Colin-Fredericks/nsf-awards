 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematics department at Grinnell College will develop a                   Mathematics and Computing Lab in which students use software packages           that strengthen mathematical intuition and insight by representing              mathematical ideas and objects (such as functions, matrices,                    differential equations, infinite series, computer programs, and                 algorithms) in a variety of forms that permit them to be manipulated and        experimented with.  The objective is to promote the kind of direct              acquaintance with and understanding of these mathematical objects that          professional applied mathematicians and computer scientists have                traditionally acquired through long experience or unusual insight, and          have more recently begun to develop more quickly through software tools.        Specifically, the software will include packages for graphical display          and manipulation of functions and algorithms, numerical approximation,          and symbolic algebra.                                                                                                                                           The computer system used will consist of a Sun 3/160S  file server, a           large disk and tape system, and eight Sun 3/50M workstations.  The              workstations in the lab will be connected to a departmental local area          network, which will give faculty and students equal access to all               resources and enable them to exchange information from the lab, faculty         offices, and classrooms.",
