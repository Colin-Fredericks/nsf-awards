The program is designed to enable U.S.                  scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research              institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well          as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.  Exchange awards provide                  opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of          unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                  conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to             his/her field of science, the prospective potential of the applicants           for professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering         of international cooperation in science and engineering.  The program           is particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking          on their research careers.                                                                                                                                      This research project will address questions on the taxonomy and                molecular evolution of Penicillium species.  The proposer's study of            four heterothallic Neuspora species employed restriction endonuclease           mapping of mtDNA.  The preliminary application of this technique to             Penicillium species has shown high variability among closely related            species.  It is felt that the examination of conservative regions of            mtDNA and nuclear DNA by restriction mapping and direct sequencing will         contribute to answering questions about organismal and molecular                evolution in the genus Penicillium.                                                                                                                             The project is under the direction of Dr. John W. Taylor, Department of         Botany, University of California at Berkely CA 94720, U.S.A., and               Dr. John I. Pitt, Senior Principal Research Scientist, CSIRO Food               Research Laboratory, P.O. Box 52, North Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia.                                                                                              This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,              international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat            administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
