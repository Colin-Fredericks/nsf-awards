 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main theme of Professor Miller's research is to                     understand the primary processes involved in electron transport                 and energy transport in condensed media.  Currently, his group is               investigating the dynamics of interfacial electron transfer at a                single crystal liquid interface and the subsequent effect of the                charge transfer on the solution structure.  The time resolved                   dynamics of this process are intimately related to the mechanism                for the electron transfer step, a detailed understanding of which               is important both for its fundamental nature and its application                in surface chemistry.                                                                                                                                                   Interfacial electron transfer occurs on a picosecond                    timescale (10-12 sec) over spatial dimensions of only a few                     angstroms.  In order to study this phenomenon, they are taking                  advantage of recent developments in picosecond laser spectroscopy               and semiconductor technology.  With the advent of efficient                     semiconductor liquid junction photovoltaics, it is now possible                 to optically trigger the interfacial electron transfer process                  with high quantum yield.  Ultrasensitive techniques such as                     picosecond transient grating or electro-optic sampling are being                used to selectively study, in-situ, the electron transfer                       dynamics.  Studies in the future will involve the use of                        recently-developed quantum well semiconductor liquid junction                   devices that provide monoenergetic electrons to study exclusively               the phenomena of outer sphere (solvent) or inner sphere                         (intramolecular) repolarization that accompanies electron                       transfer at a liquid interface.  The ultimate goal is to provide                a detailed study of interfacial electron transfer dynamics which                will serve as a valuable testing ground for microscopic models of               electron transfer.                                                                                                                                                      Concurrently, Professor Miller is interested in how excess              energy is repartitioned during an exothermic reaction in the                    solution phase.  This interest is intimately linked to his                      optical studies of interfacial electron transfer which involves                 dissipation of 1 eV excess energy on an extremely fast timescale.               Vibrational energy relaxation pathways to the solvent lattice are               very different for different molecular systems.  These                          differences are only now beginning to be understood.  New                       approaches to this problem involve the use of picosecond                        transient thermal grating formation and Antistokes Raman studies                of vibrationally highly excited molecules.",
