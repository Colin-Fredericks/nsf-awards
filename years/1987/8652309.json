 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide an opportunity for three weeks of con-                centrated study of electricity and magnetism for 30 Wisconsin high              school teachers of physics and/or physical science.  The schedule calls         for lecture/discussion sessions as well as laboratory work.  The                instructional staff includes two University physics professors and one          master teacher from a nearby high school; in addition, scientists from          local industries will participate.                                                                                                                              As part of the follow-up activities, the workshop director will visit           the classrooms of the teacher participants during the spring following          the summer workshop.  In addition the participants will meet during the         spring meeting of the Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers to discuss          their experiences in implementing the new material covered during the           workshop into their regular courses.                                                                                                                            The evaluation plan calls for several different activities.  First, the         workshop will be visited and assessed by the Science Supervisor from the        State Department of Public Instruction.  Second, an opinion survey will         be completed by participants near the end of the workshop.  Third, the          project director will assess the impact of the workshop on teaching             practices during the on-site visits and the spring meeting.  Finally, a         questionnaire completed by participants during the academic year after          the workshop will determine the extent to which ten specific project            goals were achieved.                                                                                                                                            The dissemination plan will also be completed in four steps:                                                                                                        1)   The project director will report results at a convention of the                 Northwest Wisconsin Education Association.                                 2)   Reports will also be given at meetings of the Wisconsin Society                 of Science Teachers and the American Association of Physics                     Teachers.                                                                  3)   The instructional materials used during the workshop, all                       developed locally specifically for this workshop, will be                       supplied to interested teachers on request.                                4)   Participants will be encouraged to write articles about the                     influence of the workshop on their teaching for professional                    journals.                                                                                                                                              This is a well-designed project.  It promises to make a major impact on         high school physics teaching in Wisconsin.  In addition, it includes            several innovative features, and the evaluation plan is sufficiently            thorough to allow assessment of the effectiveness of these innovations.",
