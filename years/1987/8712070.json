 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Drs Todd and her colleagues to conduct                       metallurgical analyses on a large series of samples from Eastern                Europe. These include copper ores, lead ores, slags, copper                     artifacts and crucibles. Most of these are securely dated to the                Neolithic period. The investigators will employ microstructural                 observation using optical and scanning electorm microscopy to                   make detailed characterizations. Electron probe microanalyses                   will also be conducted and if appropriate further Positron                      Induced Xj. ray Emission studies will be used. On this basis it                 should be possible to determine if the slags and metals produced                are consistent with the ore samples and whether deliberate                      additions of fluxing agents appear to have been made. In order to               gain familiarity with the conditions required for copper and lead               smelting, laboratory experiments will be undertaken using copper                carbonate, sulphide and lead minerals.                                                                                                                          This research has two goals. The first is to trace the process by               which metallurgy developed in Eastern Europe. Given the                         investigators excellent access to relevant collections, they have               ammassed a series of samples which should allow them to address                 this question. The second goal is methodological. Because                       smelting, by its very nature, changes the composition of                        materials, it is very difficult to relate finished products                     either to the possible ores from which the metal is derived or                  the slag which is the byproduct of the smelting process. This                   project will attempt to develop means to accomplish this.                                                                                                       Archaeologists want to understand how complex societies such as                 our own appear and are maintained. While many factors are                       involved, the development of technological competence plays a                   major role. In this context the ability to smelt metals is                      important. This study will not only develop analytic techniques                 applicable in a wide range of situations, but also shed light on                the development of social and technological complexity.",
