 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant allows Dr. Jorde and his collaborators to continue                   their analysis of Finnish population records which cover the                    period from the seventeenth through the twentieth centuries.                    These data are valuable not only for what they show about                       population distribution and the social class of individuals but                 because of the information they provide about marriage partners.                It is possible for example to determine the distance between                    mates' birthplace. This allows population movement over time to                 be determined. What is even more interesting is the fact that                   marriages between close relatives can also be tracked. For                      example when first cousins wished to marry, a royal dispensation                was required and these were recorded and saved.                                                                                                                 The project has three goals: 1: to determine spatial and temporal               variation in inbreeding rates based on royal dispensation                       records; 2: to search for the causal variables which determine                  the spatial and temporal variation in inbreeding rates. A number                of specific hypotheses will be tested; 3: to compare inbreeding                 patterns with spatial variation in the frequencies of autosomal                 recessive diseases.                                                                                                                                             This research is important because it will shed additional light                on the determinants of human breeding patterns. It will also help               to explicate the relationship between inbreeding and recessive                  diseases. Finland has very high frequencies of at least 26                      recessive diseases which are extremely rare elsewhere. By                       examining inbreeding in Finland one can help determine whether                  this disease distribution is due to founder effect, genetic drift               or to inbreeding.",
