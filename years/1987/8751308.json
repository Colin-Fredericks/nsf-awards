 "awd_abstract_narration": "An analysis of need of groups revealed that science teachers need               additional training to effectively teach ecological concepts,                   principles, related process skills and environmental issues to their            students.  To help meet this specific need, an ecological institute is          being offered for twenty-five middle grades and high school teachers per        year for two years.  The proposed objectives of the institute are:  (1)         To develop and assess a course in ecology for science teachers that             emphasizes acquisition of concepts, principles, and inquiry processes;          (2) To teach the course to selected teachers using the Keller Plan and          modular techniques for acquiring an understanding of environmental              issues, ecological knowledge, and process skills; and (3) To provide the        teachers with ecological activities that permit \"hands-on\" experiences          in studying, collecting, identifying and preserving terrestrial and             aquatic organisms.                                                                                                                                              To ensure the achievement of the objectives, the institute will be              conducted for six weeks each year during the summer (8:00 a.m. Mondays -        5:00 p.m. Fridays) and during the academic year.  The institute will be         composed of two segments.  The first will occur on Albany State                 College's campus and on Sapelo Island, Georgia.  During the first four          weeks of the summer, participants will be engaged in the modular/               discussion part of the course, including laboratory activities.  The            last two weeks will involve activities conducted at Georgia Marine              Institute on Sapelo Island.  The second segment of the institute                (workshops) will be conducted at the schools of the participants during         the following academic year.  During this time, the institute staff will        teach ecological concepts and process skills of the institute to the in-        service teachers' colleagues.  Additionally, at these workshops, the            staff will conduct local field trips for the teachers, and provide              advice to them while they develop teaching materials that reflect               information learned in the institute.",
