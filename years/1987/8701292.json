 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 10-15 years atmospheric chemistry has evolved from            a young research discipline devoted primarily to local problems of              urban pollution and air quality to a mature science concerned with              the hemispheric to global scale cycling of a wide variety of chemical           species.  To a large extent this change has resulted from an                    increasing realization that human activities can cause chemical                 disturbances to the natural troposphere on scales far beyond local              concerns.  Well-known examples include changes in the                           regional-to-global concentrations of certain nitrogen compounds, lead           and other heavy metals, artificial radionuclides, a number of                   synthetic organic substances, certain acid-forming species, carbon              dioxide and methane.  These chemical changes in the atmosphere can              often extend to the earth's soils, oceans, and biota far from the               original source region.  They can result in alterations in the                  earth's climate, changes in vital nutrient cycles, and impact                   significantly on the public health and quality of life on earth.                    The Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE) will be a                coordinated multi-institutional atmospheric and marine chemistry                research project centered in the North Atlantic region.  The ultimate           goal of the AEROCE project will be the development of a predictive              capability for the continentally derived species observed in the                marine troposphere over the North Atlantic.  The selection of sites             and the measurement protocol in AEROCE has been developed jointly by            modelers and field experimentalists.                                                This element of the AEROCE research project is designed to                  measure: (1) the concentration of 210Pb and 7Be in all aerosol                  samples collected as part of the standard AEROCE protocol at all                sites, (2) the monthly deposition flux of 210Pb and 7Be to all sites            and (3) the long term mean deposition rates of 137Cs and 210Pb to               soils at a majority of the sites.  These nuclides have well known               sources and do not undergo chemical transformations.  This research             seeks to achieve 5 objectives: (1) The observed concentrations and              deposition of these nuclides will be used to test and refine both               event-oriented and climatological numerical models of atmospheric               transport. (2) The correlations between the radionuclides and other             species will be used to infer the sources of the other species and of           seasonal changes in source or transport.  (3) The ratio of deposition           rate to surface air concentration will be used to quantify the                  efficiency of transfer of aerosols to the surface.  (4) The 7Be/210Pb           ratio will be developed as a measure of vertical mixing in the                  troposphere.  (5) Comparison of 7Be/210Pb in air and deposition will            help quantify both the absolute value and the vertical variation of             these elements.",
