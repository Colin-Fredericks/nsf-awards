 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network location problems involve locating one or more new facilities           on a network, such as a transport network, when costs of some sort are          incurred which are proportional to network travel distances between new         facilities and existing facilities on the network, as well as possibly          to distances between new facilities.  The new facilities are to be              located on the network so as to minimize an objective function.  There          may also be distance constraints imposing upper bounds on how far apart         facilities can be.  The principal approach to solving such problems in          the past, when the problems have been continuous (considering all               possible locations on every link) has been to exploit network                   structure.  Recently it has been shown that many such continuous                problems may be formulated as mathematical programming problems                 (well-defined mathematical optimization problems).  This research will          focus on solving continuous network location problems by exploiting             connections with mathematical programming.  Since the latter field is           quite highly developed, the opportunities for improving our ability to          solve network location problems appear very promising.",
