 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is a genetic approach to understanding               the biosynthesis and action of the golgi apparatus in yeast.                    The sec14 mutation, which causes an apparent block in golgi                     function at high temperature, will be used to identify other                    genes whose products contribute to correct function of the golgi.               Mutations (glg) which suppress the effect of the sec14 defect                   will be isolated and characterized.  Two classes of such                        mutations are expected: those that obviate a need for the sec14                 product, and those which allow the mutant product to function.                  Preliminary data shows that glg mutations occur in at least four                different complementation groups.  None of the supressors so far                identified are intragenic; some are themselves conditional                      lethals.  Using these mutations as starting material, the glg                   structural genes will be isolated and characterized.  Genetic and               cytological techniques will be used to examine the role of the                  glg products in normal golgi function. Secretion of proteins by                 eukaryotic cells proceeds via an elaborate series of membranous                 structures in the cell.  Following their synthesis on the                       endoplasmic reticulum, proteins that are to be secreted move to                 the golgi apparatus, where they are subject to a variety of                     modifications, and then move on to the surface of the cell.                     Knowledge of golgi function has been largely obtained through                   cytological observation of cell types that are poorly adapted to                genetic manipulation.  Recent work has established the utility of               yeast as an experimental organism for the study of protein                      secretion, and a number of mutations which affect the process                   have been isolated.  The proposed research makes use of a yeast                 mutant which is defective for golgi function at high temperature.               Selection of second-site mutations which restore function will be               used to identify other genes whose products participate in the                  assembly and function of the golgi.  These studies should provide               important knowledge about a fundamental aspect of cellular                      physiology.",
