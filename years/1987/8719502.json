The Principal Investigators' use                   the CRAY-XMP as a yardstick and compare this to the leading                     commercially available parallel machines including the                          hypercube, and other distributed memory, VLIW and Shared                        Memory architectures.  The study will involve leading                           computational scientists in each field and experts in                           specific machine architectures.  These will be interfaced by                    groups at Caltech and at the San Diego Supercomputer Center,                    San Diego, experienced on using and optimizing                                  implementations on vector and parallel computers.  This will                    be a one-year pilot project that will develop methodology for                   larger scale performance evaluation for advanced architecture                   computers and begin to gather the data needed to compare the                    price-performance of emerging supercomputer architectures                       with that of current supercomputers.                                                                                                                                    The Program Director for Computational Science and                      Engineering recommends support in the sum of $195,700 for a                     period of one year.",
