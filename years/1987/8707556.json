 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the Heceta Limestone, which is               a deposit of Early-Late Silurian age preserved within an ancient                island arc sequence in southeastern Alaska.  This formation                     occurs within the Alexander Terrane, which is one of the many                   accretionary terranes forming part of the continental margin of                 western North America.  A main objective of this research is to                 determine the depositional environments represented in the                      Heceta Limestone.  Documentation of the lithofacies and                         biofacies will be based on petrologic, petrographic, and                        paleontologic data derived from rock samples and fossils                        collected mainly on Heceta, Kosciusko, Marble, Orr, Tuxecan,                    and Prince of Wales Islands.  Another major goal of this                        project is to determine the paleoecology of the preserved                       macroinvertebrate populations, in particular the brachiopod-                    dominated communities, and the paleobiogeographic affinities of                 these faunas.                                                                        The development of a model that explains the provincial                    affinities of the fossil assemblages that occur in the Heceta                   Limestone and the evolution of the paleoenvironments these                      faunas inhabited should aid in refining our understanding of                    the island arc system preserved in southeastern Alaska.  The                    results of the proposed research should also help to define                     more completely the geotectonic history of the region and lead                  to a better assessment of paleogeographic and paleobiogeographic                reconstructions of the Alexander Terrane.",
