 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current national policy requires wildlife investigators to submit               research protocols that involve vertebrate animals to institutional             Animal Care and Use Committees (ACUCs) for review of animal welfare             concerns.  As of fall 1987, criteria for this review will include               research guidelines on mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, and             fish, under development by professional field research societies.  This         conference session provides a unique opportunity for representatives of         the societies and ACUCs to meet to 1) make known new wildlife                   guidelines to the people who will be using them, 2) help familiarize            current ACUC members (who are mainly laboratory animal investigators)           with field research needs, 3) address ethical comparisons of the study          of wild and laboratory animals, and 4) help educate field investigators         to the institutional committee review process.   Conference                     participants will be ACUC members, field and biomedical researchers,            veterinarians, and ethicists.  The conference is organized by the               Scientists Center for Animal Welfare in cooperation with Rockefeller            University.  The proceedings will be published.                                                                                                                 This project provides an important and cost-effective forum for                 discussion and dissemination of information on animal research ethics.          The investigator, panelists, organizational auspices, and dissemination         plans are excellent.  Support in the amount of $14,227 is granted.",
