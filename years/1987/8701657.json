 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Reyman to study and prepare for                          publication notes, and cultural and archaeological materials                    included in the Geroge H. Pepper collection. George Pepper died                 in 1924 after an anthropological career which spanned almost                    thirty years. He conducted extremely important archaeological                   excavations at Pueblo Bonito, a large prehistoric site in New                   Mexico and at other sites in the U.S. Southwest. As part of his                 ethnographic work, he conducted studies among the Pueblo and                    Navaho peoples and collected a wide range of artifacts. His notes               include detailed descriptions of manufacturing processes and                    native terminology. However he published relatively little of                   this data and his notes and artifacts are scattered across a                    number of U.S. institutions.                                                                                                                                    Dr. Reyman has studied much of these materials and transcribed                  Dr. Pepper's notes. This grant permits him to complete this task.               He will focus on the one remaining collection which he has not                  examined. This is stored at the Middle American Research                        Institute at Tulane University. This will allow him to 1:                       complete an inventory and analysis of Pueblo and Navajo                         ethnographic materials; 2: integrate this information with                      previously collected data to produce a comprehensive catalogue of               Pepper's archaeological and ethnographic collections and; 3:  use               recently discovered unpublished archaeological materials from                   Chaco Canyon to publish a revised report on Pueblo Bonito and a                 new synthesis of Chacoan prehistory.                                                                                                                            This research is important because it will provide scholars with                access to primary ethnographic and archaeological data no longer                obtainable through fieldwork. As the costs involved in field                    research increase and as it becomes more difficult to work with                 traditional peoples, material such as Pepper's gains in                         importance. It is essential that it be catalogued and described                 before it is lost.",
