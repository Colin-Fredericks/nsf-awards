 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supported by an interagency agreement with                 the Department of Education.  It is awarded to Columbia Teachers                College to host the 1987 General Assembly meeting of the                        International Association for the Evaluation of Educational                     Achievement (IEA).  IEA is a non-profit international educational               research association that conducts multi-national studies of                    precollegiate achievement of students in various school subjects.               The United States is one of the founding members of IEA and has                 participated in virtually all of its studies.  The results of IEA               studies have furnished important information to educators and                   policy-makers in the United States.                                                  The annual meeting of the General Assembly of IEA is where                 key decisions are made with regard to what studies will be                      undertaken, the nature of such studies, as well as to review                    current work and conduct organizational business.  Countries take               turns hosting IEA General Assembly meetings.  Recent meetings                   have been held in New Zealand, Singapore, and the Netherlands.                  The United States last hosted an IEA General Assembly meeting in                1973.  Since the United States has been a key member of IEA since               its inception, hosting an IEA General Assembly meeting is one way               of showing support for the organization.  Also, by hosting a                    meeting in the United States, it will be possible for U.S.                      educators, researchers, and policy-makers to directly contribute                to the work of the organization.",
