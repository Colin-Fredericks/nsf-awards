Each workshop will provide                instruction for forty teachers.  The workshops to be conducted are:                                                                                                   I.  Teaching Science in the Elementary School                                  II.  Teaching Mathematics in the Elementary School                             III.  Teaching Science at the Intermediate School Level                          IV.  Teaching Mathematics for Intermediate and High School                           Teachers                                                                                                                                              There will be 8 follow-up sessions on Saturdays during the academic year        for each workshop.  The workshops will be conducted in two locations            simultaneously: Rio Piedras and Mayaguez campuses.  Half of the                 participants will be instructed on each campus during the summer and            academic year phase of the program.                                                                                                                             The primary goals of this project are to provide teachers with  new             content, methodology, and a more effectives instructional program for           their students.  Emphasis  will be placed on the interdisciplinary              nature of bodies of knowledge.  Teachers who are participants in this           project will be encouraged to share their new knowledge with other              teachers in their schools.",
