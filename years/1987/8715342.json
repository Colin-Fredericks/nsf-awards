 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests an Expedited Award for Novel Research               to investigate the feasibility of using optical range imaging to                perform non-contact coordinate measuring tasks.  Recently developed             optical 3-D sensors have the speed and resolution characteristics to            make an optical coordinate measuring machine (CMM) theoretically                feasible.  Use of the proposed optical range imaging approach should            produce a speedup of several orders of magnitude over conventional              mechanical contacting CMMs, and provide a density of sampling points            sufficient to make \"reverse engineering\" practical.  \"Reverse                   engineering\" is the production of a CAD description of a part from              an actual physical example of such a part.  This capability can lead            to a dramatic improvement in productivity.                                           Before attempting to design an optical replacement for a CMM,              it is necessary to determine what artifacts, if any, may be due to              the optical nature of the sensor, how these artifacts may corrupt               the accuracy of a measurement, and how such corruptions may be                  corrected.  The research plan is to develop an accurate model of the            camera, the surface being scanned, and the noise in the system; and             then to determine how to correct for the resulting noise and                    distortion.                                                                          The proposed approach is novel because it is mathematically                unique, it will use differential geometry to reconstruct range                  imagery rather than using traditional Fourier methods.  The ideas of            using an optical range camera to replace the more traditional                   coordinate measuring machine is a fairly new idea.  The idea of                 applying reconstruction theory to correct for anomalies in this                 context appears to be completely novel.                                              If successful, this approach could lead to a large impact on               industrial efficiency, because the capability to quickly produce                accurate solid model representations from a collection of range                 images of a subject part is badly needed.",
