 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will disseminate model programs directed at increasing the         pool of minority students who pursue engineering, science and                   mathematics based college study.  The basis of this dissemination will          be the programs that have been developed by the members of the National         Association of Precollege Directors (NAPD).  This organization includes         twenty-one independent programs which have been successful at guiding           minority students into engineering and other technical areas and helping        to assure that they have the mathematics and science skills necessary to        succeed.                                                                                                                                                        In order to bring these techniques and the NAPD type program model to a         new and much wider audience, NAPD will produce a series of comprehensive        manuals to serve as resources for communities interested in adapting            such models to their areas.  In addition, a three tiered system of              training seminars will be implemented which will include:  Interactive          National Training Seminars for school system policy makers,  Regional           Training Seminars for Administrators and other education and community          leaders, and Local Implementation Workshops for individual school system        personnel and others who will be adapting the model to their own area.",
