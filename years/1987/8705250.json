 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants                           convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates.  All                     animals including man, directly or indirectly, depend upon this                 process for their daily caloric intake.  Although food production               demands are continuing to rise, our food production/unit of land                area has leveled off.  The future demands an increased                          understanding of and ability to manipulate plant photosynthesis.                Our understanding of photosynthesis has changed dramatically in                 the last 15 years due to the discovery of different                             metabolic pathways in some plants.  It is now known that there                  are at least two rather specialized groups of plants (C4 and CAM)               which, prior to assimilating CO2 into glucose, fix C02 directly                 into an organic acid (malic acid).  The proposed research will                  focus on recent discoveries of these unusual photosynthetic                     pathways incertain aquatic plants.  It appears that for these                   aquatic plants, CO2 fixation into malic acid may be a mechanism                 for increasing net productivity.  The implications of such a                    processare obvious when one recognizes that our most productive                 crops and our most drought.resistant crops possess this                         photosynthetic pathway.  These generalizations however apply to                 terrestrial plants, very little is known about aquatic plant                    photosynthesis.",
