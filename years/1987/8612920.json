 "awd_abstract_narration": "To evaluate the sources, sinks, chemistry, and transport of                 organic compounds in the troposphere, one must define the                       distribution of several manmade and natural compounds between the               gaseous and condensed phases.  Currently there is little quantitative           information available about the phase distribution of semivolatile              organic compounds present in the atmosphere.  The vapor/particle                distribution of compounds has an important influence on their                   atmospheric lifetimes and the chemical reactions they undergo.                  Direct measurement of the phase distribution of semivolatile                    compounds in the atmosphere is a challenging analytical problem that            requires additional research.                                                       In this project the distribution of semivolatile organic                    compounds (SOC) between the vapor phase and atmospheric particulate             matter is to be determined through field and laboratory experiments.            The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine the partitioning             behavior of different classes of semi-volatile compounds; (2) test              the hypothesis that the SOC liquid-phase vapor pressure largely                 controls adsorption to atmospheric particular matter; (3) investigate           the influence of SOC molecular shape on adsorption; and                         (4) distinguish \"exchangeable\" and \"non-exchangeable\" SOC on                    particles.  High volume air samples are to be collected in summer and           winter using a glass fiber filter backed up by an adsorbent trap.               Samples will be analyzed by chromatographic procedures.                         Vapor-particle partition coefficients are to be calculated from the             SOC concentrations on the adsorbent trap and filter and the total               suspended particle concentration.  Field and laboratory estimates of            heats of adsorption will be made.  Estimates of the                             \"non-exchangeable\" fraction of SOC will be made by analyzing filters            after stripping with SOC-free air.",
