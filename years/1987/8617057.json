 "awd_abstract_narration": "The processing of semi-conductor lasers is becoming increasingly                important.  Techniques for producing the fine structures needed                 to couple radiation into and out of the laser are lacking as well               as techniques for controlling the frequency and stabilizing it.                 Moving the frequency to shorter wavelengths is also a problem                   which needs addressing particularly as new applications of                      lightwave technology come along.  One technique which has been                  applied to address some of these problems is the                                photoelectrochemical etching of semiconductors.  This has been                  successfully used to fabricate diffraction gratings for                         optoelectronic devices.                                                                                                                                         The effort proposed in the present proposal deals with the limits               which such processes might encounter.  It also addresses the                    issue of accurately tailoring semiconductor composition so as to                provide precisely designed structures.  These will become crucial               as lightwave technological advances continue to occur.                                                                                                          This effort is to be jointly supported by the lightwave                         technology (EET) program and the interfacial, transport, and                    thermodynamic processes program in CBTE.",
