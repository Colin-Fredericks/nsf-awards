 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the modeling and least squares parameter         identification for a class of nonlinear input-output differential and           functional-differential systems using projected equation error                  methods.  Examples for this class will be found in diverse areas such           as pharmacokinetics, robotics, lasers, and viscoelastic materials, as           well as models for control systems engineering.  The projections are            designed to obviate the necessity of dealing with unknown initial or            boundary conditions for time limited input-output data.  Special                emphasis is given to a projection method based on Fourier type                  modulating functions which facilitates utilizing well known DFT/FFT             techniques at each stage of the least squares identification.                   Proposed topics include delineating and extending the class of                  nonlinear systems that are amenable to the projection methods,                  structure determination procedures for certain classes of models,               methods for handling modeling errors, determining optimal inputs for            the projected equation error identification, and a multicomponent               signal analysis problem.  The singular value decomposition and total            least squares estimate will aid as important computational tools for            the proposed research.",
