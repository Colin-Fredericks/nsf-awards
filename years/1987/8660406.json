 "awd_abstract_narration": "The serviceability limit state associated with occupant comfort under           wind induced lateral and torsional motion is becoming an increasingly           important consideration in the design of tall buildings.  In some               instances, structural modifications required to produce acceptable              predicted response characteristics can cost hundreds for thousands of           dollars or even millions of dollars.  With these kinds of cost at stake         it is imperative that predicted response levels be as accurate and              reliable as possible.                                                                                                                                           Aeroelastic model tests and high-frequency force-balance tests provide          two means of estimating building response to winds.  In most instances,         aeroelastic model tests are impractical because of the time required to         design and construct the models.  Results obtained after completion of          the normal design process cn produce cotly modificaiton or lively               buildings where occupants must endure numerous instance of disturbing           motion.  Current high-frequency force-balance test can provide results          in a fraction of the time required for aeroelastic model tests but              incorporate linear mode shapes for sway and a uniform mode shape for            torsion.  Force-balance tests also do not provide information on                possible aeroelastic effects which may increase or decrease loading and         response.                                                                                                                                                       Research is proposed on second generation high-frequency force-balances         and associated instrumentation which would overcome the model shape             inaccuracies by allowing modal forces to be determined for various mode         shapes.  Badic research is also proposed on the influence of building           motion on modal forces.  The Principal Investigator is well qualified to        conduct the research.  The research will lead to improved force balance         for use by commercial wind tunnel testing laboratories.  Use of the             improved balances will allow more accurate prediction of wind-induced           response for complex structures where torsion is an important                   consideration and where mode shapes are not linear.  Better                     understanding of aeroelastic effects will provide valuable information          on limits to the application and force balance test",
