 "awd_abstract_narration": "Removal of dissolved matter from liquids is a problem of                        considerable difficulty in some cases.  For instance, purifying                 brackish water for domestic or industrial use is a chronic                      problem in some coastal and/or arid regions.  Also, dozens of                   municipal water sources contain large amounts of dissolved matter               which must be removed before the water can be used.  In order to                achieve high levels of separation, many methods in which the                    fluid passes back and forth through a bed of absorbents have been               examined over the years.  The present proposal seeks to study a                 method, known as dual recycle thermal swing absorption (DRTSA)                  process, in which the product from the equipment is recycled back               to increase the extent of separation substantially.  The                        objective is to examine some fundamental physical and chemical                  issues that affect the performance of this process so that the                  economics of the process can be evaluated subsequently.  If                     successful, this work will be of value in many industrial and                   domestic treatment processes.",
