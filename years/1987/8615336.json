 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tailoring of materials to improve performance and reduce                manufacturing cost is applicable to a wide range of products from cars to       civil engineering structures to jet engines.  However, the efficient            utilization of tailored materials requires the design integration of            several disciplines.  This integration of the design process is addressed       by this research.                                                                    The proposed research is focussed on integrating the processes of          aerodynamic and structural designs as a prototype for design integration.       Two methods will be explored; simultaneous analysis and optimization, which     seeks to optimize the combined equations for structures and for                 aerodynamics, and second, partial-decoupling, which optimizes each part         separately and fits them together through a modally reduced number of           cross-sensitivity derivatives.                                                       It is expected that the research will lead to improved and more            efficient techniques for multi-disciplinary design optimization.  Although      aircraft structural-aerodynamic optimization is considered here, the            mathematical and computer techniques have a wider application and               importance to future inter-disciplinary designs.                                     The principal investigators have a good reputation in the area of          optimization techniques and structural mechanics.",
