 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to provide support for noted scholars in         the basic social science disciplines to participate in a series of              conferences and workshops aimed at developing a research agenda for             addressing problems related to agriculture and rural life.  Major               support for the overall project, known as the Social Science                    Agricultural Agenda Project, is from a variety of other funding                 sources.  The motivation for this larger effort is a variety of complex         issues and pressing needs confronting U.S. agriculture and rural                America.  In many cases, farming is not a viable economic enterprise,           and the tax payers and a variety of competing interests have extensive          financial stakes in an elaborate and expensive price support and                production control system that has evolved over the years.  At the same         time, there is a growing concern about the quality of food and the              impact of food production on the environment.  Other issues of                  importance include: (1) the impact of international trade and monetary          policy on the agricultural sector, (2) the effect of third world                development on American agriculture, and (3) domestic and international         nutrition and world hunger.",
