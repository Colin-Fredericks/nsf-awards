It provides policy-                              makers from government, industry, labor, and universities an                    opportunity to meet and discuss issues that influence the overall               competitiveness of U.S. industries engaged in manufacturing.                    While there is wide recognition that efforts are needed to                      improve the environment in which manufacturing and industry                     operate, no clear concensus of agenda specific actions has                      emerged.  This grant provides a forum where such actions                        can be considered and, if necessary, recommended.  Broad concerns               with these issues in general has been represented by government,                industry, and academe during a meeting that was convened by the                 Manufacturing Studies Board of the National Research Council in                 February 1986.  It was recommended that a manufacturers forum                   should be created to bring together leaders of activities related               to manufacturing, to exchange views and review alternative                      actions.  This request is fully consistent with the Directorate                 for Engineering's objective of \"stimulating the application of                  engineering knowledge to the solution of significant problems of                national interest.\"",
