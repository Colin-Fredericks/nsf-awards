Astrom, Lund Institute of Technology, Sweden.  They plan to investigate         issues related to the stability analysis of adaptive control systems.           Such systems are more useful for dealing with uncertainty than are              fixed model control systems.  Adaptive control systems allow control            functions to be implemented in real time and on-line, rather than               off-line.  A problem with adaptive control systems is their relative            lack of robustness and stability.                                                                                                                               The intent of the proposed research is to develop theory and                    definitions of mathematical and computational tools to assist in the            computer-aided-design for the next generation of computer-aided-design          of adaptive control systems.  Drs. Kosut and Astrom propose to                  investigate the transient behavior of adaptive control systems and the          relation between the methods of system identification and robust                control.  They will try to develop a list of computational tools that           will be useful for computer-aided-design of adaptive and nonlinear              systems.  They will also attempt to clarify model accuracy in system            identification, which will aid in developing methods for robust on-line         control tuning.",
