 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, there is an increasing body of knowledge                  about juror and jury decisionmaking, especially in terms of the                 determinants of convicting or acquitting a defendant at trial.                  While some of the more interesting studies in this arena have                   begun to examine how jurors reason in rendering legal judgments,                only slowly have social scientists begun turning their attention                to the interrelationship between rules of evidence and the                      inference process of jurors.  Two critical forms of information                 that come into play in conviction and sentencing are aggravating                and mitigating evidence.  Dr. Tanford aims to examine the impact                and interplay of both through a series of four experiments.                     Designed with the highest standards of rigor and sensitivity to                 generality and plausibility, these studies emphasize the penalty                phase of a capital murder trial.  All studies use jury-eligible                 subjects and videotaped trial reenactments.  The aggravation and                mitigation manipulations include future dangerousness versus                    future value to society, intent versus lack of intent, brutality/               psychopathology versus external justifications.  By systematic                  manipulation of such factors, this research should be able to                   isolate how jurors reason and weigh evidence and what accounts                  for differences in inference processes and decisionmaking.",
