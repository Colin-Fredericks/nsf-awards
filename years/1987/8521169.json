 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests supplemental funds for NSF Grant No. EAR8416071          to permit Dr. Paul I. Abell, Professor of Chemistry, University of              Rhode Island, to pursue with Dr. Christine Betterton, Bayero                    University, Nigeria, Dr. H. V. Clarke, University of Zimbabwe, and              other scientists in Sub-Saharan Africa, for a period of 6 months, a             program of cooperative research on oxygen isotope ratios in freshwater          gastropods as a paleoclimatic indicator.  Samples of modern gastropod           shells and their aqueous environments will be studied first to provide          base line data.  The technique then will be applied to selected fossil          gastropods in studies of paleoenvironments from a variety of locations          in Sub-Saharan Africa.                                                                                                                                          Freshwater gastropods record environmental information in the stable            oxygen isotope ratios of their shells.  This information includes a             sensitivity toward temperature in the decomposition of the calcium              carbonate of the shell as well as evaporative effects stemming from             the host body of water in which the gastropod lived.  This study may            provide additional insights into paleoenvironments.  This project is            relevant to the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries               Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S.           scientists and engineers and their counterparts in developing                   countries through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual          benefit.",
