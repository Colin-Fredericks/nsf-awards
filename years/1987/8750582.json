 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Hunter College will introduce        a new laboratory for physics majors.  Students taking this new                  laboratory will have had an already existing lecture course and                 laboratory in the fundamentals of electronics.  The equipment purchases         will allow physics majors access to microcomputers (personal computers)         used to (1) control experiments and (2) collect data from probes placed         in the experiment.  The five experiments which will be used are in the          areas of heat (thermodynamics), properties of magnetic materials,               properties of repetitive or oscillatory motion (nonlinear harmonic              motion).  The students will also see how a computer collects data from          an experiment through various kinds of probes which sense the                   temperature and other quantities in time.  The digital computer cannot          make continuous measurements of (for example) temperature as it changes         with time but instead must measure the temperature at discrete but              closely spaced time intervals.  This process of digitizing is quite             interesting in itself and the student will learn what conditions must be        met so that the digitizing is done properly and the result is faithful          to the phenomena measured.                                                                                                                                      The major equipment proposed for purchase are six Macintosh                     microcomputers, chosen for their ease of use by the student.  Also,             proposed for purchase are (1) the equipment to perform the  experiments,        (2) the probes that sense or collect the data from the experiment, and          (3) the equipment which connects the signal from the experimental probe         to the computer (the computer interface).",
