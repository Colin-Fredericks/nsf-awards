 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is a geochemical investigation of ocean bottom rock samples          obtained in 1985 from the Drake Passage and Bransfield Strait under a           cooperative program with the Federal Republic of Germany on R/V                 POLARSTERN.  The objectives concern the formation of back-arc and               marginal basins and their associated volcanic rocks.  Major elements            and trace elements will be analyzed to establish the extent to which            subducted sediment is incorporated into the generation of mantle                basalts, and how the subducted material has affected the composition            of the mantle beneath the Bransfield Strait and the South Shetland              Islands.  Mineral chemistry and glass inclusions of phenocrysts will            be analyzed to evaluate the extent of magma mixing, the depth of magma          chambers, and the kinetics of magma eruption.                                                                                                                   The rock samples to be studied were obtained by the principal                   investigator, and include fresh basalts recovered from two seamounts            and from volcanic hills in the Bransfield Strait.  Older more                   weathered basalts were dredged from the basin between Low and                   Deception Islands.  The Bransfield Strait is a young marginal basin             that was formed by rifting and subsidence of the Antarctic Peninsula.           The geochemical processes associated with this subduction are not well          understood; neither is the transport of material from the subducting            slab to the arc magma system.  The slab may melt and intrude into the           overlying mantle wedge with the mixture forming the island arc magma            source, or the source may be the subducting slab itself.  It is                 expected that the trace element analysis will point to one or the               other of these processes.",
