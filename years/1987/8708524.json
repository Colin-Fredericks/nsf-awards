 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paleomagnetic observations of transitional field behavior come                  from a wide varkety of igneous and sedimentary structures.  Yet                 it may be that no one rock type possesses the capabilities to                   render idea\u00d5 recordings, both in terms of vector field changes                  as well as temporal accuracy.  Indeed, each type of recording                   appears to have its own set of advantages as well as limitations.               The two studies planned promise not only to shed light on the                   geomagnetic reversal process, but also to enhance our knowledge                 regarding the relationship between record fidelity and rock                     type.  The first project, presently ongoing, involves the                       attainment of the polarity transition corresponding to the                      termination of the Olduvai normal polarity event from lavas on                  Moloka, Hawaii.  The derived record, when complete, will be                     rigorously compared to a published record of the same transition                obtained from nearby deep-sea sediments.  The second project                    involves the attainment of detailed paleofield behavior of                      sequential reversals recorded in exposed, rapidly-deposited                     marine sediments along the Mangapoike River on New Zealand's                    North Island.  The sequence has been well-correlated to the late                Miocene.  Akaroa Volcano, on New Zealand's South Island - the                   previous focus of transitional field studies by this P.I. -                     appears to have been created contemporaneously with the marine                  sediments.  This situation provides a rare opportunity to                       compare transition records derived from two paleomagnetically                   distinct, yet desirable rock types.  As has been the case with                  past paleomagnetic projects at Cal Poly, several undergraduates                 will take part throughout the proposed projects, from assistance                in the field to laboratory analysis.  Some will undertake an                    aspect of the original research as their own and produce a                      senior project.",
