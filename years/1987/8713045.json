 "awd_abstract_narration": "Petroleum derived base oils incorporating suitably designed additive            packages dominate the lubricant market. Individual additives are chosen         on the basis of their ability to reduce the thermal and oxidative               degradation of the base oil, to protect the lubricated surface from             wear, to inhibit rust and corrosion, to reduce or prevent deposits and          to impart other desirable properties to the base oil.  The additive             interactions in bulk oil give rise to the formation of intermolecular           complexes, and micelles. Molecular thermodynamic method is utilized in          this research to predict the various structures existing in oil as a            function of the composition of the oil, the concentrations of the               various additives and the system temperature. Kinetic models for the            oxidation of oil and deposit formation are formulated incorporating the         fact that additives occur in various types of structures in the base            oil. The kinetic models allow the calculation of the lubricant                  performance indices - namely the induction times preceding oil                  oxidation and deposit formation  as well as the rates of oxidation and          deposit formation. The calculated results are to be compared with               experimental data on bulk solution behavior.",
