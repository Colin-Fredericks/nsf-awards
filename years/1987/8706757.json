 "awd_abstract_narration": "As neurobiological data accumulate and better methods are devised for           extracting anatomical and physiological information about nervous               systems, a profoundly difficult problem remains: how can we use what            we know to explain higher functions in terms of neuronal networks?              What are the dynamical principles which yield complex effects from              the behavior of individual neurons?  Theoretical approaches are                 underway in various places, and one striking and important                      development in this context is the connectionist strategy.  Combined            with serious neurobiological constraints, this has engendered a new             enterprise--computational neuroscience. Dr. Churchland in                       collaboration with Dr. Terrence J. Sejnowski, is seeking to provide a           panoramic view of the theoretical task and give a unique integration            of material from neurobiology, psychophysics and computer science.              They will explore the computational strategies used by human and                other nervous systems, presenting detailed examples of promising                computational results, of the limits of the models, and of problems             remaining.  The project is on interest both for the neurosciences and           philosophy of science.  Philosophically, the principal interest                 concerns the role and character of representations and computations             in neural network theories, and in the emergence of reductive                   explanations.",
