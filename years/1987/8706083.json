 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an international collaboration between                  Professor Jose Luis Menaldi of Wayne State University and Professors            M.C. Bancora-Imbert, R. Gonzalez, and D. Tarzia of the Mathematical             Institute \"Beppo Levi\" of the University of Rosario in Argentina.  The          collaborators will study three main research areas:  i) Optimization            problems with monotone controls; ii) Impulse control problems; and iii)         Control problems with free boundaries.  This class of problems has the          property that they can be formulated in terms of (quasi) variational            inequalities, and the investigators plan to solve them by using                 techniques from numerical analysis leading, in the process, not only to         concrete algorithms but also to the study of rates of convergence and           to numerical estimates.                                                                                                                                         Optimization problems with monotone controls and impulse control                problems arise from modeling the control of a dynamical system by an            external force that, as a function of time, has jumps or other types of         discontinuities.  These models are quite useful in Operations Research          and Economics.  Other physical applications of monotone and impulse             control methods originate in the study of oscillating systems and in            the study of optimal allocation of resources.  Likewise, the study of           fluid flow through a porous medium, the theory of semiconductors, and           the analysis of phase change problems, often lead to control problems           with free boundaries, so that the class of problems under consideration         is an important one with many practical applications.  Furthermore, the         project brings together active experienced collaborators with                   complementary skills to work on problems of mutual concern, and by so           doing fulfills the objectives of the U.S.-Argentina Program.  In                addition, this award adds an international dimension to the U.S. PI's           current support by the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences through            grant DMS8601998.",
