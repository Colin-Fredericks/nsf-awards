This               vast area of the ocean is essentially unexplored because the                    technology and the financial resources needed are not available.                Extensive research is needed to develop the knowledge base                      required for technology development suitable to this difficult                  environment.  The workshop proposed in this application is                      planned as a continuation of an earlier conference which brought                together a group of scientists and engineers knowledgeable of the               technological needs in the ocean environment.  The San Diego                    Workshop will continue the planning and result in the development               of a research agenda that can serve as guidelines for future                    research funding in ocean systems engineering.",
