 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knoop and Vickers indentation is analyzed to develop a test to rank the         wear resistance of brittle materials such as engineering ceramics.  The         indenter is caused to slide along the surface of the specimen which             causes subsurface fractures to grow to the surface and break off,               leading to material removal or wear.  The complete stress field, both           elastic and inelastic, due to the diamond pyramid indentation, is               calculated.  The displacement at the surface of the specimen is matched         to the shape of the indenter by numerically distributing the elasticity         Green's Function for the point force on the surface of the half space.          The inelastic strains are modeled with eigenstrains.  The crack growth          is predicted using a critical stress intensity factor criterion in              conjunction with the assumption that the Mode II stress intensity               factor is always zero.  The test will rank the wear resistance of               ceramics, as well as predict the effect of fundamental mechanical               properties on wear resistance.",
