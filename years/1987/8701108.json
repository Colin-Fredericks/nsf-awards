Particular attention will be devoted to questions of job           matching, job turnover, and the inter-firm mobility of skilled and              unskilled segments of the semiconductor labor force.                                    The purpose of this research is to determine how local labor            markets are organized in the U.S. semiconductor industry, and in                particular, the ways in which the organization and operations of local          labor markets produce external economies of scale that cause and sustain        the agglomeration of the industry in regions of concentration,                  especially in Santa Clara County, California.  The project will also            produce insights into the ways firms select dispersed locations in              small, often non-metropolitan labor markets for some of their                   production.                                                                             Understanding the locational dynamics of high-tech industries           such as semiconductors is important from the standpoint of industrial           location theory as well as from the perspective of national and                 international economic and industrial policy.  Professor Scott's                previous research has made major contributions to location theory, and          this research promises to yield additional insights along similar lines.",
