 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many industries are involved in areas of research, design, and             manufacturing that necessitate increasing their application of advanced         computer techniques.  The expansion of high technology fields such as           aviation, micro-electronics, and energy-related industries make the             assurance of system safety and reliability imperative to the future             growth and success of these industries.  Risk assessments are now               performed at many stages in the design and operation of complex systems         to assure reliable operation and also to reduce design and maintenance          costs.  The application of powerful integrated computer systems for             reliability analysis is necessary to respond to the computational needs         of engineers in complex design situations.                                           Fault tree and event tree analyses are key elements in reliability         studies.  The accident sequences defined by the event trees provide the         analyst with criteria for system failure as well as the context that            describes the conditions under which the system is required to perform.         Reliability analyses of large systems involving many failure causes are         too complex to be analyzed without the assistance of a computer, not            only to perform the fault tree analysis, but also to organize and               present the information to the analyst.                                              Use of list processing techniques widely used in artificial                intelligence will be investigated in evaluating reliability of large            systems represented by fault trees.  Use of LISP will allow advanced            techniques in reliability calculations to be utilized to produce                powerful reliability software.  These algorithms will be applicable to          the evaluation of any large, complex system and will benefit many areas         of engineering system design.",
