 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will cover many aspects of contemporary                      geometry. The geometers at Berkeley form one of the world's major               centers of excellence. All four investigators have consistently                 made outstanding contributions to geometry and the prospects for                substantial progress in the present research program are very                   exciting.                                                                            Hsiang will continue his work in global differential                       geometry of submanifolds, in geometry of simplexes in constant                  curvature spaces and symmetric spaces and in the geometry and the               topology of Lie transformation groups.                                               Weinstein will carry out research in symplectic geometry and               its relations with other areas of geometric analysis and                        mathematical physics. In particular he will investigate the                     connections between symplectic geometry and operator algebra.                   This is one of the most exciting areas of modern geometry and                   Weinstein is universally acknowledged as being at the forefront                 of this research.                                                                    Chern is the grand old man of modern differential geometry                 whose continued activity into his seventies is inspiring. He will               work principally on two projects. The first concerns taut                       immersions and Lie sphere geometry. The second continues work                   done with Wolfson concerning harmonic maps of a surface into                    classical spaces.                                                                       Wu will work on harmonic maps, the geometry of 4-manifolds              and rational homotopy in Riemannian geometry. This will continue                his excellent work  on Kaehler manifolds relating function theory               with curvature properties.",
