 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to discriminate between and to selectively attend to                different stimulus events are fundamental properties of adaptive                behavior.  The mechanisms underlying the important processes of                 attention and discrimination learning are discovered by studying how            animals respond to different stimuli that signal other, biologically            important events.  Although external events have typically been used in         research in this area, experimental psychologists have recently begun to        study how internal stimuli or \"codes\" are also involved in these                processes.  In this project, Dr. Urcuioli will examine the role of two          types of internal stimuli in attention and discrimination:  the feedback        arising from an animal's own behavior (response codes), and the                 expectancy of future rewarding events (expectancy codes).                                                                                                       The general procedure for most of the experiments will be to present            animals with one of two possible visual stimuli, followed shortly               thereafter by two different choice alternatives, on each trial.  One            alternative will be designated \"correct\" following one initial stimulus,        and the other alternative will be correct following the remaining               initial stimulus.  Response and expectancy codes will be generated by           requiring the animals either to respond differently to the two initial          stimuli, or by correlating these visual events with different outcomes          following each choice alternative.  Later, the animals will be tested to        determine whether or not their choices are being cued by the response or        expectancy codes and, if so, how their attention to these internal              events affects their attention to the redundant visual stimuli present          at the beginning of each trial.                                                                                                                                 This research project is important to our understanding of the internal,        cognitive processes of non-human animals, and will provide data relevant        to the question of whether or not the mechanisms of selective attention         and discrimination are similar for internal as well as external stimulus        events.",
