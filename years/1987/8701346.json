 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Phase I research the chitinase (chiA) gene from the                     bacterium Serrata marcescens has been fused to three different                  promotor fragments which have been isolated.  These chimaric                    genes have been introduced into tobacco protoplasts.  Stably                    transformed plants have been generated and individuals have                     been identified which express high levels of the chiA gene at                   both the mRNA and protein level.  These have been assayed for                   susceptibility to infection by the fungus Alternaria.  It                       appears that they exhibit an increased resistance to the                        disease.  In this Phase II research, it is planned to improve                   the level of expression and to express chitinase in specific                    tissues (roots) and outside the cell.  Later the gene will be                   transferred to other plants and their resistance to other                       pathogens will be tested.                                                            This experimental research will be performed in tobacco                    tomato and Brassica napus and will assay for conferred                          resistance against Alternaria, the powdery mildews, and root                    knob nematodes.  Control of a broad range of fungi by genetic                   engineering of plants could greatly increase crop production                    and preclude the excessive use of chemical fungicides.",
