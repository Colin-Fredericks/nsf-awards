 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scanning tunneling microscopy is an innovative new method of                    surface atomic and electronic structural analysis with subatomic spatial        resolution.  Structural imaging and current image spectroscopy with STM         will be used to investigate the effects of dopants on the electronic            structure of ZnO varistor materials.  The electronic structure in the           depletion lasers near the grain boundaries will be compared with that in        the center of the grains.  The structure of the grain boundary will be          probed to determine if grain boundary trapping states are due to                segregated impurities or lattice strain defects.  These results will be         compared to existing models of varistor behavior.  The impact of this           work will be seen in two fields.  As the first demonstration of scanning        tunneling microscopy in ceramics it will illustrate an expanded                 potential of the techniques and be the basis of further work in this            area.  The characterization of ZnO electronic structure will be useful          in refining models of varistor behavior and guiding future composition          modifications.",
