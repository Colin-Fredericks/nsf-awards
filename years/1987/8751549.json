 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to establish a consortium to                    carry out, on an interim basis for the 1990 assessment, the kind                of consensus planning process that will be necessary for state-                 by-state administration of the National Assessment of Educational               Process (NAEP).                                                                                                                                                 The purpose of this consortium is to establish a steering                       committee consisting of a representative of each consortium                     member which will develop and direct a process leading to a                     series of recommendations to the Center for Education Statistics                concerning the conduct of a state-level assessment in 1990.  On                 May 4, a planning meeting convened by the Council of Chief State                School Officers determined on a preliminary basis that it is                    feasible to conduct a state-by-state assessment on a limited                    scale in 1990.  The group recommended attempting to conduct a                   consensus planning process to prepare for state-by-state                        assessment and to identify operational procedures for such an                   assessment.  The group concluded that limiting the assessment to                mathematics at the high school (17-year olds) level would be                    desirable.                                                                                                                                                      The consortium will:  1) Develop and propose a policy statement                 on the purposes of state-level assessment.  2) Recommend the                    scope of the 1990 assessment that should be done on a state-by-                 state basis--confirm the subject (mathematics) and grade levels                 to be assessed and the extent of participation to be sought.                    3) Determine commonalities of opinion and important sources                     of differences within and among major educational constituencies                concerning the subject to be assessed.  4) Recommend the                        knowledge and skills that should be assessed in the subject.  5)                Recommend additional information that should be collected in                    conjunction with achievement data on a state-by-state basis.  6)                Recommend the format that should be used to report state-level                  assessment and background data.",
