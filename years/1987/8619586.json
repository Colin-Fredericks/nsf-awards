 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to explore the feasibility and technical      merits of a process for making intricate thin wall castings by using            permanent molds preheated to the metal melting temperature of the cast          metal.  The molds would be in the form of a punch and a die.  The molten        metal would be introduce into the preheated die and then the preheated          punch would be lowered into the die.  The preheat of the molds to the           temperature of the molten metal would ensure complete filling of the            intricate thin walled cavity between the punch and die.  Solidification of      the cast metal is achieved by introduction of a predetermined quantity of       water or cold air into the cooling channel of the punch in such quantity        that no extensive reheating of the punch and die is needed for the next         casting.  The punch and die material would be alloy steel as used in the        die casting industry.  A suitable coating would be employed on the cavity       surfaces to facilitate extraction of the casting from the die.  Aluminum        alloy will be employed as the cast metal in this proposal; however,             application of this techniques should also be possible to alloys of tin,        lead, zinc, magnesium and copper.  This work will explore the minimum           casting thickness, the microstructure, strength and ductility properties,       and the cycle time.  With the proposed process it may be possible               to attain wall thicknesses smaller than with the die casting process, i.e.      0.040\" or less, without the need for pressure as is employed in the die         casting process.  Properties of the cast metal may also be enhanced.",
