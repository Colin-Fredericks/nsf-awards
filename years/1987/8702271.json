 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is in progress that follows two paradigms for parallel                 computation:  A reduction paradigm and a divide and conquer paradigm.           The reduction paradigm proceeds as follows:  given a problem instance of        size n it employs a reducing procedure to produce a problem instance of         size less than or equal to n/2, such that the solution to the original          problem can be easily deduced from the solution to the reduced problem.         Work on the reduction paradigm continues a previously successful avenue         of research carried out by the PI.  Work on the divide and conquer              paradigm holds similar promise.  Work done under each of these paradigms        proceeds by obtaining exact solutions from approximate solutions.                                                                                                                                                                               The PI is very knowledgeable and is an accomplished researcher in the           area proposed.  The work proposed is very significant for the future of         parallel computation and has potential for substantial impact.",
