 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop an                 alternative whole fermentation broth bioseparation scheme based on              immobilized affinity adsorbents.  Beba-lactam antibiotics (e.g                  penicillin) have been chosen as model bioproducts representing small            molecular weight compounds.  The overall objective can be divided into          the following specific objectives:                                                                                                                              l.) To protein engineer and design specific affinity ligands such as            beta-lactamases for non-destructive but reversible binding of beta-             lactam antibiotics.                                                                                                                                             2.) To evaluate the feasibility of using various protein-engineered             ligands to separate the chosen bioproducts and to develop the selection         criteria.                                                                                                                                                       3.) To examine the effect of various bead design parameters and reactor         configurations of the bioproduct adsorption using immobilized affinity          adsorbent beads.                                                                                                                                                This is a joint US-Japan collaborative research project between the             University of Michigan and Osaka University.  Genetic engineering is to         be carried out at Osaka and process engineering is to be carried on at          the University of Michigan.  The investigators will travel to the other         laboratories once a year in order to coordinate and cross-fertilize the         research efforts.  This proposal requests funds for the US efforts.  The        Japanese part is to be funded by an appropriate agency in Japan.                                                                                                The investigators are considered to be capable of carrying out the              proposed research.  This proposal also meets NSF objectives for                 international cooperation and proposed objectives for cross-disciplinary        research of the Biotechnology Program.  I, therefore, recommend that            this proposal be funded for two years in accordance with the submitted          budget.",
