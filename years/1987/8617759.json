 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many new designs are modifications, derivations, or variations of          existing designs.  The problem of redesign is a fruitful area for               research both because the problem is better defined than for de novo            design and because redesign is common in practice.  One approach to the         problem of redesign in the use of replay, that is, re-creating the steps        by which the original design was created and modifying the original             decisions to meet the new requirements.                                              This proposal addresses reusability of a design by transforming a          formal specification of the problem into a suitable implementation by           the repeated application of transformations.  It explores how a                 specification derived as a modification of an existing design can be            realized by replaying the transformational derivation of the original           and modifying it as required by changes made to the specification.  This        notion of replay can substantially mediate the difficulty and expense of        maintenance, particularly for software systems.  The Principal                  Investigators propose to exhibit a replay capability for a                      transformational system that designs efficient data structures.  The PIs        have previously developed a suitable set of transformations for this            domain and have powerful knowledge-based tools to support this activity.",
