 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal by Dr. Elizabeth Bernays and her graduate               student, Mr. Raymond V. Barbehenn, of University of California,                 Berkeley.  Overall, this is a very well-conceived and well-                     executed grant proposal.  It addresses questions about herbivore                utilization of C3 and C4 grasses that have benn inadequately                    addressed in previous work, and proposes to test hypotheses about               the use of these grasses by herbivorous insects.  The perspective               of assessing three levels of this relationship (nutritional                     ecology, macronutrient use, and mechanisms of digestion) is a                   good one.  The methodologies of various of the planned                          experiments are adequately described.  The work has implications                for advances in pest control and in agriculture, especially with                cereal systems.                                                                      Dr. Bernays is increasingly applauded for her fine work in                 this area of ecologyy and the facilities at Berkeley are ideal                  for pursuing this research.  The Program recommends funding.",
