 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NAEP 1987 High School Transcript Study includes two                    major components:  the collection of transcript data and the                    analysis of transcript data.  Under the base period of the                      contract, a survey organization will conduct in 1987 a high                     school transcript study of sample members of the 1986 National                  Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).  In                                  the 1986 NAEP assessment, 38,000 high school students who were                  either 17 years old or enrolled in the eleventh grade (or both)                 in the 469 sampled schools were included in the assessment.  A                  copy of the high school transcript for each member of this sample               will be collected.  All the collected transcripts will be                       transcribed into a standard form, edited, and put on a computer                 data base for later analysis and reporting.  A first edition of                 the data tape is scheduled for completion in March, 1988.                            The reporting of the NAEP 1987 transcript data will be                     addressed to seven topics:  changes  in course-taking from 1982                 to 1987, student participation in vocational education,                         handicapped students in vocational education, course-taking                     patterns and student achievement, student self-reports of course-               taking, patterns of exclusion from NAEP assessments, and                        international comparisons of school curriculum.  The first three                analysis topics are scheduled for FY 1988 and the last four                     topics for FY 1989.",
