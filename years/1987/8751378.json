 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientist and technical professionals of the National Radio Astronomy           Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia and science educators from West        Virginia University in Morgantown are jointly proposing a Secondary             Science Teachers' Institute for 150 selected high school teachers.  The         summer institute (a two week session the first year and two three weeks         in subsequent years) will include lectures in basic astronomy and               demonstrations to give teachers resources they can use in their                 classrooms, including the use of an instrumented 40-foot telescope where        participants can make observations of their own.  Over the three years          of the project the system will be automated to the extent that                  electronic communication between the classroom and the telescope will           permit observations to be made from the classroom.  The overall goal of         the project is to bring classroom teachers into direct contact with             research scientists in order to foster a greater appreciation as to how         science is conducted and glimpse the acquisition of knowledge at its            boundary with the unknown.",
