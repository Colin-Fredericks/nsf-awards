 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to provide a solution to a major obstacle in                commercial scale operations of mammalian cell bioreactors, i.e.                 shear stress-induced cell detachment.  Specific objectives of the               proposal are to:                                                                                                                                                       -  Determine the role of an adhesive glycoprotein                                  (von Willebrand factor(vWF)) in the resistance to shear                         stress-induced detachment of anchorage-dependent                                mammalian cells.                                                                                                                                             -  Determine if and how shear stress itself may enhance                            such resistance to detachment.                                                                                                                        By using a previously developed flow apparatus for subjecting                   cells to shear, the PI proposes to determine the critical shear                 stress for cell detachment.  To test the hypothesis that                        secretion of vWF increases resistance to detachment, the PI will                compare the critical shear stress for detachment of genetically                 engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells that express vWF to                wild-type CHO cells which do not express vWF.                                                                                                                   To address the second objective, the PI proposes to investigate                 if shear stress stimulates the synthesis of vWF and another                     glycoprotein, fibronectrin.  The production and secretion of                    these glycoproteins is to be measured using quantitative                        immunofluorescence.                                                                                                                                             The PI is considered to be well qualified to carry out the                      proposed research and I recommend funding of this proposal.",
