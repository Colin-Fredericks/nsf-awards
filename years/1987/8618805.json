 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Objectives:  The primary objective of this U.S.-China                  cooperative research project between Drs. Martin Flower and Chu-yung            Chen of the University of Illinois at Chicago and Dr. Xie Guanghong of          the Guiyang Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences is to        study magmatic activity in the South China Basin through sampling and           geochemical analysis of igneous rocks, such as basalts and xenoliths,           which are formed from molten materials.  The project consists of                stratigraphic sampling and trace element analysis of whole-rock and             xenolith samples. Based on the results of this geochemical study, the           investigators propose to develop the first volcanic model of South China        and if possible, characterize the composition of the Earth's mantle in          this part of the world.   Joint field research will take place on Hainan        Island and the Leizhou Peninsula; both U.S. and Chinese laboratories            will perform the sample analysis.                                                                                                                               Relevance to Program Objectives:  This project in volcanology and mantle        geochemistry identifies and promotes mutually beneficial scientific             research for the advancement of world scientific knowledge through the          combined facilities, abilities and efforts of leading American and              Chinese scientists.   The project has been approved by the Chinese              Academy of Sciences under the Basic Sciences Protocol of 1980.                                                                                                  Merit:  This very good project will contribute new geochemical and              petrologic data on the volcanism and mantle evolution in both South             China and Southeast Asia.  It is a significant first step towards the           development of a comprehensive model of volcanism for Southeast Asia and        could form the basis for a future joint geophysical and petrological            study of the South China Sea basement.  Acquisition of geochemical data         and further geophysical studies of this region may also provide solid           scientific rationale for basement drilling in South China Sea by the            International Ocean Drilling Project.                                                                                                                           Funding:  This is a new two year award.  The international financial            arrangements are reciprocal; that is, the Chinese side covers the               expenses for research in China and the NSF China Program will fund              research in the United States.  The funding for this project totals             $39,725.",
