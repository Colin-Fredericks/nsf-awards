 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will serve as the bases on which the development and                  implementation of the International Decade of Hazards Reduction will            rest.  It consists of four phases, the first of which has already taken         place.  During the second phase four main activities will be undertaken:                                                                                                                                                                        1.  Completing the revision, editing, publication, and dissemination of            the prospetus drafted during Phase I.  Collecting and compiling                responses to this document.                                                                                                                                   2.  Initiating a study to assess the extent of and the reasons for the            present worldwide underutilization of technologies for reducing               natural hazards losses.                                                                                                                                         3.  Seeking the input of the international investment and development            communities, and tying them together with the technical and research            communities to better understand the diverse objectives these                  organizations pursue in hazards reduction.                                                                                                                      4.  Organizing an international workshop to discuss how the                     International Decade will be organized and carried out, and how                 highly targeted research can bring about a worldwide decrease in                losses from geophysical hazards.                                                                                                                                The phase II of this project will have a duration of eight months.  The         P.I.s are highly capable to carry it out, thus, an award is recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        8616067                                                                         WEIRICH                                                                         An integrated, field based project will be carried out to:  a)                  continuously monitor subaqueous debris and torpidity flows for                  temperature, density, velocity and travel distance in a reservoir               environment; b) study flow conversions of debris flows to turbidity             currents, specifically by means of hydraulic jumps, and the role of             bottom geometry in such conversions; c) correlate the characteristics of        the flow with the nature of the sediment deposition/erosion processes,          the bottom geometry, and other parameters governing the transport               processes.  The work will be conducted in conjunction with a project            jointly funded by the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles County Fire          Department, and the L.A. Flood Control District, in which oontrolled            fires, pollutant and smoke effects, sediment yields and debris flows            emanating from the burned areas are being studied.  The site is the Lodi        Canyon and Puddingstone Diversion Reservoir located in the San Gabriel          Mountains near Los Angeles, that has long hydrologic and sediment               records, detailed geologic and geomorphic data available, a single              sediment input source, a reservoir of manageable size, and other                convenient characteristics and conditions.  The results from this work          will help increase the accuracy of predictions of the movement patterns         and incidence of subaqueous debris and turbidity flows; the                     determination of threshold conditions; the probable travel distance of          such events; an assessment of both, the ability of subaqueous hydraulic         jumps to control the deposition of sediments, and the possible                  engineered use of these jumps to control the location of sediment during        major flood events.                                                                                                                                             The P.I. is highly capable to carry out this work, thus, an award is            recommended.  The grant is for one lump sum and a duration of two years.",
