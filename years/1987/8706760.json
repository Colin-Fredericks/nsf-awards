 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research of Professor Satoru Masamune, which is directed               at the synthesis of new bonding types for molecules that contain                silicon(Si), germanium(Ge) or tin(Sn) atoms as replacements for                 the usual carbon atom.  These new structures will undoubtedly                   lead to new chemistry and physical properties and possibly to                   important new materials.                                                                                                                                        This research will be concerned with two specific aspects of Si,                Ge, and Sn chemistry:  1) the synthesis and chemistry of small                  rings including the cyclopropane, bicyclobutane, and                            tricyclobutane (tetrahedrane) systems which consist, fully or                   partially, of Si, Ge, or Sn, e.g., tetrasilatetrahedrane and                    (mono)silatetrahedrane; and 2) the construction and                             characterization of multiple bonds of the digermene, disilyne,                  germathione, and silyne types.  These two series of systems are                 chemically interrelated and the compounds in one series are                     converted into those in the other series.                                                                                                                       Cyclotrimetallanes and dimetallenes  and                                        tetrasilabicyclo\u01311.1.0!butane derivatives have already yielded to               synthesis and the initial ground work has been completed.                       Additional work will systematize the now known systems.   Major                 emphasis will be on the synthesis of tetrasilatetrahedrane and                  disilyne derivatives, and parent disilene and digermene.",
