 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will do research on VLSI design models and           methodologies.  In the direction of modeling, he will find models that          describe accurately the constraints and requirements of the physical            design process.  In the direction of methodologies, he will apply               algorithmic techniques to design automation problems, which are                 mathematical and formal, so that they can be evaluated and analyzed             prior to experimentation.  Professor Liu will concentrate on these              topics:  (1) two-dimensional approaches to the layout problem; (2) the          extension of floorplanning techniques to non-slicing modules and L-             shaped structures; and (3) the investigation of algorithms that might           profit from parallel computation, e.g. simultaneous global routing.             This research addresses the need to produce rapidly layouts of very and         ultra large-scale integrated (VLSI/ULSI) circuits which operate                 efficiently.  It is a need that has become of paramount importance as           such devices become more complex and the industry increasingly                  competitive.  There are many approaches to problems in VLSI/ULSI                design; however they suffer from one of two problems.  Either the               design methods are heuristic and can fail unexpectedly because analysis         methods are not well developed; or formal algorithms, which are well            understood, take too much time when very large circuits are involved.           The basic need is for more realistic and sophisticated models of                computation and new analysis methods that will lead to efficient                VLSI/ULSI design methods.  Professor Liu proposes to solve research             problems in VLSI theory (e.g. floorplanning, routing and parallel               design techniques) and put the solutions in software form to further            study them.  The principal investigator has, in the past several years,         turned his attention to VLSI, where he has made important contributions         to theory while keeping practical problems in mind.",
