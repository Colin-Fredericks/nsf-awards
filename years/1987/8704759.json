 "awd_abstract_narration": "An image analysis system will be purchased to evaluate various                  geometrical features of the flaws of portland cement-based composites           and to record their interaction preceding macroscopic fracture.  An             image of a polished section (impregnated with a fluorescent epoxy) will         be magnified and digitized using a high resolution video scanner.  The          digitized image will be enhanced, edited, stored and manipulated to             obtain quantitative measures of the flaw structure.  This will be done          using color TV monitors and a host computer.                                    In addition to quantifying flaw structure and their interactions,               fracture toughness measurements will be made and theoretical models             relating flaw structure to fracture toughness will be developed.  Due           consideration to fracture process zone, nonlinear fracture mechanics and        crack shielding phenomena will be given.                                        The equipment will enable studies leading to a basic understanding of           the influence of flaw structure on fracture properties of cement,               mortar, concrete and other cement-based composites.",
