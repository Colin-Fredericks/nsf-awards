 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop will be convened near Washington State                       University, October 12-14, 1987 to assess the likelihood that new               weedy forms of higher plants could arise through techniques in                  recombinant DNA genetics.  Each participant represents one or                   more relevant disciplines in plant biology.  The participating                  ecologists, will characterize the life history and worldwide                    epidemiology of weeds that cause great damage, especially plants                that readily escape cultivation.  The plant geneticists and                     systematists will outline the precedents for the transfer of                    genetic information among common cultivated plants and their                    weedy relatives.  Using common arable crop and forage species and               their wild relatives, both these groups of specialists will                     identify a tentative list of hypothetical phenotypes that could                 be potentially damaging to the environment.  To the extent                      proprietary interests permit, the invited molecular biologists                  will outline traits that could be imparted to these same common                 cultivated plants by recombinant DNA genetics.  Working together,               the participants will have as one objective an assessment of the                potential for these hypothetical phenotypes to be produced                      directly (or indirectly through subsequent gene transfer in the                 wild) by recombinant DNA genetic techniques in higher plants in                 the next ten years.  The participants will also identify the                    information (e.g., experiments, compilations of existing data on                failure rates in plant introduction and agronomic field trials)                 needed to strengthen their predictions.   The outcome of the                    meeting will be published for a wide scientific readership.",
