 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research project is object based systems, especially          with respect to support of design activities involving more than one            person.  Design involves the manipulation and reliable storage of large         amounts of data.  Hence, design systems require database support.               However, compared with traditional (i.e., business oriented) databases,         design data is considerably more structured and varied.  More complex           constraints of many kinds are imposed (physical laws, legal                     requirements, organizational goals, consistency etc.).  Such databases          have been called object oriented databases (emphasis on the variety of          structure) and knowledge databases (emphasis on constraints and                 reasoning).  The approach taken to supplying such databases is to merge         object oriented programming language concepts with database                     functionality to produce a smoothly integrated language/database system.        There are two main categories of problems:  providing functionality, and        achieving sufficient performance.                                                                                                                               Past work on nested transactions has been influential.  Further                 understanding of object based systems can have considerable impact.",
