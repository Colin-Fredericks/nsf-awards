 "awd_abstract_narration": "The accretion of terranes to continental margins seems to have been an          important process in the formation of the continents as we see them             today.  Alaska has been the site of terrane accretion at least since            Mesozoic time.  This proposal is concerned with the investigation of            the crustal thickness and Pn velocities associated with an area that            consists of accreted and possibly stacked terranes.  The planned                experiment uses the existing seismograph network of the University of           Alaska, augmented by stations in the Yukon Flats area, to record the            signals from a number of chemical explosions.  The distribution of              stations is such that it should be possible to look at Pn arrivals              along sections across the Alaska Range, the Tanana Valley and the Yukon         Flats.  The latter is a large, geologically unknown area covered by             recent sediments, which on some models is thought to be trapped oceanic         crust.",
