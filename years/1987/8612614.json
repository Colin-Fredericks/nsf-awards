 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major concerns confronting the nation is the deterioration of        the physical structures of the country.  One of the oldest systems place        is that of buried pipelines which date back to colonial days.  They are         rupturing in many places and causing inconvenience and added expense to         the community to repair them for continued service.                                                                                                             This project will investigate several related aspects of buried                 pipelines to determine their condition and rehabilitation activities.           Specifically, the Workshop will evaluate:  loadings, effects of                 temperature, materials, installation and repair practices, joining              methods, and general constructing practices.                                                                                                                    The results of this Workshop will be beneficial to the researchers,             decision makers at local, state and Federal levels, and professional            engineers engaged in the design and construction of pipeline systems.                                                                                           The researchers are qualified to conduct this Workshop.                                                                                                         The project is recommended for an award.  This award is for a period of         one year and is a one time award.",
