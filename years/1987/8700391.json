 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John Taylor and postdoctoral associate Dr. Thomas Bruns             of the University of California at Berkeley will employ modern                  molecular techniques to investigate the evolutionary                            relationships among fungi of the order Boletales.  They will                    study the mitochondrial gene order, construct restriction-                      endonuclease digestion-site maps of mitochondrial and nuclear                   ribosomal RNA genes, and sequence selected ribosomal RNA genes.                 Preliminary results suggest that a much better understanding of                 phylogenetic relationships among these fungi can be achieved with               these methods than has been realized to date by traditional                     morphological studies.                                                                  This work is significant for several reasons.  Many of the              species to be studied are important ectomycorrhizal root                        symbionts of temperate-forest trees, and others are important                   wood-rotters.  An understanding of the phylogeny of these fungi                 will provide insight into their pattern of coevolution with their               plant hosts, and will provide a better understanding of the                     relationship between mycorrhizal symbionts and primary saprobes                 in the order.  As currently defined, the Boletales contains                     several morphologically diverse groups of fungi, including false                truffles, gilled mushrooms, and resupinate wood-rot fungi.                      Therefore, understanding of their phylogeny will provide a                      framework for testing theories about morphological trends in the                basidiomycete fungi.  Finally, the methods being used should                    prove applicable to evolutionary investigations in a wide range                 of other groups of fungi, and the gene-sequence data generated                  will add to a database which can eventually be used to study the                evolutionary lines within the entire Basidiomycetes.",
