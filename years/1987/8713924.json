 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protistans are a varied group of micro-organisms that defy              the simple classification of life into plants and animals.  The                 International Society for Evolutionary Protistology will meet in                England during July, 1987, and a variety of important problems                  regarding evolution and classification of the Protista will be                  discussed.  Dr. John Corliss requests a modest sum that will                    allow a contingent of four American protistologists to attend the               meeting.                                                                             These four investigators cover the spectrum of protistan                   diversity and the range of approaches to their systematics.  Each               member of the delegation will either be presenting a research                   paper or chairing a symposium session.  In addition, the                        delegation has been allotted time on the program for a planning                 session, during which participants will draft a plan for several                workshops, to be held in conjunction with international                         protistological conventions over the coming five years.  These                  workshops will address the problem of protistan evolution and                   classification using the full range of modern techniques.",
