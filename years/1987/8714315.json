 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to purchase equipment for the                      Freshwater Biological Facilities Center.  Three major suites of                 equipment include:  a scanning electron microscope with elemental               analyzer, image analysis and multitask computer; an Intermap                    Analytic Photogrammetric Workstation; and an inductively coupled                plasma emission spectrometer, ion chromatograph, and                            autoanalyzer.  This instrumentation will enhance one of the major               directions of interdisciplinary research, the development of                    linkages among stream ecology, geology, geochemistry, and                       geography, including geomorphology and hydrology.  A major                      research goal is to improve current theories in stream ecology by               incorporating the indirect and direct effects of watershed                      geology and geography on stream biology and chemistry and to                    utilize geology and geography as an organizing force within                     ecosystems.  The University of Alabama is in an ideal location to               achieve this owing to its proximity to four geological provinces                in a climatically similar area and an extensive system of streams               and rivers.  This instrumentation will substantially move the                   institution closer toward its goal of focused breadth with                      cooperative efforts in areas of aquatic ecololgy and modern                     systematics as interfaced with geology, geochemistry, and                       geography.",
