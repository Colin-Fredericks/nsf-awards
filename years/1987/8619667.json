 "awd_abstract_narration": "An experimental investigation is proposed of the feasibility of                 extending the principle of water (low viscosity) lubricated pipeline            transport of thick crude oils (high viscosity) to the case where the            viscous fluid is a dispersion of coal in oil.  The investigator proposes        to explore the possibility that his observation of a high degree of             stability for the retention of coal in the oil, under limited                   conditions, may permit coal to be retained under realistic flow                 conditions.  This would permit large reductions in pumping power through        the use of a low viscosity lubricating fluid which could be easily              separated from the slurry/dispersion being pumped.  Applications to             complex slurry/dispersions in the food and paper industries could also          be favorably impacted by this research.  Funding is highly recommended.",
