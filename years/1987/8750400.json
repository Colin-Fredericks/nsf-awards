 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics department at Luther College will update microcomputer         equipment and improve its contribution to physics instruction throughout        the physics curriculum.  First generation KIM and PET microcomputers            were introduced beginning 9 years ago in lower division laboratories and        course work.  These are now obsolete, and they will be replaced with PC-        XT type computer stations in order to keep students abreast of important        current technology and introduce new capabilities in the courses.                   The upper division curriculum will be strengthened by purchase of           new advanced microcomputers:  the PC-AT 16-bit microcomputer, and a 32          bit accelerator board for a Mac-Plus.  These will be used to expand             instruction in techniques important to the forefront of physics:                modeling of complex systems, and the numerical solution of problems by          computer.  The excellent graphics, very large memory, and high                  computational speed will permit a new class of problems to be attacked          by our students, and also enable new student/faculty research                   opportunities.  In addition, a new telescope mount will be purchased to         permit completion of a student-originated research project which                involves the computer control of a 14-inch telescope.",
