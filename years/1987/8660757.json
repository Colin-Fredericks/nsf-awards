 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will develop design rules and database for use of            \"electroimpact\" technology in conjunction with a robot end effector             (gripper).  The Electroimpact Tool is powered by the phenomenon of eddy         current repulsion.  Recoilless operation is achieved by transferring the        eddy current reaction force into a movable recoil mass which imparts a          impulse force at the point of contact.  The low recoil and powerful             output force pulse of the device could broaden the functional range of          robots, which currently have low payload capacity.  Functions such as           metal forming, punching, shearing, dimpling, chipping, anchor setting           and interference fit assembly potentially could be performed.  The              device should be economical, compact and safe making this a practical           technology for robots.  The capabilities must be determined in                  performing a range of job functions in view of the accuracy, load and           dynamic limitations of current industrial robot technology.  The Phase I        plan is to design a prototype Electroimpact End Effector based on               magnetodynamic simulation, construct the prototype and test it on a             specific robot to confirm the validity of the design rules.  The                research result should be a design model which is expected to be the            basis for extension to other robots in follow-on research.  Plans also          include commercialization.                                                           With the assistance of this device an end effector on a robot could        press, punch, form, anchor set, and shear with a force pulsing two              orders of magnitude greater than the payload capacity of the robot.             This should vastly broaden the functional range of robots, and hence            contribute to increased productivity.",
