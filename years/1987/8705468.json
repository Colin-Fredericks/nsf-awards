 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposed research, Dr. Coleman and his colleagues at            the University of Georgia will investigate and concentrate on                   factors influencing the structural and functional complexity of                 soil faunal communities, on interactions among fauna and with                   their bacterial and fungal prey, and on the effects of these                    interactions on higher plants.  In their work, they will also                   attempt to make correlations between community structure and                    ecosystem function, which they feel is an essential step in                     unifying \"population\" and \"ecosystems\" approaches in ecology.                           The work is of great interest to soil biologists and                    ecologists but has major implications for management practices in               agricultural systems and forestry.  The Program recommends                      funding.",
