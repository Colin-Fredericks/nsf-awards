 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to develop a powerful yet intuitively                         comprehensible language for the generation and processing of                    sounds.  The goal is to provide flexible control over the most                  comprehensive set of audiocomputational methods possible.  The                  language is to be efficiently embedded in a UNIX/C processing                   environment for maximum portability to using laboratories.                                                                                                      The personal computing workstation and a burgeoning industry in                 musical audio synthesizers have already had an impact on research               in audio processing, psychoacoustics, human-computer interaction,               and audio cognition.  Until now, however, the impact has been                   limited by reliance on computationally simple models of sound                   production, lacking both the diversity of our cultural aural                    experience and the methods of control that would support its                    systematic investigation.  If this project is successful, every                 investigator will be able to explore the most subtle nuances of                 sound and audition.",
