 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new curriculum for a one-semester biochemistry laboratory course has          been designed and is being implemented by the Chemistry Department at           California State University at Long Beach. The course is the capstone of        a newly approved degree program leading to a Bachelor of Science in             Biochemistry. The course emphasizes the acquisition of both experience          with modern biochemical research techniques and instrumentation and the         acquisition of problem-solving skills used in a research setting. The           following equipment has been recently added to the department's                 instrumental holdings, specifically for use in this regard: a high speed        centrifuge, three ultraviolet-visible scanning spectrophotometers, a            high pressure liquid chromatography gradient system with variable               wavelength detector, and three low pressure liquid chromatography               systems. In addition to experiments on protein determination, enzyme            kinetics, and gel electrophoresis, the isolation and characterization of        hemoglobin, DNA, and messenger RNA, from the brine shrimp Artemia               Salina, is carried out, together with experiments on the transformation         of bacteria with recombinant plasmids and the isolation and                     characterization of the plasmids.",
