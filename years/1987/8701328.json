 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for continued investigation of the interaction            between mixed Hodge theory, 1-adic cohomology, rational homotopy,               etale homotopy and the topology of singularities of algebraic                   varieties.  The theory of mixed Hodge structures, recently                      developed by Deligne, is a powerful tool with potentially far-                  reaching applications to singularities.  Investigation will                     continue into the consequences of the existence of a mixed Hodge                structure on the rational homotopy of links of the singular set                 of varieties.  In particular, restrictions will be put on the                   knot type of links.  The purity of their cohomology will be                     investigated, and an 1-adic minimal model will be found for them.               It is important to master powerful techniques for handling                      singularities, since mathematical models of aspects of the real                 world are seldom smooth everywhere but exhibit essential                        singularities.",
