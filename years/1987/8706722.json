 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the recent interest in Artificial Intelligence, nonmumeric                 (specially list) processing has been brought to the forefront.  This            has led to a demand for computer architectures that are suited to               nonnumeric processing tasks.  In this research proposal, the                    researchers identify four major area in the list processing paradigm            namely: 1) function calls, 2) environment maintenance, 3) data                  structure access and 4) garbage collection.  They propose to                    investigate methods that a) allow fast and efficient implementations of         function call and environment maintenance mechanisms, b) allow streamed         access to data structures and c) reduce the burden on the garbage               collection process.                                                                                                                                             For the efficient implementation of function call and environment               maintenance mechanisms, they will investigate new cache management              strategies for the stacks that are used to implement the mechanisms.            Since streamed access to data is crucial to a pipelined implementation          of list-processing architecture, they will investigate representations          of list structures that allow streamed access.  Current list-processing         architectures are constrained to accessing list structures serially.            They also will investigate strategies that reduce the overhead due to           garbage collection by reclaiming some garbage cells without passing             them on to garbage collection process.",
