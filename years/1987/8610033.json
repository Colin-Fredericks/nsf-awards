 "awd_abstract_narration": "The causticizing reaction plays a crucial role in the chemical                  recovery cycle of the Kraft pulping process used by most of the                 paper industry.  Kraft recovery operations include concentration                of spent pulping liquor, burning to recover energy and chemicals,               smelt formation, smelt dissolution, causticizing, white liquor                  clarification, calcium carbonate thickening, and mud washing.                   This proposal is part of the PI's work to improve the many                      aspects of the Kraft process in an attempt to make it more                      amenable to control.  Improved process control should decrease                  capital and operating cost for the process and increase                         productivity.                                                                                                                                                   Causticizing converts an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate and               sodium sulfide (green liquor) into caustic solution (white                      liquor) and lime mud (CaCO (s)).  The product caustic solution is               used in the digestion process to delignify wood and other                       vegetable matter.  The objective of the proposed research is to                 obtain experimental data and estimate parameters required to                    verify a thermodynamic model of the causticizing reaction.  The                 problem is to determine when equilibrium has been attained and to               improve the approach to equilibrium.  The causticizing efficiency               is a maximum at equilibrium.  Increases in productivity and                     decreased operating and captital costs would result if the                      causticizing efficiency can be improved.  This proposal is aimed                at defining an expression for the equilibrium conversion.  The                  data will be directly applicable to processing wood and other                   vegetable matter into pulp by the Kraft and Soda processes.  In                 addition, the data can be applied to chemical processes wherever                causticizing reactions are used; for example, the production of                 caustic soda.",
