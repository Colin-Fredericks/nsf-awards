 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic pressures are forcing the chemical industry to                         decrease production of large amounts of commodity chemicals and                 to move to the production of smaller amounts of fine or                         specialty chemicals.  These require different modes of                          operation, an important one being batch processing.  Processes                  related to the production of specialty chemicals are                            characterized by significant price differences between the                      reactants and the products.  Often a batch does not result in                   making a product of the desired quality and has to be                           discarded.  Because the added value of the product in                           relationship to the reactants is so high, significant economic                  benefits can result from a general purpose modeling and                         optimization strategy for batch processes that decreases the                    number of batches that do not meet the product quality                          constraints.                                                                                                                                                    In contrast to continuous processes, batch processes are                        characterized by transient and nonlinear behavior.  The linear                  approximate models, useful for continuous processes, can not be                 applied simply because there does not exist a steady state                      about which the process can be linearized.  The use of batch                    reactor models that predict the time evolution of the                           concentration changes of the most important reactants and                       products offers the possibility for a much better understanding                 and a significant increase in the optimization of the process.                                                                                                  The PI's plan to use \"Tendency\" or \"Gray\" models, because they                  do not depend upon the availability of a detailed and                           predictive model of the process (\"White\" model) as such models                  are very rarely available.  In this technique an initial model                  is postulated (often a very crude one) and is successively                      updated and improved using experimental results.                                                                                                                The equipment requested, a batch reactor, a gas chromotograph                   (to measure concentrations) and computer equipment for on line                  calculations and control of the process, are appropriate for                    the project.  The PIs are respected researchers.  Digital                       Equipment Corporation offers a 30% discount on equipment                        awarded under NSF grants.  The PI has obtained an estimate of                   $40,330 for the computer equipment, therefore using the 30%                     discount and 1/3 cost share by Lehigh University an award of                    $45,941 out of FY87 funds is recommended.",
