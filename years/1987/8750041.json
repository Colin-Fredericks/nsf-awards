 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, will obtain current               production quality image analysis equipment to be used in the                   undergraduate curriculum for geography and environmental studies majors,        geology/geography distributed study majors, and students in other               related disciplines.  The present curriculum will be redesigned to              contain an introduction to image processing at the level of Introduction        to Remote Sensing. Traditional air photo interpretation and                     photogrammetry will still be introduced in this course.  The proposed           new equipment will be used for the entire Advanced Remote Sensing               course.  Students will get in-depth instruction and extensive hands-on          experience with the new system.  The class will be designed so that at          the end of the course students on their own will be able to function            well with all of the system capabilities to solve real remote sensing           and image analysis problems.  A new seminar, Practicum in Image                 Processing, will be added to the curriculum.  This course will be the           organizational mechanism for establishing the Southern Colorado Remote          Sensing Center in which students will elicit real world remote sensing          problems from local and regional government agencies (e.g. planning             departments), private enterprise firms on a cost paid basis, and                university projects.  The students will then design, produce, and               present their work to the data requester.",
