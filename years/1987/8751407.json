 "awd_abstract_narration": "The WGBH Educational Foundation and the NOVA production team will               produce an hour-long special program in the NOVA series on the                  remarkable scientific response to Supernova 1987A, the most significant         supernova to be observed since 1604.  Responding rapidly to this unique         opportunity, they will capture the spirit of science in formation,              through video and audio interviews with many of the involved research           scientists in their laboratories and observatories around the world             during the critical time period when there are as many questions as             answers about the event.  They will continue to cover the scientific            response into the summer and early fall, including scientific meetings          that are expected to provide clarification and explanation of the               supernova's behavior.                                                                                                                                           They are responding with insight and speed to a rare opportunity, and           will match National Science Foundation funds with $300,000 of their own         production funds to produce this program.  NSF support will be used to          insure that the coverage land treatment of the event will be substantive        and accurate, and rich enough in detail to illustrate the processes of          scientific discovery, research cooperation, and debate and dialogue that        leads to understanding.                                                                                                                                         The resulting program will be seen by the more than 12 million viewers          of the NOVA series, as well as by tens of thousands of classrooms in            high schools and colleges.  Educational materials will be produced to           accompany the program.  An award of $50,000 for FY87 is recommended.",
