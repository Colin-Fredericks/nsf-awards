 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the participation of                            Professor Abel Klein of the University of California, Irvine                    in a program of cooperative research with Professor J.                          Fernando Perez of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  The                     research will deal with extensions to our knowledge of random                   Schrodinger operators, a topic of relevance to the                              quantum-mechanical description of matter, and in particular                     to the motion of electrons in disordered systems.                                                                                                               This project builds on the research of Prof. Klein currently                    supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences of NSF.                      At first the Anderson model for the motion of quantum-                          mechanical particles on imperfect lattices will be extended                     to two and three dimensions.  Such an extension would                           facilitate the description of both conduction and optical                       properties of quantum-mechanical systems.  Subsequently, the                    Wegner model for such motion--an alternative to Anderson's,                     which can also describe extended states--will be used to                        investigate the properties of such states in disordered                         systems.  The collaboration between Professors Klein and                        Perez, which is already of some six years' duration, has led                    to numerous joint publications in the field of mathematical                     physics, and the research now proposed should benefit all                       physicists and engineers who are seeking to understand the                      phenomena of conduction in very small systems.",
