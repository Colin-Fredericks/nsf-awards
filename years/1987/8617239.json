 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many design problems require that an existing process or                   system be redesigned to meet new requirements, respond to a                     changed environment, or respond to new a technology.  An                        existing design imposes many constraints on redesign, and often                 the redesign must be achieved with limited resources.  Examples                 of this class of design problems are retrofitting of chemical                   plants, redesign of manufacturing facilities, and expansion of                  electrical transmission and distribution networks.                                   The goal of this research is to develop systematic methods                 for the redesign problem based on synthesis, simulation, and                    optimization.  The principal investigator will initially study                  the redesign problem in the context of retrofitting chemical                    process plants.  Specifically, he will develop methods for                      describing the existing process accurately, identifying the                     elements of the existing design that limit its improvement,                     generating a superstructure for describing the design with and                  without the limiting elements, identifying and modeling                         promising alternatives, and finally integrating and optimizing                  the alternatives within the existing design.                                         This research focuses on an area of design that is                         neglected by researchers because redesign appears to be easier                  than the design of something completely new.  However, most                     industrial design is redesign, and redesign is often more                       difficult because of the constraints imposed by the existing                    design.",
