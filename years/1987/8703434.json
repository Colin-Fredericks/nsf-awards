 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kohn's proposal is for theoretical research in the            physics of solids.  Principal emphasis will be on density                       functional theory and surface physics.                                                                                                                          A. Density functional theory (DFT)                                                      He plans to build on recent contributions by his group to               DFT of excited states and of time dependent processes.  In view                 of the very wide practical use of DFT for groundstate properties,               a thorough exploration of the possibilities offered by DFT for                  the calculation of excited state properties and of time dependent               phenomena (e.g. linear response theory) will be undertaken.                                                                                                     B. Surface Physics                                                                      He shall extend his studies of the electronic structure of              metal surfaces by detailed consideration of an \"exactly\" soluble                model system: a jellium positive background sphere of radius R                  with N interacting electrons.  He plans to calculate and compare                the energy and density by DFT, hypernetted chain theory and                     quantum chemical methods.                                                                                                                                               A second major interest is in the dynamics of inelastic                 scattering of atoms from surfaces, with the emission or                         absorption of phonons.  Here he plans to build on completed model               calculations in two limits: adiabatic and anti-adiabatic                        corresponding to incident velocities fast or slow relative to                   characteristic speeds of the target atoms.  His aim is a                        consistent and comprehensive theory.                                                                                                                            Other potential projects are Landau theory of semi-infinite                     systems and electronic structure of quasicrystals.",
