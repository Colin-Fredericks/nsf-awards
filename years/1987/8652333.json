 "awd_abstract_narration": "This national leadership project for superior level computer                    science/mathematics instruction of high school mathematics/science              teachers combines two six-week intensive summer instruction in                  computers, Pascal and algorithmic mathematics with individualized guided        home study operation and a two day meeting at mid-year during the               intervening academic year.  The participating teachers will run in-             service workshops/seminars for their schools, upon completion of the            program.                                                                                                                                                        The goals of the project are to assist high school teachers to:                                                                                                 o be proficient in teaching the essence of computer science,                      namely the construction and testing of algorithms;                            o experience intensive supervised hands-on instruction;                         o become lead teachers and run workshops for their school                         districts;                                                                                                                                                    The first summer (1987) 60 teachers, half from California and half from         a national applicant pool, from a varied demographic and ethnic                 backgrounds, will meet at the University of California, Santa Barbara.          They will study: structured programming in Pascal; data structures in           Pascal; and algorithmic mathematics.  During the intervening academic           year, there will be a nine month program of guided home study under the         direction of project faculty and staff via a hot line telephone, mail-in        assignments and a mid-year mini-conference at the UCSB microcomputer            laboratory. The next summer (1988) the same 60 teachers will return to          UCSB to study: computer systems; programming language organization and          implementation; and topics in algorithmic mathematics.  The teachers            will also take seminars on how to develop computer workshops for                colleagues in their school districts, and how to translate their course         work into materials for class use.                                                                                                                              The project director is Marvin Marcus, professor of mathematics and             computer science and a vice-chancellor at UCSB. Marcus is recognized            internationally for his work in  the mathematical sciences.  The senior         personnel will consist of Ralph Shively, professor and chairman of the          department of mathematics and computer science at Lake Forest College,          senior  mathematical scientists, research learning expert, and                  evaluators from UCSB and Lake Forest.                                                                                                                           Cost sharing by UCSB consists of paying the administrative costs of the         director of university extensions, and exclusive use of the micro-              computer laboratory.",
