 "awd_abstract_narration": "The decision to launch a space shuttle is an example of a decision              that is made in a distributed decision making environment.  Distributed         decision making (DDM) typically refers to decision making when the              decision makers or the information are distributed across information           processing centers.  A decision maker may be a group of humans, a               single human, or a basic transaction (piece of a computer program).             The concern of this proposal is with DDM environments where the                 decision makers are humans organized hierarchically and dispersed               across information processing centers that may or may not be                    geographically separate.                                                                                                                                        Most work on human decision making has been concerned with the behavior         of individual decision makers.  It is quite clear that it is                    unrealistic to lump together identical people into an \"economic man\"            or \"ideal decision maker\".  Such models tend to make erroneous                  predictions vis-a-vis group decision making.  Consequently, what is             needed is a way of aggregating individual models that does not violate          the constraints placed on individual decision making due to the fact            that are involved in a distributed decision making enterprise.  There           is a need for a model of the human decision maker in a DDM environment.         Such a model would decrease reliance on expensive field exercises and           war and organizational games where parameters affecting decision errors         are difficult to control.  Further, such a model would enable                   researchers to make predictions about human decision making behavior in         distributed environments which could then be empirically tested.",
