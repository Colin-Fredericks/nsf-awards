 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational techniques are being developed for discovering elusive            combinatorial configurations, specifically:  t-designs and Ramsey               numbers.  The search algorithms being employed in the two cases are             similar as are the computational techniques and theoretical tools.  In          recent work the PIs have found a notable special design as well as a new        family of designs.  They are now refining the techniques used,                  developing new implementations, and constructing new algorithms to              continue their computations.  In their recent work on Ramsey graphs             several new lower bounds were discovered for Ramsey numbers.  The PIs           are now exploring several new approaches for making further improvements        in lower and upper bounds.  It is hoped that they will compute the exact        value of one or more of the small Ramsey numbers.                               The proposed work will continue the valuable work that the PIs started          during their previous RUI grant which was for a period of only 12               months. The results of the previous grant have been highly rated and            further results along the same line are anticipated.  The proposed work         provides very appropriate experience for the students involved.",
