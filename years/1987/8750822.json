 "awd_abstract_narration": "A recently acquired Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer (FTIR)         is being used in the laboratory programs in Analytical, Organic and             Physical Chemistry at Lafayette College. Experiments hitherto not               possible, such as analyses of residues in extracts from contaminated            soils, studies of structural changes of compounds upon interaction with         solvents, and studies of very rapid decomposition reactions, are being          carried out. Contrasting the capabilities of FTIR with dispersive               infrared spectrophotometry in these cases gives a deeper understanding          of the inherent superiority of FTIR and of certain aspects of instrument        development. In addition, the availability of FTIR is increasing                student-faculty research activities, thus strengthening the professional        training of chemistry majors. At Lafayette College, a large proportion          of these are women.",
