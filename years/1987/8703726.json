The Principal Investigator                      will:  (1) Classify essential mechanisms that contribute                        significantly to the observed stochasticity of soft hadron                      production at very high collision energy; (2) Analyze the                       event-by-event fluctuations of hadron production to conclude                    whether there is a tendency of phase transition in prehadronic                  matter produced at very high energy; (3) Study the influence of                 local correlations such as clustering and the quantum                           mechanical Bose-Einstein effect on the characteristics of the                   many-body system; (4) Extrapolate partial coherence reflected                   in hadronic multiplicity distributions to the SSC Tev region to                 estimate the range of multiplicity fluctuation; (5) Clarify the                 similarities and differences between the phenomenology of QCD                   soft hadron distributions and QED photon distributions,                         specifically due to charge conservation and the isospin degree                  of freedom, and (6) Establish the existence of the subPoisson                   distribution as a consequence of the nonlinear hadronic                         production mechanism.                                                                This work, to be carried out by a highly-regarded                          elementary particle theorist, is very important to our                          understanding of the most common occurrences in the production                  of hadrons in elementary particle collisions.",
