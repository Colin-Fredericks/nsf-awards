 "awd_abstract_narration": "American Indian Schools: Science Teacher Development, organized                 under the direction of the American Indian Science and                          Engineering Society, will enhance the general science background                of 40 teachers, grades 5-8, from schools in which the majority of               the students are American Indians.  Over a three year period,                   teachers will develop and test classroom materials which                        interface science and the culture/tradition of American Indians.                                                                                                In the first summer, 20 teachers will attend the program at the                 Colorado School of Mines, study general science, meet and learn                 from prominent American Indian Scientists, and develop draft                    teacher materials employing cultural integration in science.                    After using, testing and evaluating these materials during the                  academic year, the teachers will return for a second summer                     science program, with 20 additional teachers. After refining the                classroom materials the teachers will all use and evaluate the                  refined draft edition in the academic year. During the third                    summer 10 teachers will return to revise the volume of lesson                   plans and prepare it for distribution, through AISES, to teachers               in 1200 American Indian schools.                                                                                                                                If American Indians are to realize increased participation in key               scientific and technical positions, programs must be developed                  that significantly enhance the opportunity for American Indian                  youth to have high quality mathematics and science preparation.                 Increasing the knowledge and motivation of teachers is the best                 means of delivering a more knowledgeable students to college.                   This is critical to enlarging the pool of students eligible to                  participate in mathematical and scientific fields.",
