 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to design and validate a computer-simulation                model of the tissue forming the menisci of the human knee.  This                research would be pursued as part of the Industry/University                    Cooperative Research Center for Interactive Computer Graphics at                the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  Modern minimally-invasive                surgical techniques make it conceptually possible to construct a                surgical-training simulator, and research will be directed towards              this goal.  Modeling constraints are different from those normally              encountered in either computer graphics or biomechanics.  The                   model must be capable of supporting real-time simulation, produce               visualizations showing both the structural character and the                    surface of the material, and provide a convincing mechanical                    response.  Simulations will treat meniscal tissue as a composite                consisting of fluid within a porous solid matrix.  Initial                      modeling will capitalize on two very different methodologies:  1)               finite-element, and 2) particle-system approximation.  The finite-              element approach promises highly accurate biomechanical                         representation, while the particle-system approach will be more                 amenable to parallelization and graphical rendering.  The eventual              goal is to develop a hybrid representation.                                          In addition to the principal investigator, it is proposed to               support  a woman undergraduate student from Williams College.  All              personnel are highly qualified.                                                      The Program Manager recommends that Williams College, a RUI,               be awarded $30,000 for one (1) year for this project.  This                     includes $5,000 for \"Supplemental Funding of Women, Minority and                Handicapped Engineering Research Assistants.",
