 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will utilize the expertise of 30-50 of local science              professionals (Content Specialists) and 150 elementary school teachers          in a four week inservice training partnership.  The workshop will               benefit from the strength and uniqueness derived from the active                participation of two science-rich communities.  One is the greater              Livermore, California area that includes 5000 practicing scientists,            technologists and engineers.  The other community is the \"Space Coast\"          area of Brevard County, Florida where the science resources are greater         than those of Livermore.                                                                                                                                        The aim of \"Helping Our Partners Enrich Science\" (HOPES) is to bring a          high quality science program into the elementary classroom and is based         on a proven pilot program.  HOPES summer workshop will include content          training, topic selection, lesson development, mentor teachers                  development, follow-up activities and the development of a manual.  The         program will involve scientists and teachers working together in the            learning, teaching and sharing of basic skills, strategies,                     methodologies and content information for effective teaching of science.                                                                                        The staff for both locations of this project is highly qualified.  In           addition, to the college level personnel, two Master Teachers are               included on the instructional staff.  The combined team represents a            broad range of experience in science and science education.                                                                                                     HOPES should provide a highly refined and well documented program for           teacher inservice training in science and for training scientists and           engineers as classroom resources.  This program has the potential to            become a model which can be replicated in many other science-rich               communities throughout the country and is in keeping with the purpose of        the Division of Teacher Preparation and Enhancement.",
