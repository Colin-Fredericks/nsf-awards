 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Felker plans to carry out a program of research which falls                 into three areas, all involving time-integrated and picosecond                  time-resolved spectroscopy on jet-cooled species.  In the                       first, picosecond spectroscopy will be applied to the study of                  vibrational energy flow in the electronic ground-state                          manifolds of molecules.  His second major area of interest is                   the application of the (recently observed) rotational coherence                 phenomenon to high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and to                     studies of the rotational state-changing collisions of large                    species.  In the spectroscopic studies, rotational coherence                    effects will be used to obtain sub-Doppler, megahertz                           resolution measurements of the rotational constants of                          molecular complexes and clusters, with the aim of elucidating                   the structures of the species.  His third area of interest is                   the spectroscopy and dynamics of jet-cooled, isolated                           transition-metal coordination complex ions.                                                                                                                     This work is important because it involves looking at energy                    flow within molecules.  Questions such as how rapidly                           vibrational energy once deposited in a specific mode is                         redistributed in a molecule and just where it ends up are of                    fundamental importance to understanding chemical reactivity.",
