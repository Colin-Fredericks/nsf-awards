 "awd_abstract_narration": "As an engineering design evolves, there is a constant interplay of         system definition and performace analysis.  A successful computer-aided         design system must, therefore, not only support tools for convenient            interactive three-dimensional geometry definition and modification, but         also provide algorithms and computational resources for rapid system            simulation.  These critical issues of three-dimensional geometry                definition and high speed computation are addressed in a unified fashion        by the Geometry-Defining Processor to be explored under this research           grant.                                                                               Geometry-Defining Processors, or GPDs, are microprocessors housed          in physical geometric packages that can be manually assembled or                reconfigured.  An individual GPD has information on its own parameters,         is able to communicate with neighboring GPDs, and is capable of                 performing independent numerical computations.  An assembly of GPDs is          able to define both a three-dimensional system geometry and, operating          as an optimally connected parallel processor, efficiently solve the             associated continuum partial differential equations needed for design           evaluation.  Combining simplicity-of-use with powerful computational            capabilities, the GPD design system should prove useful in a broad range        of engineering applications.",
