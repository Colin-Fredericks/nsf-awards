 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemistry.  It contains                 five specific research thrusts: (1) Studies of electron transfer                kinetics across well-defined Langmuir-Blodgett oriented molecular               films; (2) Electrocatalysis using colloidal clay-supported                      electron transfer mediators; (3) Mechanistic studies of the                     electrocatalytic reduction of dioxygen; (4) Studies of                          polyoxymetallates as electrocatalytic reagents; and (5) Oxidative               electrocatalysis using nitroxyl compounds.  These studies address               fundamental issues in heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics                  across membrane-like molecular structures, basic studies in the                 electrochemistry of dioxygen that are of prime importance to                    efficient fuel cell technology, and the development and                         evaluation of new catalytic systems with which the                              electrochemical production of desired materials can be made to                  proceed selectively and cost effectively.                                                                                                                       Realization of the goals of this project can be expected to                     enhance our understanding of the fundamentals of electron                       transfer processes at membrane-solution interfaces, which is                    essential to the development of biosensors, and to define new                   electrocatalytic systems with which economical electrosyntheses                 and the efficient interconversion of electrical energy and                      chemical energy can be facilitated.",
