 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing national need for science, engineering and                  technological personnel make the participation of all sectors of the            U.S. population in these areas imperative.  Women, certain minority             groups, and physically disabled persons continue to be underrepresented         among those pursuing science and engineering degrees.  Colleges and             universities have made efforts to increase the participation of these           target groups in science and engineering through precollege programs to         develop student interest and skills, recruitment programs to bring              students into science and engineering majors, and retention programs to         improve graduation rates.  However, the extent and effectiveness of             these programs and services has not been examined, especially at the            undergraduate and graduate levels.  Through surveys and intensive case          studies directed at top research universities, minority institutions,           and women's colleges, this project will determine the number, types,            and effectiveness of programs and services currently housed at these            U.S. institutions which are aimed at increasing the participation of            female, minority, and physically disabled students in science and               engineering.  Findings of the project will be disseminated through a            conference on recruitment and retention efforts and through the                 publication and distribution of a report on the recruitment and                 retention of female, minority, and physically disabled students in              science and engineering.                                                             The project will make an important contribution to NSF and national        understanding and implementation programs to broaden participation in           science and engineering.",
