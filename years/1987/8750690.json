 "awd_abstract_narration": "New laboratory experiences for undergraduates in three Biology courses          which have a substantial Physiology component (Human Anatomy and                Physiology, Principles of Biology, and The Biological World) are being          developed using new equipment acquired through this grant.  The project         has three major foci: teaching students how to interface computers with         laboratory equipment, how to use computers to acquire data, and how to          manipulate and analyze data with computer assistance.  This equipment           makes it possible to consider aspects of cardiovascular physiology,             respiratory physiology, and the physiology of reflexes that previously          could not be addressed in these courses because the requisite equipment         was lacking.                                                                                                                                                    Laboratory experiments in other areas also are being upgraded by                involving students more directly.  Laboratories being improved in this          way include the EKG labs; lung physiology labs; exercise physiology             labs; and labs in biochemistry and human genetics (where computer               simulations are being used extensively).  A laboratory manual is being          prepared that reflects the hands-on experiences of this P.I. and his            students.",
