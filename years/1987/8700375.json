 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been intense recent interest in the                           geneticmechanisms by which plant and animal populations respond                 tonatural selection.  Theories of population genetics suggest                   thatfunctional interactions between different genes of an                       organismmay result in adaptations not predicted from studies of                 thedifferent genes independently.  These kinds of gene                          interactionshave been well.documented in some laboratory animals                anddomesticated plants, but have never been evaluated in                        naturalpopulations of animals or plants.  The reason for this is                thatgene interactions are difficult to document in diploid                      organismswithout extremely complicated, expensive, and                          time.consumingbreeding programs.                                                        This proposal initiates a project to measure                            interactionsbetween different genes by concentrating on an                      organism whosehaploid genetic system simplifies the analyses                    considerably. Gene interactions that determine the degree of                    tolerance to heavymetals will be evaluated because metal                        tolerance is clearlyadaptive to plants in habitats contaminated                 at toxic levels. This research will significantly further our                   understanding of thegenetic mechanisms of adaptation and                        evolutionary change.  Themethods of genetic analysis developed                  for this study will beapplicable to other organisms as well.",
