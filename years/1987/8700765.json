 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will involve the development of experimental data         and a theoretical framework for the transfer of electrons between               metal-containing molecules in the gas phase. Although such reactions in         solutions have been under investigation for several decades, many               details of mechanism remain obscure because of the difficulty of                evaluating the role of solvent molecules. This gas-phase study will be          conducted in the absence of solvent and is expected to allow an                 evaluation of the intrinsic factors which govern the rates of this              extremely important class of chemical and biochemical reactions.                                                                                                Redox and photochemical processes involving primarily metal-containing          reactants in the gas phase will be studied by using Fourier transform           ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS).  A major goal of          the project will be to provide data on gas-phase redox reactions of             large polyatomic reactants, so that this class of reactions may be              compared and contrasted to electron transfer reactions of small                 molecules in the gas phase ( i.e. atoms and diatomics) and large                reactants in condensed-phase processes. Kinetics and thermodynamic              properties will be measured for electron-transfer reactions involving a         variety of reactants, theories will be developed to model gas-phase             redox reactions of polyatomic species, and solution and gas-phase               results will be correlated. The metallic species studied will be                primarily volatile organometallics, but less volatile metal complexes           and non-metallic reactants will also be investigated using laser                desorpotion. Variation of pressure, temperature and laser excitation            will be used to probe the energetics of the potential surfaces.  Marcus         theories and other models will be applied to correlate and systematize          the dependence of rates on the experimental variables. The first                extensive set of relative adiabatic ionization potentials for the               metallic complexes will be determined.  The role of electron transfer           mechanisms in the chemistry of anionic organometallic nucleophiles will         be illuminated by investigation of the kinetics and thermodynamics of           displacement reactions at carbon centers.",
