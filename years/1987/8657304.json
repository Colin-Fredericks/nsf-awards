 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator award provides five years of               support to Dr. Kenoyer. It permits him to develop and gain                      experience in techniques in archaeometric research; to continue                 his own work in Pakistan and India; and to develop new teaching                 frameworks.                                                                                                                                                     Dr. Kenoyer will learn to: prepare ceramic thin sections and                    apply techniques of petrographic analysis;  prepare samples for                 S.E.M. analysis; conduct micro.wear analysis using binocular                    microscopes; conduct trace element analysis using S.E.M. and                    electorn probe; carry out metallurgical analysis, including                     experimental replication using traditional ores and smelting                    procedures; and develop methods of ceramic replication and                      analysis. With these techniques he can both determine the methods               of production of ceramic, metal and other materials, and in some                cases also determine points of origin of raw materials.                                                                                                         Dr. Kenoyer is currently involved in a major archaeological                     excavation at the site of Harappa in Pakistan. Specific studies                 will be conducted to source shell, stone and metal ores as well                 as finished objects used in external and internal trade. He will                also study modern pottery manufacture in Pakistan and bead                      working in India to record traditional technological aspects of                 these industries and types of adaptations, both technological and               social that have occurred through the introduction of imported                  technology. This will help him to understand past cultures and                  the role of innovation in change.                                                                                                                               This work is important because it will improve Dr. Kenoyer's                    archaeological skills, contribute to our understanding of the                   past, and aid in the development of innovative teaching programs.",
