 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Martin will examine the development and differentiation of                  undifferentiated cells, interstitial cells, during embryogenesis in a           marine hydrozoan, Halocordyl disticha.  Hydrozoan planulae contain a            population of interstitial cells which either divide to maintain the I-         cell population or differentiate into ganglionic nerve cells or                 nematocytes.  Embryos treated with colchicine or hydroxyurea have either        no or reduced numbers of I cells respectively.  Five major aspects of I-        cell behaviour in larval tissues will be analyzed: 1) the dynamics of           larval stem cell repopulation in epithelial planulae; 2) the involvement        of I-cells and their derivatives in metamorphosis; 3) a determination if        larval I-cells exhibit restrictions in their developmental potential            with time; 4) an examination of the stem cell properties and                    developmental potential of a larval population of hydroxyurea resistant         interstitial cells; and 5) a comparison of the larval I-cell population         to the adult I-cell population. Pieces of different treated or aged             control embryos will be grafted to epithelial planulae and removed at           various times after grafting for analysis.                                                                                                                      The general problem approached by this research is how the spatial              pattern of differentiated cells is established during embryogenesis and         how such an organization is carried over and maintained in the adult            state.  Dr. Martin is studying  cellular commitment, proliferation and          differentiation of a manipulatable population of stem cells in a marine         hydrozoan as a model.",
