This study is investigating the scale effects on the gas and solid              flow patterns in fluidized bed systems.                                                 The studies are two integrated efforts.  The first involves             studying the flow patterns in three similar circular beds and in                three similar rectangular systems with aspect ratios of 2:1.  The               second study is investigating the fundamentals of emulsion phase                stability, bubble dynamics and associated flow of particles, gas                backmixing, and solids dispersion.  The study is divided into four              tasks: 1)  Recognition of Gas.Solid Contact Using Chemical                      Reactions, 2)  Gas and Solids Flow Patterns in Fluidized Beds,                  3)  Development of Fluidized Bed Instrumentation and 4)  The                    Effect of Configuration on Flow Patterns of Solids and Gases.                           This two year study is being cost.shared by DuPont Union                Carbide, the Electric Power Research Institute and West Virginia                University.                                                                             The Co.Principal Investigators and their colleagues are noted           experts in their disciplines and are well qualified to conduct                  this study.                                                                             The project has been coordinated with Dr. M. Ojalvo,                    ENG/CBT/PMP.                                                                            The Program Manager recommends that West Virginia University            be awarded $100,000 for the first year of a two.year continuing                 grant.  Second year funding is to be contingent upon satisfactory               research progress and companies cost sharing at least $100,000 to               complete the project.",
