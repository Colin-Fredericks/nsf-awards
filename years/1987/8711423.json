 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past few years the Surface Science Laboratory at             Yale has become established as the world's foremost research                    center for the study of the fundamental properties of oxide                     surfaces.  Professor Henrich's approach is to use single crystal                samples, prepared and studied in an ultrahigh vacuum environment                or under controlled chemisorption conditions, and to measure                    their geometric and electronic structure by using a wide range of               surface sensitive electron spectroscopic techniques.  Particular                attention has been given to the transition metal oxides, whose                  cations can have any of several different valence states                        depending upon their ligand environment; these oxides are the                   most important ones in catalysis and surface chemistry.                         Measurements on nearly perfect, vacuum cleaved surfaces are a                   necessary starting point, particularly for comparison with                      theoretical calculations.  However, his primary interest is in                  the properties of surface defects and their interaction with                    adsorbed molecules.  Surface defects have been shown to be the                  active sites for chemisorption on almost all oxides that have                   been studied, with nearly perfect surfaces being relatively                     inert.  Professor Henrich proposes here a three-year research                   program consisting both of a continuation of the most productive                research areas that are currently being pursued and of several                  new directions that will address some of the important questions                that research to date has left unanswered.  Empty electronic                    states on oxide surfaces will be examined by using inverse                      photoelectron spectroscopy, and a newly acquired high resolution                electron energy loss spectrometer will be used to study the                     subtleties of the interaction of molecules of catalytic interest                with oxides.  A collaborative effort with the IBM Watson Research               Center will use scanning tunneling microscopy to determine the                  geometry of both perfect and defect oxide surfaces and to measure               the spectra of their filled and empty electronic levels.",
