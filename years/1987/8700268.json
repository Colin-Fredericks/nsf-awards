 "awd_abstract_narration": "After demonstrating the overall feasibility of the                         computer modeling approach to investigate the frictional                        behavior of rolling bearings in Phase I, this Phase II research                 effort is directed towards the development of a comprehensive                   understanding of frictional interactions and the fundamental                    mechanics of initiation of an instability in the motion of                      bearing elements.  The fundamental interaction models in the                    available computer codes for bearing performance simulation                     shall be greatly enhanced and significant correlations between                  bearing geometry and the frictional behavior between the                        bearing elements, shall be developed for both ball and                          cylindrical roller bearings.                                                         The research effort, in addition to a significant                          contribution to the rolling bearing technology, shall result in                 enhanced computer codes which will provide the foundations for                  technology transfer and development of specific designs.  The                   findings of the research shall be significant for the design                    and performance simulation for a wide range of rolling                          bearings; the rolling elements bearings used in automotive and                  aircraft engines, gyroscopes and guidance systems, satellites                   and a variety of computer hardware are some examples.  The                      results shall be particularly significant for solid lubricated                  rolling bearings used in adverse operating environments, such                   as the adiabatic diesel engines in automotive applications.",
