 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many materials that exhibit unusual chemical reactivity or                      unusual transport properties owe their uniqueness to a                          near-degeneracy of the electronic ground state.  Existence of a                 low-lying electronic state in a molecular species results in                    thermally excited interconversions which can enhance                            reactivity.  Rates of processes involving electron transfer can                 also be affected by near-degeneracy of the ground state.  In                    materials with extended structures, \"ground state degeneracy\"                   can take the form of a high density of states at the Fermi                      level, with attendant metallic behavior.  Like their molecular                  counterparts, however, these systems are often subject to some                  form of Jahn-Teller instability which can introduce a gap at                    the Fermi level and give rise to transport properties                           characteristic of a semiconductor.                                                                                                                              In order to understand better the structural interactions that                  result in unusual properties for inorganic systems, Dr. Strouse                 will carry out extensive low temperature crystallographic                       studies.  All of the inorganic systems to be studied exhibit                    temperature dependent structures.  Almost no other laboratory                   in the country is equipped to carry out low temperature                         crystallography (as low as 20K) and related studies on the                      magnetic resonance and Mossbauer measurements of inorganic                      systems.  The experimental capability of this laboratory has                    the potential to be important for eventual structural studies                   of high temperature superconductors.",
