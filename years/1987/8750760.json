 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a result of the massive technological reform which has taken place           during the past ten years, virtually every academic and industrial              research institution now obtains infrared spectra through the use of            Fourier Transform instrumentation. To adequately prepare students who           hope to pursue research-oriented careers, the Department of Chemistry at        La Salle University has recently acquired a Fourier Transform Infrared          (FTIR) Spectrophotometer which is being used by junior and senior               chemistry majors as an integral part of four courses in the                     undergraduate curriculum: Advanced Quantitative (Instrumental) Analysis,        Qualitative Organic Analysis, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, and Senior          Research. Through this experience, undergraduates are better able to            understand the Fourier Transform method, learn how to perform peak              searches in existing FTIR spectra libraries, and utilize IR spectroscopy        as a quantitative technique.",
