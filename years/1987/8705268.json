 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of evolutionary adaptation to environmental                 stresses will be clarified by studying natural genetic variation                in the context of \"bioenergetics\", that is the flow and use of                  energy through and by living systems.  Techniques will be                       employed from molecular biology and physiological ecology, as                   well as more traditional areas of population biology.  An insect                study system, on which much progress has already been made, will                be used as a \"model system\" for examination of these processes.                         This work will yield understanding of how natural variation             interacts with identifiable environmental stress patterns and                   other selection pressures, and thus of how energy flow through                  all living beings is shaped, over time, by natural environmental                processes.  This will allow test of, and stimulate extension of,                new analytic theory of physiological organization now being                     developed.  This work is thus of importance not only to                         fundamental understanding in population biology, but to a wide                  variety of applied-biological areas.  It has already begun to                   have impact on the genetic aspects of conservation biology, and                 is starting to show major potential in genetic aspects of                       agriculture and preventive medicine.",
