 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell volume restoration following an osmotic stress is the                      property of every cell type.  The mechanism of this volume                      regulation depends upon the ability of the cell to control                      intracellular water gain and loss by regulating the intracellular               levels of ions and low molecular weight organic solutes (cellular               osmolytes).  Cells with the greatest volume regulatory ability                  have the greatest ability to control the accumulation and loss of               the organic solute molecules.  Dr. Popper has excellent evidence                that the quaternary ammonium compound, glycine betaine, is the                  primary cellular osmolyte in the heart cells of the marine                      horseshoe. Glycine betaine is also used by a number of salt                     resistant strains of plants and bacteria.  Popper feels that the                mechanisms regulating glycine betaine levels are common to all                  these salt stress resistant organisms and that the heart of this                crab will serve as an excellent model system for elucidating                    these mechanisms.  Planned experiments involve characterization                 of some of the biosynthetic and catabolic enzyme systems, studies               on uptake and utilization of precursor molecules and an                         evaluation of the changes in the regulation of gene expression                  (enzyme synthesis) under various conditions of osmotic stress.                  The results will have both basic science and practical value in                 terms of our understanding of the mechanisms of cell volume                     regulation and salt stress resistance.",
