 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators conducting this project have been studying properties         of the visual system of the horseshoe crab, Limulus, for some time.             This is a favorite model system for investigations of visual mechanisms         and principles of neural organization.  Among their important recent            discoveries is the observation that the structure and function of the           eyes are modified by signals from the brain recurring with a twenty-four        hour (circadian) cycle.  This observation is an example of a newly              emerging principle in sensory physiology: feedback from the brain alters        the nature of sensory receptors and the information they transmit to the        brain.  That is, sensory receptors and the brain are two-way                    communication systems, not unidirectional systems as had been thought           previously.                                                                                                                                                     In this project they will obtain long term recordings of electrical             signals in the Limulus retina and optic nerve in intact animals.  The           potential for doing such studies is one of the advantages to using this         organism as an experimental model.  This will permit better analysis            of the circadian regulation of retinal sensitivity.  They will also             conduct anatomical, neurochemical and behavioral studies of the system.         The goals are to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which          the brain can influence retinal structure and function; the neural              characteristics of the \"clock\" controlling circadian rhythms; the               course of development of circadian rhythms in retinal sensitivity; and          the role of such rhythms in visual behavior.  They also plan to explore         other possible animal models for studying control of visual sensitivity         by the brain.                                                                                                                                                   We expect significant advances in our understanding of vision, neural           organization, and general principles of sensory receptor modulation by          the brain to emerge from this project.",
