 "awd_abstract_narration": "On-line problems are extremely common in computer science and                   operations research.  For these problems an algorithm must be                   devised to decide how to respond to a request immediately                       when the request is made, without knowledge of future                           requests.  Some familiar examples of on-line problems are:                      Controlling an elevator, controlling a disk drive,                              controlling caches, and data structures.                                                                                                                        An extremely powerful technique in the design and analysis of                   algorithms for on-line problems is that of amortization.  In                    an amortized analysis, the cost of a sequence of requests is                    considered rather than the cost of each request individually.                   Algorithms efficient in the amortized sense balance the costs                   of expensive requests by inexpensive ones.  A variety                           of new amortized-efficient algorithms and data structures                       have been devised.                                                                                                                                              For many on-line problems there are on-line algorithms with                     amortized performance that is almost as good as the                             performance of any off-line algorithm on any sequence of                        requests.  Such an on-line algorithm is said to be                              competitive.                                                                                                                                                    The PI is applying known techniques of amortization and                         competitiveness to a variety of other on-line problems, and                     developing new techniques for doing amortized analysis.                                                                                                         The PI has been judged to be an outstanding computer                            scientist by the Presidential Young Investigator panel.",
