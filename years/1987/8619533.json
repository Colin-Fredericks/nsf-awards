 "awd_abstract_narration": "A philosopher who specializes in studies of science policy and                  environmental ethics and an ecologist who studies plant-animal-habitat          interactions will investigate two foundational concepts in ecology:             balance of nature and community.  The goal is to understand (1) the             roles of evaluative assumptions in these concepts, (2) how these                assumptions may affect the interpretations and conclusions ecologists           draw from their work, and (3) the moral justifiability of the support           that may thereby be given to specific policies regarding environmental          protection.  Meeting weekly, the two investigators will analyze 30 key          ecological works.  The ecologist has primary responsibility for the             analysis of the two concepts; the philosopher, for the ethical                  analysis.  Drafts of their work will be commented on by a group                 including several ecologists and historians, an expert in environmental         policy and a philosopher specializing in ethics and environmental               policy.  During the course of the project, several graduate seminars in         ecology will also examine these issues.  Results will include a co-             authored manuscript examining the concepts and their presuppositions,           the practical consequences of using them in environmental policymaking,         and possible answers to questions of the moral justification for their          use.                                                                                                                                                            This project will provide an important impetus to the development of            adequate analyses of theoretical and normative implications of                  ecological science.  The investigators are both exceptionally well-             qualified; graduate studies are involved; institutional support is very         good.  This is a good example of the kind of cross-disciplinary                 collaborative research EVS should encourage.  Results are likely to be          provocative and widely disseminated.  Costs are very reasonable.  Total         support in the amount of $72,044 is recommended, with $35,404 to be             awarded in this fiscal year.",
