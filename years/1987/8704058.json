 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Davis proposes to isolate cDNA and genomic clones                      containing structural information for the several known rat                     phosphodiesterases (PDEs).  Two such genomic clones have already                been identified using the cloned drosophila gene as a                           hybridization probe.  Once the rat sequences are known, isozyme                 specific regions will be selected for probes for in situ                        localization of mRNAs in the rat brain, and for characterization                of processed forms of the messages.  High titer antisera will                   also be prepared and then used immunocytochemistry of the rat                   brain.  Finally, mouse/hamster hybrid cell lines will be tested                 with the probes to establish the chromosomal locations of the                   cognate mouse PDE genes.                                                             Since their discovery by Sutherland, cyclic nucleotides have               been shown to play a central role in the regulation of cell                     metabolism in virtually all organisms.  As a result, the                        regulation of the enzymes that produce (cyclases) and degrade                   (PDEs) these compounds has continued to be a subject of great                   importance.  Considerable evidence, both direct and indirect,                   points to important roles for the different PDEs in various                     functions of the mammalian brain (for example, vision and                       memory).  As yet, however, there is little information about the                number of PDE genes, about their regulation, and about the                      localization and eventual fate of their products in the brain.                  The proposed work will provide the tools needed to provide                      this information.",
