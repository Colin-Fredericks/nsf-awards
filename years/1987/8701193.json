 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the investigation of electron-electron correlation in               atoms, the complete understanding, both experimental and                        theoretical, of its influence in helium is indispensable.  For                  the past two years the investigators have been engaged in an                    experimental and theoretical program to analyze this correlation.               The process which is examined is the photoionization to produce                 the n=2 level of the He+ ion.  Through a measurement of the                     alignment of the 2P3/2 state, the additional experiment necessary               to determine the partial cross sections for production of all                   continuum state contributing to the ionization has been performed               at two energies.  This parameter will be measured throughout the                energy region from the n=2 to the n=3 ionization limits, with                   special attention to the 3s3p resonance at 69.9 eV.                                     In support of the experimental program a theoretical                    calculation of the alignment using hyperspherical coordinates                   will be carried out.  A transformation of the alpha-coordinate                  allows solution of the angular equations using a series                         expansion.  This simplifies the numerical procedures and allows                 calculation of more accurate channel functions and coupling                     parameters.  The alignment and electron angular distribution                    parameter beta will be calculated, as well as the accuracy with                 which calculations using this technique can be made and the                     scattering phase shifts for the e- + H system.",
