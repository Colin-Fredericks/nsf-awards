 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to a Project Solicitation, the National Center for                  Supercomputing Applications, representing the University of                     Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, submitted a proposal to conduct a                 Supercomputer Summer Institute in 1987.  This proposal and eight                others were evaluated by a review panel.                                                                                                                        NCSA has proposed a two week Institute for 30 young researchers.                Students will be reimbursed for the costs of travel and living                  expenses during their stay.  NCSA has developed a series of                     training modules on the Center's Cray XMP/48 supercomputer and                  associated equipment.  This will provide the students with a                    grounding in the basics of vector supercomputer usage.  In                      addition, seminars will be conducted in advanced computing as                   applied to the atmospheric sciences, chemistry, physics, graphics,              and computer science.  Each student will be given five service                  units on the Cray.                                                                                                                                              All reviewers found this to be a solid, strong proposal with a                  balance between hands-on work and lectures.  The NCSA facilities                will be available 24 hours per day, seven days per week, with a                 workstation/personal computer dedicated to each student.  Students              will retain the service units which are not used during the                     Institute to be used later.  The costs have been controlled by                  using lecturers from the NCSA professional staff and researchers                at the University of Illinois and other local institutions.                                                                                                     NCSA has proposed a cost of $90,489.  By cutting travel costs,                  speaker honoraria and associated overhead costs, the overall costs              have been reduced to $68,000.  NCSA has also identified an                      undergraduate research component of $7000.                                                                                                                      The Centers Program recommends support of a Supercomputer Summer                Institute at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications                in the amount of $75,000.",
