Apart from uncertainties in               how to devise representative samples of organizations, in general,              there are measurement uncertainties. Specifically, what is the                  reliability of measures of organizational attributes across diverse             samples of organizations?                                                                                                                                       This investigation entails a survey in a sample of 300 firms of                 three types: for-profit businesses, non-profit, and government                  agencies. Within each, five upper level functionaries will be asked             a variety of questions about their organization's: size,                        specialization, values, and so on. Reliability coefficients will                then be computed to assess the consistency among the five                       respondents within each surveyed organization. In addition,                     covariations among responses will be analyzed to indicate what type             of functionary is best able to speak for an organization.",
