 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long-term ecological research program will be conducted on            the barrier-estuarine system on the Atlantic coast of Virginia.                 This 1,000-km2 system has developed during the period of Holocene               sea level rise.  This project is designed to incorporate a wide                 domain of scales of time and space.  The interrelationships of                  secular climate change, sea-level change, island movement, and                  marsh growth and development will be studied with data from dated               sediment cores.  The interrelationships of the current climatic                 environment, stochastic climatic disturbances and surficial                     landscape processes such as plant and animal succession will be                 studied with data from remotely-sensed imagery, field and                       laboratory experimentation, and direct field observation of                     population distributions and processes such as decomposition and                element cycling.  A system of three coupled models, including a                 biogeochemical process model, a succession model and a landscape                model, will be used both to guide and to synthesize studies of                  processes occurring on different scales of time and space.                              This research undertaking will be conducted by a truly                  remarkable interdisciplinary research group each member of which                is an outstanding scientist in his own right.  The group is                     organized in a completely integrated and collaborative fashion                  and a major synergism should result.  The University of Virginia                will provide excellent on-campus facilities for the work which                  will be a department-level centerpiece commanding a significant                 allocation of new support resources.  The Nature Conservancy,                   owners of the research site, will participate in the support of                 the project by both direct and in-kind avenues in addition to                   assuming all costs for site integrity and security.  The                        organization of the total project team is extraordinary.                                The project and scientific group come fully prepared at the             outset to assume a leadership position within the family of                     concurrent similar research efforts at the landscape scale.                     Plans are already being implemented for several kinds of                        collaborative efforts in areas of science and technology                        appropriate and important to the achievement of major progress.                 In addition to the obvious characteristics of high quality                      fundamental ecological research this project will offer the                     opportunity to affect the management of critical and fragile                    natural resources of the coastal zone.                                                  The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends that funding be                made available for the first year of this five-year continuing                  award.",
