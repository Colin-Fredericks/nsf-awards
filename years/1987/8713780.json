 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an important part of the National Ozone Expedition              (NOZE-2).  The stratospheric column density, and to some extent the             vertical profile, of the important gases (O3) Ozone, (ClO) Clorine              Monoxide and (N2O) Nitrous Oxide are measured by detecting their                molecular microwave emissions.  The proposers were participants in the          NOZE-I in 1986 and successfully measured ozone, ClO and N2O.  Their             finding that N2O was at very low concentrations inside of the ozone             hole was unanticipated by any of the models that have been developed            to explain the depletion of ozone, and the measurement needs to be              made again.  They were also successful in detecting ClO in large                quantities below 20km altitude, but they were unable to determine the           amount present.  For NOZE-2, the instrument will be modified by                 doubling the bandwidth in an attempt to make a more quantitative                measurement of ClO concentration.",
