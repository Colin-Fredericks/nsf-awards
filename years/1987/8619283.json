 "awd_abstract_narration": "Occurrences of closely related, terrestrial vertebrates at mid-                 latitudes in North America and Asia suggest that Alaska was part of an          intercontinental route of overland dispersal and supported diverse              faunas during the late Cretaceous.  Until recently the composition of           these faunas was unknown.  Discovery of concentrations of dinosaur              fossils on the Alaskan North Slope opens the possibility for the first          assessment of the composition of this Cretaceous fauna.  Field work in          this area will allow thorough sampling of the vertebrate fauna                  preserved in North Slope localities.  Members of the U.S. Geological            Survey are investigating the invertebrate paleontology, paleobotany,            tephrachronology, and magnetostratigraphy of this geological section.           Correlated with these and other lines of investigation, the                     occurrences should yield information on the tolerances of some                  dinosaurs to extremes in temperature and light conditions.  Most                current hypotheses concerning dinosaurian extinction invoke either              catastrophic or gradual environmental change as a causal factor.                Determination of the probable ranges of environmental tolerance of              Alaskan dinosaurs will contribute to the evaluation of these                    hypotheses.",
