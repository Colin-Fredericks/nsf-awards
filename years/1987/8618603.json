 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States Geological Survey is opening the 5030-ft-deep                 Varian A-1 well, 4 km southeast of the expected epicenter of the                next Parkfield earthquake.  It is proposed to NSF that this well be             instrumented with a 4-part sensor array to conduct basic research               into the character of small earthquakes and the physical properties             of the San Andreas Fault Zone.  The design, installation, data                  collection, and data analysis for this project will be conducted by             University of California, Santa Barbarba in collaboration with                  University of California, Berkeley.  The sensor array will consist              of: (1) an \"ultra low frequency\" downhole pressure transducer and               1-hz seismometer at the bottom of the well, (2) a set of 8 \"low                 frequency\", 2-hz 3-component gimbled seismometer packages spaced at             200-meter intervals along the well, (3) a set of 8 \"high frequency\",            4.5-hz 3-component pressure-cased seismometer packages at 20-meter              intervals near the bottom of the well, and (4) a set of 8 \"ultra                high frequency\" 1000-hz 1-component accelerometers at 2-meter                   intervals, also near the bottom of the well.  In this present                   proposal, UCSB seeks funds to construct and cement the array into               the well.  An additional but separate part of our proposal is to                collect microearthquake data and analyze microearthquake Vertical               Seismic Profiles recorded on the \"low frequency\" part of the array.             Requests for funding of data collection and analysis for the other              parts of the array will be submitted in separate proposals by UCB.",
