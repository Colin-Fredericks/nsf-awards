 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Little is undertaking an examination in the philosophy of the               social sciences organized around four recent controversies in                   empirical agrarian studies.  His study is designed to permit the                formulation and analysis of topics in the philosophy of social                  science that are concretely related to the current practice of social           science.  This investigation analyzes the main theoretical and                  methodological controversies in these four debates and attempts to              determine how these theories illuminate issues in the philosophy of             science.  The primary aim of this investigation is to arrive at a               more detailed and accurate representation of the logic and diversity            of social science than is available in the philosophy of science                literature today.  This study will shed new light on traditional                problems in the philosophy of social science, and it will suggest new           problems for further research within this area.  A second goal of               this research is to contribute substantively to ongoing debates in              the concrete areas under scrutiny.  Experience in other areas of the            philosophy of science shows that philosophical examination of current           empirical research can be of significant benefit to the practicing              scientist in clarifying conceptual puzzles, analyzing issues in the             logic of explanation and confirmation, and the like.  Many of the               issues in the area of agrarian studies which Dr. Little is examining            are ones that cut across disciplinary boundaries and involve abstract           philosophical concepts like rationality, community, or moral values.            A philosopher's treatment of these issues in their context in the               empirical literature should be of interest to the practitioners                 themselves.  Thus the research produced from this project promise to            be of great interest to both philosophers and social scientists.",
