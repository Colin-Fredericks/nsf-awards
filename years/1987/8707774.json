 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the study of surface damage accumulation during         fatigue of oxide dispersion strengthened nickel which has been surface          modified by ion beam mixing of aluminum.  The work is intended to               advance the understanding of the mechanisms by which novel surface              modifications can influence cyclic deformation phenomena associated with        fatigue crack initiation and thus prolong fatigue life.  Results will be        compared with those recently obtained in a study of pure nickel with            similar surface modifications in which it was found that the behavior of        the surface layer was controlled mainly by bulk plastic strain                  localization events.  The research will focus on an alloy which is              chemically similar to pure nickel (since the dispersoid phase is inert),        but which will display different behavior with respect to slip band             extrusion, cyclic hardening, and plastic strain localization behavior.          Specimens will be prepared using an established technique of vacuum             evaporation of multiple layers of Ni and Al followed by high energy             inert ion irradiation, resulting in a supersaturated solid solution of          Al in Ni in a surface layer about 100 nm thick.  These will be subjected        to plastic strain controlled fatigue while monitoring the accumulation          of surface damage by scanning electron microscopy and optical                   interferometry.  Slip homogeneity and the spatial distribution and the          detailed local morphology of slip bands features will be analyzed and           compared to the behavior of unmodified nickel in both the pure and              dispersion strengthened forms.",
