 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI is a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) and describes         her research as follows:  Computer-aided-design (CAD) techniques play a         major role in the design and performance of Millimeter-wave Monolithic          Integrated Circuits.  Despite the need, none of the existing CAD                capabilities can really work well for designs intended for very high            frequencies.  This project aims at developing accurate CAD algorithms           for characterizing shielded-microstrip interconnects such as via-holes          in the mm-wave range.  The method to be applied for the solution of the         above problem is a Finite Element Method for Integral Equations.  The           advantage of this method over other existing ones is its ability to             solve both horizontal and vertical discontinuities.  The above                  analytical technique can provide a rigorous field solution for any              microstrip interconnect with as many of the involved physical factors           incorporated and possible including:  surface waves, radiation,                 dielectric losses and n=mutual interactions between circuit elements.                Computer-aided-design (CAD) techniques play a major role in the            design and performance of Millimeter-wave Monolithic Integrated                 Circuits.  Despite the need, none of the existing CAD capabilities can          really work well for designs intended for very high frequencies.
