 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structuring classrooms in which students work cooperatively rather than         compete or work individualistically has been shown to be powerful in            several key ways.  Cooperative learning groups produce a learning               environment where more students learn more material, students are more          positive about the subject area and more motivated to take additional           classes.  In addition, there is an acceptance of differences which              encourages the achievement of both males and females, handicapped and           non handicapped, students of different ethnic backgrounds, and students         who do not have English as a native language.                                                                                                                   The goals of the project are to train leadership teams of science and           mathematics teachers in school systems where cooperative learning has           already been introduced and to initiate basic training in cooperative           learning in other prominent school systems, including at least two inner        city sites.  Over 600 mathematics and science teachers from eleven key          school districts across the United States will be trained in how to             structure cooperative learning groups in their science classrooms.  In          addition, a model for building cooperative learning into already                existing curricula in science and mathematics will be developed and             implemented.",
