 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teaching undergraduates to use modern chemical instrumentation has              become increasingly difficult due to the sophistication and complexity          of both the instruments and the theory upon which they are based. This          situation has aggravated the problem of scheduling experiments at the           most opportune time. A unique plan to overcome these difficulties is            being implemented by the Chemistry Department of the College of the Holy        Cross by merging the Physical Chemistry and Instrumental Analysis               Laboratories into a coherent three-semester advanced laboratory program.        An orderly progression from basic instrumental laboratory techniques in         the first semester to challenging and advanced topics in the third              semester is being followed. During the first semester a unique                  timesharing approach utilizing the rapid data acquisition capabilities          of a an ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) rapid scan spectrophotometer and a         Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer makes it possible           for all students to concurrently carry out a series of introductory             experiments in spectroscopy. During the same semester they will be              introduced to the use of the computer as a data station. The culmination        of the students' laboratory experience occurs in the third semester             where they devote attention to projects centered around some of the             challenging and advanced techniques essential to carrying out modern            chemical research, including the use of lasers in chemistry, techniques         for studying very fast reactions, and microcomputers.",
