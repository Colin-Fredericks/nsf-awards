The proposed                   research extends Dr. Etzler's work on the biosynthesis,                         distribution and regulation of a family of lectin proteins from                 the legume, Dolichos biflorus that have recently been                           characterized.  It addresses such questions as what are the                     biosynthetic steps leading to the different subcellular                         distributions of these proteins and how is the biosynthesis                     regulated.                                                                                                                                                      Lectins are proteins, originally identified in plants, that bind                certain sugar moieties in a highly specific manner.  The                        physiological role(s) of lectins is still unknown but their                     widespread occurrence implies their importance.  It has been                    suggested that they act as recognition molecules.  The results of               this study should contribute to an eventual understanding of the                physiological role of plant lectins as well as provide basic                    information on the spatial and temporal regulation of the                       production of closely related proteins.",
