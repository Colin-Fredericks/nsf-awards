 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reactions and removal of tropospheric sulfur dioxide occur via a            variety of pathways.  The dominant gas phase reaction path, with the            hydroxyl radical, is thought to be characterized by a sulfur dioxide            half-life of 7-14 days.  Reaction on aerosol surfaces, and in haze and          cloud droplets results in the direct production of sulfate in cloud and         precipitation water.  Laboratory kinetic data suggest that aqueous phase        reactions of dissolved sulfur dioxide with peroxides and ozone are the          most efficient pathway by which sulfur dioxide is removed from the              atmosphere.  To complement laboratory data, and because of the need to          understand processes which produce oxidized sulfur species in tropospheric      clouds, field studies are recognized as important objectives of                 atmospheric chemistry research.  Knowledge of the oxidants and processes        responsible for the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid are           essential if predictions of precipitation composition are to be made.               The oxidation of sulfur dioxide dissolved in cloud droplets is thought      to be affected by several factors which make it difficult to extrapolate        laboratory studies of aqueous sulfur dioxide oxidation to natural cloud         systems.  In this research a set of unique experiments designed to measure      the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfate in orographic clouds will be        carried out.  These measurements will be compared to a detailed cloud           chemistry model using laboratory derived rate constants and cloud               composition measurements as input parameters.  The experimental strategy        is to release pulses of sulfur dioxide into the cloud from a ground based       generator and to collect cloud water as a rime ice deposit during plume         detection at the mountain top observatory. This experimental design has         been tested and shown to be capable of producing usable results.  Plume         transport times will be measured using several shorter pulses of an inert       tracer during the sulfur dioxide releases.",
