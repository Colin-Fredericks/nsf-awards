 "awd_abstract_narration": "The processes by which trace metals such as FE, Mn, Cu,                    Pb, Zn, Mo, V, Cd and Co are incorporated into organic-rich                     sediments of saline lakes will be elucidated by studying three                  contrasting closed basins:  Great Salt Lake, Utah, Mono Lake,                   Cal. and Walker Lake, Nevada.  Great Salt Lake bottom waters                    are anoxic and consist of concentrated sulfate enriched                         brines, Mono Lake is highly productive and alkaline, with                       carbonate-enriched brines and an anoxic sediment sulfate.                       Walker Lake is alkaline, but less concentrated and less                         productive, and its sediment-water interface is only temporarily                anoxic.  Lake waters, pore fluids and sediment to 1 meter depth                 are to be analyzed and studied with special emphasis on metal                   complexing by organic matter, such as humic substances.                         Preliminary data suggest that at Great Salt Lake metals are                     precipitated as sulfides in the hypolimnion.  At Mono Lake,                     metals are mobilized very near the sediment surface.  Within                    the sediment, hydrogen sulfide production is high and metals                    are precipitated.  At Walker Lake, an oxy-hydroxyde layer is                    formed at the sediment-water interface.  A molybdenum maximum                   exists in the pore fluids at 10 cm and in the sediments at 15                   cm depth, indicating considerable metal redistribution in                       response to redox changes.  A comparison of metal distribution                  between lake waters, pore fluids and sediment in these three                    contrasting sites promises to provide significant insights into                 metal accumulation in black shles and oil shales deposited in                   saline lacustrine settings.",
