The equipment includes a real time spectrum analyzer with switching,            mass storage, and graphics output capabilities; as well as transducers          and cables for making accurate vibration measurements in the laboratory,        on soil pavement surfaces, or in boreholes.                                                                                                                     It has the capability of making very accurate measurements of soil and          structural vibrations and performing mathematical operations on them.           The equipment is portable and can be used in the field as well as in the        laboratory.",
