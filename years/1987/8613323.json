 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two campaigns to measure transient tracers in the Atlantic              Ocean (TTO/NAS and TTO/Equatorial) were funded by NSF during the                period from 1980 to 1985.  A complete data base for modelling                   this ocean basin would include a South Atlantic Study to:                               1.Determine CO2 transports and their influence on world                 climate,                                                                        2.Constrain models of major ocean currents in this area,                        and                                                                             3.Confirm an observed 5-fold increase in the addition                           rate of new carbon to the thermocline.                                                  Eight components of such a study (SAVE) will be performed by            investigators from LDGO, Princeton, University of Washington,                   WHOI, and SIO.  The track record of these scientists is well                    established by successful completion of previous studies in the                 Equatorial and North Atlantic.  They will provide physical and                  chemical expertise which will be directed toward a cooperative                  effort to reach the goals of the geochemical study.                                     This component is aimed at correlatinag heat flux and freon             gradients across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.  This                       approach at estimating meridional heat transport is new and if                  successful would significantly increase our ability to measure                  and explain heat fluxes across ocean current interfaces.",
