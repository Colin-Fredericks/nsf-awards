 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Brush is continuing his long-term project examining theories          of the origin and structure of the Earth and other members of the solar         system in modern times.  This study spans a number of disciplines               ranging from astronomy and physics to geology.  Topics range over issues        of celestial mechanics, properties of planets and the sun, meteoritics,         the age of the Earth, and the physical/chemical state of its core.                                                                                              During the course of this grant, Professor Brush will concentrate on            issues surrounding astronomy and cosmogony since 1940.  This is a period        of radical changes in theories of cosmogony and will include specific           questions about which theories were most successful in gaining                  acceptance and why?  What criteria were used to evaluate hypotheses of          origin, and how have these criteria changed over time?  How have                developments in nuclear astrophysics, cosmochemstry, and the space              program affected the theories concerning the origins and development of         our solar system?                                                                                                                                               Professor Brush's work has proved to be extraordinarily useful for both         historians and philosophers of science.  A trained physicist, he fully          understands the technical aspects of his subject.  Such a background is         essential in studying contemporary science.  Further, he is an award            winning historian--his study of the development of thermodynamics won           the major book award in the field.  These combined scientific and               historical credentials with his proven productivity virtually guarantee         that this grant will result in significant results in our understanding         of the processes of development of contemporary theoretical and                 experimental science.",
