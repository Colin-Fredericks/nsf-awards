 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (Pol1III holoenzyme), the major                   replicative polymerase of E. coli is isolated as a complex of                   at least eight polypeptides and can be reconstituted from                       purified preparations of subunits.  Although individual                         functions of some of the subunits are still unknown,                            collectively they confer upon the pol1III holoenzyme special                    properties that distinguish it as a major replicative                           polymerase.  It is extremely rapid in locating a primer, it                     hydrolyzes ATP to initiative extremely processive synthesis,                    has high catalytic efficiency and diffuses on duplex DNA to                     search for a primer terminus.  In this proposal the specific                    aims are to study the diffusion properties of the enzyme on                     DNA, the mechanisms underlying rapid location of a primer                       terminus, the stoichiometry and spatial orientation of                          subunits within the enzyme and their interaction with a                         primer terminus.  The ultimate aim of this program is a                         detailed molecular description of the events at the                             replication fork of a growing chromosome and a grasp of the                     basic principles that underlie them.  Dr. O'Donnell has                         received excellent postdoctoral training with Kornberg and                      with Lehman, and is skilled in the techniques of biochemistry                   and molecular biology.  He is well qualified to pursue the                      proposed research.",
