 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  The objective of this project is to evaluate                 the accuracy and study the range of applications of a new, non-                 contact electrochemical method for determining mass transfer                    boundary-layer thickness in natural and forced convection                       systems.  The method, which will be applied to the                              electroplating and electro-dissolution of copper, converts                      concentration overpotentials after current interruption to a                    dimensionless concentration fraction.  The experimental data is                 then matched to a theoretical electrode surface concentration                   decay model.  Boundary-layer thicknesses are determined by                      equating the real time scale of the experimental data and the                   dimensionless time scale of the theoretical analysis.                                                                                                           The advantages of the technique over other methods of                           determining boundary-layer thicknesses are:  a) the technique                   can be applied to both electro-deposition and dissolution                       reactions over a wide range of applied currents, b) the method                  can be used to analyze convective mass transfer at irregularly                  shaped electrodes and c) the necessary experimental apparatus                   is simple and inexpensive.  The proposed research regarding                     this new technique is as follows:  a) theoretical and                           experimental boundary-layer analyses at a vertical flat plate                   copper anode and cathode with natural, forced and mixed                         natural/forced convection stirring, b) segmented copper anode                   and cathode boundary-layer experiments and c) boundary-layer                    thickness determinations in a semi-cylindrical cavity during                    plating and etching.",
