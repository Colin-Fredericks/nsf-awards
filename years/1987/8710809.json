 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant will be used to design research that will                   investigate the learning processes and strategies of Black                      young adults participating in literacy intervention programs.                   Those participants who successfully perform specific literacy                   tasks (high-literacy proficient adults) will be compared to                     participants who do not demonstrate competence on these tasks                   (low-literacy proficient adults).  The research will involve                    comparisons of task characteristics, such as type of task and                   requirements for processing information, as well as learner                     characteristics, such as problem solving approach, errors made,                 and cognitive strategies used.  Pilot data will demonstrate the                 feasibility and utility of the approach.                                                                                                                        Literacy tasks for inclusion in this research will be selected                  from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)                     Young Adult Literacy Study conducted in 1985.  The selection                    will be based on a content and error analysis of those tasks                    included in the NAEP assessment which differentiated high vs                    low proficiency in a national sample of Black young adults.                                                                                                     The principal investigator, a well-trained recent Ph.D. in                      educational psychology, will also conduct a literature review                   in the fields of cognitive psychology, the psychology of                        reading, and adult literacy and education.  This information                    will be synthesized to provide the theoretical basis for the                    research.                                                                                                                                                       This reseach has potential utility in designing instruction in                  literacy intervention programs.",
