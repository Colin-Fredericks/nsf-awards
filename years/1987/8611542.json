 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to improve experimental and                    theoretical capabilities to characterize and understand how the                 nonlinearities of catalytic reactions are manifested in reactor                 behavior.  An integrated experimental and theoretical approach is               planned to explain the dynamics of catalytic reactions and reactors.            Catalytic reactions often have nonlinear kinetics which provide the             autocatalytic steps necessary for oscillations.  The plan is to study           such systems as well as the responses of nonlinear systems to forced            disturbances and systems consisting of two or more coupled spontaneous          oscillators (such systems approximate spatial waves).  The work could           have substantial impact in two ways:  (1) as reactor types and                  operating conditions become more intricate, these phenomena may be              exploited by industry in the design and the operating phase to improve          reactor performance; and (2) aid in the design of efficient control             mechanisms for such linked systems where disturbances can propagate in          unpredictable ways.",
