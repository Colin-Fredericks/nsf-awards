 "awd_abstract_narration": "The modern world view is distinguished from the medieval or ancient             view by what has been called a quest for reality: how does the world            really work?  \"Reality\" refers here to a definite structure of the              universe independent of ourselves as observers.  In even recent                 history of science, this quest for reality has been assigned only to            those studying what we today define as science, that is our physical            and natural sciences: astronomy, physics, botany, zoology,and even              medicine, which occupies a special position.  It is also commonly               agreed that the transition occurred with the Scientific Revolution of           the 16th and 17th centuries in physics and astronomy.  Dr. Pyle, in             this pathbreaking study, argues that the modern view emerged not only           in science, but also in humanities and that it was the humanist                 traditions of the Renaissance of the 14th and 15th centuries are                aspects of the same quest which influenced the development of                   science.  She argues that the zoologists' approach to the masses of             new materials and species which were flooding into Europe as a result           of the explorations of the new world which began in the 15th and 16th           centuries drew their techniques at least analogously from the                   humanists' approach to classical texts.  The methods the humanists              used to identify texts, date them, and test their validity are                  comparable according to Jacob Bronowski to the scientific method and,           in the case of zoology, are directly analogous.  Like the humanists,            the zoologists relied increasingly on first-hand evidence,including             specimens and drawings sent from one investigator to another.  Under            this grant, she will examine manuscript sources in Europe in order to           determine the development of the new zoological methods in the 15th             and 16th centuries.  She will examine the work of a number of                   zoologists of this period in order to compare the philological and              zoological methods in order to test her hypothesis that the two                 methods are indeed analogous and stem from the same scientific                  impulse which arose in the 15th and 16th centuries.  This study thus            promises to clarify the origins not only of zoology, a little-studied           area in the history of science, but, more importantly, to lay the               groundwork for a whole new interpretation of the origins of modern              scientific methodology.  The work is controversial as any new                   interpretation of the rise of science will be.  Yet it also provides            new insights into a force which has completely reshaped the world we            live in.",
