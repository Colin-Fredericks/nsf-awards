 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to study the effects of early experience on         adult mothering behavior, and also to identify the attributes and               behaviors that provide an intermediate link between early experience and        behavior in adulthood.  Dr. Fairbanks is investigating these important          problems using a colony of captive vervet monkeys living in four social         groups at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Nonhuman Primate                Research Facility.  Results from undisturbed, captive social groups can         provide good models of behavior in expanding populations with an ample          resource base and low death rate.  These conditions might have greater          generality to some aspects of human behavior than conditions found in           more stable or declining field populations.                                                                                                                     Preliminary results from Dr. Fairbanks' colony suggest that female              vervet monkeys who were overly protected as infants become overly               protective mothers, while females who were rejected more often as               infants tend to be more rejecting as mothers.  There are also                   indications that laissez-faire mothers produce offspring who are more           independent, adventuresome, and responsive to the outside environment as        juveniles and adults, compared to the offspring of more protective              mothers.  The objective of Dr. Fairbanks' further research is to verify         these relationships between early experience and later behavior with a          larger sample of individuals, and to determine how early experience             influences an individual's ability to react adaptively to its                   environment.                                                                                                                                                    This research represents the first extensive study of the long-term             effects of spontaneously occurring variation in early experience for            primates living in naturally composed social groups.  The results will          allow Dr. Fairbanks to trace the developmental course of differences in         early experience from infancy through adulthood, and to test the                hypothesis that mothering style tends to be propagated from one                 generation of females to another.",
