 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for                   the determination of the molecular structure of compounds as                    diverse as small peptides and complex metal clusters.  When                     combined with the latest computer software, the technique is                    becoming remarkably easy to put into practice.  The acquisition                 of X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the                 ability of chemists to carry out frontier research.                                                                                                             With the aid of awards from the Chemistry Shared                                Instrumentation Program and NIH, the Department of Chemistry at                 the University of Texas at Austin will purchase an automatic                    diffractometer and the appropriate peripheral accessories to                    establish an X-ray diffractometry facility.  The areas of                       chemistry that will be enhanced by the acquisition of the                       instrumentation include:                                                                                                                                           1) Cation Radical Pericyclic Reactions in Solution                              2) Mechanisms of the Photochemistry and Electrochemistry of                        Ions, Radicals, and Radical Ions                                             3) Development of a Biomimetic Approach to Trichothecenes                       4) Organometallic Structures of Biological Importance                           5) Determination of the Structure of Covalently Bound                              Drug-DNA Adducts                                                             6) Ligand-based Systematic Modification of Properties of                           Transition Metals                                                            7) Synthesis and Properties of Chromium Complexes                               8) Relationship between Structure and Function of Bioactive                        Natural Products                                                             9) Study of Reactive Intermediates Generated by Photolysis                         or Thermolysis                                                              10) The Synthesis of Novel Macrocyclic Compounds                                11) Synthesis of Natural Products                                               12) Synthetic and Bioorganic Chemistry",
