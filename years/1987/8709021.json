 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims at the understanding of solid surface                  properties and their ability to support growth of epitaxial films               or formation of alloys.  The central piece of information sought                is the atomic structure, in particular, the difference between                  the atomic arrangements in several layers on a surface and those                expected in a truncated bulk.  This difference, called surface                  relaxation or surface reconstruction, is a fundamental property                 of solid surfaces and is investigated both experimentally and                   theoretically.  At the same time, the ability of a surface to                   sustain growth of another phase or another metal is tested.  This               growth may proceed by producing strained atomic layers clamped to               the substrate structure and has therefore interesting links to                  technology and fundamental theory because both new bulk and new                 surface phases can be produced.  The new phases include                         metastable phases and magnetic phases, as well as the formation                 of surface alloys.  One goal of the project is to determine the                 atomic and electronic structure of the epitaxial films or surface               alloys grown.  In addition, attempts are being made to shorten                  the calculations that are necessary in order to determine a                     surface structure by means of analysis of low-energy electron                   diffraction intensities.",
