 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Summary:  The research is focused on the use of polymeric              thin films in the microelectronics/computer industry.  Major areas              being studied include high density reversible mass data storage by              direct laser writing and erasure in organic thin films, interfacial             properties and phase morphology determination of these films, and               preparation and characterization of these thin films.  Both in-depth            experimental investigations and model simulations of key processes              will be pursued in order to develop feasible systems and optimize               processing conditions.                                                                                                                                          Impact on Current Technology:  Success of this research will                    allow data in massive amounts to be stored, erased at will, and                 transferred in real time.  All these tasks can be accomplished                  in light weight and compact organic media.  Information                         processing will therefore no longer be limited by current                       magnetic disk technology, which suffers from frequent head                      crashes, accidental erasure by stray magnetic fields and                        generally low data density.  The last drawback stems from the                   fact that reading and writing heads can not be miniaturized as                  to address spots smaller than about 50 square micrometers.  In                  contrast, laser pulses can be focused to expose areas as small                  as 1 square micrometer.  It is clear that if optical media are                  developed, a major bottleneck of computer technology evolution                  will be removed.",
