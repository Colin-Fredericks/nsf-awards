 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Experimental Physical Chemistry supports research of              Professor Paul N. Schatz in both experimental and theoretical                   spectroscopy.  His current research program is designed to meet the             need for basic electronic structural information about the ground and           excited states of molecular, ionic, mixed-valent and radical species.           This information is needed to test theoretical models of these systems          and to help interpret their chemical properties and reactivities.  The          PI has also pioneered in the use of the Synchrotron light source in             basic chemical research.                                                                                                                                        In forthcoming research Dr. Schatz will use magnetic circular                   dichroism, absorption and emission spectroscopy to study matrix                 isolated species over a wide spectral range from about 1500nm in the            near infrared through the visible and ultraviolet to about 120nm in the         vacuum ultraviolet.  Synchrotron based vacuum ultraviolet measurements          will be conducted using a self-contained matrix isolation                       superconducting magnetic system.  Mixed-valence species will be studied         theoretically and mixed-valent precursors of the \"organic metals\" will          be studied spectroscopically.",
