 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to provide (1) the first primarily                ethical assessment of competing waste treatment technologies and (2) a          model for introducing consideration of issues of distributive justice           and consent to risk into contexts involving technology assessment.  The         project will compare fixed (continuous) and transportable or mobile             (batch) technologies for treatment of hazardous wastes being generated          as part of the ongoing waste stream, so as to isolate the effects of            mobility on the distribution of benefits and burdens.  The principal            investigator, a philosopher specializing in issues of justice and               public policy, will collaborate with engineers, political scientists,           and experts on regulatory policy and community concerns.  The ethical           comparison of standard and alternative treatment technologies will draw         on the philosophical literatures concerning distributive justice and            consent to risk.  It will also require a review of the extensive                empirical literature, based on case studies, surveys, and interviews,           of efforts to site standard treatment facilities.  This literature also         includes discussion of the perception of risks and community                    sensitivity to distribution issues.  The team's members will guide the          principal investigator through relevant surveys of commercially                 available transportable treatment units (TTUs), and of regulations that         affect them, and assist him in the review and analysis of relevant              technical and regulatory documents.  Results will include articles              aimed at the audience interested in philosophy and public policy, and           co-authored articles, aimed at specialized technical audiences of               engineers, and corporate and regulatory officials, as well as at                community organizations and environmental groups concerned with siting          issues.                                                                                                                                                         The project will make a significant contribution to incorporating               ethical considerations into the assessment and regulation of new                technologies.  The principal investigator and other members of the              research team are very well qualified; this is exactly the kind of              collaborative research effort EVS intends to foster.  Institutional             support is excellent.  The research design is good; tasks are                   appropriately allocated and results are targeted to important                   audiences.  Total support in the amount of $114,566 is recommended.",
