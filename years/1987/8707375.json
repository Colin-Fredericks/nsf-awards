 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine the regulation by polyamines of                 the translational efficiency of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)                   mRNA.  cDNA and genomic clones for mouse ODC have been isolated,                the sequence of the 312 base 5' leader sequence has been                        determined and it has been established that increasing the                      polyamine pools of cells decreases the rate of ODC synthesis                    without changing the level of intracellular ODC mRNA.  Because                  ODC is rate-limiting for polyamine synthesis in animal cells,                   interaction of polyamines with leader represents a means by which               polyamines could contribute to the regulation of their own                      synthesis.                                                                                                                                                           Many laboratories are studying the regulation of gene                      expression at the level of transcription.  Few are characterizing               regulation at the secondary level of messenger translation.  Dr.                Coffino and his associates have been developing this system of                  regulation of ornithine decarboxylase for a number of years.                    Ornithine decarboxylase is biologically important, appears to                   play a significant role in cell growth and is subject to a                      variety of modes of regulation.  The focus in this project is on                regulation  at the translational level and the results should                   allow greater insight into the different ways a cell can modulate               the amount of product available.",
