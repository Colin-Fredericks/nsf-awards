 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquefaction, a potentially destructive type of ground failure, is              commonly associated with fine-grained soils.  Yet evidence exists that          liquefaction occurred in coarse-grained soils such as gravels in the            following earthquakes:  Fukui (1948), Japan; Alaska (1964); Tangshan            (1976), China; Mt. Borah (1984), Idaho.  In spite of this evidence,             liquefaction in gravelly soils has never been observed in laboratory            tests.  Presumably, this is due in some way to the failure of laboratory        tests to reproduce the in-situ performance of gravelly soils.  The most         probable reason for this failure is the \"membrane compliance effect.\"                                                                                           Soil samples must be held within a compliant rubber membrane when loaded        mechanically in laboratory tests.  Due to its compliance, the membrane          is able to penetrate into the surface voids between grains, and this            penetration increases with the coarseness of the soil particles.                                                                                                The objective of this research program is to develop improved laboratory        testing procedures to eliminate this membrane compliance effect in              liquefaction testing.                                                                                                                                           The P.I. is a young investigator with an outstanding track record.  He          has the facilities available to accomplish the research proposed.                                                                                               The liquefaction of gravels is of serious economic consequence for              various large construction projects because decisions have to be made as        to the necessity of remedial work:  the liquefaction potential of               gravelly soils was not recognized when these projects were designed and         constructed.
