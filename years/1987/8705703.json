 "awd_abstract_narration": "An extremely important type of chemical reaction is the addition                of oxygen atoms to an organic compound, a process called                        oxidation.  The compounds under study in this research project,                 metalloporphyrins, constitute the active sites of enzymes which                 carry out biological oxidations and also show great promise as                  laboratory and industrial catalysts for oxidation reactions.  The               aims of this project include both the synthesis of new compounds                of this type and achieving a more profound understanding of the                 mechanisms of catalytic action.                                                                                                                                 This project represents in part a continuation of present efforts               in the general area of spectroscopic studies of highly oxidized                 and unusual metalloporphyrin compounds.  Newly proposed studies                 are designed to demonstrate prototype chemical and                              electrochemical systems for oxidation of hydrocarbon and carbonyl               compounds.  Preliminary results with iron porphyrin-catalyzed air               oxidation of these molecules are particularly noteworthy.                       Deuterium NMR spectroscopy of the paramagnetic and often highly                 reactive metalloporphyrin compounds provides a central theme for                the five diverse projects described here.  Specific objectives                  include:  (1) continued synthetic and reactivity studies of                     metalloporphyrin complexes with strongly oxidizing oxyanion and                 thioanion axial ligands; (2) expanded use of fluoroiron complexes               for electrocatalytic hydrocarbon oxidations and dioxygen                        activation; (3) detailed study of chlorine(I) oxide as a                        metalloporphyrin oxidant, and evaluation of the role of this                    anhydride in manganese porphyrin mediated hypochlorite oxidation                of hydrocarbon compounds; (4) evaluation of various                             metalloporphyrin derivatives as catalysts for the air oxidation                 of aldehydes and other cosubstrates; and (5) synthesis of novel                 metalloporphyrin compounds by insertion of substrates into the                  iron-carbon bond of alkyl and aryliron porphyrin complexes.",
