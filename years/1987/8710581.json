 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of plants to resist pathogenic invasion by fungi often         involves interactions between specific host and pathogen genotypes.             Genes from the bean pathogen, Glomerella cingulata, that are responsible        for specific interactions with Phaseolus vulgaris will be isolated.             Experiments with the cloned genes will address the mechanisms                   responsible for specific recognition between host and pathogen.  The            genes will be used to test whether their expression is induced by               exposure to plants; if so, factors responsible for induction will be            identified.  Antibodies made against proteins encoded by these genes            will be used to detect their presence and cellular localization.                Experiments will be performed to determine if these proteins are the            primary signals for recognition by resistant hosts, or if they are cell-        wall degrading enzymes that release specific elicitors that are                 recognized by the host.  If the fungal proteins are the signals, they           will be used to detect the plant receptors.                                          Knowledge of how pathogens and their hosts interact on both the            genetic and metabolic level is of basic interest but the practical              considerations are also immense.  Crops are lost each year to various           diseases and only by understanding the basis of disease can rational            preventatives be designed.",
