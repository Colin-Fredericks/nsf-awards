 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Steven Mount plans to study the mechanisms whereby a second                 mutation in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster acts to suppress the          phenotypic effects of a first mutation caused by the insertion of a             transposable element into a previously functional gene.  Specifically,          he will utilize the color of the eye of the fruit fly (normally red) as         a means of following genetic changes.  When the transposable element,           copia, inserts into the white gene, the eye color becomes an apricot            hue.  A specific mutation at a second and different gene causes a               reversion to the normal eye color red.  What is the mechanism(s)                utilized by Drosophila which effects that reversion?                                                                                                            These experiments are directed at understanding the basis of extragenic         suppression in drosophila.  Most suppressible mutants in drosophila             appear to arise from the insertion of a transposable element.  Thus,            although the phenomenon is superficially similar to suppression in              bacteria, the kinds of mutants that can be suppressed, and the                  mechanism for doing so, differ in fundamental way from those seen in            prokaryotic systems.  The clarification of the molecular basis of               suppression in bacteria provided important insight into the nature of           the genetic code and the mechanism of translation; it seems likely that         the molecular details of suppression in drosophila will provide similar         insight into tissue-specific regulation of gene expression and post-            transcriptional modification of mRNA.",
