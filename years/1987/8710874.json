 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this research is to design and implement a hardware               specification language that has a hierarchical structure and a formal           semantics for specifications which not only assists in automating               several costly and error-prone tasks of VLSI design, but also guides            test case generation.  The language must have sufficient expressive             power so that it can express behavioral, structural and temporal                attributes of the chip or system design.  The basis for the language is         a purely functional specification language, developed in his doctoral           research, called the Structural and Behavioral Language (SBL).  The             proposed research will address questions of:  (1) specification of              timing protocols; (2) characterization of the formal semantics; (3)             implementation of the language using object-oriented programming                techniques; and (4) design automation capabilities including test               generation techniques.  He will exercise the language by specifying a           large and functionally complex VLSI chip.                                       As we enter an era in which fabrication of several million transistors          on a single silicon chip is possible, integrated circuit designers are          faced with the difficult problem of specifying the external behavior of         modules, their timing, and then verifying that the design meets the             specifications.  Unfortunately the advances in technologies have                rendered existing hardware specification languages inadequate for               design of large, complex VLSI circuits.  They have major short-comings          such as lack of high-level abstraction mechanisms, lack of formal               semantic definitions, poor support for design automation, and inability         to specify complex timing protocols.  What is needed is research on             means to express circuit design specifications that can uniformly               characterize the behavior as well as timing of modules ranging in size          from simple VLSI library modules to entire micro-computer systems.  The         proposer will attack this problem by designing a VLSI specification             language which has a formal notation which will capture design                  decisions precisely at all stages in the design of a chip or system.            This will facilitate a free exchange of design information, as well as          provide the structure for automatic  verification of designs.  This             research will lead to improvements in the quality, performance, and             cost of VLSI circuit designs.                                                                                                                                   This two-year award is being made under the Engineering Initiation              Awards Program.",
