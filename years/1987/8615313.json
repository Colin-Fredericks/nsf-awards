 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial funding to upgrade the spaceframe                   and radome membrane enclosing the Five College Radio Astronomy                  Observatory (FCRAO) 14-meter telescope.  Matching funds are                     being provided by Massachusetts.  Improvements of the panel                     alignment, pointing, and environmental systems during the past                  3 years have resulted in an antenna capable of efficient                        operation at wavelengths as short as 1.1 mm.  Weather                           statistics, measured attenuation data, and observing experience                 support the utility of the Quabbin site for short millimeter                    (mm)-wavelength observation for 4 months of the year.  Under                    the direction of the respected Principal Investigator, the                      replacement of the present radome-membrane fabric with a woven                  teflon laminate, which has recently become available, will                      result in a dramatic improvement in system efficiencies at                      wavelengths < 2 mm and 7 mm, as well as a significant                           improvement in the 3 mm window.  Together with the state-of-the                 art receivers available or under development at FCRAO, the                      fully upgraded system will offer angular resolution and                         sensitivity at short millimeter wavelengths that are                            competitive with facilities operated or planned by other                        countries.                                                                                                                                                      Technological applications of this project are also                             significant.  Metal spaceframe radomes are widely used to                       protect communication systems and radars in both civilian and                   military applications around the world.  The radome proposed                    here would be the first of its type, a real innovation for                      short millimeter-wavelength and sub-millimeter systems.  In                     addition, its installation at FCRAO will provide an important                   improvement in the astronomical \"testbed\" for the development                   of rugged, versatile, state-of-the-art electronics for use at                   these wavelengths, and in the training of graduate students in                  this technology.",
