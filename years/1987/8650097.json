 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Teacher Enhancement project will involve thirty teachers and               supervisors in 15 northwestern Louisiana school districts in a program          to upgrade both their mathematics knowledge and their instructional             methodologies in the teaching of mathematics.  The program participants         will provide 8 inservice sessions for their colleagues in their schools         utilizing materials and strategies developed during the program.                Program staff will provide follow-up activities to assist the                   participants in their own classrooms as well as in the inservice                sessions.  Future plans include the dissemination of this program to            other schools and school districts using the network established in this        program.                                                                                                                                                        The program includes a spring meeting for orientation of participants to        the background, goals and structure of the program.  A three week summer        workshop will stress mathematics content in whole and rational number           operations, problem solving and computer applications.  Participants            will use this knowledge to develop classroom instructional materials and        inservice modules for use in the schools.  Mathematicians, mathematics          educators and outstanding teachers will work with the teachers in the           development and evaluation of these materials.  Five formal one day             workshops will be held during the following academic year to provide            further assistance in implementation of the goals of the project.  In           addition, the Project Director will visit each school site a minimum of         three times during the year.                                                                                                                                    The Project Director is well qualified to conduct this program since she        has been actively involved in the improvement of mathematics education          for some time.  An Advisory Council, representing several consti-               tuencies, exists to assist in the planning and implementation of the            project and an exemplary staff has been retained for both the summer            workshop and the one day academic year sessions.  An excellent project          evaluation plan has been formulated.",
