 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the solar energy that drives the atmosphere enters                  through the tropics.  Understanding how the atmosphere behaves                  depends then on understanding how the tropical atmosphere and its               major weather systems work and relate to the extratropics.                          This project involves the study of the dynamics of large-scale              atmospheric motions in the tropics and in the Asia-Pacific                      monsoonal region.  The principal investigators will combine several             approaches, including theoretical and numerical modeling as well as             analysis of observational data, to investigate a variety of motion              systems.  These systems include the planetary scale 30-50 day                   oscillations, propagating and stationary tropical waves, zonally                varying mean flows and related disturbances, and the various                    monsoon circulations ranging from the summer monsoon trough over                East Asia (Mei-yu) to winter monsoon cold surges.  The purpose is               to understand the structure, behavior and dynamic and thermodynamic             mechanisms of these systems and the interactions and                            interrelationships among them.  Possible interactions of these                  motion systems with weather and climate outside of the tropics and              monsoon regions will also be investigated.",
