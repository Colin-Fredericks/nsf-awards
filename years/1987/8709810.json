 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some technologies (such as space exploration, air travel, and electric          power generation) offer significant benefits to society, but have               severe consequences of failure, as demonstrated by such accidents as            with the space shuttle Challenger and the Chernobyl nuclear reactor.            The need for highly reliable use of such technologies requires a                disciplined approach to risk management in design, construction, and            operations, particularly when several groups are involved in                    safety-related decisions.  This interdisciplinary study is designed to          incorporate organizational effects into classical reliability                   assessment.  It will generate one quantitative measure of                       organizational effectiveness by assessing how such factors as                   hierarchical structure, incentives, and protocols for distributed               decision-making can affect the physical risk.  The national air                 traffic control system is the proposed application.                                                                                                             Of particular interest is the formation of safety thresholds (the               maximum allowable failure probability for all or part of the system)            or the different groups involved; the way in which the standards                evolve as system operation becomes routine (for example, drift toward           laxity); and the effect of such variations on the overall system                reliability.",
