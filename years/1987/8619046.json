 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a result of the International Workshop on Strong-Motion                      Earthquake Instrument Arrays in Hawaii, May 2-5, 1978, and                      subsequent discussions, a cooperative U.S.-India project was                    established to organize and install an earthquake strong motion                 accelerograph array in India.                                                                                                                                   In August 1983, installation of 49 accelerograph stations was                   completed in the epicentral region of the Great Kangra Earthquake               of 1905 in India.  Since 1983, this array has been maintained by                the staff of the University of Roorkee, India.  Later, another                  strong motion array of 50 stations was installed in the area of                 Shillong, Assam, where a great earthquake of magnitude 8.7                      occurred in 1897.                                                                                                                                               Arrays such as these provide invaluable data whenever they are                  able to record a large earthquake, data which is used to better                 understand the processes causing earthquakes, the ground shaking                resulting from large earthquakes, the effect on the stability of                soil structures at a particular construction site, the response                 of a building or structure at that site, and the damage and loss                of life that could result from damage and collapse of soil                      structures and buildings.  Since large earthquakes are rare                     events, it is essential that strong motion arrays be placed in                  any place in the world where strong earthquakes are expected                    within the next decade or two.  This action will assist in                      obtaining such data from these two crucial arrays in India, one                 of which was installed as cooperative agreement between the U.S.                and India.                                                                                                                                                      The purpose of this action is to continue and to extend the                     accomplishments of this effort and to archive, digitize, and                    publish already available strong motion data in India, so that a                complete detailed data gathering program can be set up for future               research and its applications:  all scientists and engineers                    involved in earthquake hazard reduction can benefit from this                   effort by having a sound experimental basis for their analyses                  and engineering applications.",
