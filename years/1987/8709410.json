 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to produce a series of                     laboratory and numerical experiments to determine the effects of                large-scale topography on baroclinic flows in thermally-driven,                 rotating fluids.  The B-effect will be simulated with radially                  sloping bottom and top boundaries without bottom topography.                    Starting with simple 2-wave bottom topography, the PIs will                     progress to increasingly more complex topography using the                      amplitudes and phases of the dominant modes of the earth's                      topography in the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.                  Numerical models will be modified to include waves over bottom                  topography and will be integrated in parallel with the laboratory               experiments.  These models will incorporate two versions of the                 B-effect.  In one version, the B-effect will be incorporated in                 the governing equations as it appears in the equations for                      atmospheric flow.  In the other, it will be incorporated in the                 boundary conditions by assuming radially sloping bottom and top                 boundaries as simulated in the laboratory experiments.  The                     numerical solutions obtained with both forms of B will be                       compared in order to assess the degree to which the sloping                     boundaries in the experiment capture the essential influence of B               on baroclinic flows.                                                                    Much interest in the area of geophysical fluid dynamics                 research is currently focused on study of topography and rotation               induced planetary wave regimes, and their role in the                           fluctuations of the mean zonal wind.  One problem with the                      current batch of theoretical studies of topographic instability                 is that there is very little by the way of suitable observations                for verifying predictions of theoretical models.  The importance                of this project is that laboratory annulus experiments provide a                powerful means for simulating fluid behavior under various                      boundary conditions and validating theory.  The work proposed by                Dr. Pfeffer and colleagues will investigate through a series of                 laboratory annulus and numerical experiments the effects of large               scale topography on thermally-driven rotating fluids.",
