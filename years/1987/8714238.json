 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Biological Facilities Center request for the                          purchase and developmental support of a tandem mass spectrometer,               or MS/MS, to be used as a shared instrumental facility and as                   part of the Middle Atlantic Mass Spectrometry Facility.                         The instrument, to be located on the Baltimore County campus of                 the University of Maryland, will supplement existing                            capabilities available at the MAMS Facility at the Johns Hopkins                University.                                                                                                                                                     Core and collaborative research by the principal investigators                  and their staff will include both instrument development and                    applications to the analysis of complex biomolecules.  Instrument               development will focus on improving the yield of fragment ion                   information for larger molecules using both collisions and laser                photodissociation in the field.free region between MSl and MS2.                 Multiple collisions will be employed to induce                                  fragmentation,neutralize molecular and fragment ions and                        equilibrate ion kinetic and internal energy.  Fragment ions will                then bereionized by chemical ionization and permit quadratic B                  scans in the second mass spectrometer at higher resolution than                 the B/Escans normally employed for high.energy collisions.                      MS/MS will be used to induce structural fragmentation, improve                  the sample ion signal relative to matrix ions, distinguish                      fragment ions formed from several molecular ion species, and                    separate components of microheterogeneous and other mixtures not                readily separable by liquid chromatographic techniques.  These                  advantages will be exploited for the structural analyses                        ofglycopeptides, lipopolysaccharides, chemically and post.                      translationally modified peptides, synthetic nucleotides, etc. in               ongoing collaborative projects at the facility.",
