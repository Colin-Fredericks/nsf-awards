 "awd_abstract_narration": "Successful numerical weather prediction not only rests upon                appropriate modeling of physical processes frequently expressed as              partial differential equations and accurate observations used as                input data, it also depends on the efficiency and accuracy of the               numerical methods.  The numerical methods can basically be separated            into two groups: finite difference and spectral methods.  With the              finite difference methods, the spatial and temporal derivatives are             evaluated at prescribed points using Taylor series approximations.              With the spectral methods, the dependent variables are expressed as             the sum of functions that have a prescribed spatial structure and the           coefficient associated with each function is generally a function of            time.                                                                                The spectral techniques have been proven extremely worthy in the           numerical modeling of the global atmosphere, but have not been used             extensively in limited-area models.  The atmosphere in a global model           is treated as a laterally-closed spherical shell.  In contrast, the             atmosphere in a limited-area model interacts with its surrounding               atmosphere.  This open boundary condition is one of the most                    difficult aspects in limited-area modeling in meteorology.                           Under this project, a spectral method using the Chebyshev                  polynomials will be developed for both barotropic and baroclinic                limited-area models.",
