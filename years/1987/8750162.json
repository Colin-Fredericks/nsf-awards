 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this project, a Huber powder goniostat and countertube attachment,        and a Rigaku D/max IIIVB X-ray generator with vertical goniometer mount         will be purchased.  This instrumentation will serve the broad purpose of        teaching geology, physics, and chemistry undergraduate students the             fundamentals of photon counting and signal processing, interfacing of           instruments to computers, and X-ray crystallographic techniques.  It is         our perception that undergraduate programs in geology, physics, and             chemistry in general suffer from inadequacy in the teaching of                  instrument interfacing, computer simulation, and structure                      determination.  All of these aspects of experimentation are important to        the education of undergraduate geologists, physicists, and chemists so          they can pursue graduate studies or obtain meaningful employment.  The          requested equipment will be used in mineralogy, petrology, soils,               glacial geology, environmental geology, physical chemistry, chemical            instrumentation laboratories and in selected independent studies and            senior thesis research projects in geology, physics, and chemistry.",
