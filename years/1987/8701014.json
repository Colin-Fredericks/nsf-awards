 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little is known about the role of predators in tropical                    rivers.  This study will examine predator prey relationships in a               series of Venezuelan streams, where a wide range of predation                   regimes are found in close proximity.  In order to investigate                  the direct and indirect effects of predators on mayflies                        (Order:Ephemeroptera), a series of comparative studies will be                  conducted between streams that range from naturally fishless to                 others containing > 60 fish species.  Direct effects of predators               will be examined by performing field enclosure/exclosure                        experiments. Field experiments will be coupled with data on                     mayfly drift, predator numbers and diet, to determine if the                    efficacy of predators in controlling prey abundance differs                     according to predator density and/or prey recolonization                        potential.  Indirect effects of predators will be examined in                   several contexts.  Diel patterns of mayfly drift and activity on                stone tops will be compared between sites. Cinematography will be               used to explore the importance of predators in determining both                 when and where mayflies forage, and the effects of predator                     harassment on foraging efficiency.  Findings from this research                 will have bearing on general questions concerning the                           significance of predation in structuring lotic systems and                      whether the role of biotic interactions differs between tropical                and temperate systems.                                                               Professor J. D. Allan and doctoral candidate A. S.                         Flecker are well qualified to conduct the investigation which                   will entail significant logistic and scientific challenges.  The                ecology of neotropical rivers is an important area for ecological               research.",
