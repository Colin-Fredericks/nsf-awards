 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to support two distinct, yet                       highly interacting, biological facility centers:  the Center for                Prokaryotic Genome Analysis (CPGA) and the Center for                           Molecular Phylogeny (CMP).                                                                                                                                      The CPGA is being created to facilitate the acquisition                         and analysis of the DNA sequences determined for the genomes of                 selected archaebacteria as well as an eubacterial                               photosynthetic organism.  The Center will be interdisciplinary,                 its scientists being drawn from molecular biology, microbial                    physiology, computer science, information theory, and                           engineering.  The Center's activities will have a major impact on               the understanding of prokaryotic evolution, molecular biology,                  and physiology.  The Center will also be heavily involved in                    developing computer.based systems for the handling of sequence                  data.                                                                                                                                                           The CMP is an interdisciplinary group whose members share                       interests in evolutionary biology and use biochemical and                       molecular biological methods to examine the phylogenies of                      diverse sets of organisms.  In addition to nucleic aid                          sequencing, core members have nationally recognized epertise in                 other biochemical methods, especially electrophoresis and                       immunology.                                                                                                                                                     The two groups have two areas of common interest..evolution and                 the mechanics and methodology of sequence analysis.  The focus of               these facilities will be on genome mapping, gene sequencing, and                the determination of phylogenies, and examination of the sequence               evolution of ribosomal RNA genes.  The instrumentation requested                will enable the University of Illinois to become a center for                   excellence in molecular evolution.",
