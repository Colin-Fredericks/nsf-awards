Participants will present their views on the needs and priorities for           future research activities.  They will address, among others, the               following questions:  (a) What research have they found useful and why?         (b) How did they learn about the results of the useful research? (c) Did        they share this information and, if so, how and with whom? (d) What             future research would be most useful for their professional work? (e) In        what form should the results of such research be presented and                  disseminated?                                                                                                                                                   The working group will consist of Federal, State and local managers,            administrators, planners and other persons responsible for disaster             preparedness and mitigation in the U.S.  The workshop will take place at        the George Washington University, organized and conducted by staff of           the Graduate Program of Science, Technology and Public Policy.                                                                                                  The P.I. is well respected in the field of disaster preparedness,               mitigation and response and is qualified to carry out this project.  An         award is recommended.",
