 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on three years of investigation on the                      effects of grazer-algae interactions and predator-grazer-algae                  interactions in north temperate streams to ask fundamental                      questions about the influence of grazing fishes (Campostoma) on                 biotic communities and ecosystem-level processes or rates in                    stream systems.  The previous research demonstrated a link                      between predatory fishes that influenced distributions of the                   algae-grazing minnows, which in turn has strong effects on                      disribution and kinds of attached algae.  The previous research                 also suggested that grazing by Campostoma could have a direct                   influence upon the taxa of algae that dominated Ozark stream                    substrates, maintaining a \"lawn\" of primary productivity, and                   changes in kinds of algae could influence phenomena such as                     nitrogen fixation, C:N ratios, or bacterial flora.  This research               tests, through a combination of laboratory and field                            manipulations, the hypothesis that grazing fishes have prevasive                effects throughout the structure and function of temperate stream               ecosystems.  Fish have largely been overlooked as grazers in                    north temperate streams.  The present study will use laboratory                 stream comparisons of Campostoma to a variety of invertebrate                   taxa with regard to strength of grazing effects upon system                     phenomena.",
