 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to explore a few of the key cognitive         science, educational, and software engineering issues surrounding the           development of effective, computer-based, instructional systems.  This          exploration will take place in the context of building and evaluating a         specific, computer-based, instructional system-DEBUG-ASSISTANT.  It will        provide high-school students with instant, on-line feedback on the non-         syntactic bugs in their Pascal programs.  In order to build a system            capable of coping with (1) a semester's worth of assignments, and (2)           the significant variability found in students' programs, a key question         in cognitive science will be explored:  can bugs and variability be             predicted for a domain as complex as programming?  In classroom tests of        the DEBUG-ASSISTANT the educational utility of providing students with          this type of on-line assistance will be examined.  Finally, issues of           interface design for educational software and software engineering              practices as they relate to building modifiable, expert systems will be         explored.  While preliminary research suggests that bugs and variability        can be predicted, and that providing feedback is educationally                  beneficial, the use of the DEBUG-ASSISTANT will enable an investigation         of these issues in a more systematic and rigorous fashion.  This effort         will be conducted in cooperation with administrators, teachers and              students of the New Haven School System.",
