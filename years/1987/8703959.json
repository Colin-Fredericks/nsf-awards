 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was            established to provide support to strengthen the research environments          and capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or                      institutions that have substantial minority student populations.                Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or            programs in engineering.  Funding is provided for faculty research in           fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and for           the acquisition of research instrumentation.  Lehman College will use           RIMI support to acquire a scanning electron microscope to perform               studies on heavy metal distribution in biological, chemical, and                geological systems.  Scientists have gathered considerable information          on heavy metal pollution.  This study will add to this base of                  knowledge by examining the subcellular structural responses to                  metallic pollutants and by assessing the possibility of drawing                 correlations between the effects of these metals in simple but                  dissimilar cell types.                                                                                                                                          The investigators on one study will use flameless atomic absorption             spectrophotometry initially to determine the incorporation of selected          heavy metals in two test organisms:  Saccharomyces cerevisiae and               chlorella vulgaris.  Other studies will focus on topics such as                 toxicity on freshwater lake algae and controlled environmental                  systematics problems for plants.  The principal investigator has a              long history of research publications and has a commendable record as           a university administrator.  The Foundation has supported this project          because the participation of minorities in meritorious biological               research on plants will be enhanced significantly at an urban                   university.",
