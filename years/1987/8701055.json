It affects and is affected by the            society in which it is embedded.   Having said this, however, does              not necessarily imply that scientific institutions must automatically           follow society's lead.  There are important examples in this century            of scientific institutions which have resisted political and social             pressures.   Several scientific institutes in the Soviet Union, for             example, provided shelter for geneticists and their research during             the period of Lysenkoism when orthodox genetics was officially                  condemned.  During the horrors of the Nazi Third Reich, scientific              institutions also resisted official pressure.  The purpose of Ms.               Mackrakis' research is to examine the impact of Nazi policies on                science and its organization at the Kaiser Wilhelm Society while                seeking out the factors that allowed an oasis of high quality science           to continue.  Important here is the changing nature of the                      developments at the KWG; thus the development went through three                phases:  1) 1933-36:  While Max Planck was still president of the               Society he could preserve some of the Society's autonomy;  2) 1937-             39:  The appointment of an industrialist as president with the                  concomitant encroachment of more politics into the Society's affairs;           and 3) 1939-45: the war years.  Ms. Macrakis will use the travel                funds from this grant to examine files which will help to determine             what happened to the Society in the last, war period.  This research            will serve to provide much needed new information concerning the                interaction of science in society during a period of extreme                    upheaval.  She has already published on her topic.  Her dissertation            promises to be a significant contribution to this important area of             study.",
