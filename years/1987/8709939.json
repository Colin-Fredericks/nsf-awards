 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of automorphic representations is a meeting ground                 of various branches of mathematics -- for example, number theory,               Lie theory, algebraic geometry -- and of mathematical physics.                  Its origins are found in the attempt to apply the techniques of                 infinite-dimensional representation theory of groups to obtain a                deeper understanding of L-series, a dominating concept in number                theory.  As a subset of representation theory, great progress has               been made in the past few decades.  Thus, one now finds a                       remarkable expanse of technique and applications involving the                  analytic theory of modular forms, trace formulas, techniques of                 algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and functional analysis.                             The research of Professor Flicker deals with the transfer of            automorphic representations between two groups.  Recent                         collaborative work establishes the metaplectic correspondence                   relating automorphic forms on the general linear group and an                   arbitrary topological covering.  This work develops new                         techniques while also simplifying computations.  Various                        applications of these results comprise Professor Flicker's                      subsequent work.  Current plans call for work in several                        directions: Lifting theorems for automorphic forms.  Transfer of                stable orbital integrals.  Matching of orbital integrals of                     smooth functions.  Computations of characters and twisted                       characters.  Trace formulas.  Ramanujan conjecture for GL(n) over               a function field.  Congruence relations.  Applications of the                   Hecke algebra with respect to an Iwahori subgroup.",
