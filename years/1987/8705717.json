 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geological field studies will be undertaken in northeastern                Mexico in order to learn the history of the southern margin of                  the North American continent during the latter part of the                      Paleozoic Era.  This history is now very poorly known because                   there are only a few places where rocks of the appropriate age                  are exposed and there have been no studies which include both                   collection and integration of field data from all of these                      localities.  This project is a broad, systematic study of some                  of the remaining relatively unknown areas; knowledge thus                       gained will be integrated with that derived from our previous                   work in northern Mexico.                                                             That two or more lithospheric plates converged in northern                 Mexico in the latter part of the Paleozoic Era is proven by the                 presence of calcalkaline volcanic rocks and associated basinal                  sediments in southern Coahuila.  A principal objective of this                  study is to seek the kinds of information in other Mexican                      states which will help determine the orientation, geographic                    setting, and timing of convergence.  There is also indirect                     evidence that rocks formed along the boundary may have been                     disrupted by lateral movement along one or more large, NNW-                     trending faults during the Mesozoic Era.  Therefore, a second                   objective is to compare rocks along the zone of postulated                      faulting to learn about the nature of the disruptions.                               The principal contributions of this project will be                        knowledge, interpretations, and data which are necessary to                     those geologists who have been trying to fit one of the last                    pieces into the Pangaea puzzle.  Further, it is in the national                 interests of both the U.S. and Mexico to understand the geology                 of rocks which may have substantial potential as bearers of                     both petroleum and metallic mineral resources.",
