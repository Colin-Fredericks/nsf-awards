 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a cooperative research project between NSF and the Army                 Research Office (ARO).  The major emphasis of this research is to               develop a reliable means for the measurement of horizontal stress               in the ground using a cone penetrometer.  The insitu lateral                    stress has long been recognized as an important parameter in a                  wide range of applications in geotechnical engineering.  A                      quantitative value for lateral earth pressure (the ratio of the                 horizontal to vertical effective stresses) is needed for                        virtually all stress-deformation and stability analyses; e.g.                   settlement, bearing capcity, pile capacity, slope stability and                 design of retaining structures.  Safe and economical design of                  these earth structures and reinforcement systems requires the                   knowledge of the horizontal stress.                                             The research program develops theoretical analysese of stresses                 around penetrometers and verifies the results with laboratory                   chamber tests and field tests using a recently developed lateral                stress sensing cone penetrometer (LSSCP).  Tests will be done at                several sites in the San Francisco bay area where different soil                types ranging from soft clays to clean sands are encountered.                   During the first year of the proposed 3-year program, the lateral               stress sensing cone penetrometer testing system will be improved,               theoretical analyses related to stress fields around                            penetrometers and in test chambers will be made, and preparations               will be completed for field tests.  During the second year, field               tests will be done at several sites using several different test                devices in addition to the LSSCP.  The field and laboratory                     testing will be completed early in the third year.",
