 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for the final analysis of data collected            under NSF Grant CES-8308744 and its amendments.  Under this grant, over         1700 interviews were conducted with samples of households in comparable         cities in six countries including U.S.A.-California, Peru, Mexico,              Italy, Yugoslavia, and Turkey, for purposes of developing and testing a         cross-culturally valid method for measuring disaster impact on household        living conditions.  Data on the cost of housing and household equipment         and furnishings was also collected along with detailed inventories of           community infrastructure.  This work was extended to conduct data               collection in Mexico City after the 1985 earthquake to test the methods         of assessing damage under real disaster conditions.  A monograph will be        published which will present the measurement technique in a manner that         it can be employed by other scholars wishing to measure household level         damage and loss or to measure progress toward the restoration of                household level living conditions following a disaster.",
