 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed work is directed toward the                         investigation of stabilization of enzymes by attachment to                      soluble polymers.  Methods for the stabilization of enzymes by                  multi-point attachment to soluable polymers will be developed,                  with the emphasis on improving the scope of the technique with                  respect to the types of chemistry employed, the types of                        stabilizing molecules used, and the number of different enzymes                 to which the methods can be applied.  The tresyl chloride method                developed in Phase I of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)               will be further examined, using several different hydroxylic                    polymers and also lower molecular weight diols and polyethylene                 glycols.  Other chemistries to be explored include reactions to                 produce multi-point attachment through chemically modified lysine               residues and through carboxyl groups.  Once refined, the methods                will be applied to a number of different enzymes.  Finally, the                 techniques will be developed for the production of stabilized,                  immobilized enzymes.                                                                                                                                            This work is to be funded under Small Business Innovation                       Research (SBIR)Phase II program.  The funds to be granted here                  will permit Genetics Institute to undertake further research to                 fully demonstrate the technical feasibility for commercialization               under Phase II of the SBIR Program.  The technical staff of                     Genetics Institute has an outstanding track record on enzyme                    technology, and the success of this project could benefit the                   food, pharamaceutical and feed industries.",
