 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposer will apply computer modeling to the investigation of the           fluid dynamics of aquatic animal propulsion.  She will make extensive           use of a newly-available research tool, the CRAY supercomputer.                         The proposer has developed a reliable computational model in two        dimensions.  The fluid motion is described by the incompressible                Navier-Stokes equations, and the immersed organism is comprised of a            single filament undergoing time-dependent motion.  On the size or               position-dependency of the amplitude of the swimming motion the                 algorithm works for a very wide range of Reynolds numbers.  This is the         first computational study of aquatic animal locomotion which makes these        claims.                                                                                 The major goal of this research is to extend this computational         model to three dimensions.  It is also proposed to improve the two-             dimensional model by including a cell body attached to the undulating           filament, and to study phase-locking between neighboring flagella.                This work is pioneering in at least two respects:  it is the first            computational model of aquatic animal locomotion which solves the full          Navier-Stokes equations and it makes extensive use of large-scale               computational fluid techniques on a supercomputer.",
