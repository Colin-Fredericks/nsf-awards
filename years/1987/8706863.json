 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two theoretical investigations are planned.  Both are                      concerned with experimental findings on exotic atoms.  One is                   an attempt to account for regularities in exotic atom formation                 believed to be related to shell structure.  This investigation,                 which should be relevant not only to existing experimental                      results but also to results coming from LEAR, will employ, at                   least initially, a simplified adaptation of a procedure due to                  Born and Flock for dealing with nearly adiabatic processes.                     The negative meson will be treated as a classical particle                      moving in a realistic potential due to the capturing atom,                      while the electrons will be described by wave functions that                    take into account shell structure.  The other investigation is                  concerned with three body association reactions, especially the                 one believed to complicate attempts to measure the Lamb shift                   in muonic helium.  Although the immediate goal is to achieve a                  thorough understanding of an especially simple reaction--the                    one that occurs when a positive helium ion forms a diatomic                     molecule in helium gas and which has been studied for decades--                 it is intended ultimately to compute the rate coefficient for a                 similar reaction involving a muonic helium ion that has                         recently been investigated experimentally at SIN.",
