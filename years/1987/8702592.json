 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomic Absorption/Flame Emmision (AA/FE) spectrometry is a                      technique that has found wide-spread use in the analysis of                     trace metals.  It is a ubiquitous experimental method cutting                   across all the physical and biological sciences.  Access to                     AA/FE instrumentation is crucial to a modern chemistry                          department.                                                                                                                                                     The Department of Chemistry at Southeast Missouri State                         University will use an award from the Chemistry Shared                          Instrumentation Program to help purchase an AA/FE spectrometer                  and high performance liquid chromatograph with a conductivity                   detector for trace element and anion analysis.  The teaching                    and research capabilities of the Chemistry Department of this                   RUI institution will be enhanced materially by acquisition of                   the instrumentation which also will serve as a resource for the                 departments of Agriculture, Biology, and Earth Science.  Areas                  of research in chemistry that will be enhanced center around                    studies in trace metal analysis of soils and aquatic organisms                  and trace anion studies related to acid rain and acid                           phosphatase activity.",
