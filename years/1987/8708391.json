 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current theoretical understanding of how glaciers respond                  to changes in mass balance induced by climate is based on the                   propagation and diffusion of kinematic waves as developed by                    Nye and reviewed in the most recent geological texts.                           Application of this theory to several example glaciers indicates                that it should take several hundred years for a typical glacier                 to complete its response to a change in climate.  However,                      available evidence about glacier fluctuations during the                        \"Little Ice Age\" and subsequently indicates response times much                 shorter than this prediction.  Based on theoretical analysis,                   the discrepancy arises because the ice volume changes predicted                 by the theoretical models are unrealistically large by up to                    more than one order of magnitude.  The over estimate of volume                  change arises from assumptions about how wave velocity and                      diffusion coefficients vary near the terminus, which cause over                 estimate of thickness change in the terminal zone and how the                   thickness change is spread up the glacier length.  This project                 will examine  elevation change profiles on actual advancing and                 retreating glaciers in order to relate volume changes to                        changes in length.  Available sequential survey data of profile                 changes over the last several decades on glaciers primarily                     from the Alps and Washington will be used as well as geomorphic                 evidence for net elevation changes on longer time scales as                     recorded by lateral moraines and trim lines on selected                         glaciers.  These measurements will  contribute to a  description                and understanding of the relationship of \"Little Ice Age\"                       lateral moraines and trim lines to current glacier surfaces.                    The up valley convergence of \"Little Ice Age\" and current                       glacier margins is a well known feature of the present mountain                 landscape which has not been systematically investigated.  The                  quantitative aspects of this pattern are intimately tied to the                 response time for adjustment to climate, thereby having                         significant bearing on paleoclimatic interpretation and adding                  to our understanding of the behavior of glacier.",
