Sahaptin and Nez Perce, a language                 spoken in Idaho and northeastern Oregon, together comprise the                  Sahaptian family.  The Sahaptian languages are of particular                    interest to linguists both in terms of their genetic and his-                   torical relationships to other American Indian languages, and                   also because of their grammatical properties, some of which                     bear directly on currently discussed issues in linguistic                       theory.  Documentation of the language, however, is scanty.                     The purpose of this project is to produce a grammar of                          Sahaptin.  The process of preparing the grammar, with                           computational aids, will also result in the analysis of a                       number of Sahaptin texts, which will also be an important                       contribution to the field.                                                                                                                                           The Co-Principal Investigator, who will be carrying out                    the bulk of the work on the project, has worked for a number of                 years on the related language Nez Perce.  His work has been                     very successful, and has earned him a reputation as an                          extremely talented young linguist.  This experience has made                    him entirely qualified to carry out the proposed new project to                 a successful conclusion.",
