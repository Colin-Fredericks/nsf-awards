 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two campaigns to measure transient tracers in the Atlantic              Ocean (TTO/NAS and TTO/Equatorial) were funded by NSF during the                period from 1980 to 1985.  A complete data base for modelling                   this ocean basin would include a South Atlantic Study to:                               1.Determine CO2 transports and their influence on world                 climate,                                                                        2.Constrain models of major ocean currents in this area,                        and                                                                             3.Confirm an observed 5-fold increase in the addition                           rate of new carbon to the thermocline.                                                  Eight components of such a study (SAVE) will be performed by            investigators from LDGO, Princeton, University of Washington,                   WHOI, and SIO.  The track record of these scientists is well                    established by successful completion of previous studies in the                 Equatorial and North Atlantic.  They will provide physical and                  chemical expertise which will be directed toward a cooperative                  effort to reach the goals of the geochemical study.                                     This component is aimed at tracing water mass movement in               the South Atlantic using radiocarbon (C-14). About 1000 tracer                  samples will be collected by LDGO and analyzed under the                        direction of Drs. Ostlund and Tap at the University of Miami; Dr.               Broecker at Columbia University will interpret the data.  Both                  principle investigators have developed a valuable understanding                 of water movement through C-14 studies around the world and are                 well qualified to perform this task in the SAVE project.",
