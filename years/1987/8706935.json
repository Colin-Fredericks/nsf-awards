 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation addresses the issue of how the social context in             which citizens live, work, and play is transformed into social                  influence on voting behavior in an election campaign.  Questions that           follow from this include:  What mechanisms promote homogeneity or               heterogeneity in political choice in neighborhoods or work groups?  In          what ways do the social contexts of work, recreation, or neighborhood           life filter the perception of politically relevant information coming           from the mass media or other persons?  What mechanisms of social                interaction enhance or inhibit social influences on political choice?           In the highly dynamic context of a political campaign, how does the             political influence of social context evolve over time?  What                   mechanisms govern the changing course of social influence on political          choice during a campaign?                                                                                                                                       To address these questions the investigators have undertaken a three            wave panel survey of 1,500 voters in South Bend, Indiana, before,               during, and after the 1984 election campaign.  A supplemental survey of         almost 1,000 persons identified by respondents as political discussion          partners was also completed.  This survey employed a research design            and sampling technique that differed markedly from traditional                  practice.  Extensive scientific study of mass political behavior,               especially voting behavior, has been undertaken over the past four              decades utilizing national random sample survey techniques.  The                current investigation differs from this methodology in two important            respects.  First, the research site is a particular urban community.            Second, the sampling design randomizes respondent selection, but within         purposefully chosen neighborhoods that differ systematically in social          and economic composition.  A high sampling rate within each                     neighborhood allows the investigators to characterize each neighborhood         environment.  This design is believed to be unique in the study of              voting behavior in that it provides for direct, comprehensive                   measurement of the social, attitudinal, economic, and political                 characteristics of the voter's immediate social milieu.                                                                                                         The data set resulting fom these procedures provides analytic                   opportunities unavailable in the usual national election studies.  In           the determinants of voter choice or policy attitudes, measurements of           respondents' social contexts may be introduced directly into the                analysis.  The relative importance of individual properties compared            with the political influence arising from the social composition of the         respondent's neighborhood can be assessed.  For example, a body of              evidence suggests that vote choice by working class respondents is              heavily influenced not only by their working class membership but also          by the concentration of working class families in their living areas.           This classic effect of social context on voting behavior can be                 specified in extraordinary detail with the data set now available from          South Bend.  What mechanisms of social interaction drive this observed          amplification of working class influence on individual members of the           working class?  Is it the composition of their political discussion             networks?  Is it the composition of their work groups?  Is it the               homogeneity of other social cleavages within their neighborhoods - -            race, religion, ethnicity?  Such questions can be raised, and given             answers in first approximation, with these data.",
