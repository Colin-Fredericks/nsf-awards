 "awd_abstract_narration": "Before cells divide, their genetic information, contained in               structures called chromosomes, is duplicated precisely.  During                 cell division, the duplicated chromosomes are distributed into                  the two daughter cells so that each daughter subsequently                       contains exactly the same kind and number of chromosomes.  The                  cellular organelles responsible for carrying out this crucial                   process are collectively called the mitotic spindle.  The spindle               is composed primarily of a complex network of microtubule cables                that attach to individual chromosomes at one end, and become                    anchored at their other end to sites called the cell poles.                     During the course of cell division these cables                                 somehow pull the chromosomes to their respective poles, by a                    mechanism whose details are only poorly understood.  In this                    novel and well written proposal, the principal investigator will                design, construct, and calibrate an ultraviolet microbeam                       apparatus.  This device is capable of irradiating and thereby                   cutting a single microtubule fiber in a living cell.  The                       experiments described will allow the investigator to distinguish                between several current models of microtubule function during                   chromosome movement.  This is the case because the various models               made different predictions with respect to the effect of gap                    production on the stability and dynamics of the fiber, the                      movement of chromosomes, and the nature of irradiation-induced                  gap repair.",
