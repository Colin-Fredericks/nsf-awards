 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports the research of Dr. Blair which is aimed at the                        preparation and study of the chemical properties of positively                  charged halogen complexes.  Positively charged halogen atoms                    play a significant role in human biochemistry and they function                 as reagents used in the preparation of a variety of                             halogen-containing molecules.  Despite the importance of                        positively charged or 2-coordinate halogen atoms, they have not                 been extensively investigated and they are difficult to                         isolate.  Dr. Blair has recently circumvented these problems,                   characterizing such complexes by X-ray analysis.  He now plans                  to prepare several new types of 2-coordinate halogen complexes,                 to examine the chemical properties of this unique type of                       complex and to find novel uses for these highly reactive salts.                                                                                                 More specifically, the proposed work entails the synthesis and                  characterization of new 2-coordinate complexes of positive                      bromine and iodine and their application as new reagents.                       Complexes to be investigated include bis(quinuclidine)Br+ and                   I+ as well as the related complexes of 1,4-diazabicyclo\u01312.2.2!                  octane.  Quinuclidine complexes of N-bromosuccinimide and                       N-iodosuccinimide will also be studied.  New complexes will be                  characterized by X-ray crystallography, proton and carbon NMR                   spectroscopy, and UV-Vis spectrophotometry.  The dynamics of                    the formation of bis(quinclidine) Br+ from the rearrangement of                 the dibromo quinclidine complexes will be probed by NMR and                     UV-Vis techniques.                                                                                                                                              Refinements in the application of bis(quinclidine)Br+ as a new                  agent for the oxidation of alcohols will be sought to reduce                    costs and increase the utility of this stable and conveniently                  handled source of active bromine.  Initial studies to determine                 the potential of bis(quinclidine)Br+ and I+ as new agents to                    introduce radio-bromine and -iodine into aromatic acids will be                 undertaken.",
