 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program                  supports research by Prof. Philip Shevlin on the chemistry of                   atomic carbon and related high-energy organic reaction                          intermediates.  Because atomic carbon possesses a large                         thermodynamic driving force for bond formation, it is a                         versatilereagent for preparation of selected, highly reactive                   species suchas carbenes.  Thus, this work is useful both as a                   preparation                                                                     method for some new high-energy chemical fragments, and for                     understanding the bonding and reactivity forces in others.                                                                                                      In general, experiments are designed to prepare and elucidate                   thechemistry of monovalent carbon intermediates.  Dr. Shevlin's                 recent work has shown that reaction of arc-generated carbon                     atomswith tetraflouromethane results in the formation of CF,                    which is                                                                        observed to react with alkenes to generate flourocyclopropyl                    radicals.  The products of the reaction of this interesting                     species with other substrates such as dienes and aromatic                       compounds will be identified in the coming work.  Additional                    experiments are designed to investigate the chemistry of the                    other halomethynes and the parent species, CH.  Other studies                   arebuilt around continuing investigations of novel carbenes                     generated as intermediates in C atom reactions.  The reaction of                carbon atoms with nitriles will be investigated with the goal of                forming cyano- or isocyanocarbenes.  The chemistry of                           aminomethylene will be investigated to determine if it undergoes                reactions similar to the  nucleophilic addition of                              hydroxymethylene to carbonyls, followed by hydrogent transfer.                  Lastly, experiments designed to investigate the reaction of                     atomic carbon with nonvolatile substrates in solution are                       planned.",
