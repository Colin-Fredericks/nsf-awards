 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a cooperative research project between Dr.              Harvey Reisine, Department of Neurology, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine,          and Drs. Volker Henn, Urs Schwarz, and Walter Waespe, University                Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.  The general objective of the research           is to elucidate brainstem neuronal mechanisms underlying reflexive eye          movements in response to passive head rotation (i.e. the                        vestibulo-ocular reflex) and/or visual stimulation in the form of               illuminated full field motion (optokinetic nystagmus or optokinetic             after-nystagmus).  Electrical impulses of single neurons in the                 vestibular nuclear complexes of alert, trained rhesus monkeys will be           recorded during a paradigm designed to activate selectively classes of          neurons involved in various aspects of vestibular and eye movement              control, and to measure certain dynamics of the reflexive behaviors.            Neuronal responses will be analyzed in relation to parameters of eye            movement and stimulation, and in terms of current models of                     vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic behavior.                                                                                                                      The research is aimed at providing quantitative answers to questions            arising within the context of a generally accepted model of the                 visual-vestibular-oculomotor reflex, which has the purpose of                   maintaining a steady image on the retina.  Standard                             electrophysiological techniques will be used, and the experimental              phase of the work will be carried out in a Swiss laboratory with an             international reputation for excellence.  Results may facilitate an             understanding of the complex neural mechanisms associated with eye-head         coordination during normal orienting, and establish a neural basis for          motion perception.  Dr. Reisine is an accomplished neuroscientist.  The         Swiss scientists with whom he will collaborate have outstanding                 reputations and experimental facilities.  In addition to furthering the         research aims of this project, the cooperating scientists hope that             this joint effort will contribute to increased collaboration between            their respective research groups by introducing common data                     acquisition, analysis, transfer, and storage mechanisms in the two              laboratories.",
