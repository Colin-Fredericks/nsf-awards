 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forensic scientists require methods and procedures for identifying and          typing the human blood and body fluids encountered in cases of homicide,        assault, robbery, sexual assault and other crimes against persons.  The         Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) technique offers a desirable          alternative to present procedures.  Its major advantages are increased          sensitivity, ability to utilize recently developed, highly specific             monoclonal antibodies in its tests, and the ability to introduce new            levels of quantitation and instrumental objectivity in interpreting test        results.  Modern ELISA instrumentation, its use and applications are            revolutionizing forensic tests on blood, body fluids and stains.                                                                                                In addition, the isoelectric focusing (IEF) technique offers many               advantages over earlier electrophoretic procedures for typing blood and         body fluid stains.  Its advantages include the ability to recognize more        genetic types in several systems and thus to improve individualization          of stains left by biological materials.  The application of IEF to the          genetic typing of blood and body fluid stains increases the capabilities        of forensic scientists, enabling them to provide more and better                evidence to the justice system they serve.  Through the help of this            grant, future forensic specialists in this model program are being              trained on state-of-the-art apparatus.  This project constitutes a              striking example of science serving society in helping to demonstrate           the guilt or innocence of persons accused of violent crimes.",
