 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will support purchase         equipment for wideband channel measurements for wireless indoor                 communications.  Results of these measurements will be used for                 developing a statistical model and computer simulation for the                  channel.  The scope of applications for wireless indoor communications          is wide and it is expected to expand drastically in the future.                 Current research activities in this area are motivated by wireless              LANs(WLLAN), wireless PBX systems, and portable phones (1).  In the             future these applications will be complemented with wireless                    communication between mobile robots and other services unknown at the           present time.  Wireless indoor local network is expected to                     revolutionalize communication between various items of equipment in             manufacturing floors, offices, research labs, hospitals, warehouses,            and shopping areas.  This grant is funded with additional support from          the Instrumentation, Sensing and Measurement Program in ECSE and the            Automation and Systems Integration Program in DMCE.",
